        "Content": "Democrats have shared more pictures from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a day before the government's deadline for the full release. The 68 photos published on Thursday are among more than 95,000 images that the House Oversight Committee Democrats said they were reviewing. They said the images were \"selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos\" and to \"provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities\". But the Democrats added that they are still analysing thousands more images that are \"both graphic and mundane\". There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of those pictured in the images - and the context surrounding the photos is not known. Mystery text quotes price for 'girl' The latest cache includes a text message appearing to discuss the price for a girl. It isn't clear who sent the messages and to whom, but the screenshot shows some details on an unidentified girl, described as a teenager here. \"I will send u girls now,\" one of the texts read. Writing on body Several pictures show handwritten messages on a person's body. One appears to be quoting the opening paragraph of the book Lolita - which can be seen in the background of the picture. The book was written by Vladimir Nabokov and tells the story of a girl groomed by a middle-aged literature professor. Another shows writing on a foot, which reads: \"She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock.\" Other messages can be seen on the neck, hip, back and chest, with the latter reading: \"The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down\". In a different image, Epstein is pictured with three girls in his house in New York. One appears to be touching Epstein's chest, one is holding her wrist up and another is looking at a laptop. The identity of the women has been hidden. Epstein with high-profile figures Some high-profile figures also appear in the newly released images, with one showing Epstein sitting alongside Sheikh Jabor Bin Yousef Bin Jassim Bin Jabor al Thani. He is the chairman and director of several privately established companies and is a member of the Qatari royal family. Another image shows Epstein with the former president of the UN General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak, who held the role between 2017 and 2018. He is also a former Slovakian foreign affairs minister. Last month, he told TASR news agency: \"The reopening of the Epstein case occurred after I left New York, and the full extent of his inexcusable actions, which I strongly condemn, only came to light after his arrest.\" Shaher Abdulhak, a deceased Yemeni billionaire businessman whose son is a suspect in the murder of a Norwegian woman in Mayfair, was also pictured with Epstein. His son, Farouk Abdulhak, fled to Yemen after the rape and death of Martine Vik Magnussen in March 2008 and has been wanted for questioning ever since. Ms Magnussen was found dead among rubble in a basement in Great Portland Street. She and her friends had been celebrating finishing their end-of-term exams at the Maddox nightclub before she vanished. Her body was found two days later. Also featured in the newly released images were former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, magician David Blaine, businessman Tom Pritzker, billionaire Bill Gates, director Woody Allen, talk show host Dick Cavett, Trump ally Steve Bannon, and Kuwait's former information minister Anas al Rasheed. Photos of identity documents with redacted names were also published, including one with text saying that \"the bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor\", which could belong to convicted sex offender Epstein. Also among the identification documents is a heavily redacted Russian passport. It belongs to a female, but other information has been blocked out. The release also includes ID documents from the Czech Republic, South Africa, Ukraine, and Lithuania. Deadline looming The picture drop came a day before the deadline set by a bipartisan bill that compels the US Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month. Mr Trump had promised to release the Epstein files during his ultimately successful presidential campaign, but he later made a U-turn, even going as far as calling the Epstein files a Democratic \"hoax\", before eventually changing path again to sign the bill. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the deadline that he believes the Department of Justice will release the files in time, and warned that there will be \"strong bipartisan pushback\" if they don't. \"Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who've been working on this matter, related to full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,\" he told reporters on Thursday. Full release going 'down to the wire' National security lawyers inside the Department of Justice are \"working down to the wire\" as Friday's deadline for the full release of the Epstein files edges closer, according to Sky News' US correspondent James Matthews. He said those lawyers are mulling \"how much is actually divulged in these documents\". \"There will be redactions... the question is, how far short of everything? How far short of the full story will the release fall?\" Matthews said. \"The issue at the heart of it... where does Donald Trump feature? Remember, he emphatically denies all knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and any involvement in them.\" Read more:Releasing the Epstein files: How we got hereGhislaine Maxwell attempts to overturn conviction 'Frustration building' Meanwhile, frustration is building at the justice department ahead of the release, according to CNN. A source has told the US broadcaster that there could be up to 1,000 redactions needed from each attorney. Lawyers reportedly believe they aren't getting clear or comprehensive direction on how to make the most information available under the law. A previous batch of images featured more high-profile figures, including Donald Trump, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Bill Clinton, British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Emirati businessman Ahmed bin Sulayem, and singer Jimmy Buffett. Several images of a sexual nature have also been released, including a picture of a bowl of novelty condoms with a caricature of Mr Trump's face, and various sex toys."

        "Content": "By Tom Parmenter, national correspondent, and Emily Upton, national producer  \"When will it end, when will it stop?\" It's the question that Jay Slater's mother still can't answer. The constant stream of vitriol, misinformation, and abuse online has continued every day for the past 18 months. \"I've just been absolutely crucified and ripped to pieces,\" Debbie Duncan told us, as she read out the online comments that have hurt the most: • \"Debbie deserved to lose her son\"• \"How can you possibly respect a mother grifting off her own son's death?\"• \"How do you know it's Jay in that coffin - he needs digging up.\" \"Just scroll, scroll and scroll, and they are still there,\" Debbie said. \"Jay's just been dehumanised.\" There are hundreds of millions of pieces of Jay Slater content online, and it's constantly being created - even after a coroner ruled his fall in a remote ravine in Tenerife was a tragic accident. \"I don't think I'd be here if I sat every day and read everything that was being said,\" Jay's mum told us. This is why she is campaigning - in her son's name. She has tried and failed many times to get misinformation and the worst abuse taken down from online platforms. \"We just want to have some legislation around content,\" she said. \"It's about the [social media] platforms having that responsibility to take down the misinformation, the harassment, bullying.\" New levels of tragedy trolling Jay's case took the febrile world of online sleuthing and tragedy trolling to new levels. Her campaign to give a degree of control back to families suffering this abuse is backed by the charity Missing People. They work with a growing number of relatives being attacked online and trying to tackle callous misinformation. \"It feels quite out of control,\" Josie Allan from the charity told us. \"We know with the development of AI, there's going to be even more complicated issues. \"People creating fake news about missing cases, potentially making fake content using missing people's faces or voices. \"We know that that would just be horrendous for families to have to see and could really misdirect police resources and investigations.\" Bogus posts of missing people Malicious content like this is appearing more regularly. Anonymous accounts create bogus missing people posts - often it sits in front of a fake advert or has a link to a scam website. It exploits the natural goodwill people feel towards missing person cases. In Australia, the search for a missing boy, Gus Lamont, was recently disrupted by a fake AI image of a man carrying what appeared to be the four-year-old. It wasn't real. It is an emerging and disturbing problem for people searching for a loved one. In the UK, the family of Andrew Gosden, who has been missing for the past 18 years, has been through a similar ordeal. Kevin Gosden's son was 14 years old when he disappeared in 2007. Andrew caught a train to London from his hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire. His family has never given up hope of him returning. Father close to breakdown \"Just before the 18th anniversary of Andrew's disappearance… we suddenly became aware that there were articles online circulating and being shared,\" his father told us. \"Claiming that Andrew's body had been found, that his DNA had been found somewhere… the police have been concealing some CCTV footage with him. \"Utter nonsense. None of that's true. \"If you've got a lot of false information out there, it just doesn't help find the lad we love. \"We need to know that Andrew is still being looked for. \"I have been very close to what I know is going to be a breakdown, again with it a number of times.\" Clicks are driving content The monetisation of clicks online is one of the driving forces behind this constant stream of content. At the CrimeCon conference in Manchester, we spoke to true crime content creators and fans of this growing genre about where the moral boundaries lie. Andy Hobbs, who sells murder mystery games, told us: \"Unfortunately, views means more money. And until that gets looked at, I don't think any regulation will come in. \"It's in the interest of social media networks to get more views, more hits.\" Ruth Berry, a true-crime fan, pointed out that online investigators can, in some instances, turn up new information: \"They've helped solve in some cases, haven't they? \"They've helped to unpick things that maybe authorities haven't had the resources to do, and they've had the time and the resources to do. \"But also is it their jurisdiction and is that evidence actually valid and reliable? Because how did they get hold of it, who knows?\" Annie Robinson and Beth Kent host the Grave Secrets true-crime podcast. \"It's not something you can control, is it really?\" Annie said. Beth added: \"Everyone obviously deserves to have their say, I think I would just be mindful and cautious that you are having an opinion knowing that nobody has all the facts. \"It's sort of easy to talk about it, as in like, it's not a real person you've got to remember these are still victims and victims' families,\" Annie added. Some sleuths 'very dangerous' \"Some amateur sleuths are very dangerous,\" forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes told Sky News. \"Because people want their 15 minutes of fame on social media we can't do things that knowingly hamper police investigations. \"You know, in any other world that would result in a prosecution. \"So I think that we do need to clamp down on those small number of people who do actually cause a great amount of carnage and damage.\" Some content creators have turned up to insert themselves into active police searches but the wider problem of misinformation online is also hindering officers. Read more from Sky News:Police failed to tackle social media risksConspiracy theories are disrupting police Fake news 'misdirecting police' Assistant Chief Constable Damien Miller, the national policing lead for missing persons, told us: \"It takes policing away from those inquiries that we need to be following, because it's fake, it's false information. \"It's hurtful, it is harmful to the families, but it's also then misdirecting police investigations. \"People have freedom of speech, but there is a line and what I would say to those members of the public is please do not cross that line. He, too, would like to see social media companies helping remove misleading content sooner. 'I wouldn't wish it on anyone' \"I think what we need to do is work with those providers to make sure that when mis or disinformation is put on social media, that it's removed at its earliest opportunity because otherwise it gains momentum,\" he said. That incessant flow of content is what Jay's mum, Debbie Duncan has been hit by. She is determined to do all she can so that other families don't have to go through the same ordeal. \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody what we have been through,\" she said while contemplating everything that's happened. She has kept boxes of cards and gifts in Jay's bedroom at home in Lancashire - reminders of all the compassion and support they have received as well as the online hatred. \"It's torture,\" she said while looking at the many photos of her son. \"I just look at his picture and if it's the last thing I can do for you Jay - I'll try my blimmin' hardest.\" Debbie's petition can be found here."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Christian Turner is a mandarin's mandarin. His appointment to the most glamorous posting in the UK diplomatic service is a victory for the Sir Humphreys over the politicians. After the disaster and humiliation of Peter Mandelson's demise over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, it always made sense to appoint a scandal-free career diplomat as his successor. Father-of-two Dr Turner is 53 but looks half his age. But his youthful appearance hides a long experience as a diplomat and civil servant serving prime ministers dating back to Tony Blair. The Foreign Office announcement of his appointment describes him as \"one of the UK's most experienced diplomats\". And the top mandarins at the FCDO will be delighted they've got their man. When Lord Mandelson was appointed last year, the senior cabinet minister Peter Kyle told Sky News the government had decided that he was \"worth the risk\". And what a risk it turned out to be. Will they never learn? \"Mandy\" - as he's always been known in Westminster - had previously been forced to resign from the cabinet not once, but twice. He declared in an angry and defiant victory speech when he held his Commons seat in Hartlepool: \"I'm a fighter, not a quitter.\" But not long after that, he quit to become a Brussels commissioner. Dr Turner, on the other hand, has enjoyed a stellar and unblemished career as a diplomat. His most high-profile international post so far was high commissioner to Pakistan, where he was said to be immensely popular. One of his earlier diplomatic posts was high commissioner in Kenya, when he had to lead the UK's response to the Westgate Mall terrorist attack, in which 71 people were killed. So he's seen as a safe pair of hands and is unlikely to attract scandal and controversy in the way that his predecessor did, with his relationships with colourful tycoons and oligarchs as well as love of the high life. Nevertheless, the Washington posting comes with some of the best perks in the diplomatic world, notably the luxurious Lutyens mansion that serves as the ambassador's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Dr Turner saw off some distinguished rivals for the top job in the diplomatic service, including chief Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's business adviser, who is credited with being the architect of recent trade agreements with President Trump. Until this week, he was seen as the frontrunner for the job, and as a sop for not getting the Washington post, he will now have an expanded role, including taking a lead role in trade talks with the US. A late entry in what became a three-horse race was Nigel Casey, Britain's ambassador in Moscow. But ultimately, he was seen as indispensable in his current role, given the volatile relations with Vladimir Putin and the continuing war in Ukraine. The PM interviewed all three candidates last week and his choice of Dr Turner is seen as a victory for Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office's top diplomat, whose career has prospered despite criticism of his role as the UK's post-Brexit negotiator, over government ministers. Read more from Sky News:Russia 'reveals secret chat' with MI6 chiefFormer footballer wins claim against top surgeon Insiders claim there will be champagne corks popping in the Foreign Office's King Charles Street HQ because Dr Turner is their man and will report back to the FCDO rather than No 10. If Lord Mandelson - the \"prince of darkness\" in his days as a Labour spin doctor - was seen as Sir Keir's \"Trump whisperer\", Dr Turner will be the PM's - and, more importantly, the Foreign Office's - eyes and ears."

        "Content": "Vladimir Putin's spymaster has said he had a \"rather lengthy telephone conversation\" with the new head of MI6, Russian state news agency Tass has reported.  Sergei Naryshkin, Russia's foreign intelligence director, said: \"A few days ago, I had a rather lengthy telephone conversation with the newly appointed chief of MI6 [Blaise] Metreweli.\" He added that Russian intelligence officers worked officially in London while MI6 officers worked officially in Moscow, according to Tass. Ms Metreweli took over as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service on 1 October. Sky News military analyst Michael Clarke believes it shows Moscow is \"trying to imply that the Brits are somehow appealing to them… because of the negotiations going on in Washington\". Further US-Russia talks are expected to take place over the coming days. EU talks stall amid fears over 'Russian retaliation'  Mr Naryshkin's comments came as the European Union held crunch talks on Ukraine funding in Brussels. EU leaders met at the bloc's headquarters on Thursday to discuss a plan to use frozen Russian assets - but tensions have arisen, with Belgium vocally opposed to the plan amid fears of Russian retaliation. Most of the €190bn (£166bn) of assets frozen after the start of the war in 2022 are currently held in Belgium, specifically by Euroclear, the Brussels-based financial clearing house. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the plan to loan Ukraine the frozen assets \"drastically increases the risk of Russian retaliation\". \"It's not acceptable that this happens to Belgium alone,\" he added. \"If we jump, we jump together.\" Read more:Brit who fought for Ukraine jailed by RussiaBelgian PM 'sceptical' over Ukraine loan plan Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he understands \"the risks that he is talking about, but I think that we face bigger risks\". \"Ukraine has the right to this money because Russia is destroying us,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. In a post on X, he added: \"The decision now on the table - the decision to fully use Russian assets to defend against Russian aggression - is one of the clearest and most morally justified decisions that could ever be made.\" Trump claims peace deal is 'close'  On the other side of the Atlantic, Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to move quickly to secure a peace deal. The US president's envoys are scheduled to meet with a top adviser to Mr Putin in Miami on Saturday, where they are due to discuss the evolving US peace agreement aimed at ending the war. Mr Trump has been optimistic that a deal can be reached. \"Well, we're getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there,\" he said. \"Every time they take too much time, Russia changes their mind.\" Russia 'deploys nuclear-capable missiles' to Belarus  Russia has deployed its latest nuclear-capable missile system to Belarus according to the country's president, Alexander Lukashenko. The authoritarian leader said the Oreshnik, an intermediate range ballistic missile system, arrived in the country on Wednesday and is entering combat duty. He did not provide any further details. Russia has previously deployed tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, the territory of which it used to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

        "Content": "TikTok's Chinese owner has signed a deal to sell the company's US arm to American investors – ensuring the video platform can continue operating in the United States.  The deal is expected to close on 22 January 2026, according to an internal memo seen by Sky News' US partner, NBC News. It will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law last year that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied. Mr Biden set a January 2025 deadline for the sale and when ByteDance failed to comply, TikTok went dark for several hours. It returned after Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running on his first day in office. Who's taking over? The internal memo sent to employees on Thursday said the deal allows \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part ‌of a vital global community.\" TikTok owner ByteDance will sell just over 80% of the company's US assets to three major investors, Reuters news agency reports. The investors - Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX - will form a new venture, named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.

The Metropolitan Police recovered 400 items in the operation on 11 December. Two men, aged 55 and 54, and two 15-year-old boys have been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. The objects seized by officers at the Hounslow Heath car boot sale included power drills, nail guns, electric saws, and a concrete mixer. It comes after shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick visited the sale last month and posted a social media video highlighting concerns about the sale of suspected stolen goods. The Met said its operation was in response to worries about tool theft and was working to identify the tools and trace their original owners. Superintendent James Rawlinson, of Hounslow's local neighbourhood policing team, said: \"We are listening to Londoner's concerns about tool theft because we understand the significant impact it has on tradespeople and their livelihoods. \n                  Terrorist parole case becomes first to be heard in public\n                 \n                  86-year-old man arrested in connection with murder of couple 32 years ago\n                 \n                  Aria Thorpe: Images released of girl, 9, stabbed to death - as boy appears in court charged with murder\n                 \"We are targeting the prolific offenders and organised criminal groups that drive this trade in stolen tools through proactive, intelligence-led operations.\" Read more from Sky News:Controversial FBI deputy director to resign next monthAll trials of Ajax armoured vehicles halted again The force said tool theft between April and December was down 20.3%, compared with the same period last year as a result of Met operations targeting tool thieves.

While there is near consensus among astronomers that the object is a comet from outside our solar system, a Harvard University astrophysicist has sparked a furious debate by warning he cannot rule out that extraterrestrials are paying us a visit. Professor Avi Loeb told Sky News that humanity should be on high alert for what may be a \"black swan event\" - something that's highly unlikely but has high consequences and might have been foreseen. \"Alien technology is a potential threat because when you go on a blind date of interstellar proportions, you never know whether you have a friendly visitor as your dating partner or a serial killer,\" he said. \"When there are implications to society, we must consider even an unlikely event and collect as much data as possible to convince us otherwise.\" Professor Loeb said images of the object show it has an unusual tail that could come from a propulsion system, nickel in its gas cloud could be evidence of metal mining on its surface, and its trajectory, aligned with the orbits of planets in our solar system, was too unlikely to be by chance. 3i/ATLAS was first spotted in July as a distant dot of light against the starry canvas of the cosmos. But it has moved rapidly through the solar system, passing Mars in early October, disappearing briefly behind the sun, and after coming close to Earth's orbit, will fly by Jupiter before fading from view again. The US and European space agencies have trained cameras from a dozen spacecraft on the object, and they say there is no doubt its origins are completely natural. Amit Kshatriya, from NASA, said: \"This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet.\" Scientists estimate the comet is around eight billion years old, twice the age of our sun and solar system, and is a cosmic fossil left over from the formation of an unknown star in the galaxy. Professor Chris Lintott, an astronomer from the University of Oxford, told Sky News that there was nothing sinister about the object. \"It is just nonsense,\" he said. \"It's like saying we should consider the possibility that the moon is made of cheese. \"You could consider that possibility if you like, but my first question is why would you think that?\" He said the comet's changing colour and brightness can be explained by the sun heating pockets of ice and different materials that it's picked up on its epic journey through the stars. \"There is nothing this thing has done that we haven't seen elsewhere,\" he said. Read more:Why do the moons two sides look so different?Stranded Chinese astronauts return to Earth But Prof Loeb has accused other scientists of closing their minds to alternative explanations for what they are seeing. \"At the foundation of science is the humility to learn,\" he said. \"It's not the arrogance of expertise. And what you see very often is experts tell you what something should be and demonstrate by that, the arrogance of their expertise. They're not willing to learn something new.\" Prof Loeb made similar claims about a possible alien craft over Oumuamua, another interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, in 2017. Prof Lintott said wild theories that have no evidence can be dangerous. \"I'm baffled as to why Avi has latched on to this,\" he said. \"We can look for signs of intelligence in the cosmos. I'm very sympathetic to that idea. \"But you start by looking at things that are odd, and this thing is not odd.\""

        "Content": "Retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family are among seven people killed in a plane crash at a North Carolina airport. The Cessna C550 business jet erupted into flames when it hit the ground while trying to land at Statesville Regional Airport, around 45 miles north of Charlotte, shortly after 10am local time (3pm UK time) on Thursday. According to flight tracking data, the plane had taken off from the airport and was bound for Florida, but returned within minutes. In a statement, NASCAR said it was \"devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma [and] son Ryder\". It named the other three people who died as Craig Wadsworth, and Dennis and Jack Dutton, all \"beloved by many in the NASCAR community\". The statement continued: \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. \"His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\" Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the top-level Cup Series. \"Beyond his racing career, he gave of himself for the betterment of our community,\" the NASCAR statement continued. \"Most notably, Greg spent countless hours of his time helping the citizens of North Carolina during the disasters that followed Hurricane Helene. His tireless work saved lives.\" Biffle piloted his personal helicopter to help deliver aid to hard-hit communities after the hurricane in 2024. \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to Greg's entire family, friends, and all who were touched by his life,\" the statement concluded. State police said earlier: \"Although the post-crash fire prevents us from releasing a definitive list of the occupants at this time, it is believed that Mr Gregory Biffle and members of his immediate family were occupants of the airplane.\" Footage from local news channel WSOC-TV showed emergency workers rushing on to the runway as flames burned near the wreckage. Airport director John Ferguson said: \"The airport now is closed until further notice. It will take some time to get the debris off the runway.\" More US news:New Epstein pictures releasedWhite House plaques attack ex-presidents The airport's website says it offers corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams. The Federal Aviation Administration said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation into the crash."

        "Content": "By Tom Parmenter, national correspondent, and Emily Upton, national producer  \"When will it end, when will it stop?\" It's the question that Jay Slater's mother still can't answer. The constant stream of vitriol, misinformation, and abuse online has continued every day for the past 18 months. \"I've just been absolutely crucified and ripped to pieces,\" Debbie Duncan told us, as she read out the online comments that have hurt the most: • \"Debbie deserved to lose her son\"• \"How can you possibly respect a mother grifting off her own son's death?\"• \"How do you know it's Jay in that coffin - he needs digging up.\" \"Just scroll, scroll and scroll, and they are still there,\" Debbie said. \"Jay's just been dehumanised.\" There are hundreds of millions of pieces of Jay Slater content online, and it's constantly being created - even after a coroner ruled his fall in a remote ravine in Tenerife was a tragic accident. \"I don't think I'd be here if I sat every day and read everything that was being said,\" Jay's mum told us. This is why she is campaigning - in her son's name. She has tried and failed many times to get misinformation and the worst abuse taken down from online platforms. \"We just want to have some legislation around content,\" she said. \"It's about the [social media] platforms having that responsibility to take down the misinformation, the harassment, bullying.\" New levels of tragedy trolling Jay's case took the febrile world of online sleuthing and tragedy trolling to new levels. Her campaign to give a degree of control back to families suffering this abuse is backed by the charity Missing People. They work with a growing number of relatives being attacked online and trying to tackle callous misinformation. \"It feels quite out of control,\" Josie Allan from the charity told us. \"We know with the development of AI, there's going to be even more complicated issues. \"People creating fake news about missing cases, potentially making fake content using missing people's faces or voices. \"We know that that would just be horrendous for families to have to see and could really misdirect police resources and investigations.\" Bogus posts of missing people Malicious content like this is appearing more regularly. Anonymous accounts create bogus missing people posts - often it sits in front of a fake advert or has a link to a scam website. It exploits the natural goodwill people feel towards missing person cases. In Australia, the search for a missing boy, Gus Lamont, was recently disrupted by a fake AI image of a man carrying what appeared to be the four-year-old. It wasn't real. It is an emerging and disturbing problem for people searching for a loved one. In the UK, the family of Andrew Gosden, who has been missing for the past 18 years, has been through a similar ordeal. Kevin Gosden's son was 14 years old when he disappeared in 2007. Andrew caught a train to London from his hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire. His family has never given up hope of him returning. Father close to breakdown \"Just before the 18th anniversary of Andrew's disappearance… we suddenly became aware that there were articles online circulating and being shared,\" his father told us. \"Claiming that Andrew's body had been found, that his DNA had been found somewhere… the police have been concealing some CCTV footage with him. \"Utter nonsense. None of that's true. \"If you've got a lot of false information out there, it just doesn't help find the lad we love. \"We need to know that Andrew is still being looked for. \"I have been very close to what I know is going to be a breakdown, again with it a number of times.\" Clicks are driving content The monetisation of clicks online is one of the driving forces behind this constant stream of content. At the CrimeCon conference in Manchester, we spoke to true crime content creators and fans of this growing genre about where the moral boundaries lie. Andy Hobbs, who sells murder mystery games, told us: \"Unfortunately, views means more money. And until that gets looked at, I don't think any regulation will come in. \"It's in the interest of social media networks to get more views, more hits.\" Ruth Berry, a true-crime fan, pointed out that online investigators can, in some instances, turn up new information: \"They've helped solve in some cases, haven't they? \"They've helped to unpick things that maybe authorities haven't had the resources to do, and they've had the time and the resources to do. \"But also is it their jurisdiction and is that evidence actually valid and reliable? Because how did they get hold of it, who knows?\" Annie Robinson and Beth Kent host the Grave Secrets true-crime podcast. \"It's not something you can control, is it really?\" Annie said. Beth added: \"Everyone obviously deserves to have their say, I think I would just be mindful and cautious that you are having an opinion knowing that nobody has all the facts. \"It's sort of easy to talk about it, as in like, it's not a real person you've got to remember these are still victims and victims' families,\" Annie added. Some sleuths 'very dangerous' \"Some amateur sleuths are very dangerous,\" forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes told Sky News. \"Because people want their 15 minutes of fame on social media we can't do things that knowingly hamper police investigations. \"You know, in any other world that would result in a prosecution. \"So I think that we do need to clamp down on those small number of people who do actually cause a great amount of carnage and damage.\" Some content creators have turned up to insert themselves into active police searches but the wider problem of misinformation online is also hindering officers. Read more from Sky News:Police failed to tackle social media risksConspiracy theories are disrupting police Fake news 'misdirecting police' Assistant Chief Constable Damien Miller, the national policing lead for missing persons, told us: \"It takes policing away from those inquiries that we need to be following, because it's fake, it's false information. \"It's hurtful, it is harmful to the families, but it's also then misdirecting police investigations. \"People have freedom of speech, but there is a line and what I would say to those members of the public is please do not cross that line. He, too, would like to see social media companies helping remove misleading content sooner. 'I wouldn't wish it on anyone' \"I think what we need to do is work with those providers to make sure that when mis or disinformation is put on social media, that it's removed at its earliest opportunity because otherwise it gains momentum,\" he said. That incessant flow of content is what Jay's mum, Debbie Duncan has been hit by. She is determined to do all she can so that other families don't have to go through the same ordeal. \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody what we have been through,\" she said while contemplating everything that's happened. She has kept boxes of cards and gifts in Jay's bedroom at home in Lancashire - reminders of all the compassion and support they have received as well as the online hatred. \"It's torture,\" she said while looking at the many photos of her son. \"I just look at his picture and if it's the last thing I can do for you Jay - I'll try my blimmin' hardest.\" Debbie's petition can be found here."

The Metropolitan Police recovered 400 items in the operation on 11 December. Two men, aged 55 and 54, and two 15-year-old boys have been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Christian Turner is a mandarin's mandarin. His appointment to the most glamorous posting in the UK diplomatic service is a victory for the Sir Humphreys over the politicians. After the disaster and humiliation of Peter Mandelson's demise over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, it always made sense to appoint a scandal-free career diplomat as his successor. Father-of-two Dr Turner is 53 but looks half his age. But his youthful appearance hides a long experience as a diplomat and civil servant serving prime ministers dating back to Tony Blair. The Foreign Office announcement of his appointment describes him as \"one of the UK's most experienced diplomats\". And the top mandarins at the FCDO will be delighted they've got their man. When Lord Mandelson was appointed last year, the senior cabinet minister Peter Kyle told Sky News the government had decided that he was \"worth the risk\". And what a risk it turned out to be. Will they never learn? \"Mandy\" - as he's always been known in Westminster - had previously been forced to resign from the cabinet not once, but twice. He declared in an angry and defiant victory speech when he held his Commons seat in Hartlepool: \"I'm a fighter, not a quitter.\" But not long after that, he quit to become a Brussels commissioner. Dr Turner, on the other hand, has enjoyed a stellar and unblemished career as a diplomat. His most high-profile international post so far was high commissioner to Pakistan, where he was said to be immensely popular. One of his earlier diplomatic posts was high commissioner in Kenya, when he had to lead the UK's response to the Westgate Mall terrorist attack, in which 71 people were killed. So he's seen as a safe pair of hands and is unlikely to attract scandal and controversy in the way that his predecessor did, with his relationships with colourful tycoons and oligarchs as well as love of the high life. Nevertheless, the Washington posting comes with some of the best perks in the diplomatic world, notably the luxurious Lutyens mansion that serves as the ambassador's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Dr Turner saw off some distinguished rivals for the top job in the diplomatic service, including chief Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's business adviser, who is credited with being the architect of recent trade agreements with President Trump. Until this week, he was seen as the frontrunner for the job, and as a sop for not getting the Washington post, he will now have an expanded role, including taking a lead role in trade talks with the US. A late entry in what became a three-horse race was Nigel Casey, Britain's ambassador in Moscow. But ultimately, he was seen as indispensable in his current role, given the volatile relations with Vladimir Putin and the continuing war in Ukraine. The PM interviewed all three candidates last week and his choice of Dr Turner is seen as a victory for Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office's top diplomat, whose career has prospered despite criticism of his role as the UK's post-Brexit negotiator, over government ministers. Read more from Sky News:Russia 'reveals secret chat' with MI6 chiefFormer footballer wins claim against top surgeon Insiders claim there will be champagne corks popping in the Foreign Office's King Charles Street HQ because Dr Turner is their man and will report back to the FCDO rather than No 10. If Lord Mandelson - the \"prince of darkness\" in his days as a Labour spin doctor - was seen as Sir Keir's \"Trump whisperer\", Dr Turner will be the PM's - and, more importantly, the Foreign Office's - eyes and ears."

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n Almost two in five victims of what the government defines as violence against women and girls are neither women nor girls, but adult men. The government describes violence against women and girls (VAWG) as a \"national emergency\" and one of their central promises has been that they would halve it within a decade. Today, 18 months in to their time in power, we know what they mean by that. As part of a strategy labelled Freedom From Violence and Abuse, the Home Office has been working alongside the Office for National Statistics to define a new measure of VAWG. Among the crimes it says are included in the definition of VAWG are: domestic abuse, stalking, sexual violence, including rape and other sexual offences, sexual harassment, 'honour'-based abuse, female genital mutilation, online and technology-facilitated abuse, fatal VAWG such as domestic homicides, sexual exploitation and spiking. But in terms of the numbers of offences committed, the majority of VAWG crimes involve either sexual abuse, domestic abuse or stalking - some 5.1 million victims in the year ending March 2025, according to government figures. The government's strategy includes a range of educational and preventative measures aimed at supporting men and boys, in a bid to reduce the number of crimes of those types women and girls experience. That will include training for teachers to spot early signs of misogyny in boys and steer them away from it. It also pledges money for victims, although it's unclear how much of that is new funding and how much is from programmes already in place. Domestic abuse charity Woman's Trust told Sky News they welcome the approach, but that the plans as they stand \"lack both ambition and investment.\" It's also unclear how the help for victims will be targeted. Out of those 5.1 million victims, representing more than one in ten adults in England and Wales, some two million are men, and it doesn't track the experience of under-16s. The fact that such a high proportion of men were included in the measure was described as \"counter-intuitive\" by the Police Foundation. But it added that it would have been controversial to announce a policy that ignored male survivors of sexual crimes. Niki Scordi, Chair of the Board of Trustees at the Woman's Trust, told Sky News that although the fight against VAWG has always been led by women, they recognise that the issues also affect men. \"Many women's charities also support male victims of these sorts of crimes, so it is appropriate that the government are also trying to support all victims as well. Many of the perpetrators of male abuse are also men, so efforts to educate and prevent abuse will help victims of all genders.\" Read more:'National emergency' of violence against women and girlsMale survivors 'ignored' as abuse is classified 'violence against women'Teachers to be trained to spot early signs of misogyny in boys James McKinnon, a spokesperson for Survivors UK which supports male and non-binary victims of sexual abuse, told Sky News \"it is understandable and right that strategies for tackling sexual violence prioritise women and girls since they clearly account for the majority of victims.\" He added: \"That male victims of sexual violence are parcelled in under VAWG does in effect mean that supporting male survivors is seen as an afterthought and their experiences not as important.\" \"This presents a self-perpetuating problem because men are less likely to report being a victim of rape, sexually assaulted or abused to the police, or in some cases even recognise their experiences as abuse.\" Is violence against women and girls growing? The figures the government is using come from the Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW), using survey responses from about 34,000 households selected at random each year. It is generally considered a better measure for recording people's experiences of crime than police-recorded data because it is not affected by changes in police recording practices, the introduction of new offences, or victims not wanting to report their crime for any reason. The last factor is particularly relevant for VAWG offences as we know that many domestic or sexual abuse victims in particular find it difficult to report their experiences to police. The CSEW data suggests that number of sexual assault victims has gone up and down a bit over the last twenty years, but overall it's not changed much. Across all genders, 2.36% of people aged 16 or over were sexual assault victims in 2024/25. That's the same as the average from 2004 to 2023. The government will be hoping that its new strategy can start moving that line more consistently in the right direction. The most common sexual assault experience in 2024/25 was unwanted sexual touching, experienced by 3.6% of women and 0.6% of men aged 16 or over. The most serious offence of rape or attempted rape was experienced by 0.4% of women and 0.1% of men last year. There was a significant fall in the number of over-15s that say they experienced stalking through the 2010s. It fell by almost half between 2004 and 2010. The figures have flat-lined since then, however. There was actually a rise in female victims between 2010 and 2022, which has started to come back down again in the last few years. Unfortunately, the definitions of domestic abuse changed recently, meaning we don't have comparable data for such a long time period. The percentage of over-15s affected by it fell slightly over the last year, from 8.0% to 7.8%. The most common form was emotional abuse by a partner, experienced by 4.8% of women and 3.2% of men aged 16 or over. Other significant partner-on-partner offences included economic abuse, threats and stalking. Abuse by family members, another part of the VAWG strategy, was experienced by about 2.7% of over-15s. Ms Scordi from Woman's Trust told us that children - who are not represented in the crime survey figures - are particularly at risk from this. A report published by the National Audit Office earlier this year, whose statistics were also used by a House of Commons library report on the same topic, pointed out that the number of rape and sexual offences recorded by police grew by 264% between 2009/10 and 2023/24. The ONS, however, says that police recorded sexual offences are not a good indicator of trends over time. Girls not included One significant criticism of the data is the fact that under-16s are not included in the CSEW. This means it's not possible to measure the government's efforts to protect \"girls\". Before the government confirmed that this would be their approach, the Police Foundation told Sky News that excluding under-16s would be \"a glaring omission\". Following up after the announcement today, Ruth Halkon, a researcher at the Police Foundation, said that there isn't currently much reliable crime data available on girls, but that it would not be impossible to start getting the data, as some police forces like Gloucestershire had done. Ms Halkon said that doing so would be \"expensive and time-consuming\" but that getting hold of that important information would be a good use of time and money. The Home Office told Sky News \"children and girls under 16 who experience sexual abuse and exploitation are considered throughout the strategy, with specific commitments aimed at tackling these appalling crimes\". Funding questions Another criticism is the amount of money pledged to the various policies. Ms Scordi told us that it's currently unclear how much of the funding is new and how much is from either existing projects or ones that were cancelled recently. For example, £2m has been put towards a specialist police unit dedicated to investigating sexual violence. Ms Scordi says this replaces a team that was closed down a few years ago, but it now has a narrower remit because the old team was also empowered to investigate both domestic and sexual abuse. She added that £500m announced by Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips to support housing for domestic abuse victims has already been in place since 2022. And that the additional £500m to support victims in other ways replaces services previously offered by local authorities. Ms Scordi said that the £5m announced to train health workers to recognise signs of domestic abuse is strengthening a service that is already in place. And it's a similar story with the £20m allocated to train teachers to recognise either signs of abuse or developing misogyny. Ms Halkon from the Police Foundation also said that the definitions used for things like domestic abuse were also potentially too broad, which makes it harder to measure whether the strategy is achieving its targets. She welcomed however the fact that the strategy supports programmes that have already been proven to help in pilot schemes, and that the approach was cross-departmental - involving work in schools and healthcare settings, not just criminal justice. Ms Halkon added that other issues like social media safeguarding for young people and the courts backlog also need to be addressed in order to prevent VAWG and improve outcomes for victims.

        "Content": "A former Premier League footballer has won a court case against a leading surgeon, after the player argued an unnecessary procedure had brought his career to a \"premature end\". Ex-Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, 39, successfully brought a legal challenge in the High Court on Thursday, more than a decade after he suffered an injury playing for the club. Ebanks-Blake broke his left leg in a match against Birmingham City in April 2013. He said that during an operation to fix the fracture, surgeon Professor James Calder also removed ankle scar tissue and loose cartilage. Ebanks-Blake said the procedure \"gave rise to inflammation\", and sped up the development of osteoarthritis in his ankle. He also said the surgeon failed to properly inform him of the risks associated with the procedure. Professor Calder denied the claims and argued the treatment prolonged the Premier League footballer's career, as he played for another six years before retiring in 2019. Judge Christina Lambert found the surgery, known as arthroscopy, did contribute towards the decline of Ebanks-Blake's health. \n                  Man charged with racially abusing Antoine Semenyo during Premier League match\n                 \n                  Arne Slot has 'no clue' whether Mohamed Salah has played last game for Liverpool\n                 \n                  Vitor Pereira sacked as Wolves manager just weeks after signing new contract, as club remains winless and bottom of the Premier League\n                 \"I am satisfied on balance that, but for the arthroscopy, the claimant would have returned to his pre-accident pain-free state,\" she said. During the trial in London earlier this year, Ebanks-Blake's barrister, Simeon Maskrey KC, said the \"onset of symptoms and the development and acceleration of osteoarthritis brought the claimant's footballing career to a premature end\". Defending the claim, Professor Calder said the injuries were significant and that it would have been negligent not to have performed the surgery. But Mrs Justice Lambert said Ebanks-Blake had suffered a \"modest acute ankle fracture only\". \"Taking all of these factors into account, I am satisfied that the decision to undertake arthroscopy, and the other procedures, was neither reasonable nor logical,\" she said.\"The removal of the scar tissue destabilised the joint by removing the cushioning and by altering the biomechanics of the joint leading to increased movement of the joint, increased instability and acceleration of degenerative change in the ankle joint.\" Read more from Sky News:SNP leader condemns alleged bugging of MSP's officeActors vote for industrial action over AI concerns Ebanks-Blake started his career in 2002 at 15, playing for Manchester United's youth academy, making his first team debut in 2004. He suffered an injury to his lower left leg after being tackled a year later, but was able to continue playing after taking the rest of the season off. In 2008, he signed with Wolves where he became their top goal scorer, until the collision with a defender in 2013. Ebanks-Blake told the court the other player's full body weight had landed on the lower part of his left leg, the same area as the previous injury. He underwent the ankle surgery with Professor Calder that led to further complications and his eventual retirement, the court found. Damages will be decided at a future hearing."

        "Content": "A judge has ruled that nearly £20m is to be paid out to 16 survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing who were children at the time of the tragedy. Twenty-two people were murdered and hundreds injured in the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, 2017. Amounts of between £2,770 and £11.4m were agreed at a hearing on Thursday at the Manchester Civil Courts of Justice for 16 youngsters, all aged under 16 at the time of the attack. The total amount to be paid comes in at £19,928,150. Some of the youngsters suffered \"catastrophic\" and life-changing injuries, and others suffered psychological damage after 22-year-old Salman Abedi detonated a backpack bomb leaving the concert. The claims were made against, and will be paid by, the defendants in the case - those responsible for the safe and secure running of the arena event. Those contributing to the settlement include: SMG Europe Holdings, which managed the venue; Showsec International Ltd, responsible for crowd management; and British Transport Police (BTP) and Greater Manchester Police (GMP), responsible for policing the area. A public inquiry into the bombing, led by Sir John Saunders, found that chances to prevent the attack had been missed, and also noted \"serious shortcomings\" in security and individual failings.

It is understood that following the hearing, claims by another 352 people, all adults deemed to have capacity, including the families of the 22 who lost loved ones, will now be agreed between lawyers for the claimants and the defendants. Those agreements have been made out-of-court, so no details of any public money to be paid out by public bodies BTP and GMP have been made public. The four organisations have apologised to the bereaved families and to the survivors, lawyers for the claimants said, and have admitted their failures. Judge Bird told the hearing: \"Each of these cases has a common link, that is injuries and loss suffered, arising out of a single and unimaginable act of terrorism committed on the evening of May 22 2017 at the end of a concert attended by very many young people and their families.\" \"The love and care a parent gives to an injured child is beyond monetary value,\" he added. Judge Bird also paid tribute to the \"courage, dedication and fortitude\" of the families involved in each case, adding: \"Each through their quiet determination has brought about promises of change in the hope that in the future, other families need not go through what they have been through.\" After the hearing, a joint statement was issued from the legal teams at Hudgell Solicitors, Slater & Gordon and Broudie Jackson Canter, the three main firms representing the claimants. The statement said: \"This is not a day of celebration. It is a moment to acknowledge the mistakes that were made and the unimaginable suffering our clients have endured over the past eight and a half years. \"We now expect all parties to honour their commitment to do what they can to prevent those same mistakes from happening again.\" Martyn's Law, named in memory of Martyn Hett, 29, who was killed in the attack, has since been implemented, to better protect public venues from terror attacks."

        "Headline": "Equity members voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning in a move which could have big implications for the UK film and TV industry.  ",
        "Content": "By Bethany Minelle and Katie Spencer, arts specialists  Actors have voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning on set in a bid to secure adequate AI protections. Equity - the UK's largest acting union - announced the results of an indicative industrial action ballot on Thursday. With a turnout of over 75%, over 99% of those who voted said they would be prepared to refuse a set scan. There have been growing concerns among actors that their work, voice and likeness are being used without their explicit consent, with Equity pushing for transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage via an enforced industry standard. Announcing the results at Equity's headquarters in Covent Garden, Equity general secretary Paul Fleming said: \"Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity's film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action. \"Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and decades of erosion in terms and conditions begin to be reversed. \"The US streamers and PACT need to step away from the brink, and respect this show of strength. We need adequate AI protections which build on, not merely replicate, those agreed after the SAG-AFTRA strike in the USA over two years ago.\" \n                  OpenAI bags Disney characters for Sora short video app\n                 \n                  Apple's AI chief steps down as company falls behind in tech race\n                 \n                  Bigger than COVID? The graph that explains why AI is going to be so huge\n                 The vote follows unrest in the US in 2023, when members of Equity's sister union, SAG-AFTRA, went on strike for four months over issues including artificial intelligence protections. While nearly all those who voted in the Equity ballot said they would be prepared to take industrial action, Mr Flemming insisted \"industrial action is not an inevitability\". \"It is a choice to be made by the producers,\" he said. 'A big AI sausage machine' The vote came after 18 months of talks with the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact), the trade body representing the majority of film and TV production companies in the UK. While they say they have made significant progress in negotiations on protecting performers' rights when it comes to working with digital replicas (digital copies of real performers) and synthetic performers (artificially generated performers), the use of data, such as recorded performances or digital scans, to train AI systems, remains a sticking point. Mr Flemming said: \"The ball is in [Pact's] court when we return to the table in January.\" He warned that if negotiations did not produce a better AI deal, Equity's next step would be a statutory ballot for industrial action. Speaking to Sky News a little later, Mr Flemming dubbed the current system \"a big AI sausage machine\", saying its members' voice, likeness, and performance data was increasingly being \"used in commercial exploitation by American streamers, and also British independent producers and broadcasters\". Reminiscent of an episode of black comedy Black Mirror, he said that for some of the union's high-profile members, the \"big anxiety is creating entire AI characters of themselves\". Mr Flemming went on: \"We don't want to stop AI. What we want to do is regulated.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent Battle lines drawn. Equity's members have fired a clear warning shot to producers. Just a few years ago, the film and TV industry ground to a halt when actors and writers in the US walked out over AI and pay. While this industrial action stops short of a strike like that, we could in theory, still see substantial delays to productions if Equity performers make good on their threat to refuse to be scanned on set. How often does a scenario like that come up? Equity says it's now happening frequently. As The Crown star Bertie Carvel told me, \"it is one of the first things that happens these days when you go on to a major film set\". He added: \"Why would I collude in that? Well, the answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job.\" And that's the point of this collective stand. It is much harder as an individual to say no. Some have, but many have felt they could not This is a line in the sand. Given the speed of society's move towards AI, Equity knows that if it fails to get this right, it's signing the death warrant on many of its members' careers. If it fails to get the AI demands ironed out now in the small print of new working agreements with producers’ union PACT, it will be too late to demand these protections retrospectively. This indicative ballot might not be a binding decision to take industrial action, but it really does give an idea of the strength of feeling. For now, this is a cliff-hanger of an ending as we wait to see who blinks first - producers or performers? A big moment for the UK's film and TV industry A Pact spokesperson told Sky News: \"The majority of productions don't scan cast. In some types of production (such as those with SFX), scanning has taken place for many years - long before new technologies like Generative AI. Cast are informed when and why they are being scanned - most commonly for editing purposes. Producers abide by the legal requirements for the treatment and storage of scans. \"During the recent negotiations, Pact offered Equity terms on AI consistent with those that are in place in other countries. Equity is asking for future-facing protections that extend beyond the established safeguards already proven to protect actors around the world.\" Pact said discussions between the two bodies would continue. It's the first time such a large section of Equity's membership - over 7,000 performers working across TV and film - has been balloted, and as such is a significant moment for the UK's film and TV industry. As an indicative ballot, it's not binding, nor would it legally cover members who refuse to be digitally scanned on set. It acts as a warning shot to the industry, showing the level of support the union has for action, short of a strike. 'AI can't do creativity' Speaking after the vote, Laurence Olivier Award-winning actor Bertie Carvel, who is an active member of Equity and a member of its screen and new media committee, told Sky News he had voted \"yes\". Explaining how set scanning works, The Crown star, who works across both screen and stage, said: \"You're ushered into a studio, sometimes a mobile pod. I've had it done in the middle of muddy fields on location, surrounded by hundreds of cameras in every direction, 360 degrees. \"Within seconds, thousands of images have been captured that allow for a 3D replica - a computerised model of you to be built. And the question is what happens to that model next.\" Describing feeling obliged to be scanned as \"uncomfortable\", he added: \"I don't want this technology in the world, if I'm honest. It's contributing almost inevitably to my own obsolescence. Why would I collude in that? \"The answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job. And that's why we need to stand together as a union.\" Speaking to Sky News about AI earlier in the day, actor Riz Ahmed, who is currently starring in a modern re-imagining of Shakespeare's Hamlet, said: \"I don't think you can be relaxed about something that's gonna change our lives so dramatically. \"But I do think that, in a way, AI can't do creativity. I think AI can make things, it can make finished products, but without friction, without struggle to get there, things don't have meaning. A frictionless life is a meaningless life.\""

        "Content": "Former politician Derek Hatton and his wife have denied misconduct in a public office. The 77-year-old and Sonjia Hatton, 50, appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday. Derek Hatton, of Mossley Hill, Liverpool, entered a not guilty plea to a charge of counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office. His wife, of Aigburth, Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office. She is accused of providing her husband with confidential council information over matters of commercial and business use. Earlier this year, Derek Hatton pleaded not guilty to a charge of offering a bribe. The 77-year-old was a member of the Militant tendency that infiltrated Labour in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983, he became deputy leader of the Militant-led Liverpool City Council, which set an illegal budget in 1985 - spending more than its income - in a stand against Margaret Thatcher's government. Then Labour leader Neil Kinnock lambasted the \"grotesque chaos\" of the council's actions in his 1985 party conference speech. Hatton was expelled from Labour in 1986 after being found in breach of their rules. In 2019, he told Sky News he had been readmitted to the party but was suspended again just days later. Both Derek and Sonjia Hatton were on Thursday bailed to stand trial in April 2027 along with former Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, his son David Anderson and the council's former assistant director of highways and planning, Andrew Barr. Joe Anderson, 67, denies bribery, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. His 38-year-old son denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and Barr, 51, denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and accepting a bribe. They were charged as part of Operation Aloft. Launched by Merseyside Police, it looked into the awarding of commercial and business contracts from the council between 2010 and 2020. Six other defendants charged in connection with the investigation are due to stand trial in February next year."

        "Content": "Vladimir Putin's spymaster has said he had a \"rather lengthy telephone conversation\" with the new head of MI6, Russian state news agency Tass has reported.  Sergei Naryshkin, Russia's foreign intelligence director, said: \"A few days ago, I had a rather lengthy telephone conversation with the newly appointed chief of MI6 [Blaise] Metreweli.\" He added that Russian intelligence officers worked officially in London while MI6 officers worked officially in Moscow, according to Tass. Ms Metreweli took over as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service on 1 October. Sky News military analyst Michael Clarke believes it shows Moscow is \"trying to imply that the Brits are somehow appealing to them… because of the negotiations going on in Washington\". Further US-Russia talks are expected to take place over the coming days. EU talks stall amid fears over 'Russian retaliation'  Mr Naryshkin's comments came as the European Union held crunch talks on Ukraine funding in Brussels. EU leaders met at the bloc's headquarters on Thursday to discuss a plan to use frozen Russian assets - but tensions have arisen, with Belgium vocally opposed to the plan amid fears of Russian retaliation. Most of the €190bn (£166bn) of assets frozen after the start of the war in 2022 are currently held in Belgium, specifically by Euroclear, the Brussels-based financial clearing house. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the plan to loan Ukraine the frozen assets \"drastically increases the risk of Russian retaliation\". \"It's not acceptable that this happens to Belgium alone,\" he added. \"If we jump, we jump together.\" Read more:Brit who fought for Ukraine jailed by RussiaBelgian PM 'sceptical' over Ukraine loan plan Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he understands \"the risks that he is talking about, but I think that we face bigger risks\". \"Ukraine has the right to this money because Russia is destroying us,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. In a post on X, he added: \"The decision now on the table - the decision to fully use Russian assets to defend against Russian aggression - is one of the clearest and most morally justified decisions that could ever be made.\" Trump claims peace deal is 'close'  On the other side of the Atlantic, Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to move quickly to secure a peace deal. The US president's envoys are scheduled to meet with a top adviser to Mr Putin in Miami on Saturday, where they are due to discuss the evolving US peace agreement aimed at ending the war. Mr Trump has been optimistic that a deal can be reached. \"Well, we're getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there,\" he said. \"Every time they take too much time, Russia changes their mind.\" Russia 'deploys nuclear-capable missiles' to Belarus  Russia has deployed its latest nuclear-capable missile system to Belarus according to the country's president, Alexander Lukashenko. The authoritarian leader said the Oreshnik, an intermediate range ballistic missile system, arrived in the country on Wednesday and is entering combat duty. He did not provide any further details. Russia has previously deployed tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, the territory of which it used to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

        "Content": "Democrats have shared more pictures from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a day before the government's deadline for the full release. The 68 photos published on Thursday are among more than 95,000 images that the House Oversight Committee Democrats said they were reviewing. They said the images were \"selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos\" and to \"provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities\". But the Democrats added that they are still analysing thousands more images that are \"both graphic and mundane\". There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of those pictured in the images - and the context surrounding the photos is not known. Mystery text quotes price for 'girl' The latest cache includes a text message appearing to discuss the price for a girl. It isn't clear who sent the messages and to whom, but the screenshot shows some details on an unidentified girl, described as a teenager here. \"I will send u girls now,\" one of the texts read. Writing on body Several pictures show handwritten messages on a person's body. One appears to be quoting the opening paragraph of the book Lolita - which can be seen in the background of the picture. The book was written by Vladimir Nabokov and tells the story of a girl groomed by a middle-aged literature professor. Another shows writing on a foot, which reads: \"She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock.\" Other messages can be seen on the neck, hip, back and chest, with the latter reading: \"The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down\". In a different image, Epstein is pictured with three girls in his house in New York. One appears to be touching Epstein's chest, one is holding her wrist up and another is looking at a laptop. The identity of the women has been hidden. Epstein with high-profile figures Some high-profile figures also appear in the newly released images, with one showing Epstein sitting alongside Sheikh Jabor Bin Yousef Bin Jassim Bin Jabor al Thani. He is the chairman and director of several privately established companies and is a member of the Qatari royal family. Another image shows Epstein with the former president of the UN General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak, who held the role between 2017 and 2018. He is also a former Slovakian foreign affairs minister. Last month, he told TASR news agency: \"The reopening of the Epstein case occurred after I left New York, and the full extent of his inexcusable actions, which I strongly condemn, only came to light after his arrest.\" Shaher Abdulhak, a deceased Yemeni billionaire businessman whose son is a suspect in the murder of a Norwegian woman in Mayfair, was also pictured with Epstein. His son, Farouk Abdulhak, fled to Yemen after the rape and death of Martine Vik Magnussen in March 2008 and has been wanted for questioning ever since. Ms Magnussen was found dead among rubble in a basement in Great Portland Street. She and her friends had been celebrating finishing their end-of-term exams at the Maddox nightclub before she vanished. Her body was found two days later. Also featured in the newly released images were former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, magician David Blaine, businessman Tom Pritzker, billionaire Bill Gates, director Woody Allen, talk show host Dick Cavett, Trump ally Steve Bannon, and Kuwait's former information minister Anas al Rasheed. Photos of identity documents with redacted names were also published, including one with text saying that \"the bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor\", which could belong to convicted sex offender Epstein. Also among the identification documents is a heavily redacted Russian passport. It belongs to a female, but other information has been blocked out. The release also includes ID documents from the Czech Republic, South Africa, Ukraine, and Lithuania. Deadline looming The picture drop came a day before the deadline set by a bipartisan bill that compels the US Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month. Mr Trump had promised to release the Epstein files during his ultimately successful presidential campaign, but he later made a U-turn, even going as far as calling the Epstein files a Democratic \"hoax\", before eventually changing path again to sign the bill. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the deadline that he believes the Department of Justice will release the files in time, and warned that there will be \"strong bipartisan pushback\" if they don't. \"Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who've been working on this matter, related to full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,\" he told reporters on Thursday. Full release going 'down to the wire' National security lawyers inside the Department of Justice are \"working down to the wire\" as Friday's deadline for the full release of the Epstein files edges closer, according to Sky News' US correspondent James Matthews. He said those lawyers are mulling \"how much is actually divulged in these documents\". \"There will be redactions... the question is, how far short of everything? How far short of the full story will the release fall?\" Matthews said. \"The issue at the heart of it... where does Donald Trump feature? Remember, he emphatically denies all knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and any involvement in them.\" Read more:Releasing the Epstein files: How we got hereGhislaine Maxwell attempts to overturn conviction 'Frustration building' Meanwhile, frustration is building at the justice department ahead of the release, according to CNN. A source has told the US broadcaster that there could be up to 1,000 redactions needed from each attorney. Lawyers reportedly believe they aren't getting clear or comprehensive direction on how to make the most information available under the law. A previous batch of images featured more high-profile figures, including Donald Trump, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Bill Clinton, British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Emirati businessman Ahmed bin Sulayem, and singer Jimmy Buffett. Several images of a sexual nature have also been released, including a picture of a bowl of novelty condoms with a caricature of Mr Trump's face, and various sex toys."

Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi in the UK and to the Commonwealth, told Sky News correspondent Nicole Johnston that \"all Jewish hearts are broken at this time\". He said he wanted to fly out to Australia to offer his support to those affected by Sunday's terror attack, where 15 people were killed. Some 22 victims remain in hospital following the shooting, carried out at an event marking the start of the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah. Speaking after landing early on Thursday, Rabbi Mirvis said that as Jewish leader for the Commonwealth: \"This is my place. This is where I need to be.\" He added: \"I am here as a symbol of the extent that the whole Jewish world's hearts are broken at this time, and we identify with the Jewish community in Australia.

Their souls are so active. \"The bonding together, the feeling of togetherness, the connection to Jews and Judaism, love of the State of Israel, recognition of the demonisation of Israel, of Jews and Judaism, which is part of this whole story - of a desire for people out there to know what the real truth is. \"Standing tall as Jews during these exceptionally difficult times and being positive.

Frederic Pechier, who denied all the charges, was found guilty of 30 poisonings in total. The 53-year-old's family collapsed in emotion but he appeared unmoved after the court decided he was the \"common denominator\" in a series of cardiac arrests, reported France's BFM. The poisonings happened between 2008 and 2017 at two clinics in Besancon in eastern France, with Pechier adding chemicals to patients' anaesthesia bags to induce a heart attack or haemorrhage. Police began investigating after emergencies occurred during surgeries considered low risk. The killer's youngest victim was four and suffered two cardiac arrests during a tonsil operation in 2016. The oldest was 89. Prosecutors accused him of contaminating medication with substances such as potassium, adrenaline, local anaesthetics and anticoagulant, according to Le Monde. \n                  Hundreds of books at the Louvre damaged in water leak just weeks after £76m heist\n                 \n                  Jordan Bardella: Meet the man who could become France's next president\n                 \n                  France reveals new national military service amid fears of Russian threat\n                 It said the court was told Pechier wanted to \"psychologically hurt\" colleagues with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power\". \"You turned this clinic into a graveyard,\" prosecutors told him during closing arguments last week, after a trial that lasted over three months. Pechier had claimed the poisonings were down to mistakes by others. He eventually conceded a poisoner had been at work, but insisted it wasn't him. He maintained his innocence as jury deliberations began on Monday, telling the court: \"I will always say it: I am not a poisoner.\" His lawyer said on Thursday that he will appeal. The verdict comes after a paedophile surgeon was jailed earlier this year in a case that shocked France. Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, who like Pechier was a respected medical professional, admitted raping and sexually abusing nearly 300 victims over his career. Much of his abuse was done when his victims were under anaesthetic or waking from operations."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n A mysterious object that a controversial scientist claims could be an alien battleship reaches its closest point to Earth on Friday. The object, known as 3i/ATLAS, will speed by at 130,000mph, at a distance of 170 million miles, roughly twice as far away as the sun. While there is near consensus among astronomers that the object is a comet from outside our solar system, a Harvard University astrophysicist has sparked a furious debate by warning he cannot rule out that extraterrestrials are paying us a visit. Professor Avi Loeb told Sky News that humanity should be on high alert for what may be a \"black swan event\" - something that's highly unlikely but has high consequences and might have been foreseen. \"Alien technology is a potential threat because when you go on a blind date of interstellar proportions, you never know whether you have a friendly visitor as your dating partner or a serial killer,\" he said. \"When there are implications to society, we must consider even an unlikely event and collect as much data as possible to convince us otherwise.\" Professor Loeb said images of the object show it has an unusual tail that could come from a propulsion system, nickel in its gas cloud could be evidence of metal mining on its surface, and its trajectory, aligned with the orbits of planets in our solar system, was too unlikely to be by chance. 3i/ATLAS was first spotted in July as a distant dot of light against the starry canvas of the cosmos. But it has moved rapidly through the solar system, passing Mars in early October, disappearing briefly behind the sun, and after coming close to Earth's orbit, will fly by Jupiter before fading from view again. The US and European space agencies have trained cameras from a dozen spacecraft on the object, and they say there is no doubt its origins are completely natural. Amit Kshatriya, from NASA, said: \"This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet.\" Scientists estimate the comet is around eight billion years old, twice the age of our sun and solar system, and is a cosmic fossil left over from the formation of an unknown star in the galaxy. Professor Chris Lintott, an astronomer from the University of Oxford, told Sky News that there was nothing sinister about the object. \"It is just nonsense,\" he said. \"It's like saying we should consider the possibility that the moon is made of cheese. \"You could consider that possibility if you like, but my first question is why would you think that?\" He said the comet's changing colour and brightness can be explained by the sun heating pockets of ice and different materials that it's picked up on its epic journey through the stars. \"There is nothing this thing has done that we haven't seen elsewhere,\" he said. Read more:Why do the moons two sides look so different?Stranded Chinese astronauts return to Earth But Prof Loeb has accused other scientists of closing their minds to alternative explanations for what they are seeing. \"At the foundation of science is the humility to learn,\" he said. \"It's not the arrogance of expertise. And what you see very often is experts tell you what something should be and demonstrate by that, the arrogance of their expertise. They're not willing to learn something new.\" Prof Loeb made similar claims about a possible alien craft over Oumuamua, another interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, in 2017. Prof Lintott said wild theories that have no evidence can be dangerous. \"I'm baffled as to why Avi has latched on to this,\" he said. \"We can look for signs of intelligence in the cosmos. I'm very sympathetic to that idea. \"But you start by looking at things that are odd, and this thing is not odd.\""

        "Content": "Ghislaine Maxwell has filed a petition asking a US federal judge to overturn her  sex trafficking conviction and free her from prison, claiming \"substantial new evidence\". The disgraced British socialite and ex-girlfriend of the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. In the petition, Maxwell's lawyers argue that information which would have resulted in her exoneration at her 2021 trial was withheld, and that false testimony was presented to the jury. They say the cumulative effect is a \"complete miscarriage of justice.\" Read more from Sky News:Rob Reiner's son appears in courtWhite House plaques attack ex-presidents Maxwell was jailed in 2022 for sex trafficking after recruiting young girls for Epstein during the 1990s and early 2000s. Her latest legal bid for freedom came on Wednesday, two days ahead of the deadline for the release of the Epstein files - which include all material related to civil and criminal cases involving Epstein, who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. \n                  New York judge grants order to release Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case material\n                 \n                  Releasing Epstein files could jeopardise my appeal, claims Ghislaine Maxwell\n                 \n                  'Silence speaks volumes': Andrew criticised by US politicians after missing interview deadline \n                 Maxwell's lawyers have claimed that releasing the files - required after US President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act - would harm her bid for a retrial. The argument came in a letter from her legal team to a New York judge, which Sky News saw at the start of December. The lawyers argued the release of \"grand jury materials from her case, which contain untested and unproven allegations\" would \"foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial\". The letter also reveals the plan for the habeas corpus petition, filed this week. According to the US Congress's website, a habeas corpus petition is a procedure where \"a federal court may review the legality of an individual's incarceration\". Essentially, it is a challenge to determine whether a court proceeding was fair and lawful.  Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means \"you should have the body\" - interpreted as so that a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained. It's mentioned in Article One of the US Constitution and cannot be suspended, \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". Earlier this year, however, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Mr Trump is \"actively looking at\" suspending the principle in order to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants. The petition, filed in a Manhattan federal court, argues: \"Since the conclusion of [Maxwell's] trial, substantial new evidence has emerged from related civil actions, government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceeding. \"In the light of the full evidentiary record, no reasonable juror would have convicted her.\" It is unclear what new material the lawyers are referring to. In October, the US Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's attempts to appeal against her sentence, meaning the petition or a presidential pardon from Mr Trump are her only chances at being freed before her projected release date in 2037. Earlier in December a New York judge gave the go ahead for the US Department of Justice to publish material from Maxwell's sex trafficking case, as part of the Epstein files release. Democrats have released dozens of Epstein images Several dozen photos related to Epstein have already been released by Democrats in the US, ahead of this week's deadline for the release of the full files which are expected to include thousands of pages of material. As it happened: Trump 'knows nothing about' images released Last Friday, images of Mr Trump, Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and others were shared by the Democrats on social media. There was no suggestion that the pictures implied any wrongdoing. The US president, Mr Bannon, Mr Clinton and the former prince have all denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Other images included sex toys and condoms with Mr Trump's likeness."

        "Content": "China is to tax contraception for the first time in more than three decades in a move aligned with efforts to get more families to have children.  Contraceptive drugs and products such as condoms will no longer be exempt from China's 13% value added tax from January 1, the country's newest tax laws have revealed. The move comes as the country's birth rate declines. In 2024, 9.5 million babies were born in China, about one-third fewer than the 14.7 million born in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. As deaths have outpaced births in China, India overtook it as the world's most populous country in 2023. But the tax change has been ridiculed on on Chinese social media by people who have joked that they would be fools not to know that raising a child is more expensive than using condoms, even if they are taxed. \"That's a really ruthless move,\" said Hu Lingling, mother of a 5-year-old who said she is determined not to have another child. She said she would \"lead the way in abstinence\" as a rebel. \"It is also hilarious, especially compared to forced abortions during the family planning era,\" she said. \n                  China hosts world's first half-marathon race between humans and robots\n                 \n                  China to host world's first half-marathon race between humans and robots\n                 \n                  UK and China selling new economic relationship as a win-win - but it's complicated\n                 More seriously, experts are raising concerns over potential increases in unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases due to higher costs for contraceptives. Read more:China's population falls for the first time in 60 yearsChina's demographic sparks fears for retirement In previous decades China's huge population growth prompted the ruling Communist Party to ban couples from having more than one child in a rule that enforced from about 1980 until 2015, through fines and other penalties. In some cases women underwent forced abortions and children born over the one child limit were deprived of an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens. The government raised the birth limit to two children in 2015. Then, as China's population began to peak and then fall, it was lifted to three children in 2021. Contraception has previously been actively encouraged and easily accessed, sometimes for free. Director of the University of Virginia's Demographics Research Group, Qian Cai said: \"Higher prices may reduce access to contraceptives among economically disadvantaged populations, potentially leading to increases in unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Those outcomes could, in turn, lead to more abortions and higher health-care costs.\" She also said the new taxes would have a \"very limited\" effect on reproductive decisions. \"For couples who do not want children or do not want additional children, a 13% tax on contraceptives is unlikely to influence their reproductive decisions, especially when weighed against the far higher costs of raising a child,\" she said. But University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist Yi Fuxian said imposing the tax was \"only logical\". \"They used to control the population, but now they are encouraging people to have more babies; it is a return to normal methods to make these products ordinary commodities,\" he said."

Sophie Hunt, 34, from Northampton, died on 9 March 2022, two days after having a tummy tuck and a Brazilian butt lift (BBL) at the private Nisantasi Hospital in Istanbul. On Thursday, an inquest into her death at Northampton Coroner's Court was told Ms Hunt suffered multi-organ failure and died after experiencing cardiac arrest three times. In a statement read to the court, Ms Hunt's mother Sandra Hunt said her daughter lost consciousness after the surgery and had swelling in her hands. Paperwork from the hospital showed \"some of her ECG [electrocardiogram] readings indicate an abnormal heartbeat\", Sandra Hunt said, which she has been told was not healthy. \"We believe she was not fit for the surgery,\" she added. She said she also had concerns that there may have been a complication from the BBL procedure if too much fat was injected or removed from Ms Hunt's body. \n                  Democrats release more Epstein photos - with crucial deadline now just hours away\n                 \n                  Vladimir Putin's spymaster 'has telephone call with MI6 chief' as EU leaders meet to discuss Ukraine funding\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: Russia 'reveals secret chat' with MI6 chief - as Zelenskyy warns EU about 'bigger risks' at funding talks\n                 Assistant coroner Sophie Lomas told the inquest that because Ms Hunt died in another country, she \"does not have the jurisdiction to fully investigate what happened in that hospital\".

Ms Hunt was resuscitated, the inquest heard, but experienced a second cardiac arrest in an ambulance on the way to another hospital, the Avrupa Safak Hospital in Istanbul, which had a specialist cardiac intensive care unit. Ms Hunt died there later with respiratory failure and organ failure. The Turkish investigation found Ms Hunt died \"as a result of abdominoplasty and liposuction procedures and the complications that developed thereafter\". A post-mortem examination carried out by consultant histopathologist Professor Kevin West after Ms Hunt's body was repatriated to the UK, also concluded she died due to complications of the surgery. The \"exact cause of cardiopulmonary arrest is unclear\", but is likely to be because of the procedures, Mr West said. The coroner recorded a narrative conclusion which said: \"Sophie Hunt died due to complications of a surgical procedure carried out whilst abroad.\" Ms Hunt's mother said in her written statement that Sophie, who worked as a chef and enjoyed cooking and music, was \"outgoing, bubbly and very kind\"."

        "Content": "Democrats have shared more pictures from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, a day before the government's deadline for the full release. The 68 photos published on Thursday are among more than 95,000 images that the House Oversight Committee Democrats said they were reviewing. They said the images were \"selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos\" and to \"provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities\". But the Democrats added that they are still analysing thousands more images that are \"both graphic and mundane\". There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of those pictured in the images - and the context surrounding the photos is not known. Mystery text quotes price for 'girl' The latest cache includes a text message appearing to discuss the price for a girl. It isn't clear who sent the messages and to whom, but the screenshot shows some details on an unidentified girl, described as a teenager here. \"I will send u girls now,\" one of the texts read. Writing on body Several pictures show handwritten messages on a person's body. One appears to be quoting the opening paragraph of the book Lolita - which can be seen in the background of the picture. The book was written by Vladimir Nabokov and tells the story of a girl groomed by a middle-aged literature professor. Another shows writing on a foot, which reads: \"She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock.\" Other messages can be seen on the neck, hip, back and chest, with the latter reading: \"The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down\". In a different image, Epstein is pictured with three girls in his house in New York. One appears to be touching Epstein's chest, one is holding her wrist up and another is looking at a laptop. The identity of the women has been hidden. Epstein with high-profile figures Some high-profile figures also appear in the newly released images, with one showing Epstein sitting alongside Sheikh Jabor Bin Yousef Bin Jassim Bin Jabor al Thani. He is the chairman and director of several privately established companies and is a member of the Qatari royal family. Another image shows Epstein with the former president of the UN General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak, who held the role between 2017 and 2018. He is also a former Slovakian foreign affairs minister. Last month, he told TASR news agency: \"The reopening of the Epstein case occurred after I left New York, and the full extent of his inexcusable actions, which I strongly condemn, only came to light after his arrest.\" Shaher Abdulhak, a deceased Yemeni billionaire businessman whose son is a suspect in the murder of a Norwegian woman in Mayfair, was also pictured with Epstein. His son, Farouk Abdulhak, fled to Yemen after the rape and death of Martine Vik Magnussen in March 2008 and has been wanted for questioning ever since. Ms Magnussen was found dead among rubble in a basement in Great Portland Street. She and her friends had been celebrating finishing their end-of-term exams at the Maddox nightclub before she vanished. Her body was found two days later. Also featured in the newly released images were former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, magician David Blaine, businessman Tom Pritzker, billionaire Bill Gates, director Woody Allen, talk show host Dick Cavett, Trump ally Steve Bannon, and Kuwait's former information minister Anas al Rasheed. Photos of identity documents with redacted names were also published, including one with text saying that \"the bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor\", which could belong to convicted sex offender Epstein. Also among the identification documents is a heavily redacted Russian passport. It belongs to a female, but other information has been blocked out. The release also includes ID documents from the Czech Republic, South Africa, Ukraine, and Lithuania. Deadline looming The picture drop came a day before the deadline set by a bipartisan bill that compels the US Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month. Mr Trump had promised to release the Epstein files during his ultimately successful presidential campaign, but he later made a U-turn, even going as far as calling the Epstein files a Democratic \"hoax\", before eventually changing path again to sign the bill. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the deadline that he believes the Department of Justice will release the files in time, and warned that there will be \"strong bipartisan pushback\" if they don't. \"Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who've been working on this matter, related to full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,\" he told reporters on Thursday. Full release going 'down to the wire' National security lawyers inside the Department of Justice are \"working down to the wire\" as Friday's deadline for the full release of the Epstein files edges closer, according to Sky News' US correspondent James Matthews. He said those lawyers are mulling \"how much is actually divulged in these documents\". \"There will be redactions... the question is, how far short of everything? How far short of the full story will the release fall?\" Matthews said. \"The issue at the heart of it... where does Donald Trump feature? Remember, he emphatically denies all knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and any involvement in them.\" Read more:Releasing the Epstein files: How we got hereGhislaine Maxwell attempts to overturn conviction 'Frustration building' Meanwhile, frustration is building at the justice department ahead of the release, according to CNN. A source has told the US broadcaster that there could be up to 1,000 redactions needed from each attorney. Lawyers reportedly believe they aren't getting clear or comprehensive direction on how to make the most information available under the law. A previous batch of images featured more high-profile figures, including Donald Trump, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Bill Clinton, British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Emirati businessman Ahmed bin Sulayem, and singer Jimmy Buffett. Several images of a sexual nature have also been released, including a picture of a bowl of novelty condoms with a caricature of Mr Trump's face, and various sex toys."

        "Content": "TikTok's Chinese owner has signed a deal to sell the company's US arm to American investors – ensuring the video platform can continue operating in the United States.  The deal is expected to close on 22 January 2026, according to an internal memo seen by Sky News' US partner, NBC News. It will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law last year that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied. Mr Biden set a January 2025 deadline for the sale and when ByteDance failed to comply, TikTok went dark for several hours. It returned after Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running on his first day in office. Who's taking over? The internal memo sent to employees on Thursday said the deal allows \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part ‌of a vital global community.\" TikTok owner ByteDance will sell just over 80% of the company's US assets to three major investors, Reuters news agency reports. The investors - Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX - will form a new venture, named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.

It will have a new, seven-member majority-American board of directors and be subject to terms that \"protect Americans' data and US national security\", the memo said.

The Cessna C550 business jet erupted into flames when it hit the ground while trying to land at Statesville Regional Airport, around 45 miles north of Charlotte, shortly after 10am local time (3pm UK time) on Thursday. According to flight tracking data, the plane had taken off from the airport and was bound for Florida, but returned within minutes.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Christian Turner is a mandarin's mandarin. His appointment to the most glamorous posting in the UK diplomatic service is a victory for the Sir Humphreys over the politicians. After the disaster and humiliation of Peter Mandelson's demise over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, it always made sense to appoint a scandal-free career diplomat as his successor. Father-of-two Dr Turner is 53 but looks half his age. But his youthful appearance hides a long experience as a diplomat and civil servant serving prime ministers dating back to Tony Blair. The Foreign Office announcement of his appointment describes him as \"one of the UK's most experienced diplomats\". And the top mandarins at the FCDO will be delighted they've got their man. When Lord Mandelson was appointed last year, the senior cabinet minister Peter Kyle told Sky News the government had decided that he was \"worth the risk\". And what a risk it turned out to be. Will they never learn? \"Mandy\" - as he's always been known in Westminster - had previously been forced to resign from the cabinet not once, but twice. He declared in an angry and defiant victory speech when he held his Commons seat in Hartlepool: \"I'm a fighter, not a quitter.\" But not long after that, he quit to become a Brussels commissioner. Dr Turner, on the other hand, has enjoyed a stellar and unblemished career as a diplomat. His most high-profile international post so far was high commissioner to Pakistan, where he was said to be immensely popular. One of his earlier diplomatic posts was high commissioner in Kenya, when he had to lead the UK's response to the Westgate Mall terrorist attack, in which 71 people were killed. So he's seen as a safe pair of hands and is unlikely to attract scandal and controversy in the way that his predecessor did, with his relationships with colourful tycoons and oligarchs as well as love of the high life. Nevertheless, the Washington posting comes with some of the best perks in the diplomatic world, notably the luxurious Lutyens mansion that serves as the ambassador's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Dr Turner saw off some distinguished rivals for the top job in the diplomatic service, including chief Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's business adviser, who is credited with being the architect of recent trade agreements with President Trump. Until this week, he was seen as the frontrunner for the job, and as a sop for not getting the Washington post, he will now have an expanded role, including taking a lead role in trade talks with the US. A late entry in what became a three-horse race was Nigel Casey, Britain's ambassador in Moscow. But ultimately, he was seen as indispensable in his current role, given the volatile relations with Vladimir Putin and the continuing war in Ukraine. The PM interviewed all three candidates last week and his choice of Dr Turner is seen as a victory for Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office's top diplomat, whose career has prospered despite criticism of his role as the UK's post-Brexit negotiator, over government ministers. Read more from Sky News:Russia 'reveals secret chat' with MI6 chiefFormer footballer wins claim against top surgeon Insiders claim there will be champagne corks popping in the Foreign Office's King Charles Street HQ because Dr Turner is their man and will report back to the FCDO rather than No 10. If Lord Mandelson - the \"prince of darkness\" in his days as a Labour spin doctor - was seen as Sir Keir's \"Trump whisperer\", Dr Turner will be the PM's - and, more importantly, the Foreign Office's - eyes and ears."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n The anticipation had been that it would be a speech of significance. The White House had announced two days earlier that the president was to deliver an evening address to the nation. Traditionally the 9pm slot, interrupting the prime-time schedule on all the networks, is reserved for big news - usually international in nature. Speculation had grown through the day that he may use the speech to address the prospect of US military action in Venezuela. Read more: Trump has told us why he's going after Venezuela Instead, Trump took the big audience moment to make what was essentially a campaign speech but delivered at speed and combative in tone. He blamed former president Joe Biden for the economy he inherited, on the \"brink of ruin\", adding that he is \"bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast\". Speaking from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, he said: \"Our country is back, stronger than ever before. We're poised for an economic boom the likes of which the nation has never seen. \"It's not done yet, but boy are we making progress, nobody can believe what's going on.\" He was speaking against an increasingly challenging backdrop politically and economically. Petrol prices are down, but the broad cost of living continues to rise, and people do not seem to be feeling the economic boom he claims to be unleashing. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest it's been for five years. The only real announcement in his speech was a bonus for members of the military. He said that the government would send cheques of $1,776 to all service members. The idea, he said, had only been finalised \"about 30 minutes ago\", and the cheques were already in the post. A fascinating speech - in tone if not substance It was a very notable presidential address, not for what he announced because there was no big reveal. It was the tone which fascinated me. The 9pm live address was his framing of his greatest hits from the past year, but delivered by an angry and frustrated man. \"Why are my polling numbers not better?\" was the vibe he gave off. \"Why is the economy not doing better? Why are you - the voters - not feeling better off?\" Not actual quotes, but the clear subtext. Read more: White House plaques attack ex-presidents It is his low polling, rising unemployment, the cost of living and inflation challenges which prompted this address. Had he come out and, off script, with empathy, said - \"look, I get it… it's taking time for you to feel my economic success….\" - if he'd said all that with meaning, I think that would have landed in a more sympathetic way. Instead - reading, unusually, off a script, he came across as a very frustrated president and extremely defensive. Here's the worry for Team Trump. So often out and about with voters, I hear people say: \"Oh I don't really like his style, his language, his divisiveness. But he's a businessman. He knows how to run the country and the economy.\" If he loses those people, he's in real trouble. That's especially true when combined with suggestions he is losing some in his base too - just listen to his fan-turned-foe, MAGA stalwart, Marjorie Taylor Green. One last thought. There are observers who think Trump is kind of unhinged; losing his marbles a bit. The slightly strange tone of this speech will be evidence for them, for sure."

        "Content": "Washington's John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is set to be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center after the Trump-handpicked board backed the move in a vote. The name change has been criticised as a \"disgrace\" by the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who is also on the board. Kennedy family members have also hit out at the decision. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move recognises the \"unbelievable work President Trump has done over the past year to save the building\". \"Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" she said in a post on social media. Mr Jeffries said the president's handpicked board had no authority to rename Washington's leading performing arts centre in the absence of legislative action, \"and we're going to make that clear\".

After taking little interest in it during his first term in office, Mr Trump launched a revamp of the institution shortly after returning to power. He ousted ​its chair and installed a new board that made Mr Trump the chair instead. He also fired the centre's long-time president, Deborah Rutter. On 7 December, while walking the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honours programme, Mr Trump was asked if he planned to rename the venue after himself. He replied that the decision would be up to the board. Earlier this month, Mr Trump mentioned a \"big event on Friday at the Trump-Kennedy Centre\" before correcting himself with, \"excuse me, at the Kennedy Centre\", prompting laughter from the audience. He was referring to the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer draw, in which he took part and was awarded FIFA's new peace prize. Mr Kennedy was assassinated ⁠in Dallas, Texas, 1963. The centre has been seen as a memorial to him and ‌the ideals he espoused. In a social media post in July, Maria Shriver, a niece of former president Kennedy, hit out at \"insane\" legislation introduced in Congress to rebrand the Kennedy Centre as the Donald J Trump Centre for the Performing Arts. \"It makes my blood boil. It's so ridiculous, so petty, so small-minded,\" she wrote. \"Truly, what is this about? It's always about something. 'Let's get rid of the Rose Garden. Let's rename the Kennedy Center.' What's next?\" Read more from Sky News:King pours 'perfect' pint of GuinnessActors vote for industrial action over AI concerns Earlier this year, President Trump transformed the Kennedy-era Rose Garden at the White House into a patio, replacing the lawn with paving stones.

Mr Trump has also renamed the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\" under a 2025 executive order and rebranded the United States Institute of Peace as the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace."

        "Content": "The FBI's deputy director, formerly a controversial podcast host who spread conspiracy theories, has said he will resign in the new year. Dan Bongino was appointed by Donald Trump to be second-in-command of the federal intelligence body in February, serving under director Kash Patel. Announcing his resignation on Wednesday, the 51-year-old said he was grateful for the \"opportunity to serve with purpose\". While he did not say when in January he would leave or what he would do next, Mr Trump said earlier in the day: \"Dan did a great job. I think he wants to go back to his show.\" In a social media post, Mr Patel called Mr Bongino \"the best partner I could've asked for in helping restore this FBI\". \"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" the FBI director added. Mr Bongino worked for the New York Police Department for several years in the 1990s before joining the Secret Service as an agent, serving on the presidential details for then-presidents Barack Obama and George Bush. \n                  Some reckon Trump's unhinged - this speech might help their case\n                 \n                  New plaques in Trump's White House attack Joe Biden, Barack Obama and George W Bush\n                 \n                  Trump's critics will say 'I told you so' after angry speech\n                 The now-intelligence began doing commentary on Fox News more than a decade ago, and had a Saturday night show with the network from 2021 to 2023. He also started a podcast, The Dan Bongino Show, which Spotify said was one of the most popular on the platform as it aired. His appointment led several in the intelligence community to express concern over Mr Bongino's lack of experience and support for conspiracy theories, according to Sky News' US partner NBC News. 'Out of control furious' on Epstein files  Before his appointment, Mr Bongino spread false information about the 2020 election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud. He also claimed that Jeffrey Epstein had not taken his own life in a New York jail soon after his 2019 arrest, and claimed there was a cover-up regarding the Epstein files. Releasing the Epstein files: How we got here After his arrival in the bureau, he said in a Fox News interview: \"I've seen the whole file. He killed himself.\" Mr Bongino's position came under further question after the FBI and Department of Justice announced in July that they would not be releasing any additional records from the Epstein investigation, despite earlier promises to release all files. Sky's US partner NBC News reported at the time that Mr Bongino had a confrontation with US attorney general Pam Bondi over how her department handled the Epstein files, and was considering resigning. A source told the broadcaster: \"Bongino is out of control furious. This destroyed his career. He's threatening to quit and torch Pam unless she's fired.\" After months of pressure and repeated attacks on Democrats and Republicans calling for the files to be made public, Mr Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act in November. Attacked FBI before appointment Before his appointment, Mr Bongino also claimed that the FBI, under previous leadership, lied when it said it had not yet identified a suspect in a pipe bomb plot the day before the 6 January riots in 2021. NBC News reported earlier in December that Brian Cole Jr was arrested and charged in connection with the placement of pipe bombs outside of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee nearly five years ago. Ms Bondi said earlier this month that investigators and prosecutors made the arrest after \"sifting through evidence that had been sitting at the FBI\". But Mr Bongino said as recently as last year that the pipe bombs were either an \"inside job\" or the work of a \"connected anti-Trump insider\" and said the truth was shielded by a \"massive cover-up\". In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, the deputy director was asked about his previous remarks, and said: \"I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions, that's clear.\""

The disgraced British socialite and ex-girlfriend of the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. In the petition, Maxwell's lawyers argue that information which would have resulted in her exoneration at her 2021 trial was withheld, and that false testimony was presented to the jury. They say the cumulative effect is a \"complete miscarriage of justice.\" Read more from Sky News:Rob Reiner's son appears in courtWhite House plaques attack ex-presidents Maxwell was jailed in 2022 for sex trafficking after recruiting young girls for Epstein during the 1990s and early 2000s.

The argument came in a letter from her legal team to a New York judge, which Sky News saw at the start of December. The lawyers argued the release of \"grand jury materials from her case, which contain untested and unproven allegations\" would \"foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial\". The letter also reveals the plan for the habeas corpus petition, filed this week. According to the US Congress's website, a habeas corpus petition is a procedure where \"a federal court may review the legality of an individual's incarceration\". Essentially, it is a challenge to determine whether a court proceeding was fair and lawful.  Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means \"you should have the body\" - interpreted as so that a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained. It's mentioned in Article One of the US Constitution and cannot be suspended, \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". Earlier this year, however, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Mr Trump is \"actively looking at\" suspending the principle in order to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants. The petition, filed in a Manhattan federal court, argues: \"Since the conclusion of [Maxwell's] trial, substantial new evidence has emerged from related civil actions, government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceeding. \"In the light of the full evidentiary record, no reasonable juror would have convicted her.\" It is unclear what new material the lawyers are referring to. In October, the US Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's attempts to appeal against her sentence, meaning the petition or a presidential pardon from Mr Trump are her only chances at being freed before her projected release date in 2037. Earlier in December a New York judge gave the go ahead for the US Department of Justice to publish material from Maxwell's sex trafficking case, as part of the Epstein files release. Democrats have released dozens of Epstein images Several dozen photos related to Epstein have already been released by Democrats in the US, ahead of this week's deadline for the release of the full files which are expected to include thousands of pages of material. As it happened: Trump 'knows nothing about' images released Last Friday, images of Mr Trump, Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and others were shared by the Democrats on social media. There was no suggestion that the pictures implied any wrongdoing. The US president, Mr Bannon, Mr Clinton and the former prince have all denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Other images included sex toys and condoms with Mr Trump's likeness."

The deal is expected to close on 22 January 2026, according to an internal memo seen by Sky News' US partner, NBC News. It will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law last year that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied. Mr Biden set a January 2025 deadline for the sale and when ByteDance failed to comply, TikTok went dark for several hours. It returned after Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running on his first day in office. Who's taking over? The internal memo sent to employees on Thursday said the deal allows \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part ‌of a vital global community.\" TikTok owner ByteDance will sell just over 80% of the company's US assets to three major investors, Reuters news agency reports.

Ms O'Neill will not only become BP's first female boss when she takes over in April but also the first woman to lead one of the world's top five oil firms. Her appointment marks the first major move by BP's new chairman Albert Manifold, who took over in October amid continued shareholder frustration over the progress of BP's turnaround. \n                  Bank of England rate cut to 3.75% following fall in inflation\n                 \n                  Interest rate cut to lowest level since 2023 - with 533,000 people likely to feel impact first | Money blog\n                 \n                  TikTok's Chinese owner agrees deal to sell US business\n                 He is seeking a renewed push to improve returns as BP's shares and earnings continue to lag those of rivals - a trend that has lasted for years. The company embarked on a major strategy shift earlier this year, slashing billions in planned renewable energy initiatives and shifting its focus back to traditional oil and gas. \"Progress has been made in recent years, but increased rigor and diligence are required to make the necessary transformative changes to maximise value for our shareholders,\" Mr Manifold said in a statement announcing the appointment. Under Ms O'Neill's leadership, Woodside merged with BHP Group's petroleum arm to create a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer valued at $40bn and doubled Woodside's oil and gas production. Mr Manifold added: \"Her proven track record of driving transformation, growth, and disciplined capital allocation makes her the right leader for BP. \"Her relentless focus on business improvement and financial discipline gives us high confidence in her ability to shape this great company for its next phase of growth and pursue significant strategic and financial opportunities.\" Mr Auchincloss said of his own exit: \"After more than three decades with BP, now is the right time to hand the reins to a new leader. \"When Albert became chair, I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of BP's strategy. I am confident that bp is now well positioned for significant growth and I look forward to watching the company's future progress and success under Meg's leadership.\" Woodside shares fell by almost 3% on news of her looming departure - a clear sign of disappointment over her loss from the business. Those for BP, however, were trading only 0.2% up in early trading on the FTSE 100. Rival energy shares were seeing better gains on the back of rising oil prices. Michael Alfaro, chief investment officer at Gallo Partners, suggested the appointment signalled that BP wanted to \"pursue a firm-wide push in natural gas\". \"O'Neill is definitely respected, has a good track record of execution,\" he said. The founder of the Follow This shareholder activism group, Mark van Baal, said of the appointment: \"BP has chosen someone whose entire career is rooted in fossil fuels. \"Leaders who have climbed the ranks of the fossil fuel sector can’t imagine business models beyond oil and gas. BP needs leadership that recognises the risks and opportunities created by the shift to clean energy. By sticking to fossil fuels, while the world transitions, BP jeopardises shareholder value.\"  BP said that executive vice president Carol Howle would serve as its interim chief executive until Ms O'Neill assumes her role while Mr Auchincloss would stay on in an advisory role for up to a year."

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n Controversial reforms to inheritance tax are the \"single biggest issue\" facing farmers, according to a long-awaited report into the profitability of the sector. The Farming Profitability Review - authored by Baroness Minette Batters, former head of the National Farmers' Union - says the industry is \"bewildered and frightened\" of what might lie ahead. The publication of the government-commissioned review had been delayed, with some claiming it was shelved till after the chancellor's budget last month, to avoid scrutiny. The report makes 57 recommendations on how the government can improve profitability - with Baroness Batters saying farmers are facing \"huge economic challenges\". But it stops short of offering alternative proposals to inheritance tax reforms (IHT), with Baroness Batters saying that was outside the terms of reference set. The changes - due to come into force next April - will see farms with assets of more than £1m pay 20% tax. Previously farms had been exempt. The reforms have led to thousands of farmers protesting in London over the last year, with many saying the IHT payments will make many smaller farms no longer viable. \"Nearly all the responses to this review have cited inheritance tax as the single biggest issue regarding farming viability that they face. The farming sector is bewildered and frightened of what might lie ahead,\" said Baroness Batters. She added that the \"core focus\" of her recommendations is to \"restore balance between food production and the environment\". The report highlights the threats of climate change to farming, which accounts for 70% of UK total land.

Reacting to the report, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs announced a new board to bring together senior leaders from farming, food production, retail, finance and government to strengthen UK food production. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"When farming thrives, the whole country benefits. British farmers are central to our food security, our rural economy and the stewardship of our countryside. \"Baroness Batters' review underlines the need for government, farming and the food industry to work much more closely together. That is exactly what the new Farming and Food Partnership Board will do.\" Baroness Minette Batters said: \"I'm pleased that the Secretary of State recognises the need to establish a new approach to growing the British brand at home and abroad by producing, creating and selling more from our farms in a measurable way. \"With ever more extreme weather, the horrific, ongoing war in Ukraine and 69.7 million people in the UK now is the time to deliver food security as national security.\" The government will set out its full response in a new 25-year Farming Roadmap, due for publication next year."

Scottish parliament officials are investigating the alleged bugging incident by a man, which is said to have taken place in 2023 at Holyrood. The Scotsman newspaper reported the staffer is still involved with the SNP and moved on to work with a male MP after the issue came to light. Sky News has yet to independently verify the details, but one senior party source with knowledge of events has said it is \"100% true\". The source alleges \"the SNP did nothing; indeed he simply got moved and continued to be promoted by very senior members of executive\". It is suggested the female MSP, who has not been publicly named, is liked, rated and respected by her colleagues. First Minister Mr Swinney was stopped by reporters in Edinburgh on Thursday where he said he was \"not familiar with all of the details... but that type of conduct is completely and utterly unacceptable\". \n                  Justice Secretary Angela Constance survives no confidence vote amid grooming gangs row\n                 \n                  First Minister John Swinney backs Justice Secretary Angela Constance amid threat of no confidence vote in grooming gangs row\n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 \"Individuals are entitled to operate in an open and transparent environment that shouldn't be subjected to that kind of behaviour,\" he concluded.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Christian Turner is a mandarin's mandarin. His appointment to the most glamorous posting in the UK diplomatic service is a victory for the Sir Humphreys over the politicians. After the disaster and humiliation of Peter Mandelson's demise over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, it always made sense to appoint a scandal-free career diplomat as his successor. Father-of-two Dr Turner is 53 but looks half his age. But his youthful appearance hides a long experience as a diplomat and civil servant serving prime ministers dating back to Tony Blair. The Foreign Office announcement of his appointment describes him as \"one of the UK's most experienced diplomats\". And the top mandarins at the FCDO will be delighted they've got their man. When Lord Mandelson was appointed last year, the senior cabinet minister Peter Kyle told Sky News the government had decided that he was \"worth the risk\". And what a risk it turned out to be. Will they never learn? \"Mandy\" - as he's always been known in Westminster - had previously been forced to resign from the cabinet not once, but twice. He declared in an angry and defiant victory speech when he held his Commons seat in Hartlepool: \"I'm a fighter, not a quitter.\" But not long after that, he quit to become a Brussels commissioner. Dr Turner, on the other hand, has enjoyed a stellar and unblemished career as a diplomat. His most high-profile international post so far was high commissioner to Pakistan, where he was said to be immensely popular. One of his earlier diplomatic posts was high commissioner in Kenya, when he had to lead the UK's response to the Westgate Mall terrorist attack, in which 71 people were killed. So he's seen as a safe pair of hands and is unlikely to attract scandal and controversy in the way that his predecessor did, with his relationships with colourful tycoons and oligarchs as well as love of the high life. Nevertheless, the Washington posting comes with some of the best perks in the diplomatic world, notably the luxurious Lutyens mansion that serves as the ambassador's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Dr Turner saw off some distinguished rivals for the top job in the diplomatic service, including chief Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's business adviser, who is credited with being the architect of recent trade agreements with President Trump. Until this week, he was seen as the frontrunner for the job, and as a sop for not getting the Washington post, he will now have an expanded role, including taking a lead role in trade talks with the US. A late entry in what became a three-horse race was Nigel Casey, Britain's ambassador in Moscow. But ultimately, he was seen as indispensable in his current role, given the volatile relations with Vladimir Putin and the continuing war in Ukraine. The PM interviewed all three candidates last week and his choice of Dr Turner is seen as a victory for Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office's top diplomat, whose career has prospered despite criticism of his role as the UK's post-Brexit negotiator, over government ministers. Read more from Sky News:Russia 'reveals secret chat' with MI6 chiefFormer footballer wins claim against top surgeon Insiders claim there will be champagne corks popping in the Foreign Office's King Charles Street HQ because Dr Turner is their man and will report back to the FCDO rather than No 10. If Lord Mandelson - the \"prince of darkness\" in his days as a Labour spin doctor - was seen as Sir Keir's \"Trump whisperer\", Dr Turner will be the PM's - and, more importantly, the Foreign Office's - eyes and ears."

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n Almost two in five victims of what the government defines as violence against women and girls are neither women nor girls, but adult men. The government describes violence against women and girls (VAWG) as a \"national emergency\" and one of their central promises has been that they would halve it within a decade. Today, 18 months in to their time in power, we know what they mean by that. As part of a strategy labelled Freedom From Violence and Abuse, the Home Office has been working alongside the Office for National Statistics to define a new measure of VAWG. Among the crimes it says are included in the definition of VAWG are: domestic abuse, stalking, sexual violence, including rape and other sexual offences, sexual harassment, 'honour'-based abuse, female genital mutilation, online and technology-facilitated abuse, fatal VAWG such as domestic homicides, sexual exploitation and spiking. But in terms of the numbers of offences committed, the majority of VAWG crimes involve either sexual abuse, domestic abuse or stalking - some 5.1 million victims in the year ending March 2025, according to government figures. The government's strategy includes a range of educational and preventative measures aimed at supporting men and boys, in a bid to reduce the number of crimes of those types women and girls experience. That will include training for teachers to spot early signs of misogyny in boys and steer them away from it. It also pledges money for victims, although it's unclear how much of that is new funding and how much is from programmes already in place. Domestic abuse charity Woman's Trust told Sky News they welcome the approach, but that the plans as they stand \"lack both ambition and investment.\" It's also unclear how the help for victims will be targeted. Out of those 5.1 million victims, representing more than one in ten adults in England and Wales, some two million are men, and it doesn't track the experience of under-16s. The fact that such a high proportion of men were included in the measure was described as \"counter-intuitive\" by the Police Foundation. But it added that it would have been controversial to announce a policy that ignored male survivors of sexual crimes. Niki Scordi, Chair of the Board of Trustees at the Woman's Trust, told Sky News that although the fight against VAWG has always been led by women, they recognise that the issues also affect men. \"Many women's charities also support male victims of these sorts of crimes, so it is appropriate that the government are also trying to support all victims as well. Many of the perpetrators of male abuse are also men, so efforts to educate and prevent abuse will help victims of all genders.\" Read more:'National emergency' of violence against women and girlsMale survivors 'ignored' as abuse is classified 'violence against women'Teachers to be trained to spot early signs of misogyny in boys James McKinnon, a spokesperson for Survivors UK which supports male and non-binary victims of sexual abuse, told Sky News \"it is understandable and right that strategies for tackling sexual violence prioritise women and girls since they clearly account for the majority of victims.\" He added: \"That male victims of sexual violence are parcelled in under VAWG does in effect mean that supporting male survivors is seen as an afterthought and their experiences not as important.\" \"This presents a self-perpetuating problem because men are less likely to report being a victim of rape, sexually assaulted or abused to the police, or in some cases even recognise their experiences as abuse.\" Is violence against women and girls growing? The figures the government is using come from the Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW), using survey responses from about 34,000 households selected at random each year. It is generally considered a better measure for recording people's experiences of crime than police-recorded data because it is not affected by changes in police recording practices, the introduction of new offences, or victims not wanting to report their crime for any reason. The last factor is particularly relevant for VAWG offences as we know that many domestic or sexual abuse victims in particular find it difficult to report their experiences to police. The CSEW data suggests that number of sexual assault victims has gone up and down a bit over the last twenty years, but overall it's not changed much. Across all genders, 2.36% of people aged 16 or over were sexual assault victims in 2024/25. That's the same as the average from 2004 to 2023. The government will be hoping that its new strategy can start moving that line more consistently in the right direction. The most common sexual assault experience in 2024/25 was unwanted sexual touching, experienced by 3.6% of women and 0.6% of men aged 16 or over. The most serious offence of rape or attempted rape was experienced by 0.4% of women and 0.1% of men last year. There was a significant fall in the number of over-15s that say they experienced stalking through the 2010s. It fell by almost half between 2004 and 2010. The figures have flat-lined since then, however. There was actually a rise in female victims between 2010 and 2022, which has started to come back down again in the last few years. Unfortunately, the definitions of domestic abuse changed recently, meaning we don't have comparable data for such a long time period. The percentage of over-15s affected by it fell slightly over the last year, from 8.0% to 7.8%. The most common form was emotional abuse by a partner, experienced by 4.8% of women and 3.2% of men aged 16 or over. Other significant partner-on-partner offences included economic abuse, threats and stalking. Abuse by family members, another part of the VAWG strategy, was experienced by about 2.7% of over-15s. Ms Scordi from Woman's Trust told us that children - who are not represented in the crime survey figures - are particularly at risk from this. A report published by the National Audit Office earlier this year, whose statistics were also used by a House of Commons library report on the same topic, pointed out that the number of rape and sexual offences recorded by police grew by 264% between 2009/10 and 2023/24. The ONS, however, says that police recorded sexual offences are not a good indicator of trends over time. Girls not included One significant criticism of the data is the fact that under-16s are not included in the CSEW. This means it's not possible to measure the government's efforts to protect \"girls\". Before the government confirmed that this would be their approach, the Police Foundation told Sky News that excluding under-16s would be \"a glaring omission\". Following up after the announcement today, Ruth Halkon, a researcher at the Police Foundation, said that there isn't currently much reliable crime data available on girls, but that it would not be impossible to start getting the data, as some police forces like Gloucestershire had done. Ms Halkon said that doing so would be \"expensive and time-consuming\" but that getting hold of that important information would be a good use of time and money. The Home Office told Sky News \"children and girls under 16 who experience sexual abuse and exploitation are considered throughout the strategy, with specific commitments aimed at tackling these appalling crimes\". Funding questions Another criticism is the amount of money pledged to the various policies. Ms Scordi told us that it's currently unclear how much of the funding is new and how much is from either existing projects or ones that were cancelled recently. For example, £2m has been put towards a specialist police unit dedicated to investigating sexual violence. Ms Scordi says this replaces a team that was closed down a few years ago, but it now has a narrower remit because the old team was also empowered to investigate both domestic and sexual abuse. She added that £500m announced by Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips to support housing for domestic abuse victims has already been in place since 2022. And that the additional £500m to support victims in other ways replaces services previously offered by local authorities. Ms Scordi said that the £5m announced to train health workers to recognise signs of domestic abuse is strengthening a service that is already in place. And it's a similar story with the £20m allocated to train teachers to recognise either signs of abuse or developing misogyny. Ms Halkon from the Police Foundation also said that the definitions used for things like domestic abuse were also potentially too broad, which makes it harder to measure whether the strategy is achieving its targets. She welcomed however the fact that the strategy supports programmes that have already been proven to help in pilot schemes, and that the approach was cross-departmental - involving work in schools and healthcare settings, not just criminal justice. Ms Halkon added that other issues like social media safeguarding for young people and the courts backlog also need to be addressed in order to prevent VAWG and improve outcomes for victims.

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer and other ministers will hold regular news conferences in a radical shakeup of government communications. The announcement on Thursday, shortly before parliament broke up for Christmas, was criticised by \"furious\" political journalists who raised concerns about transparency from a government that promised to raise standards. Former Tony Blair adviser Tim Allan, who was made Downing Street communications director in September, sent a letter to news organisations announcing the changes \"to ensure that the process is as efficient and as effective as possible\". He said the reforms \"are needed to better serve journalists and to better inform the public\". Currently, the prime minister's spokesperson holds news briefings each weekday morning and afternoon, or after PMQs on a Wednesday, where \"members of the lobby\" - political journalists with accreditation - can ask questions about what the government is doing and thinking on any topic. Mr Allan said the reforms will mean journalists outside of the \"lobby\" system as well as \"content creators\" will now get more access to the government.

From January, there will be a series of morning news conferences with ministers, and occasionally the prime minister, setting out the \"main government announcements of the day\". These will be open to lobby journalists, \"sector journalists and to content creators\". Mr Allan has also axed the daily afternoon briefings as he said it was \"not a good use of journalists' time or a good use of our communications resources\" because it \"often repeats lines\". Instead, there will be \"occasional\" afternoon news conferences with ministers, where they will set out a new government announcement and take questions. There will also be occasional technical briefings where journalists can ask relevant officials questions about policy announcements.

They have no serious plan to tackle this problem.\" This week has seen the government release its long-awaited strategy to tackle violence against women and girls. On Thursday, ministers announced all secondary school teachers will be trained to spot early signs of misogyny in boys and how to steer them away from it. Lessons on issues like consent and the dangers of sharing intimate images will be mandatory by the end of this parliament in 2029. Earlier, Tory frontbencher Katie Lam, responding to the government's VAWG announcement, had called for \"an informed and honest debate about whether mass migration is making this problem worse\". \"Not every country and culture in the world believes, as we do, that women are equal to men with personal, bodily and sexual autonomy,\" she told the Commons. \"And where people from those countries and cultures come here, this can be dangerous. \"If we cannot be honest about this, we will fail to achieve the first of this strategy's goals, preventing men and boys from becoming abusers.\" Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said she was \"yet to find any community where violence against women and girls does not happen\". She earlier branded VAWG a \"national emergency\". This is not the first time Ms Badenoch has spoken about cultural inequality, but is the first since she became leader. During the Tory leadership race last year, she said \"not all cultures are equally valid\" when it comes to deciding who should be allowed into the UK. Drawing on her own background - she was born in the UK but spent her childhood in Nigeria - she said: \"Culture is more than cuisine or clothes. It's also customs which may be at odds with British values. \"We cannot be naïve and assume immigrants will automatically abandon ancestral ethnic hostilities at the border, or that all cultures are equally valid. They are not. \"I am struck for example, by the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel. That sentiment has no place here.\""

        "Content": "Former politician Derek Hatton and his wife have denied misconduct in a public office. The 77-year-old and Sonjia Hatton, 50, appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday. Derek Hatton, of Mossley Hill, Liverpool, entered a not guilty plea to a charge of counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office. His wife, of Aigburth, Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office. She is accused of providing her husband with confidential council information over matters of commercial and business use. Earlier this year, Derek Hatton pleaded not guilty to a charge of offering a bribe. The 77-year-old was a member of the Militant tendency that infiltrated Labour in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983, he became deputy leader of the Militant-led Liverpool City Council, which set an illegal budget in 1985 - spending more than its income - in a stand against Margaret Thatcher's government. Then Labour leader Neil Kinnock lambasted the \"grotesque chaos\" of the council's actions in his 1985 party conference speech. Hatton was expelled from Labour in 1986 after being found in breach of their rules. In 2019, he told Sky News he had been readmitted to the party but was suspended again just days later. Both Derek and Sonjia Hatton were on Thursday bailed to stand trial in April 2027 along with former Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, his son David Anderson and the council's former assistant director of highways and planning, Andrew Barr. Joe Anderson, 67, denies bribery, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. His 38-year-old son denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and Barr, 51, denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and accepting a bribe. They were charged as part of Operation Aloft. Launched by Merseyside Police, it looked into the awarding of commercial and business contracts from the council between 2010 and 2020. Six other defendants charged in connection with the investigation are due to stand trial in February next year."

The Conservative-held councils of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Surrey, East and West Sussex, and Hampshire had initially seen their elections delayed by a year until May 2026 to allow for the reorganisation process to take place, Sky News understands. While Surrey and Hampshire are likely to see their elections go ahead, those in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and East and West Sussex could be postponed by another year until 2027, as the process is taking longer than expected. Politics latest: Strategy to tackle violence against women and girls announced As first reported by The Times, ministers are expected to ask the county councils if they want to delay their elections, and if so, the decisions will be confirmed in January. This comes after Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said in the House of Commons in November that the elections were expected to go ahead, and one of his ministers, Miatta Fahnbulleh, said earlier this month that \"local elections will go ahead in 2026\". This latest delay to elections comes after the government postponed the elections for the new mayoralties of Essex, Hampshire and the Solent, Sussex and Brighton, and Norfolk and Suffolk until 2028. \n                  Starmer critic elected leader of Unison - the UK's biggest union\n                 \n                  Unison leadership result shows Starmer's grip on Labour machine is slipping\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner calls on MPs to sit 'through the night' to get workers' rights bill through parliament\n                 As part of its pledge to expand devolution, the government is combining some smaller district councils into bigger \"strategic authorities\" with more sway over their areas. It follows Labour's manifesto promise to \"deepen\" and \"widen\" devolution, with more areas expected to take on the mayoral combined authority (CA) model like that headed by Sadiq Khan in Greater London. But this latest delay to elections has triggered fury from opposition parties, with Reform UK accusing the Labour government of \"colluding with the Tories\" to lock them out of power. Party leader Nigel Farage said: \"Turkeys don't vote for Christmas. Tory County Councils look set to collude with Labour to keep their control until 2027. \"Only a banana republic bans elections, that's what we have under [Sir Keir] Starmer. Kemi Badenoch must instruct her council leaders to allow elections to go ahead.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey echoed that sentiment, saying: \"This is looking like yet another Labour and Conservative stitch-up to deny people their votes in May. \"Kemi Badenoch must stop her Conservative council leaders from delaying elections yet again just because they are running scared of the Liberal Democrats.\" But Tory shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly hit out at the government for \"blaming local leaders for not being ready\". He added: \"Labour promised council elections would go ahead as planned as recently as last week. Now they're saying they won't. Another broken promise. \"Voters will now be denied the right to elect their own representatives - and not for the first time under this Labour government. \"Labour are scared of the voters. They thought they could completely overhaul local government and stack the deck in their favour. They were wrong. Earlier this month, Labour cancelled mayoral elections and now they are at it again with council elections, fiddling the democratic process to serve their own political interests.\" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n A mysterious object that a controversial scientist claims could be an alien battleship reaches its closest point to Earth on Friday. The object, known as 3i/ATLAS, will speed by at 130,000mph, at a distance of 170 million miles, roughly twice as far away as the sun. While there is near consensus among astronomers that the object is a comet from outside our solar system, a Harvard University astrophysicist has sparked a furious debate by warning he cannot rule out that extraterrestrials are paying us a visit. Professor Avi Loeb told Sky News that humanity should be on high alert for what may be a \"black swan event\" - something that's highly unlikely but has high consequences and might have been foreseen. \"Alien technology is a potential threat because when you go on a blind date of interstellar proportions, you never know whether you have a friendly visitor as your dating partner or a serial killer,\" he said. \"When there are implications to society, we must consider even an unlikely event and collect as much data as possible to convince us otherwise.\" Professor Loeb said images of the object show it has an unusual tail that could come from a propulsion system, nickel in its gas cloud could be evidence of metal mining on its surface, and its trajectory, aligned with the orbits of planets in our solar system, was too unlikely to be by chance. 3i/ATLAS was first spotted in July as a distant dot of light against the starry canvas of the cosmos. But it has moved rapidly through the solar system, passing Mars in early October, disappearing briefly behind the sun, and after coming close to Earth's orbit, will fly by Jupiter before fading from view again. The US and European space agencies have trained cameras from a dozen spacecraft on the object, and they say there is no doubt its origins are completely natural. Amit Kshatriya, from NASA, said: \"This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. All evidence points to it being a comet.\" Scientists estimate the comet is around eight billion years old, twice the age of our sun and solar system, and is a cosmic fossil left over from the formation of an unknown star in the galaxy. Professor Chris Lintott, an astronomer from the University of Oxford, told Sky News that there was nothing sinister about the object. \"It is just nonsense,\" he said. \"It's like saying we should consider the possibility that the moon is made of cheese. \"You could consider that possibility if you like, but my first question is why would you think that?\" He said the comet's changing colour and brightness can be explained by the sun heating pockets of ice and different materials that it's picked up on its epic journey through the stars. \"There is nothing this thing has done that we haven't seen elsewhere,\" he said. Read more:Why do the moons two sides look so different?Stranded Chinese astronauts return to Earth But Prof Loeb has accused other scientists of closing their minds to alternative explanations for what they are seeing. \"At the foundation of science is the humility to learn,\" he said. \"It's not the arrogance of expertise. And what you see very often is experts tell you what something should be and demonstrate by that, the arrogance of their expertise. They're not willing to learn something new.\" Prof Loeb made similar claims about a possible alien craft over Oumuamua, another interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, in 2017. Prof Lintott said wild theories that have no evidence can be dangerous. \"I'm baffled as to why Avi has latched on to this,\" he said. \"We can look for signs of intelligence in the cosmos. I'm very sympathetic to that idea. \"But you start by looking at things that are odd, and this thing is not odd.\""

The deal is expected to close on 22 January 2026, according to an internal memo seen by Sky News' US partner, NBC News. It will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law last year that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied. Mr Biden set a January 2025 deadline for the sale and when ByteDance failed to comply, TikTok went dark for several hours. It returned after Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running on his first day in office. Who's taking over? The internal memo sent to employees on Thursday said the deal allows \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part ‌of a vital global community.\" TikTok owner ByteDance will sell just over 80% of the company's US assets to three major investors, Reuters news agency reports.

        "Content": "By Bethany Minelle and Katie Spencer, arts specialists  Actors have voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning on set in a bid to secure adequate AI protections. Equity - the UK's largest acting union - announced the results of an indicative industrial action ballot on Thursday. With a turnout of over 75%, over 99% of those who voted said they would be prepared to refuse a set scan. There have been growing concerns among actors that their work, voice and likeness are being used without their explicit consent, with Equity pushing for transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage via an enforced industry standard. Announcing the results at Equity's headquarters in Covent Garden, Equity general secretary Paul Fleming said: \"Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity's film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action. \"Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and decades of erosion in terms and conditions begin to be reversed. \"The US streamers and PACT need to step away from the brink, and respect this show of strength. We need adequate AI protections which build on, not merely replicate, those agreed after the SAG-AFTRA strike in the USA over two years ago.\" \n                  OpenAI bags Disney characters for Sora short video app\n                 \n                  Apple's AI chief steps down as company falls behind in tech race\n                 \n                  Bigger than COVID? The graph that explains why AI is going to be so huge\n                 The vote follows unrest in the US in 2023, when members of Equity's sister union, SAG-AFTRA, went on strike for four months over issues including artificial intelligence protections. While nearly all those who voted in the Equity ballot said they would be prepared to take industrial action, Mr Flemming insisted \"industrial action is not an inevitability\". \"It is a choice to be made by the producers,\" he said. 'A big AI sausage machine' The vote came after 18 months of talks with the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact), the trade body representing the majority of film and TV production companies in the UK. While they say they have made significant progress in negotiations on protecting performers' rights when it comes to working with digital replicas (digital copies of real performers) and synthetic performers (artificially generated performers), the use of data, such as recorded performances or digital scans, to train AI systems, remains a sticking point. Mr Flemming said: \"The ball is in [Pact's] court when we return to the table in January.\" He warned that if negotiations did not produce a better AI deal, Equity's next step would be a statutory ballot for industrial action. Speaking to Sky News a little later, Mr Flemming dubbed the current system \"a big AI sausage machine\", saying its members' voice, likeness, and performance data was increasingly being \"used in commercial exploitation by American streamers, and also British independent producers and broadcasters\". Reminiscent of an episode of black comedy Black Mirror, he said that for some of the union's high-profile members, the \"big anxiety is creating entire AI characters of themselves\". Mr Flemming went on: \"We don't want to stop AI. What we want to do is regulated.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent Battle lines drawn. Equity's members have fired a clear warning shot to producers. Just a few years ago, the film and TV industry ground to a halt when actors and writers in the US walked out over AI and pay. While this industrial action stops short of a strike like that, we could in theory, still see substantial delays to productions if Equity performers make good on their threat to refuse to be scanned on set. How often does a scenario like that come up? Equity says it's now happening frequently. As The Crown star Bertie Carvel told me, \"it is one of the first things that happens these days when you go on to a major film set\". He added: \"Why would I collude in that? Well, the answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job.\" And that's the point of this collective stand. It is much harder as an individual to say no. Some have, but many have felt they could not This is a line in the sand. Given the speed of society's move towards AI, Equity knows that if it fails to get this right, it's signing the death warrant on many of its members' careers. If it fails to get the AI demands ironed out now in the small print of new working agreements with producers’ union PACT, it will be too late to demand these protections retrospectively. This indicative ballot might not be a binding decision to take industrial action, but it really does give an idea of the strength of feeling. For now, this is a cliff-hanger of an ending as we wait to see who blinks first - producers or performers? A big moment for the UK's film and TV industry A Pact spokesperson told Sky News: \"The majority of productions don't scan cast. In some types of production (such as those with SFX), scanning has taken place for many years - long before new technologies like Generative AI. Cast are informed when and why they are being scanned - most commonly for editing purposes. Producers abide by the legal requirements for the treatment and storage of scans. \"During the recent negotiations, Pact offered Equity terms on AI consistent with those that are in place in other countries. Equity is asking for future-facing protections that extend beyond the established safeguards already proven to protect actors around the world.\" Pact said discussions between the two bodies would continue. It's the first time such a large section of Equity's membership - over 7,000 performers working across TV and film - has been balloted, and as such is a significant moment for the UK's film and TV industry. As an indicative ballot, it's not binding, nor would it legally cover members who refuse to be digitally scanned on set. It acts as a warning shot to the industry, showing the level of support the union has for action, short of a strike. 'AI can't do creativity' Speaking after the vote, Laurence Olivier Award-winning actor Bertie Carvel, who is an active member of Equity and a member of its screen and new media committee, told Sky News he had voted \"yes\". Explaining how set scanning works, The Crown star, who works across both screen and stage, said: \"You're ushered into a studio, sometimes a mobile pod. I've had it done in the middle of muddy fields on location, surrounded by hundreds of cameras in every direction, 360 degrees. \"Within seconds, thousands of images have been captured that allow for a 3D replica - a computerised model of you to be built. And the question is what happens to that model next.\" Describing feeling obliged to be scanned as \"uncomfortable\", he added: \"I don't want this technology in the world, if I'm honest. It's contributing almost inevitably to my own obsolescence. Why would I collude in that? \"The answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job. And that's why we need to stand together as a union.\" Speaking to Sky News about AI earlier in the day, actor Riz Ahmed, who is currently starring in a modern re-imagining of Shakespeare's Hamlet, said: \"I don't think you can be relaxed about something that's gonna change our lives so dramatically. \"But I do think that, in a way, AI can't do creativity. I think AI can make things, it can make finished products, but without friction, without struggle to get there, things don't have meaning. A frictionless life is a meaningless life.\""

Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressing. Murray Dowey, from Dunblane in Scotland, was just 16 years old when he became a victim of online sextortion in December 2023. His parents, Mark and Ros Dowey, have now launched legal action against Meta in a US court alongside another family amid claims the tech giant failed to protect children on its platforms. Lawyers are alleging the company \"knew of safety features that would prevent sextortion\" but instead \"prioritised profit\". Mrs Dowey told Sky News there is a \"growing army of parents\" who have suffered \"unimaginable pain\" due to social media platforms. She added: \"We've lost the most precious thing. We've got nothing left to lose. \"We will see this through to the end because the worst thing that could happen to us has already happened.\" Meta, which also owns Facebook, branded sextortion a \"horrific crime\" and said it supports law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it. The firm added: \"We continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\" It is believed Murray was exploited by criminals in West Africa, who posed as a young girl. The teenager was tricked into sending intimate images of himself and was told they would be exposed to his family if he failed to pay. Mrs Dowey branded the scammers \"scum\". She added: \"Murray was absolutely fine when he went up to his room that night. He was talking about going to football the next day, talking about his holiday with his friends. \"It literally happened in the space of a few hours in his bedroom where he should have been the safest. \"There was no opportunity for us to intervene or notice something was wrong because he didn't come through for whatever reason. \"He went from absolutely fine to dead the next morning.\" Read more from Sky News:There's one big problem with Australia's social media ban Mrs Dowey described her son as a \"lovely, funny, kind boy who had everything to live for\". The Stirling Albion FC supporter loved going out with his friends and was expected to go on to university after secondary school. Mrs Dowey said: \"We're just all devastated. He's got an older and a younger brother, so he was the middle peacemaker between them. \"Everything we do, we're aware there's a seat empty that should be Murray.

        "Content": "By Bethany Minelle and Katie Spencer, arts specialists  Actors have voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning on set in a bid to secure adequate AI protections. Equity - the UK's largest acting union - announced the results of an indicative industrial action ballot on Thursday. With a turnout of over 75%, over 99% of those who voted said they would be prepared to refuse a set scan. There have been growing concerns among actors that their work, voice and likeness are being used without their explicit consent, with Equity pushing for transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage via an enforced industry standard. Announcing the results at Equity's headquarters in Covent Garden, Equity general secretary Paul Fleming said: \"Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity's film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action. \"Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and decades of erosion in terms and conditions begin to be reversed. \"The US streamers and PACT need to step away from the brink, and respect this show of strength. We need adequate AI protections which build on, not merely replicate, those agreed after the SAG-AFTRA strike in the USA over two years ago.\" \n                  OpenAI bags Disney characters for Sora short video app\n                 \n                  Apple's AI chief steps down as company falls behind in tech race\n                 \n                  Bigger than COVID? The graph that explains why AI is going to be so huge\n                 The vote follows unrest in the US in 2023, when members of Equity's sister union, SAG-AFTRA, went on strike for four months over issues including artificial intelligence protections. While nearly all those who voted in the Equity ballot said they would be prepared to take industrial action, Mr Flemming insisted \"industrial action is not an inevitability\". \"It is a choice to be made by the producers,\" he said. 'A big AI sausage machine' The vote came after 18 months of talks with the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact), the trade body representing the majority of film and TV production companies in the UK. While they say they have made significant progress in negotiations on protecting performers' rights when it comes to working with digital replicas (digital copies of real performers) and synthetic performers (artificially generated performers), the use of data, such as recorded performances or digital scans, to train AI systems, remains a sticking point. Mr Flemming said: \"The ball is in [Pact's] court when we return to the table in January.\" He warned that if negotiations did not produce a better AI deal, Equity's next step would be a statutory ballot for industrial action. Speaking to Sky News a little later, Mr Flemming dubbed the current system \"a big AI sausage machine\", saying its members' voice, likeness, and performance data was increasingly being \"used in commercial exploitation by American streamers, and also British independent producers and broadcasters\". Reminiscent of an episode of black comedy Black Mirror, he said that for some of the union's high-profile members, the \"big anxiety is creating entire AI characters of themselves\". Mr Flemming went on: \"We don't want to stop AI. What we want to do is regulated.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent Battle lines drawn. Equity's members have fired a clear warning shot to producers. Just a few years ago, the film and TV industry ground to a halt when actors and writers in the US walked out over AI and pay. While this industrial action stops short of a strike like that, we could in theory, still see substantial delays to productions if Equity performers make good on their threat to refuse to be scanned on set. How often does a scenario like that come up? Equity says it's now happening frequently. As The Crown star Bertie Carvel told me, \"it is one of the first things that happens these days when you go on to a major film set\". He added: \"Why would I collude in that? Well, the answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job.\" And that's the point of this collective stand. It is much harder as an individual to say no. Some have, but many have felt they could not This is a line in the sand. Given the speed of society's move towards AI, Equity knows that if it fails to get this right, it's signing the death warrant on many of its members' careers. If it fails to get the AI demands ironed out now in the small print of new working agreements with producers’ union PACT, it will be too late to demand these protections retrospectively. This indicative ballot might not be a binding decision to take industrial action, but it really does give an idea of the strength of feeling. For now, this is a cliff-hanger of an ending as we wait to see who blinks first - producers or performers? A big moment for the UK's film and TV industry A Pact spokesperson told Sky News: \"The majority of productions don't scan cast. In some types of production (such as those with SFX), scanning has taken place for many years - long before new technologies like Generative AI. Cast are informed when and why they are being scanned - most commonly for editing purposes. Producers abide by the legal requirements for the treatment and storage of scans. \"During the recent negotiations, Pact offered Equity terms on AI consistent with those that are in place in other countries. Equity is asking for future-facing protections that extend beyond the established safeguards already proven to protect actors around the world.\" Pact said discussions between the two bodies would continue. It's the first time such a large section of Equity's membership - over 7,000 performers working across TV and film - has been balloted, and as such is a significant moment for the UK's film and TV industry. As an indicative ballot, it's not binding, nor would it legally cover members who refuse to be digitally scanned on set. It acts as a warning shot to the industry, showing the level of support the union has for action, short of a strike. 'AI can't do creativity' Speaking after the vote, Laurence Olivier Award-winning actor Bertie Carvel, who is an active member of Equity and a member of its screen and new media committee, told Sky News he had voted \"yes\". Explaining how set scanning works, The Crown star, who works across both screen and stage, said: \"You're ushered into a studio, sometimes a mobile pod. I've had it done in the middle of muddy fields on location, surrounded by hundreds of cameras in every direction, 360 degrees. \"Within seconds, thousands of images have been captured that allow for a 3D replica - a computerised model of you to be built. And the question is what happens to that model next.\" Describing feeling obliged to be scanned as \"uncomfortable\", he added: \"I don't want this technology in the world, if I'm honest. It's contributing almost inevitably to my own obsolescence. Why would I collude in that? \"The answer is because producers will say, unless you do this, we won't give you the job. And that's why we need to stand together as a union.\" Speaking to Sky News about AI earlier in the day, actor Riz Ahmed, who is currently starring in a modern re-imagining of Shakespeare's Hamlet, said: \"I don't think you can be relaxed about something that's gonna change our lives so dramatically. \"But I do think that, in a way, AI can't do creativity. I think AI can make things, it can make finished products, but without friction, without struggle to get there, things don't have meaning. A frictionless life is a meaningless life.\""
