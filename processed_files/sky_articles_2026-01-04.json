        "Content": "A teenager with British citizenship has been confirmed dead after a fire at a bar in Switzerland - as officials say all 40 victims have been identified. Charlotte Niddam previously attended Immanuel College, a private school in Hertfordshire. The 15-year-old is a joint British, Israeli and French national. Dozens were killed and more than 100 people were injured in the fire, which broke out in the early hours of Thursday at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, as people celebrated the New Year. In a post on social media, her family said: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister, Charlotte. \"Details regarding the funeral arrangements will follow shortly. It is most likely on Thursday in Paris. \"Thank you for all your support those last few days.\" Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote on X: \"Terrible news that Charlotte Niddam has been identified as one of those killed in the Crans-Montana fire. My thoughts are with all her family and friends after this devastating loss.\" Some of the 40 victims who lost their lives in the fire have been named, but police say no further information will be released at this time. Those who have been publicly identified include a young boxer named Benjamin Johnson, who \"left us a hero, having come to the aid of his friend\", a social media post from the Swiss Boxing Federation said on Sunday. Another teenager, Tristan Pidoux, has also been reported dead by a spokesperson for the family. Italian 17-year-old Emanuele Galeppini, Italian 16-year-old Chiara Costanzo and Swiss 16-year-old Arthur Brodard have also been named. Mourners attended a mass this morning at the Chapelle Saint-Christophe before joining the silent march up the hill to the Le Constellation bar, the site of the tragedy. Emergency service workers were among those who gathered for the service - led by Bishop Jean-Marie Lovey of Sion - and left flowers at a makeshift memorial. Hundreds of people followed the service on a screen installed outside the church. During the mass, the Rev Gilles Cavin spoke of the \"terrible uncertainty\" for families unsure if their loved ones are among the dead or still alive among the injured. \"We pray for their friends hard-hit by misery on this day that was meant to be one of festivities and friendship,\" he said. Swiss authorities said the process of identifying victims had been difficult because of the severity of the blaze. Earlier, Swiss police gave details about more of the victims who had been identified. Many of them are teenagers - with a 14-year-old among the youngest. Their bodies have been returned to their families.

In her social media post, she thanked those who had shown \"their compassion, their love\" and had shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s. Meanwhile, investigations are continuing into the cause of the fire, focusing on the champagne sparklers lit inside the bar and its ceiling foam, as well as the location and quality of emergency exits. The two managers of the bar, where the fire broke out, are under criminal investigation."

Officers will begin taking electronic devices from people at Manston processing centre in Kent, where they will use on-site technology to download data from them in a bid to gather intelligence. Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people-smuggling networks behind this deadly trade. \"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains. \"These operational measures sit alongside sweeping reforms to the system, to make it less attractive for migrants to come here illegally and remove and deport people faster.\" A total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel last year - the second-highest annual figure on record. The yearly total was 13% higher than the figure for 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023's total of 29,437. It was 9% below the all-time high of 45,774, recorded in 2022. \n                  Angola and Namibia agree to take back illegal migrants and criminals\n                 \n                  Pope and new Archbishop of Canterbury make pleas over Gaza and immigration in Christmas sermons\n                 \n                  End of small boats crossings pause exposes fragility of migration debate\n                 The new powers are hoped to speed up investigations and come after the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December. The government's new law also introduces criminal offences, with anyone found guilty of storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK via the English Channel smuggling route facing up to 14 years in prison. Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats, or researching the best places to buy equipment for dinghies, could be jailed for up to five years.

Labour has rejected this in favour of reforming the treaty to address the issue."

        "Content": "Denmark's leader has urged Donald Trump to stop threatening to take over Greenland after the US president reiterated his wish to do so in a new interview. Mr Trump has long advocated for the mineral-rich island, a self-governing Danish territory, to become part of the United States. Speaking a day after the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, Mr Trump told The Atlantic: \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.\" Follow latest: Handcuffed Venezuelan PM in US custody In a statement issued on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"It makes absolutely no sense to ⁠talk about the US needing to take over Greenland. \"The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in ​the Danish Kingdom.\" Ms Frederiksen continued: \"I would therefore strongly urge the ‌US to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly ​said that they are not for sale.\" Trump comments 'disrespectful', says Greenland leader Greenland's PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen has also criticised Mr Trump's latest comments, labelling them \"disrespectful\". He said in a statement: \"When the President of the United States says ‍that 'we need Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it's not just wrong. It's disrespectful.\" Mr Trump's latest comments came a day after he said Washington will temporarily \"run\" Venezuela following the detention of its hard-left president, Mr Maduro - which has heightened concerns that something similar could happen to Greenland. Why is Trump interested in Greenland?  The US president has long been interested in the States owning Greenland - and once suggested buying it in what would \"essentially [be] a large real estate deal\". The Arctic island's strategic position between Europe and the States makes it a key site for a US ballistic missile defence system. Its mineral wealth is also attractive as the US hopes to reduce its reliance on Chinese exports. Greenland, a former Danish colony, depends heavily ​on Danish subsidies but has the right to declare independence under a 2009 agreement.

        "Content": "Eva Schloss, the stepsister of diarist Anne Frank, has died aged 96. King Charles said he was \"privileged and proud\" to have known Mrs Schloss, who co-founded the Anne Frank Trust UK in 1990. The trust aims to help young people challenge antisemitism and all forms of prejudice through learning from Anne Frank and the Holocaust. The King, who danced with Mrs Schloss at a Jewish community centre in north London in 2022, said he and the Queen \"admired her deeply\". Mrs Schloss, the honorary president of the Anne Frank Trust UK, devoted much of her life to speaking in schools, prisons and on other international platforms. She was made an MBE in 2012 for her services educating people on the perils of prejudice and intolerance. Her death was confirmed in a tribute to the Jewish News, in which her family spoke of their \"great sadness\" at the loss of \"our dear mother, grandmother and great-grandmother\". Read more from Sky News:Mother named as victim of Withernsea drowningTeen educated in UK confirmed dead after Swiss bar fire They remembered her as \"a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace\". The King said in a statement: \"My wife and I are greatly saddened to hear of the death of Eva Schloss. \"The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world. \"We are both privileged and proud to have known her and we admired her deeply. May her memory be a blessing to us all.\" Mrs Schloss, an Austrian Jew, was a teenager when the Nazis invaded, and she left Germany with her family for Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where she became friendly with a young Anne Frank. Anne Frank would posthumously achieve worldwide fame with her diary, published after the war. Due to the worsening situation in the Netherlands, Eva and her family - mother Fritzi, father Erich and brother Heinz - moved from house to house for two years. They were eventually betrayed by a Nazi sympathiser, who took them in, only to give them up. On her 15th birthday they were arrested, brutally interrogated and, in May 1944, forced on to trains to Auschwitz, where Eva and her mother were separated from her father and brother. She would never see her brother again and, although she saw her father briefly several times, after liberation she learned both had died. She later moved to London, where she met and married Zvi Schloss. A year later her mother married Anne Frank's father, Otto. Paying tribute, her family said: \"We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind. \"We are incredibly proud of all that Eva stood for and accomplished, but right now, we are grieving. \"We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy during this difficult time. \"We hope to hold a memorial event at a later date, and will share further details in due course. We thank everyone for the love and respect shown to Eva over the years.\""

        "Content": "Eva Schloss, the stepsister of diarist Anne Frank, has died aged 96. King Charles said he was \"privileged and proud\" to have known Mrs Schloss, who co-founded the Anne Frank Trust UK in 1990. The trust aims to help young people challenge antisemitism and all forms of prejudice through learning from Anne Frank and the Holocaust. The King, who danced with Mrs Schloss at a Jewish community centre in north London in 2022, said he and the Queen \"admired her deeply\". Mrs Schloss, the honorary president of the Anne Frank Trust UK, devoted much of her life to speaking in schools, prisons and on other international platforms. She was made an MBE in 2012 for her services educating people on the perils of prejudice and intolerance. Her death was confirmed in a tribute to the Jewish News, in which her family spoke of their \"great sadness\" at the loss of \"our dear mother, grandmother and great-grandmother\". Read more from Sky News:Mother named as victim of Withernsea drowningTeen educated in UK confirmed dead after Swiss bar fire They remembered her as \"a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace\". The King said in a statement: \"My wife and I are greatly saddened to hear of the death of Eva Schloss. \"The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world. \"We are both privileged and proud to have known her and we admired her deeply. May her memory be a blessing to us all.\" Mrs Schloss, an Austrian Jew, was a teenager when the Nazis invaded, and she left Germany with her family for Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where she became friendly with a young Anne Frank. Anne Frank would posthumously achieve worldwide fame with her diary, published after the war. Due to the worsening situation in the Netherlands, Eva and her family - mother Fritzi, father Erich and brother Heinz - moved from house to house for two years. They were eventually betrayed by a Nazi sympathiser, who took them in, only to give them up. On her 15th birthday they were arrested, brutally interrogated and, in May 1944, forced on to trains to Auschwitz, where Eva and her mother were separated from her father and brother. She would never see her brother again and, although she saw her father briefly several times, after liberation she learned both had died. She later moved to London, where she met and married Zvi Schloss. A year later her mother married Anne Frank's father, Otto. Paying tribute, her family said: \"We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind. \"We are incredibly proud of all that Eva stood for and accomplished, but right now, we are grieving. \"We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy during this difficult time. \"We hope to hold a memorial event at a later date, and will share further details in due course. We thank everyone for the love and respect shown to Eva over the years.\""

Most of the yellow warning areas from Sunday persist into Monday, expiring between 11am and 12 noon.

        "Content": "\n          Chief correspondent\n       We've seen pictures coming out of Caracas of pro-government supporters gathering on the streets to show their solidarity with Nicolas Maduro. I've been asked why opposition supporters aren't out on the streets celebrating his ouster. When I was in Caracas in December, the theory many people from all walks of life put to me was that, if Maduro \"was taken down by the US\", opposition supporters would flood the streets in celebration and in support of a new government - and that would be their \"moment of freedom\". But the reason they aren't out on the streets celebrating is simple: they don't believe anything has significantly changed just yet. There are also no opposition leaders physically in country to coalesce under. Edmundo Gonzalez, the candidate who won a disputed election in July 2024, is believed to be in Spain. Maria Corina Machado - a hugely popular opposition figure in Venezuela - left the country in December after nearly a year in hiding, to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. \n                  Nicolas Maduro is at a jail housing America's 'most unwanted' - and it's far from presidential \n                 \n                  Denmark's PM urges Donald Trump to stop threats to take over Greenland\n                 \n                  Can Trump halt Venezuela's oil production decline?\n                 Although there were moments of euphoria when Maduro was captured in the early hours of Saturday among Venezuelans who do not support the regime, the belief that this was the start of a new chapter for the country soon turned into doubt. When Donald Trump recognised Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, as the one in charge for the interim at his news conference, supporters of the opposition say their doubt was confirmed. Read more from Sky News:Trump and Venezuela's oilMaduro's capture and ChinaWhat next? Fears in Caracas What some outside Venezuela don't necessarily realise, is that Maduro waged a campaign of fear and repression for years and ramped it up after the elections in 2024, arresting and locking up thousands of opposition supporters and political foes, especially key figures who could get people onto the streets. They are still in prison. Opposition supporters are just not taking their chances by going out on the streets to celebrate - or to demand change. They're nervously waiting to see if, under pressure from the US, Ms Rodriguez turns out to be an acceptable off-ramp, a safe pair of hands for a transition until new elections can be held, when they get to vote for whoever they want as their new president."

Mr Trump has long advocated for the mineral-rich island, a self-governing Danish territory, to become part of the United States. Speaking a day after the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, Mr Trump told The Atlantic: \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.\" Follow latest: Handcuffed Venezuelan PM in US custody In a statement issued on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"It makes absolutely no sense to ⁠talk about the US needing to take over Greenland. \"The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in ​the Danish Kingdom.\" Ms Frederiksen continued: \"I would therefore strongly urge the ‌US to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly ​said that they are not for sale.\" Trump comments 'disrespectful', says Greenland leader Greenland's PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen has also criticised Mr Trump's latest comments, labelling them \"disrespectful\". He said in a statement: \"When the President of the United States says ‍that 'we need Greenland' and links us to Venezuela and military intervention, it's not just wrong. It's disrespectful.\" Mr Trump's latest comments came a day after he said Washington will temporarily \"run\" Venezuela following the detention of its hard-left president, Mr Maduro - which has heightened concerns that something similar could happen to Greenland. Why is Trump interested in Greenland?  The US president has long been interested in the States owning Greenland - and once suggested buying it in what would \"essentially [be] a large real estate deal\". The Arctic island's strategic position between Europe and the States makes it a key site for a US ballistic missile defence system. Its mineral wealth is also attractive as the US hopes to reduce its reliance on Chinese exports. Greenland, a former Danish colony, depends heavily ​on Danish subsidies but has the right to declare independence under a 2009 agreement.

        "Content": "By Callum Tennant, news reporter  While many welcomed the fall of Nicolas Maduro - even if they disagreed with the way it came about - Venezuelans in the country's capital aren't expecting quick or radical change. That is the view of Caracas-based journalist Rosali Hernandez, who told Sky News Maduro's regime represented a \"system with many hands, like an octopus\". The reaction from within Venezuela is different from the celebrations seen elsewhere in the world. \"Nobody is celebrating, everyone feels so afraid about what is going to happen next\", Hernandez said. She added Venezuelans are \"living like they're in a cave\", unable to get reliable information after three TV channels were shut down. When people in the country switch on their TV, their only option is Corporacion Venezolana de Television - a state-run television station - where they can watch a stream of speeches by Maduro, she adds. As well as having their news cut off, Hernandez said residents of certain areas of Caracas have suffered power, internet and water outages since the US military operation on Saturday. \n                  US military operation in Colombia 'sounds good', Donald Trump says\n                 \n                  Nicolas Maduro is at a jail housing America's 'most unwanted' - and it's far from presidential \n                 \n                  Opposition supporters aren't celebrating Maduro's departure - and this is why \n                 She has heard reports that some substations exploded and that an important antenna on Caracas's El Volcan hill was damaged in the strikes. On the streets of the capital, 24 hours after the US operation, most places remained closed. Hernandez explained how \"no one is taking control of the situation. So, Venezuelans are going out to see what they can do and what they can buy\". That has led to long queues forming at the few marketplaces, pharmacies and petrol stations that are open. She said people were trying to buy food and medicine now because they know from past experiences that uncertainty and instability tend to linger. Rather than being a militarised city, Caracas is reportedly \"kind of empty\" with a lack of Venezuelan Guard or military on the streets, said Hernandez. Paramilitary groups and irregular armed gangs, known as colectivos, are dispersed in and around the capital. These groups create \"a dangerous situation because the colectivos operate outside of the official forces, so situations can escalate quickly\". In the past, colectivos have been deployed to break up protests and crack down on dissent and political rivals. Hernandez said that where one Caracas neighbourhood ends and another starts is \"like a border\", due to different municipal police running their own checkpoints where their district begins. The strikes and capture of Maduro took everyone by surprise, Hernandez said. However, she argued that around 10 people would have needed to have been captured for any real change to take place. Hernandez said: \"Nicolas Maduro wasn't the strongest pillar of that government network; he was the weakest, he didn't have as much power as others.\" Instead, she points to people like Jorge Rodriguez (head of Venezuela's National Assembly) and Diosdado Cabello Rondon (First Vice President of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela).

She says that \"Venezuelans won't feel like they are free\" while those who are accused of torture and political repression remain in the country. In a recent interview with NBC, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of dealing with the politicians who were left behind after Maduro's exit, and hoped for a \"holistic transition\". Perhaps that's why Trump appeared to dismiss opposition figurehead Maria Corina Machado in a press conference yesterday - revealing he hadn't spoken to her. If that is the White House's plan, then it seems that the octopus government Hernandez described could live on - even after the removal of its Nicolas Maduro arm."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Donald Trump has been unambiguous that Venezuela's huge oil reserves, and the commercial opportunity they represent for American oil companies, were a primary motivation for the removal of President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela has the largest reserves on earth, with an estimated 300 billion barrels lying untapped, equating to 17% of global reserves, and more than Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and more than three times the reserves in the United States. The bulk of Venezuela's oil lies in the central Orinoco belt, south of the Orinoco river, in oilfields covering around 50,000sq km that may be the largest hydrocarbon deposit on the planet. And it is not just how much oil there is, but the type that matters. Venezuelan oil is extra-heavy crude, used for making diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and as a raw material in petro-chemicals. Venezuela crisis: Follow the latest developments Because it's highly viscous - thick and sticky - it's more complex to extract, and requires refinement - but perhaps crucially, while the US does not have large reserves of this kind of crude, it does have refineries that can manage it. Despite its massive reserves, Venezuelan production is relatively puny and has been in decline for decades. \n                  Nicolas Maduro is at a jail housing America's 'most unwanted' - and it's far from presidential \n                 \n                  Denmark's PM urges Donald Trump to stop threats to take over Greenland\n                 \n                  What the capture of Maduro means for China\n                 In the 1960s and 1970s, when, as elsewhere in Latin America and the Middle East, American and British oil companies controlled the industry, production peaked at around 3.5 million barrels a day - around 7% of global output. Following the election of Hugo Chavez and the nationalisation of the industry, production fell, declining further under his successor Nicolas Maduro and plummeting after the imposition of sanctions in 2019. Today, Venezuela produces less than one million barrels a day, almost all of which is exported to China, under exemption as repayment for historic loans, and the United States, which has granted oil major Chevron a licence to operate in the country. Donald Trump says US oil companies will spend billions to reverse that decline, but changing course will take time. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has declined through lack of investment and there has been a brain drain of expertise from the domestic industry under Maduro. Read more:General reveals how US captured MaduroWhy is Trump so interested in Venezuela's oil? Consultants Wood Mackenzie estimate that every additional half a million barrels of extra output will require $15bn-$20bn of investment. For a sense of how long it might take to significantly increase production, we can look to a previous, albeit much larger episode of US adventurism - the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Since the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi production has tripled from around 1.5mn barrels a day to almost 4.5m, but it has taken 20 years, and the wider conflict came at an enormous cost to regional stability. The more immediate question is what impact regime change in Venezuela will have on the oil price when markets reopen this week. Given the uncertainty over who is really in charge in Caracas, some volatility would not be a surprise, but the US seizure of Venezuelan tankers before Christmas had limited impact. Oil prices have been falling for a year, down around 20% in 2025 as global demand decreased as economies slowed, leading to over-supply. It's likely that the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will have more impact on prices than the promise of more Venezuelan crude in decades to come Whatever happens to markets in the short term, the broader question of whether American involvement in the oil trade amounts to a colonial asset grab, or will ultimately benefit the Venezuelan people, will take longer to resolve."

        "Content": "A teenager with British citizenship has been confirmed dead after a fire at a bar in Switzerland - as officials say all 40 victims have been identified. Charlotte Niddam previously attended Immanuel College, a private school in Hertfordshire. The 15-year-old is a joint British, Israeli and French national. Dozens were killed and more than 100 people were injured in the fire, which broke out in the early hours of Thursday at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, as people celebrated the New Year. In a post on social media, her family said: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister, Charlotte. \"Details regarding the funeral arrangements will follow shortly. It is most likely on Thursday in Paris. \"Thank you for all your support those last few days.\" Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote on X: \"Terrible news that Charlotte Niddam has been identified as one of those killed in the Crans-Montana fire. My thoughts are with all her family and friends after this devastating loss.\" Some of the 40 victims who lost their lives in the fire have been named, but police say no further information will be released at this time. Those who have been publicly identified include a young boxer named Benjamin Johnson, who \"left us a hero, having come to the aid of his friend\", a social media post from the Swiss Boxing Federation said on Sunday. Another teenager, Tristan Pidoux, has also been reported dead by a spokesperson for the family. Italian 17-year-old Emanuele Galeppini, Italian 16-year-old Chiara Costanzo and Swiss 16-year-old Arthur Brodard have also been named. Mourners attended a mass this morning at the Chapelle Saint-Christophe before joining the silent march up the hill to the Le Constellation bar, the site of the tragedy. Emergency service workers were among those who gathered for the service - led by Bishop Jean-Marie Lovey of Sion - and left flowers at a makeshift memorial. Hundreds of people followed the service on a screen installed outside the church. During the mass, the Rev Gilles Cavin spoke of the \"terrible uncertainty\" for families unsure if their loved ones are among the dead or still alive among the injured. \"We pray for their friends hard-hit by misery on this day that was meant to be one of festivities and friendship,\" he said. Swiss authorities said the process of identifying victims had been difficult because of the severity of the blaze. Earlier, Swiss police gave details about more of the victims who had been identified. Many of them are teenagers - with a 14-year-old among the youngest. Their bodies have been returned to their families.

In her social media post, she thanked those who had shown \"their compassion, their love\" and had shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s. Meanwhile, investigations are continuing into the cause of the fire, focusing on the champagne sparklers lit inside the bar and its ceiling foam, as well as the location and quality of emergency exits. The two managers of the bar, where the fire broke out, are under criminal investigation."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n The seizure of Nicolas Maduro takes the world into new territory. Geopolitics is about to become weirder and potentially a lot more dangerous. America's president has justified seizing the leader of a sovereign nation by drawing on the US foreign policy of the 1830s - and he says the US will now be running Venezuela for the foreseeable future. Venezuela crisis: Follow the latest developments To understand what is going on, get your head around the following phrase: the Donroe Doctrine. It is obscure, but crucial to working out what has just happened - and what is likely to come next. Doing so requires a short history lesson. In the 1830s, then US president James Monroe had a doctrine named after him. It declared the Americas should be a US sphere of influence. Stay out of our backyard with your colonial ventures, it warned Europeans in particular. The Monroe Doctrine has been the stuff of history books for two centuries - but at the end of last year, it was brought back to life by the White House. Its new national security strategy referred to the Monroe Doctrine, but added what it called a \"Trump Corollary\": the US would not sit idly by, it said, while hostile or criminal neighbours operated and practised \"chronic wrongdoing\". And now, Donald Trump has now framed his capture of Maduro in the same light. \"We have superseded it by a lot,\" he said of the Monroe Doctrine. \"They now call it the 'Donroe Doctrine'. American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.\" The early 19th century may soon be calling and asking for its foreign policy back. Read more:Why is Trump interested in Venezuela's oil?Analysis: Maduro's rule was disastrous The Donroe Doctrine - \"Don\" referring to Mr Trump - has started with Venezuela but may well not stop there. There are plenty more hostile or criminal neighbours for Mr Trump to go after in America's backyard: the cartels of Mexico, the corrupt failing regime in Cuba, the cocaine laboratories in Colombia. Mr Trump may consider all of them fair game. Who might he go after next?"

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a transition can take place - and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.  Speaking to reporters hours after Nicolas Maduro and his wife were captured, Mr Trump declared that \"very large\" American oil firms would spend billions of dollars to fix \"badly broken infrastructure\" in the South American country. Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world - and the president has claimed US occupation \"won't cost a penny\" as the country will be reimbursed from \"money coming out of the ground\". Only one US energy company, Chevron, continues to operate in Venezuela. Venezuela crisis: Follow the latest developments What is the situation right now? At the moment, a US embargo on all Venezuelan oil is in full effect. And while Mr Trump eventually wants to get \"oil flowing\", analysts have warned that a lack of infrastructure and investment means this ambition could take years to realise. \"There are still many questions that need to be answered about the state of the Venezuelan oil industry, but it is clear that it ⁠will take tens of billions of dollars to turn that industry around,\" Third Bridge's Peter McNally said. Despite these logistical hurdles, Mr Trump has vowed \"to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago\". A Chevron spokesperson said: \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\" Another US oil giant, ConocoPhillips, said it is \"monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability\". A spokesman added: \"It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Other industry leaders - including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, TotalEnergies and Saudi Aramco - are yet to make their positions clear. Why does Trump want access to Venezuela's oil?  As our economics and data editor Ed Conway explained last month, the US is the world's biggest oil producer by a country mile. However, it produces light crude - as opposed to the heavy stuff needed to feed its refineries. In other words, if the US is going to keep its cars fed with gasoline, it needs heavy, gloopy crude, as that's what most of its refineries are set up to process. And since it costs many, many billions of dollars to overhaul refineries, no one particularly wants to do that anytime soon. The upshot is that for all that America theoretically pumps more crude oil than it would ever need out of its own territories, it is still totally dependent on trade to meet its demands for heavy oil. Most American crude is exported overseas. And America imports well over 6,000 barrels of oil a day to feed its refineries in Texas and Louisiana with the heavy stuff they can digest. All of which brings us to Venezuela, because it is, alongside Canada and Russia, sitting on the world's biggest reserves of heavy oil.

Figures from the Energy Institute suggest that Venezuela holds about 17% of global oil reserves - equivalent to 303 billion barrels. While the country was producing up to 3.5 million barrels a day back in the 1970s, this figure slumped to an average of just 1.1 million a day last year - equivalent to just 1% of production worldwide. The US was once the main buyer of Venezuelan oil - but since sanctions were imposed, China has become the main destination. Corruption and underfunding go some way to explaining why Venezuela has not been able to leverage its reserves in the way Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia have. And while some Western oil companies have remained active in the country, sanctions have prevented Venezuela from attracting investment and obtaining the equipment it needs. Its reserves are made up mostly of heavy oil in Orinoco in central Venezuela, making its crude expensive to produce, but technically relatively simple, according to the US government's energy department."

Sky News has learnt that GetYourGuide, which is based in Berlin, is in talks with investment banks to advise on a secondary share offering that would take place in the coming months. Industry sources said on Sunday that a decision to proceed had yet to be formally taken, and that there was no pressure from the company's investors to do so. GetYourGuide, which counts the SoftBank Vision Fund among its investors, said in October that it was approaching €1bn (£871m) in annual revenue and had become profitable for the first time. \"After two years being locked down, experiences were the one thing that people wanted to do,\" Johannes Reck, chief executive, said after the pandemic. \"We were ready for that and we rode on that wave.\" The company last raised new capital in 2023, when the Singaporean state fund Temasek and private equity giant KKR participated in a $194m equity and debt funding round. That capital-raising was said to value GetYourGuide at $2bn, and any new secondary share sale is likely to be priced at a premium to that valuation. It said that customers had booked more than 10 million experiences on its platform in a single quarter last year - its most active to date. A spokesman for GetYourGuide declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Donald Trump has been unambiguous that Venezuela's huge oil reserves, and the commercial opportunity they represent for American oil companies, were a primary motivation for the removal of President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela has the largest reserves on earth, with an estimated 300 billion barrels lying untapped, equating to 17% of global reserves, and more than Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and more than three times the reserves in the United States. The bulk of Venezuela's oil lies in the central Orinoco belt, south of the Orinoco river, in oilfields covering around 50,000sq km that may be the largest hydrocarbon deposit on the planet. And it is not just how much oil there is, but the type that matters. Venezuelan oil is extra-heavy crude, used for making diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and as a raw material in petro-chemicals. Venezuela crisis: Follow the latest developments Because it's highly viscous - thick and sticky - it's more complex to extract, and requires refinement - but perhaps crucially, while the US does not have large reserves of this kind of crude, it does have refineries that can manage it. Despite its massive reserves, Venezuelan production is relatively puny and has been in decline for decades. \n                  Nicolas Maduro is at a jail housing America's 'most unwanted' - and it's far from presidential \n                 \n                  Denmark's PM urges Donald Trump to stop threats to take over Greenland\n                 \n                  What the capture of Maduro means for China\n                 In the 1960s and 1970s, when, as elsewhere in Latin America and the Middle East, American and British oil companies controlled the industry, production peaked at around 3.5 million barrels a day - around 7% of global output. Following the election of Hugo Chavez and the nationalisation of the industry, production fell, declining further under his successor Nicolas Maduro and plummeting after the imposition of sanctions in 2019. Today, Venezuela produces less than one million barrels a day, almost all of which is exported to China, under exemption as repayment for historic loans, and the United States, which has granted oil major Chevron a licence to operate in the country. Donald Trump says US oil companies will spend billions to reverse that decline, but changing course will take time. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has declined through lack of investment and there has been a brain drain of expertise from the domestic industry under Maduro. Read more:General reveals how US captured MaduroWhy is Trump so interested in Venezuela's oil? Consultants Wood Mackenzie estimate that every additional half a million barrels of extra output will require $15bn-$20bn of investment. For a sense of how long it might take to significantly increase production, we can look to a previous, albeit much larger episode of US adventurism - the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Since the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi production has tripled from around 1.5mn barrels a day to almost 4.5m, but it has taken 20 years, and the wider conflict came at an enormous cost to regional stability. The more immediate question is what impact regime change in Venezuela will have on the oil price when markets reopen this week. Given the uncertainty over who is really in charge in Caracas, some volatility would not be a surprise, but the US seizure of Venezuelan tankers before Christmas had limited impact. Oil prices have been falling for a year, down around 20% in 2025 as global demand decreased as economies slowed, leading to over-supply. It's likely that the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will have more impact on prices than the promise of more Venezuelan crude in decades to come Whatever happens to markets in the short term, the broader question of whether American involvement in the oil trade amounts to a colonial asset grab, or will ultimately benefit the Venezuelan people, will take longer to resolve."
