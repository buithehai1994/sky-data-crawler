        "Content": " The UK-US trade deal has been signed and is \"done\", US President Donald Trump has said as he met Sir Keir Starmer at the G7 summit. The US president told reporters in Canada: \"We signed it, and it's done. It's a fair deal for both. It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.\" Sir Keir said the document \"implements\" the deal to cut tariffs on cars and aerospace, describing it as a \"really important agreement\". \"So this is a very good day for both of our countries - a real sign of strength,\" the prime minister added. Mr Trump added that the UK was \"very well protected\" against any future tariffs, saying: \"You know why? Because I like them\". However, he did not say whether levies on British steel exports to the US would be set to 0%, saying \"we're gonna let you have that information in a little while\". The government says the US \"has committed\" to removing tariffs (taxes on imported goods) on UK aerospace goods, such as engines and aircraft parts, which currently stand at 10%. That is \"expected to come into force by the end of the month\".\n\n Tariffs on car imports will drop from 27.5% to 10%, the government says, which \"saves car manufacturers hundreds of millions a year, and protects tens of thousands of jobs\". The White House says there will be a quote of 100,000 cars eligible for import at that level each year. But on steel, the story is a little more complicated.\n The UK is the only country exempted from the global 50% tariff rate on steel - which means the UK rate remains at the original level of 25%. That tariff was expected to be lifted entirely, but the government now says it will \"continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\".\n The White House says the US will \"promptly construct a quota at most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminium articles\". Other key parts of the deal include import and export quotas for beef - and the government is keen to emphasise that \"any US imports will need to meet UK food safety standards\". There is no change to tariffs on pharmaceuticals for the moment, and the government says \"work will continue to protect industry from any further tariffs imposed\". The White House says they \"committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes\". Mr Trump also praised Sir Keir as a \"great\" prime minister, adding: \"We've been talking about this deal for six years, and he's done what they haven't been able to do.\" He added: \"We're very longtime partners and allies and friends and we've become friends in a short period of time. \"He's slightly more liberal than me to put it mildly... but we get along.\" Sir Keir added that \"we make it work\". As the pair exited a mountain lodge in the Canadian Rockies where the summit is being held, Mr Trump held up a physical copy of the trade agreement to show reporters. Several leaves of paper fell from the binding, and Sir Keir quickly stooped to pick them up, saying: \"A very important document.\" The US president also appeared to mistakenly refer to a \"trade agreement with the European Union\" at one point as he stood alongside the British prime minister. Mr Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries in April. At the time, he announced 10% \"reciprocal\" rates on all UK exports - as well as separately announced 25% levies on cars and steel.

Ahead of the G7 summit, the prime minister said he would meet Mr Trump for \"one-on-one\" talks, and added the agreement \"really matters for the vital sectors that are safeguarded under our deal, and we've got to implement that\"."

        "Content": " Ignoring the ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators gives racists \"more ammunition\", the author of a new report has said. Baroness Louise Casey told Sky News' Politics with Sophy Ridge there was a particular issue with some British Asian men that was \"abundantly clear\" in data analysed from three police forces; West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester; which showed a \"disproportionately\" in child sexual exploitation. Politics latest: Reaction to 'damning' grooming gangs report But she added: \"Just to give some sort of balance, in Greater Manchester I asked for data on child sexual exploitation that took me to Asian heritage. I asked for data on child abuse and that took me to the general population, which is largely white.\" Baroness Casey said \"if we just establish the facts, then you can take the pain out of this\". \"I think you've got sort of do-gooders that don't really want this to be found because, you know, 'Oh, God, then all the racists are going to be more racist',\" she added. \"Well, actually, people that are racist are going to use this anyway. All you're doing with the hate mongers and the racists is giving them more ammunition.\" Asked if people were worried about being seen as racist, the cross-bench peer said she came across direct examples of this in Rotherham - one of the towns at the centre of the grooming gangs scandal. \"I was following through on a children's file in archive and found the word 'Pakistani' tippexed out,\" Baroness Casey said. \"I thought whoever did that inadvertently was giving ammunition to the English Defence League that were every week, in and out, campaigning and doing their stuff in that town. \"I think the problem is that people are worried about being called racist.... if good people don't grasp difficult things, bad people will, and that's why we have to do it as a society.\"  The government has announced there will be a full statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, as recommended by Baroness Casey's report. The government has also accepted her recommendations to introduce compulsory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in grooming cases, and for a review of police records to launch new criminal investigations into historic child sexual exploitation cases. Baroness Casey was asked to produce an audit of sexual abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales, looking specifically at the issue of ethnicity and the cultural and social drivers for this type of offending. This had never before been done despite multiple local reviews into child sexual exploitation and a seven-year national inquiry into child abuse more generally, known as the Jay Review, which concluded in 2022. The government had previously resisted calls for an inquiry into grooming gangs, after a row with tech billionaire Elon Musk brought the issue back into the spotlight in January, saying it would implement the recommendations of the Jay Review that the Tories didn't. However it changed its position following Baroness Casey's findings. Read more:Officials tried to cover up grooming scandal, says CummingsWhy many victims welcome national inquiry into grooming gangsGrooming gangs scandal timeline She found that flawed data has been used repeatedly to dismiss claims about \"Asian grooming gangs\". Having examined local data in three police force areas, she found \"disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds\" are among suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation, as well as a \"significant number of perpetrators of Asian ethnicity\" who have been identified in local reviews and child sexual exploitation prosecutions across the country. She said all of this warranted further examination, insisting to Sophy Ridge that the decision was not political.  ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Baroness Casey has also called for a tightening of the laws around the age of consent so that any penetrative sexual activity with a child under 16 is classified as rape, which the government has also accepted. She told Sophy Ridge that some perpetrators waited until their victims turned 13 as then it is \"much harder to prosecute for rape\". She said: \"I think we have to be really clear in society that children are children and I don't see the difference between, you know, a four-year-old and a 14-year-old. If somebody is doing to them... what I talk about in my report, it's rape and we need to call it for what it is.\""

Close by, huddled under an arched courtyard, women of all ages are sitting, grieving in their own way. Some are sobbing, others look dazed, others desperate. Their intermittent wails of grief puncture the silence. Yet there's a beautiful stillness about it all.

Layan Diab, 23, is a cousin of the girls. She's in disbelief. \"It's a deep loss. It hurts my soul. We lost our entire family. Four people here. I can't fathom it. I don't understand. It's unbelievable,\" she says. And she's fearful of the coming days. \"Every time we hear the sirens, people start to scream and remember,\" she says. Just down the street is the girls' grieving father, Raja Khatib. A doctor with a charming warmth, he starts to speak Italian, assuming we may be from Italy. He'd just returned from a holiday there with his wife and children in Ferrara. His eyes fill with tears as he says that if only he'd stayed a day longer, they would all be alive today. 'I feel terrible. I feel fire in my bodyâ€¦ I hope that I will survive this moment. I've lost my family, but for what?

When the alarms started to sound, they dismissed them at first. But after a loud boom, Razan was unsettled and started to make her way to one of the safe rooms, imploring Shada to do the same. But only Razan went.  \"In one moment, everything went dark. I couldn't see anything. I asked Allah, please don't take my life,\" she describes with searing clarity. She could hear her father calling out for them all. But his cries were met with silence. Razan's family home is now a mound of rubble. When we arrive there, we find neighbours and friends clearing the rubble. Many are deeply traumatised. Ammad, who's sweeping debris outside the house opposite, tells me he saw body parts flung across the road and into a nearby garden, and there's blood on the walls. It is a deeply visceral and harrowing account of an attack that took everyone by surprise. This is a residential neighbourhood. It's thought the missile was bound for Haifa, more than an hour away and home to oil refineries. But this time, with this missile, it fell on civilians. And took with it, futures."

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A nursery worker has been convicted of mistreating 21 children in her care after she was caught on CCTV pinching, punching and kicking her victims. Prosecutors said the scale of the abuse was \"staggering\" and Roksana Lecka \"showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment\" of children over a six-month period at the Riverside Nursery in Twickenham, southwest London. The nursery charged parents up to Â£1,900 a month to look after youngsters, aged between 18 months and two years, and followed the Montessori method of teaching, which involves allowing children to pursue their natural interests and activities. Lecka, 22, admitted seven charges of child cruelty and was found guilty of 14 further counts by a jury after a trial at Kingston Crown Court. She was cleared of three other charges. One conviction related to a child at another nursery that Lecka worked at in Hounslow, west London, in 2023. The jury heard there were no concerns raised when Lecka applied for a job at the Twickenham nursery, which has now closed, with references from another nursery and two families for whom she had babysat. But it was discovered she had \"badly treated\" children after a CCTV trawl when a colleague raised the alarm, the court heard. There were gasps from parents in the public gallery - some who were watching the footage for the first time - as it was played in court at the start of the trial. Children could be seen crying and flinching as they were repeatedly pinched and scratched on their arms, legs and stomachs by Lecka - with some attacked dozens of times in a day. Defendant 'addicted to vapes and smoked cannabis' In one clip, she was seen kicking a child on the floor, while others show her pushing children headfirst over cots, shoving one on to a mattress in the sleep room and aggressively covering a toddler's mouth as he started to cry. Prosecutors said Lecka could be seen vaping in another clip before taking a baby from a crib, who she was later filmed pinching and punching her side. Giving evidence, the nursery worker said she would regularly smoke cannabis with her boyfriend and was addicted to vapes. Prosecutor Tracy Ayling KC told the jury Lecka was \"looking around at other members of staff and who is watching when these assaults occur\". The Metropolitan Police released bodycam footage of the moment Lecka was arrested at her home in Hounslow, west London, and a clip of her answering \"no comment\" to questions from detectives about the injuries to the children. She said in a prepared statement: \"I deny assaulting any children at the Riverside Nursery.... I went into work that day and had a normal day. There were no accidents where any child seemed hurt. \"We have procedures for the handling of the children, which I adhered to. I am unaware how any injury to these children were caused.\" 'Sheer scale of abuse is staggering' Lawyer Jemma Till, from Irwin Mitchell, a legal firm representing some of the parents of the victims, said: \"The families we represent are not only deeply shocked but also traumatised by what their children have endured. \"This is sadly yet another devastating case where children have suffered at the hands of someone in a position of trust. \"Whilst Lecka's actions have been stopped, the consequences of those actions are likely to affect families for many years. Nothing can undo what has happened but it's now vital that lessons are learned, and where appropriate, measures introduced to prevent other children being harmed.\" Senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor Gemma Burns said: \"Lecka repeatedly showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment of these babies. \"No parent should have to fear leaving their child in the care of professionals, but the sheer scale of her abuse is staggering.\" She added: \"Lecka was placed in a position of trust and her job required her to provide safety and protection. Instead, she kicked, scratched, and pinched these young children, with this vile abuse of vulnerable victims continuing for many months.\" Read more from Sky News:Dig for remains of 800 infants beginsHuman leg found on UK beach Detective Sergeant Geoff Boye said officers reviewed more than 300 hours of CCTV footage during the investigation to reveal Lecka's \"prolific\" offending. It included \"pinching and grabbing children, dropping babies into their cots and on one occasion, she delivered several kicks to a young boy to the face and stepped on his shoulder,\" the officer said. Detective Inspector Sian Hutchings added: \"These families left their children in Lecka's care, trusting her to take protect their children as well as the other staff at the nurseries clearly did. \"The footage of her offences against defenceless children was disturbing.\" Lecka will be sentenced on 26 September."

Dr Salvador Plasencia, who will admit to four counts of distribution of ketamine, faces up to a maximum of 40 years in prison. He is among five people charged in connection with the death of Friends star Perry, 54, whose body was found in his hot tub by his assistant in October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine and other factors caused him to lose consciousness and drown. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal treatment for depression, but had begun seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. Plasencia is accused of supplying the bulk of Perry's ketamine in his final weeks. He and three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for their cooperation.

Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing.

A failure to act risks leaving the government facing what they described as a \"global conflict crisis\" with \"one hand tied behind its back\". The letter to Sir Keir Starmer, shared with Sky News, said violent conflict is impacting more countries across the globe than at any time since the Second World War. \"They are disrupting economies and diverting the world's attention away from human rights, climate change and gender equality,\" according to the letter, signed by, among others, Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller and Lord Jonathan Evans, former director generals of MI5, and Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser.  \"To durably strengthen national security, therefore, the government must invest not just in defence, but also in development and diplomacy.\" The group is not calling on the prime minister to reverse a decision to shrink the overseas aid budget to 0.3% of GDP from 0.5% by 2027 to fund an increase in defence spending. Instead, they are focused on the proportion of the diminished international development budget that is spent on conflict prevention and peacebuilding. \n                  British soldier arrested on suspicion of raping woman in Kenya\n                 \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Military clerk faces jail after nearly Â£1m Ministry of Defence fraud\n                 The ratio had been 4% of total overseas aid spending in 2018. But the level has shrunk to between 1 and 1.5% today, according to Lord Jack McConnell, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding, which organised the letter. The group wants the proportion to be returned to the equivalent of 4%. \"Without this, the UK might risk facing the global conflict crisis with one hand tied behind its back,\" the letter warned. The signatories said they would like to see an all-of-government approach to tackling violent conflict to be included in an upcoming national security strategy, which is due to be published before a NATO summit next week.

Conflict prevention and resolution efforts that the UK has in the past championed include helping to secure peace agreements in the Philippines, Colombia and Ethiopia. Another initiative is the \"Women, Peace and Security\" agenda. \"We are gravely concerned that these initiatives may disappear amidst cuts to the aid budget,\" the letter said. \"This would be a false economy, as conflicts left to escalate and spread will lead to further insecurity, forced displacement and humanitarian crises to which the armed forces and aid agencies must respond.\""

Her clothes had been kept in police storage for decades. The prosecution said that Ms Dunne was found by neighbours inside her home in the Easton area of the city after returning from a friend's house. They described how she was discovered lying on her back on a pile of old clothes, with blood coming from her and vomit in her mouth. \"She was fully dressed, but her knickers were around her ankles, and a nylon type stocking was lying across her neck,\" added Mrs Vigars. At the time, police found her house had been broken into and a sash window had been forced open, with a palm print discovered. The investigation in 1967 took thousands of palm prints from local males, but no match was found. A post-mortem examination at the time found she had \"extensive abrasions\" on her face and that the most likely explanation was that a hand had been pressed against her mouth. An intimate swab tested positive for semen, but DNA testing was not available at the time. The jury heard that Headley, who appeared in the dock wearing a red jumper, had already pleaded guilty of raping two other elderly women, just weeks apart in 1977. One victim, an 84-year-old woman, said she would scream, and he replied to her: \"If you do that, that will be worse for you.\" Mrs Vigars outlined to the court that Headley told the other victim, a 79-year-old, he had a gun, saying: \"If you do what I tell you, you will be all right, if not, I will kill you. Do not scream or make a noise or I will kill you.\" Read more from Sky News:Girl, 13, charged with riotingNursery worker convicted of mistreating childrenUK could see 32C this week with heatwave The prosecution said the offences demonstrated that Headley had \"a tendency\" to act in the same way that he allegedly did in 1967. \"In other words, to break into people's homes at night and, in some cases, to target an elderly woman living alone, to have sex with her despite her attempts to fend him off, and to threaten violence,\" the prosecution added. Headley denies raping and murdering Ms Dunne. The trial at Bristol Crown Court is due to last up to three weeks."

        "Content": "At least 34 Palestinians have been shot dead near food distribution centres in Gaza, according to the health ministry. It said 33 people were killed trying to reach a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) centre near Rafah, while another person died heading to an aid hub in the central Gaza Strip. Israeli troops had opened fire as they attempted to control the crowds early on Monday close to the Rafah site, two witnesses said. The number of deaths in shootings was the highest reported daily total since the Israeli and US-backed aid centres opened in May, as thousands of Palestinians move through Israeli military-controlled areas to get to them. Latest updates: Israel strikes Iranian state media studio The ministry added on Monday that four other people who were not trying to reach distribution centres were killed elsewhere. It claims hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more injured since the GHF centres opened.

Fiona MacDonald, of Cross Arthurlie Primary School in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, raised concerns following a P7 leavers' event last week which was attended by parents and carers. In her letter, Ms MacDonald said the use of a Union Flag featuring staff images \"caused some upset at the beginning of the evening\". She added: \"As a school we promote inclusion and acceptance, actively working against potentially offensive or sectarian messaging. \"Although we recognise this was not the intent, we are concerned that others within or beyond the school community may consider that this is something we would encourage.\" The headteacher said she had spoken to the children to explain \"why it wasn't a good idea\" to use images without permission.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A juror has been dismissed from the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex-trafficking trial after hearing five weeks of evidence. Judge Arun Subramanian said he had \"concerns\" about the jury member's \"candour\" and made the decision after it emerged the man - Juror 6 - had given inconsistent answers about where he lives. This could indicate he potentially had an agenda, that he wanted to be on the panel hearing the Combs trial for a purpose, the judge said, and there was nothing the juror could say that would \"put the genie back in the bottle\". Diddy trial: Day 24 - as it happened Questions over whether the juror, a black male, resided in New York or across the Hudson River in the state of New Jersey first arose at the end of last week - but defence lawyers argued dismissing him would disrupt the diversity of the jury. However, the judge rejected this argument ahead of the start of Monday's court session, excusing the juror and replacing him with one of the alternates, a white male. A review of the juror's answers to questions about his residency during jury selection, along with his subsequent responses to similar questions, revealed \"clear inconsistencies\", the judge said. \"Taking these all together, the record raised serious concerns as to the juror's candour and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury,\" Judge Subramanian said. Leaving the juror on the panel could threaten the integrity of the judicial process, he added. \"The court should not, indeed cannot, let race factor into the decision of what happens. Here, the answer is clear. Juror number six is excused,\" Judge Subramanian said. Sean 'Diddy' Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex-trafficking, and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has strenuously denied all allegations of sexual abuse. The hip-hop mogul's defence team has described him as \"a complicated man\" but say the case is not. They have conceded Combs could be violent and that jurors might not condone his proclivity for \"kinky sex\". However, they argue this was a consensual \"swingers\" lifestyle and was not illegal. Special agent and paralegal testify Following the juror's dismissal, the sixth week of the trial began - with testimony from a paralegal specialist and a special agent, who both gave evidence as summary witnesses. This means they were not involved in the criminal investigation into Combs, but were tasked with reviewing some evidence, including charts, phone records and data. In court, the aim is to provide context to the testimony heard so far and how it relates to the charges against the hip-hop mogul. During paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar's testimony, the court heard about texts appearing to reference \"freak offs\" - sexual encounters with male escorts which former girlfriends Cassie Ventura and \"Jane\", two of three alleged victims to give evidence during the trial, both say Combs forced them into. Cassie was in an on-off relationship with Combs from 2007 to 2018, while Jane - a pseudonym - dated him on and off from the beginning of 2021 to his arrest in September 2024. Chicken soup and $4,000 cash In messages from March 2016, Combs's then chief of staff Kristina Khorram appeared to ask an assistant to set a hotel room up, with items requested including Gatorade, water and chicken noodle soup. \"He wants you to go right away now please,\" a message said. In another text, Khorram asked workers to fetch $4,000 in cash and to ensure a male escort was given access to the hotel room, the court heard. The court also heard about messages sent around the time of the bombshell civil lawsuit filed against Combs by Cassie in November 2023 - which was settled within 24 hours for a then undisclosed sum, revealed to be $20m during the trial. By this time, Combs was seeing Jane. According to an audio file of a conversation, Jane told Combs after finding out about Cassie's lawsuit: \"I don't know what I'm feeling... this is so word for word, it is crazy and it just feels sick to my stomach.\" On 28 November 2023, about two weeks later, Jane told Combs she felt he exploited her with their \"dark and humiliating lifestyle\". The following month, the court heard Jane said in a message to Khorram: \"He said he would expose me and send videos to my baby daddy... I am traumatised by my time with him.\" Jane said she would not normally involve Khorram in such matters, but told her she needed help as Combs was having one of his \"evil-ass psychotic bipolar\" episodes. Jane told Khorram that she was heavily drugged in the tapes. Although it was not clear exactly what she was referencing, a message sent to Combs by Khorram around the time of the lawsuit seemed to show some friction between the pair. \"If you cannot be honest with me this doesn't work,\" she told him, according to the messages. Combs \"keeping things\" to himself put them in the \"situation we are all in right now\", she added. Towards the end of the court day, videos entered into evidence under seal were played by the prosecution. This means the jury and lawyers could see and hear what was happening, but members of the public in court could not. Read more:Everything you need to know about the trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat we learned from Cassie's testimony Prosecutors have said they expect to conclude their case later this week. After this, Combs's defence team will begin theirs. Last week, Kanye West turned up at the court in Manhattan, New York, to support the rapper, spending about 40 minutes in the building watching proceedings on a monitor in an overflow room. Combs's mother, Janice Combs, and several of his children have also consistently shown up throughout the hearing. Diddy denies charges of sex-trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy. The trial continues."

        "Content": " The UK-US trade deal has been signed and is \"done\", US President Donald Trump has said as he met Sir Keir Starmer at the G7 summit. The US president told reporters in Canada: \"We signed it, and it's done. It's a fair deal for both. It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.\" Sir Keir said the document \"implements\" the deal to cut tariffs on cars and aerospace, describing it as a \"really important agreement\". \"So this is a very good day for both of our countries - a real sign of strength,\" the prime minister added. Mr Trump added that the UK was \"very well protected\" against any future tariffs, saying: \"You know why? Because I like them\". However, he did not say whether levies on British steel exports to the US would be set to 0%, saying \"we're gonna let you have that information in a little while\". The government says the US \"has committed\" to removing tariffs (taxes on imported goods) on UK aerospace goods, such as engines and aircraft parts, which currently stand at 10%. That is \"expected to come into force by the end of the month\".\n\n Tariffs on car imports will drop from 27.5% to 10%, the government says, which \"saves car manufacturers hundreds of millions a year, and protects tens of thousands of jobs\". The White House says there will be a quote of 100,000 cars eligible for import at that level each year. But on steel, the story is a little more complicated.\n The UK is the only country exempted from the global 50% tariff rate on steel - which means the UK rate remains at the original level of 25%. That tariff was expected to be lifted entirely, but the government now says it will \"continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\".\n The White House says the US will \"promptly construct a quota at most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminium articles\". Other key parts of the deal include import and export quotas for beef - and the government is keen to emphasise that \"any US imports will need to meet UK food safety standards\". There is no change to tariffs on pharmaceuticals for the moment, and the government says \"work will continue to protect industry from any further tariffs imposed\". The White House says they \"committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes\". Mr Trump also praised Sir Keir as a \"great\" prime minister, adding: \"We've been talking about this deal for six years, and he's done what they haven't been able to do.\" He added: \"We're very longtime partners and allies and friends and we've become friends in a short period of time. \"He's slightly more liberal than me to put it mildly... but we get along.\" Sir Keir added that \"we make it work\". As the pair exited a mountain lodge in the Canadian Rockies where the summit is being held, Mr Trump held up a physical copy of the trade agreement to show reporters. Several leaves of paper fell from the binding, and Sir Keir quickly stooped to pick them up, saying: \"A very important document.\" The US president also appeared to mistakenly refer to a \"trade agreement with the European Union\" at one point as he stood alongside the British prime minister. Mr Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries in April. At the time, he announced 10% \"reciprocal\" rates on all UK exports - as well as separately announced 25% levies on cars and steel.

        "Content": "\n          Home editor\n              @JasonFarrellSky\n  Flawed data has been used repeatedly to dismiss claims about \"Asian grooming gangs\", Baroness Louise Casey has said in a new report, as she called for a new national inquiry. The government has accepted her recommendations to introduce compulsory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in grooming cases, and for a review of police records to launch new criminal investigations into historical child sexual exploitation cases. Politics latest: Yvette Cooper reveals details of grooming gangs report The crossbench peer has produced an audit of sexual abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales, after she was asked by the prime minister to review new and existing data, including the ethnicity and demographics of these gangs. In her report, she has warned authorities that children need to be seen \"as children\" and called for a tightening of the laws around the age of consent so that any penetrative sexual activity with a child under 16 is classified as rape. This is \"to reduce uncertainty which adults can exploit to avoid or reduce the punishments that should be imposed for their crimes\", she added. Baroness Casey said: \"Despite the age of consent being 16, we have found too many examples of child sexual exploitation criminal cases being dropped or downgraded from rape to lesser charges where a 13 to 15-year-old had been 'in love with' or 'had consented to' sex with the perpetrator.\"  The peer has called for a nationwide probe into the exploitation of children by gangs of men. She has not recommended another over-arching inquiry of the kind conducted by Professor Alexis Jay, and suggests the national probe should be time-limited. The national inquiry will direct local investigations and hold institutions to account for past failures. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the inquiry's \"purpose is to challenge what the audit describes as continued denial, resistance and legal wrangling among local agencies\". On the issue of ethnicity, Baroness Casey said police data was not sufficient to draw conclusions as it had been \"shied away from\", and is still not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators. 'Flawed data' However, having examined local data in three police force areas, she found \"disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds amongst suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation, as well as in the significant number of perpetrators of Asian ethnicity identified in local reviews and high-profile child sexual exploitation prosecutions across the country, to at least warrant further examination\". She added: \"Despite reviews, reports and inquiries raising questions about men from Asian or Pakistani backgrounds grooming and sexually exploiting young white girls, the system has consistently failed to fully acknowledge this or collect accurate data so it can be examined effectively. \"Instead, flawed data is used repeatedly to dismiss claims about 'Asian grooming gangs' as sensationalised, biased or untrue. \"This does a disservice to victims and indeed all law-abiding people in Asian communities and plays into the hands of those who want to exploit it to sow division.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Read more:Officials tried to cover up grooming scandal, says CummingsWhy many victims welcome national inquiry into grooming gangsGrooming gangs scandal timeline  The baroness hit out at the failure of policing data and intelligence for having multiple systems which do not communicate with each other. She also criticised \"an ambivalent attitude to adolescent girls both in society and in the culture of many organisations\", too often judging them as adults. 'Deep-rooted failure' Responding to Baroness Casey's review, Ms Yvette Cooper told the House of Commons: \"The findings of her audit are damning. \"At its heart, she identifies a deep-rooted failure to treat children as children. A continued failure to protect children and teenage girls from rape, from exploitation, and serious violence. She added: \"Baroness Casey found 'blindness, ignorance, prejudice, defensiveness and even good but misdirected intentions' all played a part in this collective failure.\" Ms Cooper said she will take immediate action on all 12 recommendations from the report, adding: \"We cannot afford more wasted years repeating the same mistakes or shouting at each other across this House rather than delivering real change.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"After months of pressure, the prime minister has finally accepted our calls for a full statutory national inquiry into the grooming gangs. \"We must remember that this is not a victory for politicians, especially the ones like the home secretary, who had to be dragged to this position, or the prime minister. This is a victory for the survivors who have been calling for this for years.\" Ms Badenoch added: \"The prime minister's handling of this scandal is an extraordinary failure of leadership. His judgement has once again been found wanting. \"Since he became prime minister, he and the home secretary dismissed calls for an inquiry because they did not want to cause a stir. \"They accused those of us demanding justice for the victims of this scandal as, and I quote, 'jumping on a far right bandwagon', a claim the prime minister's official spokesman restated this weekend - shameful.\" The government has promised new laws to protect children and support victims so they \"stop being blamed for the crimes committed against them\". It is also launching new police operations and a new national inquiry to direct local investigations and hold institutions to account for past failures. There will also be new ethnicity data and research \"so we face up to the facts on exploitation and abuse,\" the home secretary said."

This had never before been done despite multiple local reviews into child sexual exploitation and a seven-year national inquiry into child abuse more generally, known as the Jay Review, which concluded in 2022. The government had previously resisted calls for an inquiry into grooming gangs, after a row with tech billionaire Elon Musk brought the issue back into the spotlight in January, saying it would implement the recommendations of the Jay Review that the Tories didn't. However it changed its position following Baroness Casey's findings.

Having examined local data in three police force areas, she found \"disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds\" are among suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation, as well as a \"significant number of perpetrators of Asian ethnicity\" who have been identified in local reviews and child sexual exploitation prosecutions across the country. She said all of this warranted further examination, insisting to Sophy Ridge that the decision was not political.  ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Baroness Casey has also called for a tightening of the laws around the age of consent so that any penetrative sexual activity with a child under 16 is classified as rape, which the government has also accepted. She told Sophy Ridge that some perpetrators waited until their victims turned 13 as then it is \"much harder to prosecute for rape\". She said: \"I think we have to be really clear in society that children are children and I don't see the difference between, you know, a four-year-old and a 14-year-old. If somebody is doing to them... what I talk about in my report, it's rape and we need to call it for what it is.\""

        "Content": "By Liz Bates, political correspondent, and Sam Coates, deputy political editor   Whitehall officials tried to convince Michael Gove to go to court to cover up the grooming scandal in 2011, Sky News can reveal. Dominic Cummings, who was working for Lord Gove at the time, has told Sky News that officials in the Department for Education (DfE) wanted to help efforts by Rotherham Council to stop a national newspaper from exposing the scandal. In an interview with Sky News, Mr Cummings said that officials wanted a \"total cover-up\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The revelation shines a light on the institutional reluctance of some key officials in central government to publicly highlight the grooming gang scandal. Politics latest: Grooming gangs findings unveiled In 2011, Rotherham Council approached the Department for Education asking for help following inquiries by The Times. The paper's then chief reporter, the late Andrew Norfolk, was asking about sexual abuse and trafficking of children in Rotherham. The council went to Lord Gove's Department for Education for help. Officials considered the request and then recommended to Lord Gove's office that the minister back a judicial review which might, if successful, stop The Times publishing the story. Lord Gove rejected the request on the advice of Mr Cummings. Sources have independently confirmed Mr Cummings' account. Mr Cummings told Sky News: \"Officials came to me in the Department of Education and said: 'There's this Times journalist who wants to write the story about these gangs. The local authority wants to judicially review it and stop The Times publishing the story'. \"So I went to Michael Gove and said: 'This council is trying to actually stop this and they're going to use judicial review. You should tell the council that far from siding with the council to stop The Times you will write to the judge and hand over a whole bunch of documents and actually blow up the council's JR (judicial review).' \"Some officials wanted a total cover-up and were on the side of the council... \"They wanted to help the local council do the cover-up and stop The Times' reporting, but other officials, including in the DfE private office, said this is completely outrageous and we should blow it up. Gove did, the judicial review got blown up, Norfolk stories ran.\"  The judicial review wanted by officials would have asked a judge to decide about the lawfulness of The Times' publication plans and the consequences that would flow from this information entering the public domain. A second source told Sky News that the advice from officials was to side with Rotherham Council and its attempts to stop publication of details it did not want in the public domain. One of the motivations cited for stopping publication would be to prevent the identities of abused children entering the public domain. There was also a fear that publication could set back the existing attempts to halt the scandal, although incidents of abuse continued for many years after these cases. Sources suggested that there is also a natural risk aversion amongst officials to publicity of this sort. Read more on grooming gangs:What we do and don't know from the dataA timeline of the scandal Mr Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave Brexit campaign and was Boris Johnson's right-hand man in Downing Street, has long pushed for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to expose failures at the heart of government. He said the inquiry, announced today, \"will be a total s**tshow for Whitehall because it will reveal how much Whitehall worked to try and cover up the whole thing.\" He also described Mr Johnson, with whom he has a long-standing animus, as a \"moron' for saying that money spent on inquiries into historic child sexual abuse had been \"spaffed up the wall\". Asked by Sky News political correspondent Liz Bates why he had not pushed for a public inquiry himself when he worked in Number 10 in 2019-20, Mr Cummings said Brexit and then COVID had taken precedence. \"There are a million things that I wanted to do but in 2019 we were dealing with the constitutional crisis,\" he said. The Department for Education and Rotherham Council have been approached for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A nursery worker has been convicted of mistreating 21 children in her care after she was caught on CCTV pinching, punching and kicking her victims. Prosecutors said the scale of the abuse was \"staggering\" and Roksana Lecka \"showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment\" of children over a six-month period at the Riverside Nursery in Twickenham, southwest London. The nursery charged parents up to Â£1,900 a month to look after youngsters, aged between 18 months and two years, and followed the Montessori method of teaching, which involves allowing children to pursue their natural interests and activities. Lecka, 22, admitted seven charges of child cruelty and was found guilty of 14 further counts by a jury after a trial at Kingston Crown Court. She was cleared of three other charges. One conviction related to a child at another nursery that Lecka worked at in Hounslow, west London, in 2023. The jury heard there were no concerns raised when Lecka applied for a job at the Twickenham nursery, which has now closed, with references from another nursery and two families for whom she had babysat. But it was discovered she had \"badly treated\" children after a CCTV trawl when a colleague raised the alarm, the court heard. There were gasps from parents in the public gallery - some who were watching the footage for the first time - as it was played in court at the start of the trial. Children could be seen crying and flinching as they were repeatedly pinched and scratched on their arms, legs and stomachs by Lecka - with some attacked dozens of times in a day. Defendant 'addicted to vapes and smoked cannabis' In one clip, she was seen kicking a child on the floor, while others show her pushing children headfirst over cots, shoving one on to a mattress in the sleep room and aggressively covering a toddler's mouth as he started to cry. Prosecutors said Lecka could be seen vaping in another clip before taking a baby from a crib, who she was later filmed pinching and punching her side. Giving evidence, the nursery worker said she would regularly smoke cannabis with her boyfriend and was addicted to vapes. Prosecutor Tracy Ayling KC told the jury Lecka was \"looking around at other members of staff and who is watching when these assaults occur\". The Metropolitan Police released bodycam footage of the moment Lecka was arrested at her home in Hounslow, west London, and a clip of her answering \"no comment\" to questions from detectives about the injuries to the children. She said in a prepared statement: \"I deny assaulting any children at the Riverside Nursery.... I went into work that day and had a normal day. There were no accidents where any child seemed hurt. \"We have procedures for the handling of the children, which I adhered to. I am unaware how any injury to these children were caused.\" 'Sheer scale of abuse is staggering' Lawyer Jemma Till, from Irwin Mitchell, a legal firm representing some of the parents of the victims, said: \"The families we represent are not only deeply shocked but also traumatised by what their children have endured. \"This is sadly yet another devastating case where children have suffered at the hands of someone in a position of trust. \"Whilst Lecka's actions have been stopped, the consequences of those actions are likely to affect families for many years. Nothing can undo what has happened but it's now vital that lessons are learned, and where appropriate, measures introduced to prevent other children being harmed.\" Senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor Gemma Burns said: \"Lecka repeatedly showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment of these babies. \"No parent should have to fear leaving their child in the care of professionals, but the sheer scale of her abuse is staggering.\" She added: \"Lecka was placed in a position of trust and her job required her to provide safety and protection. Instead, she kicked, scratched, and pinched these young children, with this vile abuse of vulnerable victims continuing for many months.\" Read more from Sky News:Dig for remains of 800 infants beginsHuman leg found on UK beach Detective Sergeant Geoff Boye said officers reviewed more than 300 hours of CCTV footage during the investigation to reveal Lecka's \"prolific\" offending. It included \"pinching and grabbing children, dropping babies into their cots and on one occasion, she delivered several kicks to a young boy to the face and stepped on his shoulder,\" the officer said. Detective Inspector Sian Hutchings added: \"These families left their children in Lecka's care, trusting her to take protect their children as well as the other staff at the nurseries clearly did. \"The footage of her offences against defenceless children was disturbing.\" Lecka will be sentenced on 26 September."

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  A 92-year-old man has gone on trial accused of the rape and murder of an elderly woman in Bristol nearly 60 years ago. Ryland Headley, from Ipswich, denies killing Louisa Dunne, who was 75 at the time, in June 1967. Avon and Somerset Police reopened the cold case in 2023 and arrested Headley following new tests on semen found on the skirt Ms Dunne was wearing at the time. Opening the case, Prosecutor Anna Vigars KC told the jury at Bristol Crown Court that those test results showed a DNA match that was \"a billion times more likely\" to be Mr Headley's than anyone else. Her clothes had been kept in police storage for decades. The prosecution said that Ms Dunne was found by neighbours inside her home in the Easton area of the city after returning from a friend's house. They described how she was discovered lying on her back on a pile of old clothes, with blood coming from her and vomit in her mouth. \"She was fully dressed, but her knickers were around her ankles, and a nylon type stocking was lying across her neck,\" added Mrs Vigars. At the time, police found her house had been broken into and a sash window had been forced open, with a palm print discovered. The investigation in 1967 took thousands of palm prints from local males, but no match was found. A post-mortem examination at the time found she had \"extensive abrasions\" on her face and that the most likely explanation was that a hand had been pressed against her mouth. An intimate swab tested positive for semen, but DNA testing was not available at the time. The jury heard that Headley, who appeared in the dock wearing a red jumper, had already pleaded guilty of raping two other elderly women, just weeks apart in 1977. One victim, an 84-year-old woman, said she would scream, and he replied to her: \"If you do that, that will be worse for you.\" Mrs Vigars outlined to the court that Headley told the other victim, a 79-year-old, he had a gun, saying: \"If you do what I tell you, you will be all right, if not, I will kill you. Do not scream or make a noise or I will kill you.\" Read more from Sky News:Girl, 13, charged with riotingNursery worker convicted of mistreating childrenUK could see 32C this week with heatwave The prosecution said the offences demonstrated that Headley had \"a tendency\" to act in the same way that he allegedly did in 1967. \"In other words, to break into people's homes at night and, in some cases, to target an elderly woman living alone, to have sex with her despite her attempts to fend him off, and to threaten violence,\" the prosecution added. Headley denies raping and murdering Ms Dunne. The trial at Bristol Crown Court is due to last up to three weeks."

Fiona MacDonald, of Cross Arthurlie Primary School in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, raised concerns following a P7 leavers' event last week which was attended by parents and carers. In her letter, Ms MacDonald said the use of a Union Flag featuring staff images \"caused some upset at the beginning of the evening\". She added: \"As a school we promote inclusion and acceptance, actively working against potentially offensive or sectarian messaging. \"Although we recognise this was not the intent, we are concerned that others within or beyond the school community may consider that this is something we would encourage.\" The headteacher said she had spoken to the children to explain \"why it wasn't a good idea\" to use images without permission.

The leader of the Scottish Conservatives had earlier called for the local authority to apologise for the \"daft letter\". Russell Findlay MSP said: \"For a school to tell parents that our country's flag is 'offensive or sectarian' is ludicrous and embarrassing.\" Former party leader and colleague Jackson Carlaw, MSP for Eastwood, also voiced his anger at the letter. Posting on X, he said: \"Let me be clear - to equate the Union Flag with sectarianism is totally unacceptable and deeply offensive to people both locally and across Scotland.\" Demanding an apology, he added: \"Our national flag is not up for debate - it is a symbol of our tradition, unity as a nation and hope for so many.\" In a statement, East Renfrewshire Council said: \"It was not the school's intention to imply the Union Flag is sectarian and both the headteacher and the council apologises for any offence and upset that has been caused to pupils, parents and carers and the wider community. \"All educational establishments in East Renfrewshire should be spaces that are focused on learning, unity, and pride in a diverse British society. \"We expect our schools to foster an ethos of respect for diverse perspectives and national identity.\""

It comes as data from the Office for National Statistics shows domestic abuse is most commonly reported by those aged between 16 to 19. Faustine Petron, who used to be in an abusive relationship, said a lack of compulsory education on coercive control and signs of abuse was \"negligent\" and \"inappropriate\". The Cambridge university student told Sky News: \"I was a child, and it's very difficult sometimes when the lines are a bit blurred between love and abuse. \"Sometimes abusers masquerade abuse as love.\" Ms Petron's petition, with more than 105,000 signatures, calling for mandatory education has been delivered to Downing Street. Currently, relationship and sex education is compulsory for those up to the age of 16. But it's then up to post-16 educational providers to use their existing budget and resources to provide it if they choose to. \"There is much to gain from adding that extra two years on,\" Ms Petron said. \"At 16, that's normally, on average, when young people are starting their first sexual encounters and having sex. \"So they're going to have new questions and different things that concern them than when they were in Year 7 or 8.\" In response to the campaign, a government spokesperson told Sky News: \"All abuse is abhorrent, and this government is determined to root it out as part of our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade through our Plan for Change. \"As part of our review of the relationships, sex and health curriculum, the education secretary has been clear that she will ensure children are learning the skills they need to build positive, healthy relationships, right from primary school. \"More widely, we are considering every option to fundamentally transform the system and address the issue of domestic abuse head on, and that includes everything from supporting victims to looking at whether we need to change the law.\" Read more from Sky News:Nursery worker convicted of mistreating 21 childrenFlawed data 'used repeatedly to dismiss grooming gangs claims'Human leg found on UK beach Ms Petron believes lessons like this could protect young women and men from a future of potential abuse and violence. \"I think there's so much at risk,\" she added. \"I think when I say that it's a life-saving education, I'm not just saying that as a big kind of catchy statement, it's because I genuinely believe it. \"That if all young people, regardless of their gender, are well-equipped to know the signs of abuse, what a healthy relationship looks like, how to maintain healthy sexual health, all of these really important things, I think people will be kept safer from the kind of abuse that I've faced.\""

        "Content": " Israel had \"no other choice\" but to attack Iran because it was proceeding \"dramatically\" towards a nuclear bomb, Israeli President Isaac Herzog has claimed. Speaking to Sky News' Yalda Hakim, he said Iran was \"rushing\" to the bomb \"under disguise\". He also suggested the Israeli war cabinet was discussing Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, amid reports that President Donald Trump vetoed a plan to kill him. It comes as Israel and Iran continue to fire missiles at each other after Israel launched an unprecedented strike on Iran's nuclear and military capabilities. Tehran has long denied that its nuclear program has been attempting to obtain a nuclear weapon.  Mr Herzog was asked why Israel attacked Iran when it did. \"When you take such decisions of historic magnitude and proportions, you have to analyse all facets and all facts,\" he replied. \"The truth of the matter is there was no other choice.\" He claimed Iran was proceeding \"dramatically\" towards the bomb, both in terms of the enrichment of uranium and, \"clandestinely\", the armament part of the process. \"I've always been very crystal clear with regards to a nuclear capability of our enemies - it has to be removed at once.\" Mr Herzog added: \"We have to remove the Iranian nuclear program because we see the negotiating process as being futile because they are lying whilst talking to us. \"They are lying whilst talking to the United States and other allies.\"  Read more:Iran's ambassador to UK speaks to Sky NewsUK advises against all travel to Israel He was questioned whether the strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure could provoke a response that causes a mass casualty event in Israel. \"(We are) very much aware of the risks of this war,\" he replied. \"Every night there are missile attacks, heavy missile attacks on Israel. \"We have our air defence systems, which are excellent. \"Unfortunately, we have casualties.

Close by, huddled under an arched courtyard, women of all ages are sitting, grieving in their own way. Some are sobbing, others look dazed, others desperate. Their intermittent wails of grief puncture the silence. Yet there's a beautiful stillness about it all. Israel-Iran latest updates We've arrived just at the moment Tamra, Israel, has come to a standstill. Everyone here is waiting for the bodies of four members of the Khatib family to return, killed when a ballistic missile from Iran hit their home on Saturday night. \n                  Israel's war against Iran is a gamble - and to pay off it can't afford to miss\n                 \n                  Israel had 'no choice' but to attack Iran because it was 'rushing' to nuclear bomb, president Isaac Herzog claims\n                 \n                  Is Trump about to take the US into a new war?\n                 Manar Khatib was killed alongside two of her daughters - 20-year-old Shada, and 13-year-old Hala - and her sister-in-law, also called Manar. Layan Diab, 23, is a cousin of the girls. She's in disbelief. \"It's a deep loss. It hurts my soul. We lost our entire family. Four people here. I can't fathom it. I don't understand. It's unbelievable,\" she says. And she's fearful of the coming days. \"Every time we hear the sirens, people start to scream and remember,\" she says. Just down the street is the girls' grieving father, Raja Khatib. A doctor with a charming warmth, he starts to speak Italian, assuming we may be from Italy. He'd just returned from a holiday there with his wife and children in Ferrara. His eyes fill with tears as he says that if only he'd stayed a day longer, they would all be alive today. 'I feel terrible. I feel fire in my bodyâ€¦ I hope that I will survive this moment. I've lost my family, but for what?

That evening, she'd been out to buy cookies with her sisters. When they returned, Razan and her older sister Shada played music and watched videos on their phones. When the alarms started to sound, they dismissed them at first. But after a loud boom, Razan was unsettled and started to make her way to one of the safe rooms, imploring Shada to do the same. But only Razan went.  \"In one moment, everything went dark. I couldn't see anything. I asked Allah, please don't take my life,\" she describes with searing clarity. She could hear her father calling out for them all. But his cries were met with silence. Razan's family home is now a mound of rubble. When we arrive there, we find neighbours and friends clearing the rubble. Many are deeply traumatised. Ammad, who's sweeping debris outside the house opposite, tells me he saw body parts flung across the road and into a nearby garden, and there's blood on the walls. It is a deeply visceral and harrowing account of an attack that took everyone by surprise. This is a residential neighbourhood. It's thought the missile was bound for Haifa, more than an hour away and home to oil refineries. But this time, with this missile, it fell on civilians. And took with it, futures."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Former spymasters, military chiefs and leading politicians are among a group of more than 60 public figures to sign a letter urging the prime minister to allocate more of the UK's reduced overseas aid budget to preventing wars. A failure to act risks leaving the government facing what they described as a \"global conflict crisis\" with \"one hand tied behind its back\". The letter to Sir Keir Starmer, shared with Sky News, said violent conflict is impacting more countries across the globe than at any time since the Second World War. \"They are disrupting economies and diverting the world's attention away from human rights, climate change and gender equality,\" according to the letter, signed by, among others, Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller and Lord Jonathan Evans, former director generals of MI5, and Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser.  \"To durably strengthen national security, therefore, the government must invest not just in defence, but also in development and diplomacy.\" The group is not calling on the prime minister to reverse a decision to shrink the overseas aid budget to 0.3% of GDP from 0.5% by 2027 to fund an increase in defence spending. Instead, they are focused on the proportion of the diminished international development budget that is spent on conflict prevention and peacebuilding. \n                  British soldier arrested on suspicion of raping woman in Kenya\n                 \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Military clerk faces jail after nearly Â£1m Ministry of Defence fraud\n                 The ratio had been 4% of total overseas aid spending in 2018. But the level has shrunk to between 1 and 1.5% today, according to Lord Jack McConnell, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding, which organised the letter. The group wants the proportion to be returned to the equivalent of 4%. \"Without this, the UK might risk facing the global conflict crisis with one hand tied behind its back,\" the letter warned. The signatories said they would like to see an all-of-government approach to tackling violent conflict to be included in an upcoming national security strategy, which is due to be published before a NATO summit next week.

Conflict prevention and resolution efforts that the UK has in the past championed include helping to secure peace agreements in the Philippines, Colombia and Ethiopia. Another initiative is the \"Women, Peace and Security\" agenda. \"We are gravely concerned that these initiatives may disappear amidst cuts to the aid budget,\" the letter said. \"This would be a false economy, as conflicts left to escalate and spread will lead to further insecurity, forced displacement and humanitarian crises to which the armed forces and aid agencies must respond.\""

The same principle applies to Israel's decision to attack Iran. Its war is a gamble - to pay off, it must be entirely successful. It cannot afford to miss.

That fearsome power is being wielded with awesome effect. Iran's military and intelligence commanders are being traced and eliminated one by one - 20 of them in the first night alone. The destruction of Iran's air defences is also on the mark.

Read more: How conflict between Israel and Iran has unfolded  To be absolutely sure of success, Israel needs the regime to fall. It must destroy both Iran's ability to develop the bomb, but more importantly, its will to do so. Fail on either front, and Iran's leaders will prioritise building a nuclear weapon. They will have to, so they can defend themselves better next time.  Their ability to build the bomb will be impossible to destroy completely, however massive the munitions Israel puts into the centrifuge halls of Natanz and Fordow. The Iranian nuclear programme is too far developed. They have the knowledge and expertise. For as many nuclear scientists Israel kills, there are their students to replace them.  And the technology is in their favour. As one western source told the Israeli Haaretz newspaper over the weekend: \"They have knowledge about the plant centrifuges. \"They don't need as many centrifuges as they used to. They can build a small plant somewhere, heavily fortified underground, maybe even in less than three years.\"  At some point, the Israelis will need to end their campaign. The Iranians' desire to build the bomb will then be redoubled among what's left of their regime. The capacity to do so will have been degraded, but the know-how will remain. Toppling the regime will be the surest way of achieving Israel's aims if it ushers in a replacement not determined to go nuclear. Israel knows that and has been going after people and places essential to the regime's apparatus of internal control and repression.

Here, the village of Kananaskis (population circa 130) finds itself, temporarily, the diplo-centre of the world - hosting diplomacy of the difficult kind. If this isn't quite a crisis meeting, it's a meeting amidst crisis. The Israel-Iran conflict is front and centre of the G7 agenda and key players have come here talking de-escalation. If they're speaking with a single voice at the start, don't hold your breath for a single strategy by the end. The G7 starring Donald Trump is a different movie - this isn't a gathering built necessarily on the shared understanding and common purpose that has, generally, defined the annual team meeting of the world's leading democracies. Here, an abrasive US president will schmooze leaders he's screwing on trade, undermining on defence priorities and, generally, putting at a distance. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa - both veterans of the Oval Office hair dryer treatment - are the special guests filed under specially awkward. Reaching any kind of common strategy on the Middle East will be difficult in the immediate term, as it is in the long-term. Trump is a man with a different vision for the region and, without a shared view of the destination, it's complicated from the start. The same applies to Ukraine. At this gathering, the dynamic will be all about the Donald. The centre of gravity will revolve around their US invitee, reflecting the wider picture of a world working out Trump and shaping its response accordingly.

The families said they rushed to India to be by their loved ones' sides, \"only to find a disjointed, inadequate, and painfully slow government reaction\". \"There is no UK leadership here, no medical team, no crisis professionals stationed at the hospital,\" said a family spokesperson. \"We are forced to make appointments to see consular staff based 20 minutes away in a hotel, while our loved ones lie unidentified in an overstretched and under-resourced hospital. \"We're not asking for miracles - we're asking for presence, for compassion, for action,\" another family member said. \"Right now, we feel utterly abandoned.\" Read more:Who are some of the crash victims?Survivor recounts moments before impact   The families listed a number of what they called \"key concerns\", including a \"lack of transparency and oversight in the identification and handling of remains\". They also demanded a \"full crisis team\" at the hospital within 24 hours, a British-run identification unit, and financial support for relatives of the victims. A local doctor had \"confirmed\" the delays in releasing the bodies were \"linked to severe understaffing\", according to the families, who also called for an independent inquiry into the UK government's response. \"Our loved ones were British citizens. They deserved better in life. They certainly deserve better in death,\" the statement added. A Foreign Ofiice spokesperson said: \"Our staff continue to work around the clock in the UK and India to support the families and loved ones of all those impacted by the crash. \"We have set up a Reception Centre at the Ummed Hotel, near the Ahmedabad airport, and have a dedicated helpline to provide support and advice for the families and friends of British nationals - friends or family should call 020 7008 5000. \"If you are in India, you should call +91 (11) 24192100 for support, including through in-person consular staff who are available to support families of British nationals, including accompanying them to the hospital. \"Furthermore, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch has deployed an investigation team to support the Indian led investigation on the ground, and UK forensic experts are there to support the consular response.\" Families and friends of the victims have already expressed their anger and frustration - mostly aimed at the authorities in India - over the lack of information."

        "Headline": "The prime minister says the completed deal \"implements on car tariffs and aerospace\", and describes it as a \"sign of strength\" between the UK and US.",
        "Content": " The UK-US trade deal has been signed and is \"done\", US President Donald Trump has said as he met Sir Keir Starmer at the G7 summit. The US president told reporters in Canada: \"We signed it, and it's done. It's a fair deal for both. It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.\" Sir Keir said the document \"implements\" the deal to cut tariffs on cars and aerospace, describing it as a \"really important agreement\". \"So this is a very good day for both of our countries - a real sign of strength,\" the prime minister added. Mr Trump added that the UK was \"very well protected\" against any future tariffs, saying: \"You know why? Because I like them\". However, he did not say whether levies on British steel exports to the US would be set to 0%, saying \"we're gonna let you have that information in a little while\". The government says the US \"has committed\" to removing tariffs (taxes on imported goods) on UK aerospace goods, such as engines and aircraft parts, which currently stand at 10%. That is \"expected to come into force by the end of the month\".\n\n Tariffs on car imports will drop from 27.5% to 10%, the government says, which \"saves car manufacturers hundreds of millions a year, and protects tens of thousands of jobs\". The White House says there will be a quote of 100,000 cars eligible for import at that level each year. But on steel, the story is a little more complicated.\n The UK is the only country exempted from the global 50% tariff rate on steel - which means the UK rate remains at the original level of 25%. That tariff was expected to be lifted entirely, but the government now says it will \"continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\".\n The White House says the US will \"promptly construct a quota at most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminium articles\". Other key parts of the deal include import and export quotas for beef - and the government is keen to emphasise that \"any US imports will need to meet UK food safety standards\". There is no change to tariffs on pharmaceuticals for the moment, and the government says \"work will continue to protect industry from any further tariffs imposed\". The White House says they \"committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes\". Mr Trump also praised Sir Keir as a \"great\" prime minister, adding: \"We've been talking about this deal for six years, and he's done what they haven't been able to do.\" He added: \"We're very longtime partners and allies and friends and we've become friends in a short period of time. \"He's slightly more liberal than me to put it mildly... but we get along.\" Sir Keir added that \"we make it work\". As the pair exited a mountain lodge in the Canadian Rockies where the summit is being held, Mr Trump held up a physical copy of the trade agreement to show reporters. Several leaves of paper fell from the binding, and Sir Keir quickly stooped to pick them up, saying: \"A very important document.\" The US president also appeared to mistakenly refer to a \"trade agreement with the European Union\" at one point as he stood alongside the British prime minister. Mr Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries in April. At the time, he announced 10% \"reciprocal\" rates on all UK exports - as well as separately announced 25% levies on cars and steel.

        "Content": "A Los Angeles doctor has agreed to plead guilty to giving Friends actor Matthew Perry ketamine in the lead up to his death from a fatal overdose, prosecutors have said. Dr Salvador Plasencia, who will admit to four counts of distribution of ketamine, faces up to a maximum of 40 years in prison. He is among five people charged in connection with the death of Friends star Perry, 54, whose body was found in his hot tub by his assistant in October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine and other factors caused him to lose consciousness and drown. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal treatment for depression, but had begun seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. Plasencia is accused of supplying the bulk of Perry's ketamine in his final weeks. He and three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for their cooperation. Jasmine Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major ketamine dealer, is alleged to have provided the dose that killed the actor and is the only defendant who has pleaded not guilty to the prosecution's case. \n                  Lisa Kudrow says the cast of Friends only met up once after hit show ended - as she speaks about Matthew Perry's death\n                 \n                  Matthew Perry: Courteney Cox pays tribute to Friends co-star a year on from his death\n                 \n                  Friends star Jennifer Aniston pays tribute to Matthew Perry on first anniversary of his death\n                 About a month before the actor's death, Perry found Plasencia, a doctor who allegedly asked another doctor, Mark Chavez, to obtain the drug for him, according to court filings in the Chavez case. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to court filings from prosecutors. Read more from Sky News:Courteney Cox pays tribute to PerryLisa Kudrow talks about star's death The pair who practised in California met up the same day and exchanged at least four vials of ketamine, the filings said. After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500 (Â£3,314), Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to\" prosecutors said. Chavez has pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute ketamine to Perry. Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A juror has been dismissed from the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex-trafficking trial after hearing five weeks of evidence. Judge Arun Subramanian said he had \"concerns\" about the jury member's \"candour\" and made the decision after it emerged the man - Juror 6 - had given inconsistent answers about where he lives. This could indicate he potentially had an agenda, that he wanted to be on the panel hearing the Combs trial for a purpose, the judge said, and there was nothing the juror could say that would \"put the genie back in the bottle\". Diddy trial: Day 24 - as it happened Questions over whether the juror, a black male, resided in New York or across the Hudson River in the state of New Jersey first arose at the end of last week - but defence lawyers argued dismissing him would disrupt the diversity of the jury. However, the judge rejected this argument ahead of the start of Monday's court session, excusing the juror and replacing him with one of the alternates, a white male. A review of the juror's answers to questions about his residency during jury selection, along with his subsequent responses to similar questions, revealed \"clear inconsistencies\", the judge said. \"Taking these all together, the record raised serious concerns as to the juror's candour and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury,\" Judge Subramanian said. Leaving the juror on the panel could threaten the integrity of the judicial process, he added. \"The court should not, indeed cannot, let race factor into the decision of what happens. Here, the answer is clear. Juror number six is excused,\" Judge Subramanian said. Sean 'Diddy' Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex-trafficking, and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has strenuously denied all allegations of sexual abuse. The hip-hop mogul's defence team has described him as \"a complicated man\" but say the case is not. They have conceded Combs could be violent and that jurors might not condone his proclivity for \"kinky sex\". However, they argue this was a consensual \"swingers\" lifestyle and was not illegal. Special agent and paralegal testify Following the juror's dismissal, the sixth week of the trial began - with testimony from a paralegal specialist and a special agent, who both gave evidence as summary witnesses. This means they were not involved in the criminal investigation into Combs, but were tasked with reviewing some evidence, including charts, phone records and data. In court, the aim is to provide context to the testimony heard so far and how it relates to the charges against the hip-hop mogul. During paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar's testimony, the court heard about texts appearing to reference \"freak offs\" - sexual encounters with male escorts which former girlfriends Cassie Ventura and \"Jane\", two of three alleged victims to give evidence during the trial, both say Combs forced them into. Cassie was in an on-off relationship with Combs from 2007 to 2018, while Jane - a pseudonym - dated him on and off from the beginning of 2021 to his arrest in September 2024. Chicken soup and $4,000 cash In messages from March 2016, Combs's then chief of staff Kristina Khorram appeared to ask an assistant to set a hotel room up, with items requested including Gatorade, water and chicken noodle soup. \"He wants you to go right away now please,\" a message said. In another text, Khorram asked workers to fetch $4,000 in cash and to ensure a male escort was given access to the hotel room, the court heard. The court also heard about messages sent around the time of the bombshell civil lawsuit filed against Combs by Cassie in November 2023 - which was settled within 24 hours for a then undisclosed sum, revealed to be $20m during the trial. By this time, Combs was seeing Jane. According to an audio file of a conversation, Jane told Combs after finding out about Cassie's lawsuit: \"I don't know what I'm feeling... this is so word for word, it is crazy and it just feels sick to my stomach.\" On 28 November 2023, about two weeks later, Jane told Combs she felt he exploited her with their \"dark and humiliating lifestyle\". The following month, the court heard Jane said in a message to Khorram: \"He said he would expose me and send videos to my baby daddy... I am traumatised by my time with him.\" Jane said she would not normally involve Khorram in such matters, but told her she needed help as Combs was having one of his \"evil-ass psychotic bipolar\" episodes. Jane told Khorram that she was heavily drugged in the tapes. Although it was not clear exactly what she was referencing, a message sent to Combs by Khorram around the time of the lawsuit seemed to show some friction between the pair. \"If you cannot be honest with me this doesn't work,\" she told him, according to the messages. Combs \"keeping things\" to himself put them in the \"situation we are all in right now\", she added. Towards the end of the court day, videos entered into evidence under seal were played by the prosecution. This means the jury and lawyers could see and hear what was happening, but members of the public in court could not. Read more:Everything you need to know about the trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat we learned from Cassie's testimony Prosecutors have said they expect to conclude their case later this week. After this, Combs's defence team will begin theirs. Last week, Kanye West turned up at the court in Manhattan, New York, to support the rapper, spending about 40 minutes in the building watching proceedings on a monitor in an overflow room. Combs's mother, Janice Combs, and several of his children have also consistently shown up throughout the hearing. Diddy denies charges of sex-trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy. The trial continues."

Here, the village of Kananaskis (population circa 130) finds itself, temporarily, the diplo-centre of the world - hosting diplomacy of the difficult kind. If this isn't quite a crisis meeting, it's a meeting amidst crisis. The Israel-Iran conflict is front and centre of the G7 agenda and key players have come here talking de-escalation. If they're speaking with a single voice at the start, don't hold your breath for a single strategy by the end. The G7 starring Donald Trump is a different movie - this isn't a gathering built necessarily on the shared understanding and common purpose that has, generally, defined the annual team meeting of the world's leading democracies. Here, an abrasive US president will schmooze leaders he's screwing on trade, undermining on defence priorities and, generally, putting at a distance. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa - both veterans of the Oval Office hair dryer treatment - are the special guests filed under specially awkward. Reaching any kind of common strategy on the Middle East will be difficult in the immediate term, as it is in the long-term. Trump is a man with a different vision for the region and, without a shared view of the destination, it's complicated from the start. The same applies to Ukraine. At this gathering, the dynamic will be all about the Donald. The centre of gravity will revolve around their US invitee, reflecting the wider picture of a world working out Trump and shaping its response accordingly.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Poundland will halt rent payments at hundreds of its shops if a restructuring of the ailing discount retailer is approved by creditors later this summer. Sky News has learnt that Poundland's new owner, the investment firm Gordon Brothers, is proposing to halt all rent payments at so-called Category C shops across the country. According to a letter sent to creditors in the last few days, roughly 250 shops have been classed as Category C sites, with rent payments \"reduced to nil\". Poundland will have the right to terminate leases with 30 days' notice at roughly 70 of these loss-making stores - classed as C2 - after the restructuring plan is approved, and with 60 days' notice at about 180 more C2 sites. The plan also raises the prospect of landlords activating break clauses in their contracts at the earliest possible opportunity if they can secure alternative retail tenants. In addition to the zero-rent proposal, hundreds of Poundland's stores would see rent payments reduced by between 15% and 75% if the restructuring plan is approved. The document leaves open the question of how many shops will ultimately close under its new owners. \n                  Thousands of Poundland jobs at risk as shops to close after company sold\n                 \n                  Burberry to cut 1,700 jobs after multi-million pound loss\n                 \n                  Luxury store Harrods is latest retail victim of cyber attackers\n                 A convening hearing has been scheduled for next month, while a sanction hearing, at which creditors will vote on the plan, is due to occur on or around 26 August, according to one source. The discounter was sold last week for a nominal sum to Gordon Brothers, the former owner of Laura Ashley, amid mounting losses suffered by its Warsaw-listed owner, Pepco Group. Poundland declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The UK's cost of living crisis hangover is facing fresh pressure from the Israel-Iran conflict and growing tensions across the Middle East. Whenever the region, particularly a major oil-producing country, is embroiled in some kind of fracas, the potential consequences are first seen in global oil prices. The Middle East accounts for a third of world output. Money latest: 'Unusual movement' in house prices Iran's share of the total is only about 3%, but it is the second-largest supplier of natural gas. Add to that its control of the key Strait of Hormuz shipping route, and you can understand why any military action involving Iran has huge implications for the global economy at a time when a US-inspired global trade war is already playing out. What's happened to oil prices? Global oil prices jumped by up to 13% on Friday as the Israel-Iran conflict ramped up. It was the biggest one-day leap seen since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, which gave birth to the energy-driven cost-of-living crisis. From lows of $64 (Â£47) a barrel for Brent crude, the international benchmark, earlier this month, the cost is currently 15% higher. Iran ships all its oil to China because of Western sanctions, so the world's second-largest economy would have the most to lose in the event of disruption. Should that happen, China would need to replace that oil by buying elsewhere on the international market, threatening higher prices.  How are natural gas prices holding up? UK day-ahead prices are 15% up over the past week alone. Europe is more dependent on Middle East liquefied natural gas (LNG) these days because of sanctions against Russia. The UK is particularly exposed due to the fact that we have low storage capacity and rely so much on gas-fired power to keep the lights on and for heating. Israel-Iran latest: Tehran threatens to leave nuclear treaty The day-ahead price, measured in pence per therm (I won't go into that), is at 93p on Monday. It sounds rather meaningless until you compare it with the price seen less than a week ago - 81p. The higher sum was last seen over the winter - when demand is at its strongest.  What are the risks to these prices? Market experts say Brent crude would easily exceed $100 (Â£74) a barrel in the event of any Iranian threats to supplies through the Strait of Hormuz - the 30-mile wide shipping lane controlled by both Iran and Oman. While Iran has a history of disrupting trade, analysts believe it will not want to risk its oil and gas income through any blockade. What do these price increases mean for the UK? There are implications for the whole economy at a time when the chancellor can least afford it, as she bets big on public sector-led growth for the economy. We can expect higher oil, gas and fuel costs to be passed on down supply chains - from the refinery and factory - to the end user, consumers. It could affect anything from foodstuffs to even fake tan. Increases at the pumps are usually the first to appear - probably within the next 10 days. Prices are always quick to rise and slow to reflect easing wholesale costs. Energy bills will also take in the gas spike, particularly if the wholesale price rises are sustained. The energy price cap from September - and new fixed-term price deals - will first reflect these increases. Read more:How conflict between Israel and Iran unfoldedUK advises against all travel to IsraelExplosions over Jerusalem as missiles 'detected' by IDF How does this all play out in the coming months? So much depends on events ahead. But energy price rises are an inflation risk and a potential threat to future interest rate cuts. While LSEG data shows financial markets continuing to expect a further two interest rate cuts by the Bank of England this year, the rate-setting committee will be reluctant to cut if the pace of price growth is led higher than had been expected. At a time when employers are grappling with higher taxes and minimum pay thresholds, and consumers a surge in bills following the 'awful April' hikes to council tax, water and other essentials, a fresh energy-linked inflation spike is the last thing anyone needs."

The mayor of London has previously tried to ban traffic from the famous shopping street but was thwarted by the then-Conservative majority Westminster City Council in 2018.

Separate research from YouGov run in September last year suggested that 63% of Londoners support the project. Ms Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, said: \"We want to see Oxford Street become the thriving place to be for tourists and Londoners alike, and that's why we welcome the Mayor of London's bold proposals to achieve that. \"We will support the mayor in delivering this ambitious vision, which will help to breathe new life into Oxford Street - driving investment, creating new jobs for local people and providing a boost to economic growth in the capital.\" This time around, the plans just need the backing of Ms Rayner, and the mayor is looking to create a mayoral development corporation by 1 January 2026 at the latest.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        The makers of air fryers and other smart home appliances have new guidelines around what information they can collect from people's homes. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) released the guidance today after an investigation by Which? revealed in December that some air fryers, smart TVs and smartwatches are collecting data on their owners. \"In our increasingly connected world, we shouldn't have to choose between enjoying the benefits of smart products and our own privacy,\" said Stephen Almond, executive director for regulatory risk at the ICO. \"We all rightly have a greater expectation of privacy in our own homes, so we must be able to trust smart products are respecting our privacy, using our personal information responsibly and only in ways we would expect.\" Three air fryers, made by China's Xiaomi, Tencent and Aigostar, recorded audio on their owners' phones for no specified reason, according to the Which? study. The Aigostar and Xiaomi fryers also sent personal data to Chinese servers, although this was flagged in the privacy notice supplied with the product. \"Whether it's an air fryer that wants to know your exact location, or a smartwatch app that listens while you sleep, it's clear that some companies have been pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable on privacy,\" said Andy Laughlin, a tech expert at Which?, in response to the new rules. \"ICO's much-needed guidance marks an important first step towards ensuring consumers can have confidence when buying smart products for their home - but this must be backed by effective enforcement, including against companies that operate abroad.\" Read more from Sky News:First woman to head MI6Dig for remains of 800 infants begins Four out of five people in the UK are thought to own at least one smart appliance, according to research by TechUK, and the new guidance is designed to protect them from disproportionate surveillance. The ICO says manufacturers and developers must \"adopt a data protection by design and default approach\". This means considering data protection while the appliance is being designed and then all the way throughout the lifecycle of the product. The ICO recommends a series of questions developers should ask themselves including: \"Do you need to use personal information?\" Smartwatches and fitness trackers are also included in the new guidance, with the ICO warning information like a user's BMI or fertility counts as special category data and should be treated with extra caution. Which?'s investigation found the Huawei Ultimate smartwatch requested nine \"risky\" phone permissions - the most of all the devices in the study. \"Risky\" permissions generally include knowing the user's precise location, the ability to record audio, access to stored files or an ability to see all other apps installed. Huawei said all of the permissions it asks for have a justified need. There is no suggestion of illegal behaviour by any of the companies mentioned in the study. \"We want to help organisations get this right from the start - but we are ready to take action if necessary to protect people from harm,\" said Mr Almond. \"When you bring a new smart product into your home, you can feel confident that we have your back.\""

The US president told reporters in Canada: \"We signed it, and it's done. It's a fair deal for both. It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.\" Sir Keir said the document \"implements\" the deal to cut tariffs on cars and aerospace, describing it as a \"really important agreement\". \"So this is a very good day for both of our countries - a real sign of strength,\" the prime minister added. Mr Trump added that the UK was \"very well protected\" against any future tariffs, saying: \"You know why? Because I like them\". However, he did not say whether levies on British steel exports to the US would be set to 0%, saying \"we're gonna let you have that information in a little while\". The government says the US \"has committed\" to removing tariffs (taxes on imported goods) on UK aerospace goods, such as engines and aircraft parts, which currently stand at 10%. That is \"expected to come into force by the end of the month\".\n\n Tariffs on car imports will drop from 27.5% to 10%, the government says, which \"saves car manufacturers hundreds of millions a year, and protects tens of thousands of jobs\". The White House says there will be a quote of 100,000 cars eligible for import at that level each year. But on steel, the story is a little more complicated.\n The UK is the only country exempted from the global 50% tariff rate on steel - which means the UK rate remains at the original level of 25%. That tariff was expected to be lifted entirely, but the government now says it will \"continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\".\n The White House says the US will \"promptly construct a quota at most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminium articles\". Other key parts of the deal include import and export quotas for beef - and the government is keen to emphasise that \"any US imports will need to meet UK food safety standards\". There is no change to tariffs on pharmaceuticals for the moment, and the government says \"work will continue to protect industry from any further tariffs imposed\". The White House says they \"committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes\". Mr Trump also praised Sir Keir as a \"great\" prime minister, adding: \"We've been talking about this deal for six years, and he's done what they haven't been able to do.\" He added: \"We're very longtime partners and allies and friends and we've become friends in a short period of time. \"He's slightly more liberal than me to put it mildly... but we get along.\" Sir Keir added that \"we make it work\". As the pair exited a mountain lodge in the Canadian Rockies where the summit is being held, Mr Trump held up a physical copy of the trade agreement to show reporters. Several leaves of paper fell from the binding, and Sir Keir quickly stooped to pick them up, saying: \"A very important document.\" The US president also appeared to mistakenly refer to a \"trade agreement with the European Union\" at one point as he stood alongside the British prime minister. Mr Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries in April. At the time, he announced 10% \"reciprocal\" rates on all UK exports - as well as separately announced 25% levies on cars and steel.

The government has accepted her recommendations to introduce compulsory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in grooming cases, and for a review of police records to launch new criminal investigations into historical child sexual exploitation cases. Politics latest: Yvette Cooper reveals details of grooming gangs report The crossbench peer has produced an audit of sexual abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales, after she was asked by the prime minister to review new and existing data, including the ethnicity and demographics of these gangs. In her report, she has warned authorities that children need to be seen \"as children\" and called for a tightening of the laws around the age of consent so that any penetrative sexual activity with a child under 16 is classified as rape. This is \"to reduce uncertainty which adults can exploit to avoid or reduce the punishments that should be imposed for their crimes\", she added. Baroness Casey said: \"Despite the age of consent being 16, we have found too many examples of child sexual exploitation criminal cases being dropped or downgraded from rape to lesser charges where a 13 to 15-year-old had been 'in love with' or 'had consented to' sex with the perpetrator.\"  The peer has called for a nationwide probe into the exploitation of children by gangs of men. She has not recommended another over-arching inquiry of the kind conducted by Professor Alexis Jay, and suggests the national probe should be time-limited. The national inquiry will direct local investigations and hold institutions to account for past failures. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the inquiry's \"purpose is to challenge what the audit describes as continued denial, resistance and legal wrangling among local agencies\". On the issue of ethnicity, Baroness Casey said police data was not sufficient to draw conclusions as it had been \"shied away from\", and is still not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators. 'Flawed data' However, having examined local data in three police force areas, she found \"disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds amongst suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation, as well as in the significant number of perpetrators of Asian ethnicity identified in local reviews and high-profile child sexual exploitation prosecutions across the country, to at least warrant further examination\". She added: \"Despite reviews, reports and inquiries raising questions about men from Asian or Pakistani backgrounds grooming and sexually exploiting young white girls, the system has consistently failed to fully acknowledge this or collect accurate data so it can be examined effectively. \"Instead, flawed data is used repeatedly to dismiss claims about 'Asian grooming gangs' as sensationalised, biased or untrue. \"This does a disservice to victims and indeed all law-abiding people in Asian communities and plays into the hands of those who want to exploit it to sow division.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Read more:Officials tried to cover up grooming scandal, says CummingsWhy many victims welcome national inquiry into grooming gangsGrooming gangs scandal timeline  The baroness hit out at the failure of policing data and intelligence for having multiple systems which do not communicate with each other. She also criticised \"an ambivalent attitude to adolescent girls both in society and in the culture of many organisations\", too often judging them as adults. 'Deep-rooted failure' Responding to Baroness Casey's review, Ms Yvette Cooper told the House of Commons: \"The findings of her audit are damning. \"At its heart, she identifies a deep-rooted failure to treat children as children. A continued failure to protect children and teenage girls from rape, from exploitation, and serious violence. She added: \"Baroness Casey found 'blindness, ignorance, prejudice, defensiveness and even good but misdirected intentions' all played a part in this collective failure.\" Ms Cooper said she will take immediate action on all 12 recommendations from the report, adding: \"We cannot afford more wasted years repeating the same mistakes or shouting at each other across this House rather than delivering real change.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"After months of pressure, the prime minister has finally accepted our calls for a full statutory national inquiry into the grooming gangs. \"We must remember that this is not a victory for politicians, especially the ones like the home secretary, who had to be dragged to this position, or the prime minister. This is a victory for the survivors who have been calling for this for years.\" Ms Badenoch added: \"The prime minister's handling of this scandal is an extraordinary failure of leadership. His judgement has once again been found wanting. \"Since he became prime minister, he and the home secretary dismissed calls for an inquiry because they did not want to cause a stir. \"They accused those of us demanding justice for the victims of this scandal as, and I quote, 'jumping on a far right bandwagon', a claim the prime minister's official spokesman restated this weekend - shameful.\" The government has promised new laws to protect children and support victims so they \"stop being blamed for the crimes committed against them\". It is also launching new police operations and a new national inquiry to direct local investigations and hold institutions to account for past failures. There will also be new ethnicity data and research \"so we face up to the facts on exploitation and abuse,\" the home secretary said."

        "Content": "By Liz Bates, political correspondent, and Sam Coates, deputy political editor   Whitehall officials tried to convince Michael Gove to go to court to cover up the grooming scandal in 2011, Sky News can reveal. Dominic Cummings, who was working for Lord Gove at the time, has told Sky News that officials in the Department for Education (DfE) wanted to help efforts by Rotherham Council to stop a national newspaper from exposing the scandal. In an interview with Sky News, Mr Cummings said that officials wanted a \"total cover-up\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The revelation shines a light on the institutional reluctance of some key officials in central government to publicly highlight the grooming gang scandal. Politics latest: Grooming gangs findings unveiled In 2011, Rotherham Council approached the Department for Education asking for help following inquiries by The Times. The paper's then chief reporter, the late Andrew Norfolk, was asking about sexual abuse and trafficking of children in Rotherham. The council went to Lord Gove's Department for Education for help. Officials considered the request and then recommended to Lord Gove's office that the minister back a judicial review which might, if successful, stop The Times publishing the story. Lord Gove rejected the request on the advice of Mr Cummings. Sources have independently confirmed Mr Cummings' account. Mr Cummings told Sky News: \"Officials came to me in the Department of Education and said: 'There's this Times journalist who wants to write the story about these gangs. The local authority wants to judicially review it and stop The Times publishing the story'. \"So I went to Michael Gove and said: 'This council is trying to actually stop this and they're going to use judicial review. You should tell the council that far from siding with the council to stop The Times you will write to the judge and hand over a whole bunch of documents and actually blow up the council's JR (judicial review).' \"Some officials wanted a total cover-up and were on the side of the council... \"They wanted to help the local council do the cover-up and stop The Times' reporting, but other officials, including in the DfE private office, said this is completely outrageous and we should blow it up. Gove did, the judicial review got blown up, Norfolk stories ran.\"  The judicial review wanted by officials would have asked a judge to decide about the lawfulness of The Times' publication plans and the consequences that would flow from this information entering the public domain. A second source told Sky News that the advice from officials was to side with Rotherham Council and its attempts to stop publication of details it did not want in the public domain. One of the motivations cited for stopping publication would be to prevent the identities of abused children entering the public domain. There was also a fear that publication could set back the existing attempts to halt the scandal, although incidents of abuse continued for many years after these cases. Sources suggested that there is also a natural risk aversion amongst officials to publicity of this sort. Read more on grooming gangs:What we do and don't know from the dataA timeline of the scandal Mr Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave Brexit campaign and was Boris Johnson's right-hand man in Downing Street, has long pushed for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to expose failures at the heart of government. He said the inquiry, announced today, \"will be a total s**tshow for Whitehall because it will reveal how much Whitehall worked to try and cover up the whole thing.\" He also described Mr Johnson, with whom he has a long-standing animus, as a \"moron' for saying that money spent on inquiries into historic child sexual abuse had been \"spaffed up the wall\". Asked by Sky News political correspondent Liz Bates why he had not pushed for a public inquiry himself when he worked in Number 10 in 2019-20, Mr Cummings said Brexit and then COVID had taken precedence. \"There are a million things that I wanted to do but in 2019 we were dealing with the constitutional crisis,\" he said. The Department for Education and Rotherham Council have been approached for comment."

Baroness Louise Casey told Sky News' Politics with Sophy Ridge there was a particular issue with some British Asian men that was \"abundantly clear\" in data analysed from three police forces; West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester; which showed a \"disproportionately\" in child sexual exploitation. Politics latest: Reaction to 'damning' grooming gangs report But she added: \"Just to give some sort of balance, in Greater Manchester I asked for data on child sexual exploitation that took me to Asian heritage. I asked for data on child abuse and that took me to the general population, which is largely white.\" Baroness Casey said \"if we just establish the facts, then you can take the pain out of this\". \"I think you've got sort of do-gooders that don't really want this to be found because, you know, 'Oh, God, then all the racists are going to be more racist',\" she added. \"Well, actually, people that are racist are going to use this anyway. All you're doing with the hate mongers and the racists is giving them more ammunition.\" Asked if people were worried about being seen as racist, the cross-bench peer said she came across direct examples of this in Rotherham - one of the towns at the centre of the grooming gangs scandal. \"I was following through on a children's file in archive and found the word 'Pakistani' tippexed out,\" Baroness Casey said. \"I thought whoever did that inadvertently was giving ammunition to the English Defence League that were every week, in and out, campaigning and doing their stuff in that town. \"I think the problem is that people are worried about being called racist.... if good people don't grasp difficult things, bad people will, and that's why we have to do it as a society.\"  The government has announced there will be a full statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, as recommended by Baroness Casey's report. The government has also accepted her recommendations to introduce compulsory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in grooming cases, and for a review of police records to launch new criminal investigations into historic child sexual exploitation cases. Baroness Casey was asked to produce an audit of sexual abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales, looking specifically at the issue of ethnicity and the cultural and social drivers for this type of offending. This had never before been done despite multiple local reviews into child sexual exploitation and a seven-year national inquiry into child abuse more generally, known as the Jay Review, which concluded in 2022. The government had previously resisted calls for an inquiry into grooming gangs, after a row with tech billionaire Elon Musk brought the issue back into the spotlight in January, saying it would implement the recommendations of the Jay Review that the Tories didn't. However it changed its position following Baroness Casey's findings.

She said all of this warranted further examination, insisting to Sophy Ridge that the decision was not political.  ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Baroness Casey has also called for a tightening of the laws around the age of consent so that any penetrative sexual activity with a child under 16 is classified as rape, which the government has also accepted. She told Sophy Ridge that some perpetrators waited until their victims turned 13 as then it is \"much harder to prosecute for rape\". She said: \"I think we have to be really clear in society that children are children and I don't see the difference between, you know, a four-year-old and a 14-year-old. If somebody is doing to them... what I talk about in my report, it's rape and we need to call it for what it is.\""

It comes as data from the Office for National Statistics shows domestic abuse is most commonly reported by those aged between 16 to 19. Faustine Petron, who used to be in an abusive relationship, said a lack of compulsory education on coercive control and signs of abuse was \"negligent\" and \"inappropriate\". The Cambridge university student told Sky News: \"I was a child, and it's very difficult sometimes when the lines are a bit blurred between love and abuse. \"Sometimes abusers masquerade abuse as love.\" Ms Petron's petition, with more than 105,000 signatures, calling for mandatory education has been delivered to Downing Street. Currently, relationship and sex education is compulsory for those up to the age of 16. But it's then up to post-16 educational providers to use their existing budget and resources to provide it if they choose to. \"There is much to gain from adding that extra two years on,\" Ms Petron said. \"At 16, that's normally, on average, when young people are starting their first sexual encounters and having sex. \"So they're going to have new questions and different things that concern them than when they were in Year 7 or 8.\" In response to the campaign, a government spokesperson told Sky News: \"All abuse is abhorrent, and this government is determined to root it out as part of our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade through our Plan for Change. \"As part of our review of the relationships, sex and health curriculum, the education secretary has been clear that she will ensure children are learning the skills they need to build positive, healthy relationships, right from primary school. \"More widely, we are considering every option to fundamentally transform the system and address the issue of domestic abuse head on, and that includes everything from supporting victims to looking at whether we need to change the law.\" Read more from Sky News:Nursery worker convicted of mistreating 21 childrenFlawed data 'used repeatedly to dismiss grooming gangs claims'Human leg found on UK beach Ms Petron believes lessons like this could protect young women and men from a future of potential abuse and violence. \"I think there's so much at risk,\" she added. \"I think when I say that it's a life-saving education, I'm not just saying that as a big kind of catchy statement, it's because I genuinely believe it. \"That if all young people, regardless of their gender, are well-equipped to know the signs of abuse, what a healthy relationship looks like, how to maintain healthy sexual health, all of these really important things, I think people will be kept safer from the kind of abuse that I've faced.\""

It kept them warm and well.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n        The makers of air fryers and other smart home appliances have new guidelines around what information they can collect from people's homes. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) released the guidance today after an investigation by Which? revealed in December that some air fryers, smart TVs and smartwatches are collecting data on their owners. \"In our increasingly connected world, we shouldn't have to choose between enjoying the benefits of smart products and our own privacy,\" said Stephen Almond, executive director for regulatory risk at the ICO. \"We all rightly have a greater expectation of privacy in our own homes, so we must be able to trust smart products are respecting our privacy, using our personal information responsibly and only in ways we would expect.\" Three air fryers, made by China's Xiaomi, Tencent and Aigostar, recorded audio on their owners' phones for no specified reason, according to the Which? study. The Aigostar and Xiaomi fryers also sent personal data to Chinese servers, although this was flagged in the privacy notice supplied with the product. \"Whether it's an air fryer that wants to know your exact location, or a smartwatch app that listens while you sleep, it's clear that some companies have been pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable on privacy,\" said Andy Laughlin, a tech expert at Which?, in response to the new rules. \"ICO's much-needed guidance marks an important first step towards ensuring consumers can have confidence when buying smart products for their home - but this must be backed by effective enforcement, including against companies that operate abroad.\" Read more from Sky News:First woman to head MI6Dig for remains of 800 infants begins Four out of five people in the UK are thought to own at least one smart appliance, according to research by TechUK, and the new guidance is designed to protect them from disproportionate surveillance. The ICO says manufacturers and developers must \"adopt a data protection by design and default approach\". This means considering data protection while the appliance is being designed and then all the way throughout the lifecycle of the product. The ICO recommends a series of questions developers should ask themselves including: \"Do you need to use personal information?\" Smartwatches and fitness trackers are also included in the new guidance, with the ICO warning information like a user's BMI or fertility counts as special category data and should be treated with extra caution. Which?'s investigation found the Huawei Ultimate smartwatch requested nine \"risky\" phone permissions - the most of all the devices in the study. \"Risky\" permissions generally include knowing the user's precise location, the ability to record audio, access to stored files or an ability to see all other apps installed. Huawei said all of the permissions it asks for have a justified need. There is no suggestion of illegal behaviour by any of the companies mentioned in the study. \"We want to help organisations get this right from the start - but we are ready to take action if necessary to protect people from harm,\" said Mr Almond. \"When you bring a new smart product into your home, you can feel confident that we have your back.\""

        "Content": "A \"forever chemical\" that scientists worry might have an impact on reproduction has been found in all but one of 32 rivers tested across the UK, according to a study. Researchers say trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which can take hundreds of years to break down, was detected at 98% of the 54 sites they investigated. According to the study, one sample - taken from the River Kelvin in Glasgow - contained the second-highest value of TFA ever recorded in surface water globally. The researchers say the average concentrations of TFA in the UK are at the \"higher end\" of the global scale compared with the results obtained from other studies - and that the chemical has been found in 31 of the 32 rivers analysed. The research - funded by environmental charity Fidra and carried out by the University of York - looked at how much TFA was present in surface water. It marks the first time such a project has been carried out in the UK. TFA is a type of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) - also known as \"forever chemicals\" - found in pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fluorinated gases (F-gases). But there is \"growing concern\" about the general impact on human health and its potential risks to drinking water supplies. According to Fidra, TFA is thought to have \"low to moderate\" toxicity; however, because levels are rapidly rising in the environment, there are concerns about future impactsâ€‹. Studies have linked TFA exposure to birth defects in rabbits, while similar short-chained PFAS have been shown to have toxic effects on freshwater organisms. The German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) has applied to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for TFA to be classified as toxic for reproduction. However, its impacts are still being researched. 'Increasingly concerned' Experts say the results of the latest study provide \"compelling evidence of the presence of TFA and PFAS in UK waterways\". The researchers added: \"These data should be further analysed to try and establish the drivers of TFA contamination in UK surface waters and routes for source control should be prioritised. \"The scientific communities are becoming increasingly concerned about the potentially harmful properties of TFA and increasing levels in the environment, particularly in water sources. \"There are currently no practical or economically viable ways to remove TFA from water supplies. \"TFA was found in 31 of the 32 rivers examined.\" Read more from Sky News:Bonuses for water bosses bannedWater bosses face jail for illegal sewage spills  Samples were taken from sites across northern England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Scientists say TFA has the potential to cause reproductive and liver issues in mammals and is harmful to aquatic life. It also accumulates in crops and fields and \"builds up\" in drinking water. The research comes as a committee of MPs said the UK's water sector is in need of \"root-and-branch reform\". The cross-party Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) committee said the industry is \"failing\" - and trust and accountability in the sector was \"very low\"."

Dr Salvador Plasencia, who will admit to four counts of distribution of ketamine, faces up to a maximum of 40 years in prison. He is among five people charged in connection with the death of Friends star Perry, 54, whose body was found in his hot tub by his assistant in October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine and other factors caused him to lose consciousness and drown. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal treatment for depression, but had begun seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. Plasencia is accused of supplying the bulk of Perry's ketamine in his final weeks. He and three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for their cooperation. Jasmine Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major ketamine dealer, is alleged to have provided the dose that killed the actor and is the only defendant who has pleaded not guilty to the prosecution's case. \n                  Lisa Kudrow says the cast of Friends only met up once after hit show ended - as she speaks about Matthew Perry's death\n                 \n                  Matthew Perry: Courteney Cox pays tribute to Friends co-star a year on from his death\n                 \n                  Friends star Jennifer Aniston pays tribute to Matthew Perry on first anniversary of his death\n                 About a month before the actor's death, Perry found Plasencia, a doctor who allegedly asked another doctor, Mark Chavez, to obtain the drug for him, according to court filings in the Chavez case. \"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to court filings from prosecutors.

Chavez has pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute ketamine to Perry. Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A juror has been dismissed from the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex-trafficking trial after hearing five weeks of evidence. Judge Arun Subramanian said he had \"concerns\" about the jury member's \"candour\" and made the decision after it emerged the man - Juror 6 - had given inconsistent answers about where he lives. This could indicate he potentially had an agenda, that he wanted to be on the panel hearing the Combs trial for a purpose, the judge said, and there was nothing the juror could say that would \"put the genie back in the bottle\". Diddy trial: Day 24 - as it happened Questions over whether the juror, a black male, resided in New York or across the Hudson River in the state of New Jersey first arose at the end of last week - but defence lawyers argued dismissing him would disrupt the diversity of the jury. However, the judge rejected this argument ahead of the start of Monday's court session, excusing the juror and replacing him with one of the alternates, a white male. A review of the juror's answers to questions about his residency during jury selection, along with his subsequent responses to similar questions, revealed \"clear inconsistencies\", the judge said. \"Taking these all together, the record raised serious concerns as to the juror's candour and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury,\" Judge Subramanian said. Leaving the juror on the panel could threaten the integrity of the judicial process, he added. \"The court should not, indeed cannot, let race factor into the decision of what happens. Here, the answer is clear. Juror number six is excused,\" Judge Subramanian said. Sean 'Diddy' Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex-trafficking, and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has strenuously denied all allegations of sexual abuse. The hip-hop mogul's defence team has described him as \"a complicated man\" but say the case is not. They have conceded Combs could be violent and that jurors might not condone his proclivity for \"kinky sex\". However, they argue this was a consensual \"swingers\" lifestyle and was not illegal. Special agent and paralegal testify Following the juror's dismissal, the sixth week of the trial began - with testimony from a paralegal specialist and a special agent, who both gave evidence as summary witnesses. This means they were not involved in the criminal investigation into Combs, but were tasked with reviewing some evidence, including charts, phone records and data. In court, the aim is to provide context to the testimony heard so far and how it relates to the charges against the hip-hop mogul. During paralegal specialist Ananya Sankar's testimony, the court heard about texts appearing to reference \"freak offs\" - sexual encounters with male escorts which former girlfriends Cassie Ventura and \"Jane\", two of three alleged victims to give evidence during the trial, both say Combs forced them into. Cassie was in an on-off relationship with Combs from 2007 to 2018, while Jane - a pseudonym - dated him on and off from the beginning of 2021 to his arrest in September 2024. Chicken soup and $4,000 cash In messages from March 2016, Combs's then chief of staff Kristina Khorram appeared to ask an assistant to set a hotel room up, with items requested including Gatorade, water and chicken noodle soup. \"He wants you to go right away now please,\" a message said. In another text, Khorram asked workers to fetch $4,000 in cash and to ensure a male escort was given access to the hotel room, the court heard. The court also heard about messages sent around the time of the bombshell civil lawsuit filed against Combs by Cassie in November 2023 - which was settled within 24 hours for a then undisclosed sum, revealed to be $20m during the trial. By this time, Combs was seeing Jane. According to an audio file of a conversation, Jane told Combs after finding out about Cassie's lawsuit: \"I don't know what I'm feeling... this is so word for word, it is crazy and it just feels sick to my stomach.\" On 28 November 2023, about two weeks later, Jane told Combs she felt he exploited her with their \"dark and humiliating lifestyle\". The following month, the court heard Jane said in a message to Khorram: \"He said he would expose me and send videos to my baby daddy... I am traumatised by my time with him.\" Jane said she would not normally involve Khorram in such matters, but told her she needed help as Combs was having one of his \"evil-ass psychotic bipolar\" episodes. Jane told Khorram that she was heavily drugged in the tapes. Although it was not clear exactly what she was referencing, a message sent to Combs by Khorram around the time of the lawsuit seemed to show some friction between the pair. \"If you cannot be honest with me this doesn't work,\" she told him, according to the messages. Combs \"keeping things\" to himself put them in the \"situation we are all in right now\", she added. Towards the end of the court day, videos entered into evidence under seal were played by the prosecution. This means the jury and lawyers could see and hear what was happening, but members of the public in court could not. Read more:Everything you need to know about the trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' CombsWhat we learned from Cassie's testimony Prosecutors have said they expect to conclude their case later this week. After this, Combs's defence team will begin theirs. Last week, Kanye West turned up at the court in Manhattan, New York, to support the rapper, spending about 40 minutes in the building watching proceedings on a monitor in an overflow room. Combs's mother, Janice Combs, and several of his children have also consistently shown up throughout the hearing. Diddy denies charges of sex-trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy. The trial continues."
