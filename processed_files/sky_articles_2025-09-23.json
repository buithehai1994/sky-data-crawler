        "Content": " Donald Trump disparaged the Russian military and backed Ukraine to retake all its occupied territory in an astonishing about-turn on the war. In a post on Truth Social, made after talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations in New York, the US president said a return to \"the original borders from where this war started is very much an option\". \"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\" he wrote. Mr Trump said \"time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO\" could help Kyv win back lost territory, and said Russia was in \"economic trouble\". He said Moscow had been \"fighting aimlessly\" for three-and-a-half years - and had it been a \"real military power\" it would have defeated Ukraine in less than a week. \"This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger',\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy told Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone it was a \"big shift\" from his US counterpart. He later admitted he was surprised by Mr Trump's comments, telling Fox News' Special Report he has a better relationship with the president than before. Read more: Why emboldened Trump has changed his stance on Ukraine Trump's patience not 'infinite' Mr Trump also appeared to pour cold water on his hopes of persuading Vladimir Putin to sign a peace deal. Speaking to Emmanuel Macron at the UN summit, he said their relationship had turned out to be meaningless. Just last month, Mr Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Russian president at a summit in Alaska - in a push to expedite the war's conclusion. Before returning to the White House, he repeatedly claimed he'd be able to end the conflict in 24 hours. Speaking at the UN Security Council, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, admitted ending the war had proven an \"extraordinary challenge\". He said Mr Trump had \"worked on it tirelessly\", but warned Russia his patience is not \"infinite\".  The US president has previously suggested Ukraine will never be able to reclaim all the territory Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Ukraine has lost large areas of land in the east of the country. In the Donetsk region, Russia now controls about 70% of the territory. Kyiv's forces have been pushed back to four cities analysts have dubbed the \"fortress belt\". Moscow has partly annexed three other regions, too: Luhansk in the east, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson further west. Trump tells NATO to shoot down Russian jets in its skies Meanwhile, Russia appears to be provoking its neighbours to the west. Last week, Estonia said three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes before Italian NATO jets escorted them away. The week before, about 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting NATO jets to shoot some of them down and the alliance to beef up its defence of Europe's eastern flank. While talking to Mr Zelenskyy at the UN, Mr Trump was asked by reporters whether he thought NATO should shoot down any Russian planes that entered NATO airspace. \"Yes, I do,\" Mr Trump replied. On Truth Social, he said the US would continue to supply weapons to NATO, and it was for the alliance to \"do what they want with them\".

He added: \"Most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine. Putin and Russia are in big economic trouble and this is the time for Ukraine to act.\" He has called on European and NATO allies to increase economic sanctions on Moscow. In a joint statement following the president's comments, G7 foreign ministers said discussions were ongoing about additional economic sanctions on Russia."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  As U-turns go, it's a game-changer. Donald Trump has pivoted from pressing Ukraine to surrender territory to suggesting it's able to win all its land back. This is the man who threw Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy out of the White House in February and brought Russia's Vladimir Putin in from the cold in Alaska last month. So, why the handbrake turn from framing negotiations as the most practical outcome to a new-found confidence in Ukraine, when supported by its European neighbours and NATO? Firstly, it could be the military and economic reality on the ground. Russia's paying a high price for the war, both in manpower and finances. Trump has acknowledged that Moscow is in \"big economic trouble\", which strengthens the case for Ukraine prevailing with Western help. Ukraine's resilience has also shifted perceptions - the impossible now looking possible if allies remain committed. Secondly, it could be the influence of allies. European leaders flew to Washington en masse last month to urge caution in dealings with Putin. European NATO members have stepped up aid to Ukraine, further weakening the President's rhetoric about America carrying the financial burden. He's suddenly aligning himself with European countries, endorsing the shooting down of Russian planes violating their airspace. Thirdly, it could be more about domestic politics, with the president under bipartisan scrutiny at home over his \"softly, softly\" approach to Russia. A tougher national defence posture could help him consolidate support among Republicans, while also appealing to moderates, who regard the defence of Ukraine as a test of national credibility.  Trump versus the world There's another factor worth considering - Trump's negotiating tactic. He has a long record of changing position to gain leverage. Talk of compromise might have been the strategy for getting Ukraine and Russia into talks, but with Russia showing no willingness to compromise, his calculation shifting back to the restoration of Ukraine. Whatever the reason for his change of heart, and whether it translates into US policy, the last three days have shown an emboldened Trump. From his declaration of \"hate\" for his opponents during a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, to his sensational claim to have \"found an answer on autism\", to his derision of the UN, he's unfiltered right now. Place him in front of a microphone or online, and it's Trump versus the world."

        "Content": " Former tennis star Boris Becker has told Sky News he was \"shocked\" by widespread drug use and overcrowded conditions during his time behind bars in the UK. Becker claimed there weren't enough officers to manage nearly 2,000 inmates at London's Wandsworth Prison, where he was jailed for hiding Â£2.5m of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. The 57-year-old German told The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee: \"Who's controlling who? It's just so overcrowded.\" In his new book about life on the inside, he says the \"wardens are in charge until they weren't\". He told Sky News: \"Mine was a white-collar crime, as they say, but my next-door cell neighbour was a murderer, opposite was a paedophile and on the right there were people smugglers and serious drug dealers. \"Everyone is together, so naturally there's friction.\" 'You could get pretty much everything' The former sportsman, who won Wimbledon three times, was in HMP Wandsworth for several weeks as part of his sentence and was released from jail in December 2022. He served just eight months of a two-and-a-half-year jail term but was deported afterwards despite having lived in the UK for a decade. Becker said it was an eye-opener that it was possible for some prison inmates to get hold of contraband. \"I didn't know you could get pretty much everything inside,\" he said. \"I'm talking about the drugs, talking about small phones, talking about food - whatever you wanted. Even a bit of alcohol on the weekends.\" \"That shocked me,\" he admitted. \"The most common drug on the inside was called spice, I'd never heard of it before,\" said Becker, adding: \"Everyone knows who's doing what, it's just a lot of people choose to look away.\" Spice is a synthetic drug that is incredibly strong and addictive, and has been a problem in prisons for a number of years. It is understood that there were 240 prison officers available for duty at the time Becker was in prison in Wandsworth. He was one of about 1,500 prisoners at the jail. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The government inherited a prison system in crisis overcrowded, crumbling infrastructure and our hard-working prison staff at risk of violence and harm. \"We have already taken action to improve safety, security, and conditions at HMP Wandsworth. We have deployed specialist staff and will redirect Â£100m to be spent over five years.\""

The actress, who starred in more than 100 films and made-for-TV productions, died in Nemours, France, surrounded by her children, her agent told the AFP news agency. At the age of 17 she won a beauty contest in Tunisia, where she was born to Sicilian parents, and was rewarded with a trip to the Venice Film Festival, kick-starting her acting career. She had expected to become a schoolteacher before she entered the beauty contest. Cardinale gained international fame in 1963 when she starred in both Federico Fellini's 8-1/2 and The Leopard. She went on to star in the comedy The Pink Panther and Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West in 1968. She considered 1966's The Professionals as the best of her Hollywood films.

        "Content": "A 59-year-old man has been found guilty of trying to assassinate Donald Trump on a golf course.  Ryan Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen shortly after he was convicted on all five charges against him. Marshals quickly surrounded Routh and he did not hurt himself. They then dragged him out of the courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida. His daughter Sara Routh screamed: \"Dad I love you don't do anything. I'll get you out. He didn't hurt anybody.\" She continued screaming in the courtroom as her father was removed, and she said the case against him was rigged. He was later brought back into court, wearing a white shirt and no tie. There was no blood visible on his neck. The judge wanted to make sure Routh understood he was found guilty. Routh will be sentenced on 18 December, the judge announced. His son Adam said \"we love you Dad\" and Routh turned around and winked as he was taken away.  'Carefully crafted plot' A jury of five men and seven women decided Routh intended to kill Mr Trump when he pointed a rifle through a fence as the then US presidential candidate was playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September last year. Routh fled without firing a shot after a Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Mr Trump saw Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case. At the start of the trial, prosecutor John Shipley said \"this plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious\", adding that without the agent intervening, \"Donald Trump would not be alive\". The charges against Routh Routh had been charged with attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. The incident occurred weeks after a bullet grazed the president's ear in another assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Read more from Sky News:Trump's claims at UN AssemblyUS president makes full-throttle assault on UN  Routh, who faces the prospect of life in prison, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him and chose to defend himself in court. He spent weeks plotting to kill Mr Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican candidate played golf on 15 September 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club, according to prosecutors. What did Routh say? Routh told jurors in his closing argument that he did not intend to kill anyone that day. \"It's hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled,\" Routh said. He said he could see Mr Trump as he was on the path toward the sixth-hole green and noted he also could have shot a Secret Service agent who confronted him if he had intended to harm anyone. Trump's reaction Following the guilty verdict, the president said on Truth Social that Routh was \"an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him\". He thanked the Secret Service and \"the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime\", and provided authorities with his vehicle registration number. The guilty verdict \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence\", Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. \"This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our president, but an affront to our very nation,\" Ms Bondi said."

Daniel Bannister, 50, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting a single charge of breaching a restraining order. He was also given a new restraining order, which warns him against contacting the former Girls Aloud singer. \"You are causing her anxiety,\" Judge Alan Blake told him. \"She does not wish any contact with you. You have shown defiance to the court order. You need to draw a line under that behaviour.\" Bannister turned up at Tweedy's rural home for the fourth time on 19 June. Reading Crown Court heard he arrived in a taxi just before 10pm and rang the intercom twice before peering over the gate. Bannister believed the singer had invited him to her home over Microsoft Teams, the court was told. Tweedy said she was \"stunned\" when Bannister visited her home yet again and had been forced to hire security. \"Each time he returns the worry of his intentions intensifies,\" she said in a victim impact statement. \"I'm worried, nervous and on edge every time I open my gate.

During that appearance, the court heard that Tweedy \"immediately panicked\" and was \"terrified\" when she saw him outside her home, fearing for the safety of her eight-year-old son Bear. Bannister killed Rajendra Patel, 48, at a south London YMCA shelter in 2012 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Mr Patel died from an injury to his leg, a court heard.

In a statement, the club said: \"It is with profound sadness that The Yorkshire County Cricket Club announces the passing of Harold Dennis 'Dickie' Bird MBE OBE, one of cricket's most beloved figures, who died peacefully at home at the age of 92. \"Dickie Bird enjoyed an illustrious career as an international umpire, writing his name into history as the most famous and popular official in the game's history. \"He is synonymous with Yorkshire Cricket, where he has been one of the most loyal supporters. In 2014, he was named President of The Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a role he held with pride and distinction, with the club winning two County Championship titles during his tenure.\" Describing him as \"one of the most prominent umpires of his era\", the club said he \"will be truly missed by all at the club, having spent an incredible amount of time in support of everyone here and will be remembered as one of the greatest characters in Yorkshire's history\".  Bird came to be one of the best-known figures in the sport, an outstanding umpire also famous for his amusing interactions with players and fans alike, as well as his seeming talent for being involved in quirky, memorable moments. \n                  'Living with a death sentence': NHS cadaver implant leaves woman with one of world's rarest diseases\n                 \n                  'Critically ill with one of the world's rarest diseases in a remote corner of the British Isles'\n                 \n                  Boris Becker 'shocked' by drug use and overcrowding during his time in UK prison\n                 Among the incidents that saw his legend grow were a bomb scare at Lord's, when he observed proceedings while sitting on the covers in the centre of the pitch, the burst water pipes at Headingley and his entertaining exchange of opinions with a frustrated crowd, a first recorded instance of \"good light stopped play\" thanks to a Trent Bridge greenhouse and an elbow injury sustained while slipping in the showers at the Women's World Cup. Blessed with a good nature and vivid character, the unmarried and childless Bird's wide popularity ultimately transcended umpiring. His autobiography sold more than a million copies, becoming the nation's biggest-selling sports book ever, and he entertained the public for years as a TV personality and travelling raconteur. In a favoured story, he claimed his one-man show drew a bigger audience in Leeds than superstar singer Shirley Bassey. He was awarded an MBE in 1986 and an OBE in 2012 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to cricket.  In an umpiring career spanning nearly 30 years, he stood in 66 Test matches and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals.  'One of the best umpires there's ever been' Former England cricket captain Sir Ian Botham told Sky News: \"He was special. We used to take the mickey out of him, saying, 'oh, come on, Dickie, you've got to give some decisions'. \"But, you know, 99.9% of the time, he was spot on. He had a good sense of humour. I saw him not very long ago. And, I'm quite shocked to see that he passed away. He looked in pretty good order. He hadn't really changed that much when I saw him last. \"So, very sad. And 92 - he'll be disappointed he didn't get those extra eight for a century.\" Sir Ian added: \"He just loved the game of cricket. He was born for cricket. And, he played it, he wanted to be a professional. He wasn't quite good enough, but he was certainly one of the best umpires there's ever been in the game.\" South African-born former England cricketer Allan Lamb told Sky News: \"Dickie was a wonderful man... a lot of people complained he never gave anyone out. But (the) majority of the time he was bang on.\" 'Proud Yorkshireman and much-loved umpire' The England and Wales Cricket Board said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of Bird, who it described as \"a proud Yorkshireman and a much-loved umpire\" who \"will be sorely missed\". Barnsley Football Club, of whom Bird was a keen supporter and attended their match against Reading just 10 days ago, will hold a minute's applause before Tuesday's Carabao Cup fixture against Brighton. Former England wicketkeeper Jack Russell called him \"unique. One off. The greatest\". Broadcaster Piers Morgan called him \"the greatest and most legendary umpire in cricket history\". Former prime minister David Cameron called Bird \"a national treasure\", adding: \"Farewell friend\".    Lifelong bond with Boycott and Parkinson Harold Dennis Bird was born in Barnsley in 1933 and might have been a footballer, after earning a youth contract with his hometown club, before a knee injury at 15 effectively ended his career. The young Bird had always loved cricket, too, and honed his technique in the nets at Barnsley Cricket Club, where he met two of Yorkshire's other favourite sons, Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Parkinson, all three forming a lifelong bond. Bird claimed to have a technique to rival Boycott, but a temperament less suited to elite competition. Dropped after his highest score His top score for the county was 181 not out, but he was dropped for the very next match. He left Yorkshire over a lack of opportunities and retired at the age of 32 with an average of 20.71. Keen to stay involved in the game, he took up umpiring and in 1970, stood in his first county match, with his first Test match following three years later. He retired from tests in 1996 and from all cricket two years later. As an umpire, he was an instinctive 'not outer', which contributed to some of his mostly good-natured interactions with bowlers.

        "Content": " Former tennis star Boris Becker has told Sky News he was \"shocked\" by widespread drug use and overcrowded conditions during his time behind bars in the UK. Becker claimed there weren't enough officers to manage nearly 2,000 inmates at London's Wandsworth Prison, where he was jailed for hiding Â£2.5m of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. The 57-year-old German told The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee: \"Who's controlling who? It's just so overcrowded.\" In his new book about life on the inside, he says the \"wardens are in charge until they weren't\". He told Sky News: \"Mine was a white-collar crime, as they say, but my next-door cell neighbour was a murderer, opposite was a paedophile and on the right there were people smugglers and serious drug dealers. \"Everyone is together, so naturally there's friction.\" 'You could get pretty much everything' The former sportsman, who won Wimbledon three times, was in HMP Wandsworth for several weeks as part of his sentence and was released from jail in December 2022. He served just eight months of a two-and-a-half-year jail term but was deported afterwards despite having lived in the UK for a decade. Becker said it was an eye-opener that it was possible for some prison inmates to get hold of contraband. \"I didn't know you could get pretty much everything inside,\" he said. \"I'm talking about the drugs, talking about small phones, talking about food - whatever you wanted. Even a bit of alcohol on the weekends.\" \"That shocked me,\" he admitted. \"The most common drug on the inside was called spice, I'd never heard of it before,\" said Becker, adding: \"Everyone knows who's doing what, it's just a lot of people choose to look away.\" Spice is a synthetic drug that is incredibly strong and addictive, and has been a problem in prisons for a number of years. It is understood that there were 240 prison officers available for duty at the time Becker was in prison in Wandsworth. He was one of about 1,500 prisoners at the jail. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The government inherited a prison system in crisis overcrowded, crumbling infrastructure and our hard-working prison staff at risk of violence and harm. \"We have already taken action to improve safety, security, and conditions at HMP Wandsworth. We have deployed specialist staff and will redirect Â£100m to be spent over five years.\""

        "Headline": "A lawyer for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, originally from Ethopia, told the court that he wants to be deported.",
        "Content": " An asylum seeker has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 41, had been staying at The Bell Hotel in the Essex town, with the incident fuelling weeks of protests at the site. The Ethiopian national was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and harassment without violence earlier this month. It is understood the Home Office will seek to deport Kebatu following his prison sentence. Kebatu's lawyer, Molly Dyas, told Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Tuesday he wanted to be deported, calling it his \"firm wish\" and a view he held \"before the trial\". Under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months. Handing sentence, district judge Christopher Williams said the asylum seeker posed a \"significant risk of reoffending\". He also told the court that Kebatu \"couldn't have anticipated\" his offending \"would cause such a response from the public\". \"Particularly in Epping,\" the judge said, \"but also across the UK, resulting in mass demonstrations and fear that children in the UK are not safe. \"It's evident to me that your shame and remorse isn't because of the offences you've committed but because of the impact they've had.\"  Kebatu bowed his head to the judge before he was led to the cells. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court was told Kebatu had tried to kiss the teenager, put his hand on her thigh and brushed her hair after she offered him pizza. The asylum seeker also told the girl and her friend he wanted to have a baby with them and invited them back to the hotel. The incident happened on 7 July, about a week after he arrived in the UK on a boat.

He denied all the charges but was convicted earlier this month. Kebatu knew 'Epping is in chaos' over actions Prosecutor Stuart Cowen, discussing a pre-sentence report, said Kebatu admitted \"he didn't know the UK was so strict, even though he knew the Ethiopian age of consent was 18\". Kebatu understood that \"Epping is in chaos\" because of what he did and that he \"had got a lot of migrants in trouble\", Mr Cowen said. He added that the asylum seeker \"felt very sad and felt a lot of remorse\", but added: \"The word manipulative is used within the report.\" Read more from Sky News:Legendary cricket umpire Dickie Bird diesDiddy subjected to 'maggots' and 'routine violence'Child-on-child sex abuse crisis revealed  Victim: Wearing skirt 'makes me feel vulnerable' Mr Cowen also read statements from both victims, with the 14-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, saying she is now \"checking over my shoulder\" when she is out with friends. She said she prepared the statement \"so that the man who did this to me understands what he has done to me - a 14-year-old girl\". She continued: \"Every time I go out with my friends, I'm checking over my shoulder. \"Wearing a skirt now makes me feel vulnerable and exposed. Seeing the bench [where the sexual assault took place] reminds me of everything that happened.\" The adult woman who was sexually assaulted by Kebatu and who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said: \"Since the incident, I feel both angered and frustrated. \"He [Kebatu] did not even appear to know that what he's done was wrong.\"  "

        "Content": " The Home Office has lost a Court of Appeal bid to challenge a High Court ruling granting an Eritrean man a temporary block on being deported to France. The ruling will be a blow to ministers, who had been hoping to make headway with their \"one in, one out\" migrant returns deal with France. Politics latest: Don't let Trump's America become Farage's Britain, Ed Davey says Under the deal, the UK can send back any migrant who crosses the Channel illegally in return for accepting the same number of migrants in France who have a valid asylum claim here. However, only four people have been deported under the scheme so far, including one Afghan individual who was deported to France this afternoon. The Eritrean man was granted a temporary block on his removal after he claimed he had been a victim of modern slavery. The government has said up to 50 people a week could be deported under the scheme initially, but it believes numbers would grow and eventually act as a deterrent to those considering making the dangerous journey across the Channel. \n                  Iranian man becomes third migrant deported under UK-France deal\n                 \n                  David Lammy defends migrant returns deal with France - as 1,000 people cross Channel in one day\n                 \n                  Second deportation flight of week under UK-France deal set to take place today\n                 Last Friday saw more than 1,000 people cross the Channel to the UK in small boats - the day after the first migrant was deported under the \"one in, one out\" deal. The latest Home Office figures show 1,072 people made the journey in 13 boats - averaging more than 82 people per boat. It means the number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel has topped 30,000 for the year so far. Shabana Mahmood, who was promoted to home secretary in the prime minister's reshuffle earlier this month, has accused migrants who try to block their deportation of making a \"mockery\" of the UK's modern slavery laws. She has vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to end crossings - but the Conservatives have branded the \"one in, one out\" deal with France \"meagre\" and have called for their Rwanda policy to be reinstated. Read more:UK health officials push back on Trump's paracetamol claimsWhat will the UK's 'recognition' of Palestine achieve? Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: \"Yet again the courts have stepped in to block a deportation, proving what we warned from the start, unless you tackle the lawfare strangling Britain's borders, nothing will change. \"This is nothing but a gimmick. Even if by some miracle it worked, it would still be no deterrent, as 94 per cent of arrivals would still stay.\" Meanwhile, Reform UK has promised to crack down on both legal and illegal migration. Last month, party leader Nigel Farage outlined plans to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants in the first parliament of a potential Reform UK government. On Monday, he announced fresh policies to reduce legal migration, saying his party would ban access to benefits to migrants and get rid of indefinite leave to remain - the term used to describe the right to settle in the UK, with access to benefits, after five years."

        "Content": "By Duncan Gardham, security journalist  The Southport killer possessed large amounts of anti-Islamist material, including cartoons Muslims would find \"highly offensive\", the inquiry into the killings has heard.Â  The family of the killer believed his fascination with violence came from \"an interest in studying history,\" the hearing was told. Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July last year by Axel Rudakubana, who was later jailed for a minimum of 52 years. An examination of two tablet devices used by Rudakubana - referred to as AR at the hearing - was outlined to the inquiry and included pdf documents \"suggestive of violence, an interest in religion and conflict\", Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the inquiry said. Some were in the form of academic textbooks but even those appeared to deal with war and conflict, while others were \"more extreme\" and related to \"overt violence\", Mr Moss added. However, the case was never taken over by counter-terrorism police because Rudakubana had a \"fascination with violence and inappropriate material\" but was \"not somebody who was motivated by any particular religion, racial hatred, or matters of that kind,\" Mr Moss said. The documents included an interest in the fight against ISIS in Mosul, the Russian republic of Chechnya, Nazi Germany, the Zulu War in South Africa in 1879, punishments dealt to slave rebels and a book on Japanese ninja, as well as the Rwandan genocide, where Rudakubana's parents were born. \n                  Southport teacher Heidi Liddle battles 'crushing guilt' after surviving attack in which three children died\n                 \n                  'Deeply loved' father shot dead in Stoke Newington named\n                 \n                  Mum whose teenage son was murdered with ninja sword hails new law named after him\n                 Detective Chief Inspector Jason Pye, the senior investigating officer, said: \"AR clearly had an interest in numerous wars, violence... The majority of these were quite extreme in the title or in the material that was found within them.\" There were also a number of Jpeg images related to the slavery of women and anti-Islamic material. In total, police collected 247 pages of relevant images not \"consistent with a young man who had come across a highly inappropriate image during the course of other searches by accident,\" Mr Moss said. He told the inquiry: \"After this attack, there may have been suggestions and speculation about this attack being what might be described as an Islamist attack. \"Is it right that the anti-Islamic material on AR's device was quite voluminous?\" \"That's correct. There was yes,\" DCI Pye said. There was also anti-Semitic material and imagery of victims of the Nazis and the Twin Towers, which were subject to the 9/11 attacks by al Qaeda. More from the inquiry:Taxi driver waited 50 minutes to call 999Killer's parents 'knew risk he posed'The missed chances to stop Rudakubana Rudakubana had used several virtual private networks (VPNs) on an older tablet device, to disguise its location. The device included documents on warfare and weaponry, including references to nitro-glycerine, dynamite, electronic detonators, future warfare, and the influence of hypersonic weapons. Documents about young people's mental health There were also two documents that referred to mental health treatment of young people, including those from diverse communities. On 30 August and 4 September 2021, Rudakubana downloaded a 190-page document titled Military Studies In The Jihad Against The Tyrants, commonly referred to as the \"al Qaeda training manual\". The inquiry was told that the last of three referrals to the Prevent de-radicalisation scheme, provoked by concerns about violent material he had been viewing at school, was closed in May 2021. Knife ordered on Amazon Rudakubana ordered the knife he used in the attack on Amazon two weeks earlier, the inquiry was told. Amazon says there was a form of age verification but Rudakubana was able to use his father's details, which then tallied with the electoral roll, and that was sufficient to pass the age verification process, the inquiry was told. Plan formed a week earlier The Southport killer may only have hatched his plan to attack a school a week earlier, when he was stopped by his parents, the inquiry heard. Rudakubana had been excluded from the Range High School in Formby in October 2019 and had returned two months later carrying a knife and a hockey stick and had assaulted a pupil, leaving him with a broken wrist. On 22 July 2024, Rudakubana asked his father when the Range school broke up for the summer, and Alphonse looked at his phone and saw that it was the last day of term that day, he later told police. Rudakubana called a taxi and when it came, got into the back and told the driver he wanted to go to the Range High School. But, as they were about to set off, the teenager's father came running out of the house, the driver later told police. 'Don't take him', father pleads He was said to be \"pleading\" with the taxi driver, \"don't take him, don't take him\" and Rudakubana, who was aged 17, replied: \"I'm 18, I want to go, take me.\" The driver told Rudakubana to get out of the taxi. Rudakubana's father told police later he suspected that his son had a weapon with him that day, but did not call the police at the time, the inquiry heard. The parents did have some knowledge of his possession of knives, the hearing was told, including one occasion when he went to school with a knife taken from the family kitchen, and another when a parcel was delivered to the family home and he intercepted it. The child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) had also advised them to remove knives from the address or secure them so Rudakubana could not get to them. Alphonse also told police that on 22 July, it was one of the rare occasions he was able to get into his son's bedroom and found items including an alcohol bottle and containers that were later found to contain the poison ricin."

Daniel Bannister, 50, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting a single charge of breaching a restraining order. He was also given a new restraining order, which warns him against contacting the former Girls Aloud singer. \"You are causing her anxiety,\" Judge Alan Blake told him. \"She does not wish any contact with you. You have shown defiance to the court order. You need to draw a line under that behaviour.\" Bannister turned up at Tweedy's rural home for the fourth time on 19 June. Reading Crown Court heard he arrived in a taxi just before 10pm and rang the intercom twice before peering over the gate. Bannister believed the singer had invited him to her home over Microsoft Teams, the court was told. Tweedy said she was \"stunned\" when Bannister visited her home yet again and had been forced to hire security. \"Each time he returns the worry of his intentions intensifies,\" she said in a victim impact statement. \"I'm worried, nervous and on edge every time I open my gate.

During that appearance, the court heard that Tweedy \"immediately panicked\" and was \"terrified\" when she saw him outside her home, fearing for the safety of her eight-year-old son Bear. Bannister killed Rajendra Patel, 48, at a south London YMCA shelter in 2012 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Mr Patel died from an injury to his leg, a court heard.

Prince William said the couples have \"faced such horror\" but from that they \"move forward with grace and fortitude\". On Tuesday, the heir to the throne and the Princess of Wales met the parents of Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, as they were welcomed by pupils at the schools the girls attended. The three youngsters were fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town on 29 July 2024 by Axel Rudakubana, who was sentenced in January to life in prison with a minimum term of 52 years. The visit came as an inquiry is under way to examine the circumstances surrounding the attack and the events leading up to it. The royal couple first went to Elsie's school Farnborough Road Infant and Junior School and then Churchtown Primary School, which Alice and Bebe had attended. At the latter school, Prince William and Kate were shown around a new playground which was built in the victims' memory following a fundraising campaign. \n                  Trump100: The King and the Donald\n                 \n                  Sword, book and Union flag among gifts exchanged between the King and Donald Trump\n                 \n                  Arrests after Trump-Epstein images projected on to Windsor Castle\n                 Speaking to the school's 700 pupils, William said: \"This playground is a symbol of how the community have come together to create such a positive space for the pupils of this school - a symbol of remembrance and resilience, a testament that love will always overcome tragedy.\" He said the teaching communities at both schools had gone \"above and beyond to help heal this incredible group of young people\". Addressing the parents of Alice, Bebe and Elsie directly, the prince said: \"To Alex and Sergio, Lauren and Ben, Jenni and David - you are parents united in grief. \"You have faced such horror - but from that you move forward with grace and fortitude, creating the most remarkable legacies for your girls. We will always be here to support you.\" William and Kate had private meetings with the three sets of parents, including Elsie's parents Jenni, 36, and David Stancombe, 37. Bebe's mother Lauren King, 42, said of the day's events: \"It meant everything. It was really special. \"I think we're really grateful anyway how Bebe's been honoured so much in this school and seeing the prince and princess support that and be here has been just amazing.\" Ben King, 43, and Lauren King showed William and Kate a wooden wigwam built in the playground which is named The Hive and has the words \"Remember Bebe\" on it. Mrs King said: \"That's what she (Bebe) used to do in the playground, she used to find little secret spots with her friends and sit under and chat and talk. It's just really nice that they've honoured those small little moments. They are small but they mean so much to us, it's lovely.\" Read more from Sky News:Rudakubana had anti-Islamic material, inquiry toldTaxi driver who dropped off attacker 'waited 50 minutes to call 999' Alice's parents Sergio and Alexandra Aguiar showed William and Kate the playground's stage area, which had been built for students with a love of performing. Mrs Aguiar, 34, said: \"Prince William asked if that would be her favourite place and I said 'yeah, she would have been there dancing away'.\" She said the visit had given pupils a \"day they will never forget\". She added: \"It's very special having them here, coming to see what we've all done together in memory of the girls. We turned something very tragic into a positive thing for all of our children. They are happy. It is really nice having them here.\" Mr Aguiar, 38, said: \"It's so special to have them here to support us.\" It is the second time the royal couple have been to Southport in the wake of the attack and subsequent widespread rioting, the first time being last October. Royal correspondent The Prince and Princess of Wales had personally wanted to come back for this visit, here as two parents who had committed to do anything they could to help these families and this community. I was there last October when they first came to Southport, visibly moved by what they heard, they promised they wouldn't forget and they would return. This was their chance to keep that promise, to once again see the families of Elsie, Bebe and Alice, and meet for the first time some of their teachers and classmates. It was a day to importantly remember the girls, but also show how together they are all trying to look forward in a hopeful and positive way, Prince William ending his speech with the words \"be brave, be joyful and be kind\". From the friendship bracelets they were given by Bebe's mum Lauren, to the conversations they had with the children about how they've coped, it felt like it cemented the couple's connection here; a playground full of children in the sunshine saying \"good afternoon Prince of Wales\" making him and others chuckle and smile, indicative of that incredible spirit and resilience they have shown despite everything. We know William and Kate have personally donated money to the fundraising effort that helped to build the special new playground at the school Bebe and Alice went to, and the charities set up in all the girls' names. It is the most prominent example of how they want to use their roles to help specific communities, to keep in contact, to give something back from their position of privilege. This was a genuine heartfelt effort to do whatever they can, as they appreciate nothing can completely heal their pain. With the inquiry into last summer's attack ongoing, many are still having to relive the unimaginable. The Prince and Princess of Wales know they aren't unique in the way they feel about what happened here, the horror of it all is difficult for any of us to fully take in. But what they can do is again remind us of the incredible strength and bravery these families and this community have shown, all in memory of those three beautiful little girls."

        "Headline": "Actor and filmmaker Noel Clarke sued Guardian News and Media (GNM) over a series of articles published from April 2021 - but a High Court judge found the reporting to be \"susbstantially true\".",
        "Content": "Noel Clarke has been ordered to pay at least Â£3m of The Guardian publisher's legal costs after losing his \"far-fetched\" libel case over allegations of sexual misconduct reported by the newspaper. The first article, published in April 2021, said some 20 women who knew the actor and filmmaker in a professional capacity had come forward with allegations including harassment and sexually inappropriate behaviour. Clarke, best known for his 2006 film Kidulthood and for starring in Doctor Who, sued Guardian News and Media (GNM) over seven articles in total, as well as a podcast, and vehemently denied \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\".  Following a trial earlier this year, a High Court judge found the newspaper's reporting was substantially true, agreeing with the publisher's defence of its reporting as both true and in the public interest. At a hearing to determine costs on Tuesday, Clarke represented himself - saying in written submissions to the court that his legal team had resigned as he was unable to provide funding for the hearing. Mrs Justice Steyn ruled that he must pay Â£3m ahead of a further assessment into the total costs to be recovered, which lawyers for the publisher estimate to be more than Â£6m. \"The claimant maintained a far-fetched and indeed a false case that the articles were not substantially true, by pursuing allegations of dishonesty and bad faith against almost all of the defendant's truth witnesses,\" the judge said. The sum of Â£3m sought by GNM was \"appropriate and no more than what ought to be reasonably ordered in this case\", she added, and \"substantially lower than the defendant's likely level of recovery\". Clarke describes proposed costs as 'excessive' Clarke, 49, told the court he used AI platform ChatGPT to help prepare his response to GNM's barrister Gavin Millar KC, who asked the judge to order Â£3m as an interim payment - which he said was \"significantly less\" than the \"norm\" of asking for 75%-80%. The actor described the proposed costs order as \"excessive\", \"inflated\" and \"caused by their own choices\", and asked the court to \"consider both the law and the human reality of these proceedings\". He also requested that the order on costs be held pending an appeal. \"I have not been vexatious and I have not tried to play games with the court,\" Clarke said. \"I have lost my work, my savings, my legal team, my ability to support my family and much of my health. \"My wife and children live every day under the shadow of uncertainty. We remortgaged our home just to survive. Any costs or interim payments must be proportionate to my means as a single household, not the unlimited resources of a major media conglomerate. \"A crushing order would not just punish me, it would punish my children and wife, and they do not deserve that.\" Read more:The key allegations - and the judge's response Detailing GNM's spend, Mr Millar said about 40,000 documents, including audio recordings and transcripts, had to be reviewed as a result of Clarke bringing the case against them. He highlighted a number of \"misconceived applications\" made by the actor which \"required much work from the defendant's lawyers in response\". During the trial, the actor accused GNM - as well as a number of women who made accusations against him - of being part of a conspiracy aiming to destroy his career. This conspiracy allegation \"massively increased the scale and costs of the litigation by giving rise to a whole new unpleaded line of attack against witnesses and third parties\", Mr Millar said in written submissions to the court. Clarke originally asked for damages of Â£10m, increasing to Â£40m and then Â£70m as the case progressed, the barrister said. He must now pay GNM the Â£3m within 28 days, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled."

        "Content": "UK health experts and officials have pushed back on Donald Trump's claim that paracetamol is linked to autism, saying there is \"no evidence\" for it. The US president said on Monday that there had been a \"meteoric rise\" in cases of autism and suggested that the use of Tylenol - an American-branded version of paracetamol - during pregnancy is a potential cause. His claims have been widely corrected by officials, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who said that \"I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this\". Read more:What is autism?All the health claims made by Trump - and what experts say  Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, Mr Streeting said: \"I've just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.\" The health secretary then referenced a major study in Sweden last year that involved 2.4 million children, adding it \"did not uphold those claims\". He added: \"I would just say to people watching, don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. \"In fact, don't take even take my word for it, as a politician - listen to British doctors, British scientists, the NHS.\"  WHO says links 'inconsistent' Patient safety minister Dr Zubir Ahmed MP echoed this on social media, saying: \"For the avoidance of any doubt, Paracetamol remains the safest painkiller to take during pregnancy.\" Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, also said that \"there is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children\". She added that paracetamol \"remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed,\" and that the MHRA's advice \"is based on rigorous assessment of the best available scientific evidence\". ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð The British officials were supported by the European Medicines Agency, which said there was no new evidence that would mean its recommendations for the use of paracetamol during pregnancy would change. Tarik Jasarevic, a World Health Organisation spokesperson, added at a press briefing that the links between the use of the drug and autism \"remains inconsistent\".  Trump: Tylenol 'not good' for pregnant women During a press conference with US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Mr Trump urged pregnant women to stop taking Tylenol. After saying that Mr Kennedy Jr \"wants to be very careful with what he says,\" the US president added: \"Taking Tylenol is not good. All right. I'll say it. It's not good. \"For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary. That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever, that you feel you can't tough it out. You can't do it.

I think it's very bad.\" Mr Jasarevic pushed strongly back on that claim, saying: \"We know that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines, as Isaid, save countless lives. \"So this is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump disparaged the Russian military and backed Ukraine to retake all its occupied territory in an astonishing about-turn on the war. In a post on Truth Social, made after talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations in New York, the US president said a return to \"the original borders from where this war started is very much an option\". \"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\" he wrote. Mr Trump said \"time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO\" could help Kyv win back lost territory, and said Russia was in \"economic trouble\". He said Moscow had been \"fighting aimlessly\" for three-and-a-half years - and had it been a \"real military power\" it would have defeated Ukraine in less than a week. \"This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger',\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy told Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone it was a \"big shift\" from his US counterpart. He later admitted he was surprised by Mr Trump's comments, telling Fox News' Special Report he has a better relationship with the president than before. Read more: Why emboldened Trump has changed his stance on Ukraine Trump's patience not 'infinite' Mr Trump also appeared to pour cold water on his hopes of persuading Vladimir Putin to sign a peace deal. Speaking to Emmanuel Macron at the UN summit, he said their relationship had turned out to be meaningless. Just last month, Mr Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Russian president at a summit in Alaska - in a push to expedite the war's conclusion. Before returning to the White House, he repeatedly claimed he'd be able to end the conflict in 24 hours. Speaking at the UN Security Council, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, admitted ending the war had proven an \"extraordinary challenge\". He said Mr Trump had \"worked on it tirelessly\", but warned Russia his patience is not \"infinite\".  The US president has previously suggested Ukraine will never be able to reclaim all the territory Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Ukraine has lost large areas of land in the east of the country. In the Donetsk region, Russia now controls about 70% of the territory. Kyiv's forces have been pushed back to four cities analysts have dubbed the \"fortress belt\". Moscow has partly annexed three other regions, too: Luhansk in the east, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson further west. Trump tells NATO to shoot down Russian jets in its skies Meanwhile, Russia appears to be provoking its neighbours to the west. Last week, Estonia said three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes before Italian NATO jets escorted them away. The week before, about 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting NATO jets to shoot some of them down and the alliance to beef up its defence of Europe's eastern flank. While talking to Mr Zelenskyy at the UN, Mr Trump was asked by reporters whether he thought NATO should shoot down any Russian planes that entered NATO airspace. \"Yes, I do,\" Mr Trump replied. On Truth Social, he said the US would continue to supply weapons to NATO, and it was for the alliance to \"do what they want with them\".

He added: \"Most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine.

In a joint statement following the president's comments, G7 foreign ministers said discussions were ongoing about additional economic sanctions on Russia."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  As U-turns go, it's a game-changer. Donald Trump has pivoted from pressing Ukraine to surrender territory to suggesting it's able to win all its land back. This is the man who threw Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy out of the White House in February and brought Russia's Vladimir Putin in from the cold in Alaska last month. So, why the handbrake turn from framing negotiations as the most practical outcome to a new-found confidence in Ukraine, when supported by its European neighbours and NATO? Firstly, it could be the military and economic reality on the ground. Russia's paying a high price for the war, both in manpower and finances. Trump has acknowledged that Moscow is in \"big economic trouble\", which strengthens the case for Ukraine prevailing with Western help. Ukraine's resilience has also shifted perceptions - the impossible now looking possible if allies remain committed. Secondly, it could be the influence of allies. European leaders flew to Washington en masse last month to urge caution in dealings with Putin. European NATO members have stepped up aid to Ukraine, further weakening the President's rhetoric about America carrying the financial burden. He's suddenly aligning himself with European countries, endorsing the shooting down of Russian planes violating their airspace. Thirdly, it could be more about domestic politics, with the president under bipartisan scrutiny at home over his \"softly, softly\" approach to Russia. A tougher national defence posture could help him consolidate support among Republicans, while also appealing to moderates, who regard the defence of Ukraine as a test of national credibility.  Trump versus the world There's another factor worth considering - Trump's negotiating tactic. He has a long record of changing position to gain leverage. Talk of compromise might have been the strategy for getting Ukraine and Russia into talks, but with Russia showing no willingness to compromise, his calculation shifting back to the restoration of Ukraine. Whatever the reason for his change of heart, and whether it translates into US policy, the last three days have shown an emboldened Trump. From his declaration of \"hate\" for his opponents during a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, to his sensational claim to have \"found an answer on autism\", to his derision of the UN, he's unfiltered right now. Place him in front of a microphone or online, and it's Trump versus the world."

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n While Britain and America were engrossed in the pageantry and diplomacy of a US presidential visit last week, another event pretty much went unnoticed in most Western capitals - and it could have a profound impact on geopolitics. The \"Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement\" was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on 17 September. Seen as an \"Islamic NATO\" in the making, at its core is the clause that \"any aggression against either country, shall be considered an aggression against both\". Article 5 of NATO states the same, and is the cornerstone principle of collective defence that binds members of the alliance.  If an ally is attacked, each member will consider it an attack against them all and will take action to help. This clause has often been cited since Putin's war on Ukraine. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a longstanding relationship, with Pakistan willing to defend the holy sites of Mecca and Medina as Shia Iran threatened the Kingdom. The new pact between Sunni Saudi Arabia, a country considered the heart of the Islamic world, with Pakistan - the only Muslim nuclear nation - is bound to set a new order. Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif said \"the deterrence that we get from nuclear weapons, and what we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to Saudi Arabia according to this agreement\". Pakistan has also not ruled out other Islamic nations joining the coalition and its deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar, said \"other countries have also expressed a desire for similar arrangements\". The signing took place a week after Israel launched airstrikes against Hamas officials discussing US ceasefire proposals in a Qatari government complex. The unprecedented attack in Doha has shattered the illusion of American reliability in the region for rich Arab and Gulf countries. Israel's menacing military strikes - in Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Qatar - have precipitated the idea of a protective nuclear umbrella of their own.  Major blow for India A cash-strapped, politically unstable and quasi-military Pakistan, willing to share its weapons, is a win-win for both countries. It's a coup for Pakistan because a client like Saudi Arabia puts it centre stage in the Islamic world, with its credibility sky high and the potential for more patrons. It has also dealt a major diplomatic and security blow to nuclear arch rival India, against whom it's fought multiple wars and clashes. Relations between Saudi Arabia, Gulf nations and India have improved considerably over the years. But the concern is, would the pact automatically bring these nations into Pakistan's corner if there was a conflict with India. After the deadly clashes between the two countries in May, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said \"we have merely suspended our retaliatory actions against Pakistan's terrorist and military targets for now\". India's foreign ministry said it would \"study the implications for national security and regional and global stability\". It added: \"India and Saudi Arabia have a wide-ranging strategic partnership which has deepened considerably in the last few years. We expect that this strategic partnership will keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities.\" However, there will be worry and concern in the Indian establishment as its nemesis has prized open a door which they hope does not become a chasm. Read more from Sky News:China to evacuate 400,000 from 'super' typhoonBritish-Egyptian activist released from prison The Indians will be hoping the pact remains one of just political solidarity and doesn't transform into unconditional war guarantees. India's diplomacy faces huge challenges; it has been singled out by President Trump for a punitive 25% extra tariff for buying discounted Russian oil, taking the total to 50%, one of the highest in the world. Relations with China have also been very difficult over the years, while ties between Pakistan and China have strengthened into an all-weather friendship. The Saudi-Pakistan deal aims to expand military cooperation, joint exercises and intelligence sharing to counter threats, terrorism and cross-border insurgencies. It also covers the transfer of technology and co-production of military equipment between the countries. This pact could change the course of the Middle East as Pakistan's 170 warheads provide the Kingdom with a deterrent that might later expand to cover other countries - an Islamic NATO with potential to reshape the world."

        "Content": "A 59-year-old man has been found guilty of trying to assassinate Donald Trump on a golf course.  Ryan Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen shortly after he was convicted on all five charges against him. Marshals quickly surrounded Routh and he did not hurt himself. They then dragged him out of the courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida. His daughter Sara Routh screamed: \"Dad I love you don't do anything. I'll get you out. He didn't hurt anybody.\" She continued screaming in the courtroom as her father was removed, and she said the case against him was rigged. He was later brought back into court, wearing a white shirt and no tie. There was no blood visible on his neck. The judge wanted to make sure Routh understood he was found guilty. Routh will be sentenced on 18 December, the judge announced. His son Adam said \"we love you Dad\" and Routh turned around and winked as he was taken away.  'Carefully crafted plot' A jury of five men and seven women decided Routh intended to kill Mr Trump when he pointed a rifle through a fence as the then US presidential candidate was playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September last year. Routh fled without firing a shot after a Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Mr Trump saw Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case. At the start of the trial, prosecutor John Shipley said \"this plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious\", adding that without the agent intervening, \"Donald Trump would not be alive\". The charges against Routh Routh had been charged with attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. The incident occurred weeks after a bullet grazed the president's ear in another assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Read more from Sky News:Trump's claims at UN AssemblyUS president makes full-throttle assault on UN  Routh, who faces the prospect of life in prison, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him and chose to defend himself in court. He spent weeks plotting to kill Mr Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican candidate played golf on 15 September 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club, according to prosecutors. What did Routh say? Routh told jurors in his closing argument that he did not intend to kill anyone that day. \"It's hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled,\" Routh said. He said he could see Mr Trump as he was on the path toward the sixth-hole green and noted he also could have shot a Secret Service agent who confronted him if he had intended to harm anyone. Trump's reaction Following the guilty verdict, the president said on Truth Social that Routh was \"an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him\". He thanked the Secret Service and \"the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime\", and provided authorities with his vehicle registration number. The guilty verdict \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence\", Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. \"This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our president, but an affront to our very nation,\" Ms Bondi said."

'London wants Sharia law' The president continued his long-running criticism of London's mayor, Sir Sadiq Khan, telling delegates: \"I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been changed, it's been so changed. \"Now they want to go to Sharia law.

A spokesperson for Sir Sadiq said: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response. \n                  Why emboldened Donald Trump has changed his stance on Ukraine \n                 \n                  Trump disparages Russian military - and backs Ukraine to retake all lost territory\n                 \n                  Donald Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN and says he is 'right about everything'\n                 \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\" Immigration will be 'death of Western Europe' The president, who's clamped down on migrants coming via America's southern border and ordered immigration raids, warned the UN \"immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe if something is not done immediately\". He said Europe was being \"invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before\". \"Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe and nobody's doing anything to change it,\" Mr Trump said. Directly addressing European leaders, he added: \"You're doing it because you want to be nice. You want to be politically correct, and you're destroying your heritage.\" The UK has seen a record number of illegal migrants arrive in small boats for this point in the year - and there has been a spike in legal migration too. How to tackle the problem continues to be a key political battleground. Read more:Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN - analysisAll the health claims made by Trump - and what experts say Climate change world's 'greatest con job' Mr Trump urged Europe to abandon green energy plans and called climate change \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" with predictions \"made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes\". He said scientists had previously predicted some nations might be \"wiped off the map\" by now - but that's \"not happening\". \"If you don't get away from the green scam, your country is going to fail,\" he argued. The vast majority of scientists accept climate change is largely man-made and already having an effect; for example by causing glaciers to shrink, sea levels to rise, and making wildfires more likely. He also reiterated his belief that Britain should make more of untapped North Sea oil, but claimed it was \"so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company can go there\". The president is well known for his loathing of renewable energy and used his speech to also take a swipe at the UK's green energy efforts. \"I want to stop seeing them ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go seven miles by seven miles, taking away farmland,\" the president said. The UK's largest solar plant is Cleve Hill in Kent, which stretches about 1.8 miles x 1 mile at its widest. However, the country's largest onshore wind farm at Whitelee, near Glasgow, comprises 215 turbines over about 30 square miles. 'Everyone' says Trump should get prize after 'ending seven wars' Mr Trump is widely believed to be very keen to get the Nobel Peace Prize, and today he again claimed to have stopped \"seven wars\" - despite US efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine and Gaza so far failing. \"I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,\" he said, adding that \"no president or prime minister\" has \"ever done anything close to that\".  However, the president said he actually isn't concerned about being honoured for his efforts. \"Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements,\" he told world leaders. \"The real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and unglorious wars,\" the president said. \"What I care about is not winning prizes as much as saving lives.\" He also took a swipe at what he said was a lax approach from the UN, saying it was \"too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them\". Although his administration has helped mediate relations in disputes between countries such as India and Pakistan, and Cambodia and Thailand, experts say his impact isn't as clear cut as he makes out."

        "Content": "Denmark's prime minister has said she \"cannot deny\" that drones seen over Copenhagen Airport were flown by Russia. Flights were halted on Monday after two or three large drones were spotted near the transport hub. All take-offs and landings were stropped for almost four hours. Danish police said the drones came from different directions and their lights were turning on and off. One possibility is that they were launched from ships. Authorities in Norway shut the airspace at Oslo airport for three hours after a drone was seen there, too. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the incursion was the \"most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date\". She added: \"We are obviously not ruling out any options in relation to who is behind it. \"I certainly cannot deny in any way that it is Russia,\" she told public broadcaster DR. Appearing to reference Russian drone incursions in Poland and Romania, she said it was \"clear that this fits in with the developments we have observed recently with other drone attacks, violations of airspace, and hacker attacks on European airports\". The activity appeared designed to \"disrupt and create unrest\", she commented. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said that while the facts were still being established, it is \"clear we are witnessing a pattern of persistent contestation at our borders\". She added: \"Our critical infrastructure is at risk. Europe will respond to this threat with strength and determination.\" Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, said it was \"too early to say\" whether Russia was involved, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations. Vladimir Barbin, Russia's ambassador to Denmark, claimed there was a \"clear desire to provoke NATO countries into a direct military confrontation with Russia\". Europe correspondent Although NATO and Danish officials have been careful not to blame Russia until they have firm evidence, it would fit into an increasingly concerning pattern of recent behaviour. Temporarily halting commercial airport operations is the sort of hybrid tactic that Moscow is good at.Â  At night it's hard to track the exact path of the drones, the police would be reluctant to shoot them down because they risk the aircraft falling near houses or offices and, crucially, it again highlights a NATO weakness to protect European skies against cheap drones. \n\n  It has a financial and psychological impact with little cost to the perpetrator.Â  And if the evidence is found to confidently blame Russia?Â  It certainly doesn't reach the threshold for a military response, so then what? More ineffective sanctions, a stern diplomatic rebuke?  Russia is testing and probing Europe, causing embarrassment and so far with little consequence.

There was also a risk to the runways and nearby fuel depots, he added. He described the drone pilot as a \"capable actor\" and said they seemed keen to show off their skills while practising different techniques, perhaps. There were no signs the pilot intended to cause harm to anyone, he said. Referencing the lights turning on and off and different flight patterns being used, he said: \"It all indicates that you are not out to attack anyone, but you are out to show off.\""

Super Typhoon Ragasa, with winds near its centre of around 137mph (220kmh), according to Hong Kong's observatory, is travelling across the South China Sea towards Guangdong province, the southern Chinese economic powerhouse. At least three people have died and more than 17,500 displaced by flooding and landslides in the Philippines because of the storm, categorised as a \"super typhoon\" by the observatory because it contains winds of more than 115mph (185kmh).   Ragasa is expected to make landfall in the coastal area between the cities of Zhuhai and Zhanjiang in Guangdong on Wednesday between midday and evening, local time, China's National Meteorological Centre said. Sandbags and barriers have been placed by doors to protect homes, and windows and glass doors have been taped ahead of expected high winds. Many people stockpiled food and other supplies on Monday, and some market traders said their goods were selling out fast. Hurricane-force winds were forecast across a wide area, the observatory said, confirming it will issue the third-highest storm warning signal in its weather alert system, on Tuesday afternoon. Winds of 84mph (135kph) were recorded near the ground at a distance of about 75 miles (120km) from the typhoon's centre, it said. Water levels may go as high as four to five metres (13ft to 16ft) above the typical lowest sea level, while coastal areas could see rises of up to two metres (6.5ft). Schools were closed in Hong Kong and the neighbouring city of Macao, while classes were cancelled in other cities, including the tech hub of Shenzhen. Hundreds of flights were cancelled in Hong Kong.

Despite intense lobbying by Kyiv and its European allies, the US leader has thus far refused to get tough with Vladimir Putin despite a string of alleged airspace violations by Russian aircraft and drones along Europe's eastern flank. It comes as the brutal struggle to hold the line in eastern Ukraine continues, where Russian forces exert pressure all along the front including around the crucial city of Pokrovsk. Meanwhile in Moscow, Russian anti-aircraft units downed 33 Ukrainian drones headed for the capital overnight and into Tuesday morning, officials said. Zelenskyy to address UN assembly President Zelenskyy will address a UN General Assembly on Wednesday that has been dominated by discussion of the question of Palestinian statehood.

It's a super important place to be,\" first deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya said. \"I wish it were more expedient, but you will never have easy solutions to the conflicts of this magnitude. \"So I think that we will not come back from New York, all of us, with easy solutions. And we will continue to work hard after New York.\" 'Drone wall' for Europe The mood in European capitals has been tense following a series of incursions into their airspace by Russian drones and aircraft - alleged to be deliberate. British jets flew their first defence mission in Polish skies as part of a NATO mission after one such incident. The EU's foreign policy chief - former Estonia prime minister Kaja Kallas - said \"every country has the right to defend itself and act accordingly\" if Russian planes violate their airspace. This was echoed by Yvette Cooper, the new UK foreign secretary. She said: \"And if we need to confront planes that are operating in NATO airspace without permission then we will do so. \"The United Kingdom stands by our friends.\"  The parents of Callum Tindal-Draper, a British man who died on the battlefield in Ukraine in November, paid tribute to him on Sky News on Tuesday. They praised him as someone who stood up to bullies, fighting in Ukraine's foreign volunteer platoon. Lithuania's foreign minister called for Ukraine to be fully integrated into a plan to protect NATO's borders with drones due to its experience pioneering cutting-edge technology in the heat of combat. The EU is looking at how to create a \"drone wall\" along the EU's eastern border - a project that has been infused with urgency following recent incidents. \"We have to bring this technology to the front line and to build it there, build it there so that it will be effective together with Ukrainians,\" Kestutis Budrys said. Read more:MI6: 'No evidence' Putin wants to negotiate peaceRussian forces create 'kill zone' around crucial Ukrainian city Ukraine battlefield: The struggle for Pokrovsk On the battlefield in Ukraine, Russia has claimed a number of advances as its troops continue to push along the frontline. Russia's defence ministry said its forces captured the village of Pereizne in Donetsk, where Moscow has been grinding forward for months at the cost of heavy casualties. Putin's armies have long been trying to capture the rest of Donetsk, part of Ukraine's industrial heartland that Russia claims as its own following a bogus referendum. A chain of Ukrainian cities nicknamed the \"fortress belt\" has held the line there for more than a decade, but shortages of troops, supplies and chaotic management are making it increasingly hard to resist Russia's relentless pressure. But a Ukrainian commander says he's confident Russia's latest attempt to push through there won't work. \"From a military point of view it looks correct - on the map it looks neat - but after nearly three-and-a-half years of war we all know that such deep manoeuvres and wide flanking operations are not Russia's forte,\" Colonel Pavlo Yurchuk told the Associated Press. Col Yurchuk, whose troops are defending a small city at the northern end of the fortress belt, added: \"They simply won't be able to control and supply those penetrations, so I'm sure that they will fail.\" Meanwhile Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Kyiv, remains in Ukrainian hands for now despite its defenders facing months of unrelenting attack. \"Our warriors are marching forward,\" the head of Ukraine's armed forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said of the Pokrovsk front on Monday. The commander-in-chief said in the previous day 1.3 square kilometres had been taken by Ukraine and Russian forces destroyed in a further 2.1 square kilometres. Elsewhere, Russian aircraft attacked the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs during the night, killing a man, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Tuesday. In Odesa, Russian ballistic missiles struck the town centre of Tatarbunary, killing a woman, regional head Oleh Kiper said. Footage from Ukraine's state emergency service shows firefighters battling flames in Zaporizhzhia. Drones shot down on route to Moscow Across the border, Ukraine's aim to bring the war to Russia's population continued overnight, with 33 drones downed as they headed for Moscow, officials claimed. Kyiv's drone armies have become a fact of life for Russia, with long-range UAVs causing havoc at oil refineries and airfields as Ukraine attempts to hamper the Kremlin's war economy. Flights were delayed and cancelled at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, the country's largest by passenger numbers, following the drone attacks. Russia's Defence Ministry said on Telegram that its anti-aircraft units had destroyed 150 Ukrainian drones overnight and Tuesday morning. As well as on route to Moscow, drones were reported shot down near Sevastopol in occupied Crimea and Tula region in central Russia. Ukraine's military said on Tuesday that it hit two Russian oil distribution facilities in Bryansk and Samara regions. Autoplay videos credit: AP."

He was here to make history. France, the country that carved up the Middle East over a hundred years ago along with Britain, finally giving the Palestinians what they believe is long overdue. As it happened: France recognises Palestinian state Yvette Cooper witnessed the event looking on. Her prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, did the same over the weekend. Foregoing such hallowed surroundings, he beat the French to it by a day. \"Peace is much more demanding, much more difficult than all wars,\" said Macron, \"but the time has come.\" There were cheers as he recognised the state of Palestine. The time for what? Not for peace that is for sure. The war in Gaza rages and the West Bank simmers with settler violence against Palestinians. The French and British believe Israel is actively working against the possibility of a Palestinian state. Attacks on Palestinians, land seizures, the relentless pace of settlement construction is finishing off the chances of a two-state solution to the conflict, so time for unilateral action they believe.  Without the horizon of a state of their own, Palestinians will resort to more and more extreme means. The Israelis say they have already done so on 7 October and this move only rewards the wicked extremism of Hamas. But the Netanyahu government has undeniably sought to divide and weaken the Palestinians and has always opposed a Palestinian state. Israel still has the support of Donald Trump, but opinion polls suggest even in America public sentiment is moving against them. That shift will be hard to reverse. Read more:Will Trump force Netanyahu's hand? More than three quarters of the UN's member nations now recognise a state of Palestine, four out of five of the security council's permanent members. The move is hugely problematic. Where exactly is the state, what are its borders, will it now be held to account for its extremists, who exactly is its government? But more and more countries believe it had to happen. That leaves Israel increasingly ostracised and for a small country in a difficult neighbourhood that is not a good place to be, however strong it is militarily."

In a post on Truth Social, made after talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations in New York, the US president said a return to \"the original borders from where this war started is very much an option\". \"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\" he wrote. Mr Trump said \"time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO\" could help Kyv win back lost territory, and said Russia was in \"economic trouble\". He said Moscow had been \"fighting aimlessly\" for three-and-a-half years - and had it been a \"real military power\" it would have defeated Ukraine in less than a week. \"This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger',\" he added. Mr Zelenskyy told Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone it was a \"big shift\" from his US counterpart. He later admitted he was surprised by Mr Trump's comments, telling Fox News' Special Report he has a better relationship with the president than before. Read more: Why emboldened Trump has changed his stance on Ukraine Trump's patience not 'infinite' Mr Trump also appeared to pour cold water on his hopes of persuading Vladimir Putin to sign a peace deal. Speaking to Emmanuel Macron at the UN summit, he said their relationship had turned out to be meaningless. Just last month, Mr Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Russian president at a summit in Alaska - in a push to expedite the war's conclusion. Before returning to the White House, he repeatedly claimed he'd be able to end the conflict in 24 hours. Speaking at the UN Security Council, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, admitted ending the war had proven an \"extraordinary challenge\". He said Mr Trump had \"worked on it tirelessly\", but warned Russia his patience is not \"infinite\".  The US president has previously suggested Ukraine will never be able to reclaim all the territory Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Ukraine has lost large areas of land in the east of the country. In the Donetsk region, Russia now controls about 70% of the territory. Kyiv's forces have been pushed back to four cities analysts have dubbed the \"fortress belt\". Moscow has partly annexed three other regions, too: Luhansk in the east, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson further west. Trump tells NATO to shoot down Russian jets in its skies Meanwhile, Russia appears to be provoking its neighbours to the west. Last week, Estonia said three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes before Italian NATO jets escorted them away. The week before, about 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting NATO jets to shoot some of them down and the alliance to beef up its defence of Europe's eastern flank. While talking to Mr Zelenskyy at the UN, Mr Trump was asked by reporters whether he thought NATO should shoot down any Russian planes that entered NATO airspace. \"Yes, I do,\" Mr Trump replied. On Truth Social, he said the US would continue to supply weapons to NATO, and it was for the alliance to \"do what they want with them\".

        "Content": "A 59-year-old man has been found guilty of trying to assassinate Donald Trump on a golf course.  Ryan Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen shortly after he was convicted on all five charges against him. Marshals quickly surrounded Routh and he did not hurt himself. They then dragged him out of the courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida. His daughter Sara Routh screamed: \"Dad I love you don't do anything. I'll get you out. He didn't hurt anybody.\" She continued screaming in the courtroom as her father was removed, and she said the case against him was rigged. He was later brought back into court, wearing a white shirt and no tie. There was no blood visible on his neck. The judge wanted to make sure Routh understood he was found guilty. Routh will be sentenced on 18 December, the judge announced. His son Adam said \"we love you Dad\" and Routh turned around and winked as he was taken away.  'Carefully crafted plot' A jury of five men and seven women decided Routh intended to kill Mr Trump when he pointed a rifle through a fence as the then US presidential candidate was playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September last year. Routh fled without firing a shot after a Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Mr Trump saw Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case. At the start of the trial, prosecutor John Shipley said \"this plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious\", adding that without the agent intervening, \"Donald Trump would not be alive\". The charges against Routh Routh had been charged with attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. The incident occurred weeks after a bullet grazed the president's ear in another assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Read more from Sky News:Trump's claims at UN AssemblyUS president makes full-throttle assault on UN  Routh, who faces the prospect of life in prison, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him and chose to defend himself in court. He spent weeks plotting to kill Mr Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican candidate played golf on 15 September 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club, according to prosecutors. What did Routh say? Routh told jurors in his closing argument that he did not intend to kill anyone that day. \"It's hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled,\" Routh said. He said he could see Mr Trump as he was on the path toward the sixth-hole green and noted he also could have shot a Secret Service agent who confronted him if he had intended to harm anyone. Trump's reaction Following the guilty verdict, the president said on Truth Social that Routh was \"an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him\". He thanked the Secret Service and \"the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime\", and provided authorities with his vehicle registration number. The guilty verdict \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence\", Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. \"This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our president, but an affront to our very nation,\" Ms Bondi said."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  As U-turns go, it's a game-changer. Donald Trump has pivoted from pressing Ukraine to surrender territory to suggesting it's able to win all its land back. This is the man who threw Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy out of the White House in February and brought Russia's Vladimir Putin in from the cold in Alaska last month. So, why the handbrake turn from framing negotiations as the most practical outcome to a new-found confidence in Ukraine, when supported by its European neighbours and NATO? Firstly, it could be the military and economic reality on the ground. Russia's paying a high price for the war, both in manpower and finances. Trump has acknowledged that Moscow is in \"big economic trouble\", which strengthens the case for Ukraine prevailing with Western help. Ukraine's resilience has also shifted perceptions - the impossible now looking possible if allies remain committed. Secondly, it could be the influence of allies. European leaders flew to Washington en masse last month to urge caution in dealings with Putin. European NATO members have stepped up aid to Ukraine, further weakening the President's rhetoric about America carrying the financial burden. He's suddenly aligning himself with European countries, endorsing the shooting down of Russian planes violating their airspace. Thirdly, it could be more about domestic politics, with the president under bipartisan scrutiny at home over his \"softly, softly\" approach to Russia. A tougher national defence posture could help him consolidate support among Republicans, while also appealing to moderates, who regard the defence of Ukraine as a test of national credibility.  Trump versus the world There's another factor worth considering - Trump's negotiating tactic. He has a long record of changing position to gain leverage. Talk of compromise might have been the strategy for getting Ukraine and Russia into talks, but with Russia showing no willingness to compromise, his calculation shifting back to the restoration of Ukraine. Whatever the reason for his change of heart, and whether it translates into US policy, the last three days have shown an emboldened Trump. From his declaration of \"hate\" for his opponents during a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, to his sensational claim to have \"found an answer on autism\", to his derision of the UN, he's unfiltered right now. Place him in front of a microphone or online, and it's Trump versus the world."

        "Content": " President Trump's speech to the UN General Assembly featured a number of dubious, hyperbolic and headline-grabbing statements. Here are some of the main soundbites from his 56-minute moment in front of world leaders in New York. 'London wants Sharia law' The president continued his long-running criticism of London's mayor, Sir Sadiq Khan, telling delegates: \"I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been changed, it's been so changed. \"Now they want to go to Sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can't do that.\" It's not clear why he raised Sharia law - which is Islam's legal system - but there is no evidence of it being administered by civil authorities in London. A spokesperson for Sir Sadiq said: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response. \n                  Why emboldened Donald Trump has changed his stance on Ukraine \n                 \n                  Trump disparages Russian military - and backs Ukraine to retake all lost territory\n                 \n                  Donald Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN and says he is 'right about everything'\n                 \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\" Immigration will be 'death of Western Europe' The president, who's clamped down on migrants coming via America's southern border and ordered immigration raids, warned the UN \"immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe if something is not done immediately\". He said Europe was being \"invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before\". \"Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe and nobody's doing anything to change it,\" Mr Trump said. Directly addressing European leaders, he added: \"You're doing it because you want to be nice. You want to be politically correct, and you're destroying your heritage.\" The UK has seen a record number of illegal migrants arrive in small boats for this point in the year - and there has been a spike in legal migration too. How to tackle the problem continues to be a key political battleground. Read more:Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN - analysisAll the health claims made by Trump - and what experts say Climate change world's 'greatest con job' Mr Trump urged Europe to abandon green energy plans and called climate change \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" with predictions \"made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes\". He said scientists had previously predicted some nations might be \"wiped off the map\" by now - but that's \"not happening\". \"If you don't get away from the green scam, your country is going to fail,\" he argued. The vast majority of scientists accept climate change is largely man-made and already having an effect; for example by causing glaciers to shrink, sea levels to rise, and making wildfires more likely. He also reiterated his belief that Britain should make more of untapped North Sea oil, but claimed it was \"so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company can go there\". The president is well known for his loathing of renewable energy and used his speech to also take a swipe at the UK's green energy efforts. \"I want to stop seeing them ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go seven miles by seven miles, taking away farmland,\" the president said. The UK's largest solar plant is Cleve Hill in Kent, which stretches about 1.8 miles x 1 mile at its widest. However, the country's largest onshore wind farm at Whitelee, near Glasgow, comprises 215 turbines over about 30 square miles. 'Everyone' says Trump should get prize after 'ending seven wars' Mr Trump is widely believed to be very keen to get the Nobel Peace Prize, and today he again claimed to have stopped \"seven wars\" - despite US efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine and Gaza so far failing. \"I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,\" he said, adding that \"no president or prime minister\" has \"ever done anything close to that\".  However, the president said he actually isn't concerned about being honoured for his efforts. \"Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements,\" he told world leaders. \"The real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and unglorious wars,\" the president said. \"What I care about is not winning prizes as much as saving lives.\" He also took a swipe at what he said was a lax approach from the UN, saying it was \"too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them\". Although his administration has helped mediate relations in disputes between countries such as India and Pakistan, and Cambodia and Thailand, experts say his impact isn't as clear cut as he makes out."

After beginning by complaining that the autocue and escalator were both broken, the American president railed against challenges which the United Nations as a body has tried to manage. Immigration and climate change were his two central targets. \"I am here to tell the truth - I don't care.\" He chose not to recognise that the UN is only the sum of its parts, relies on consensus, is hampered by vetoes, and is unable to dictate policy. Instead, he complained that \"the UN\" had never thanked him for having solved so many wars. \"I didn't even receive a phone call,\" he said. Follow latest: Trump says NATO should shoot down Russian jets violating airspace On the war-solving claim and many others, his speech was a journey of his greatest hits in the first nine months of this second term. He had solved immigration, he said, while the countries he was speaking to were allowing it to destroy their countries. \"You have to do something about it,\" he said. \"Europe is in serious trouble, invaded by illegal aliens.\" He knows this message will resonate far beyond America. He sought to hit lots of buttons, but the speech had no singular thread. There had been an expectation that he would focus on the central geopolitical challenges - Ukraine and Gaza - but he did not. On Ukraine, he acknowledged he had underestimated how hard it would be to find peace. He then pointed the finger at Europe. \"They are funding the war against themselves,\" he said, saying that Europe continues to buy energy from Russia. There was a direct call for them to stop. On Gaza, he was deeply critical of the decision by some Western nations to recognise a state of Palestine. But he did not offer any real backing for Israel in its threat to annex the West Bank.

Your countries are going to hell.\" Then he weaved to climate change: \"The greatest con job ever perpetrated on the worldâ¦ the carbon footprint is a hoax... predictions made by stupid people.\" \"If you don't get away from the green scam, your country is going to fail.\" Beyond all that, there was no singular new headline to his speech. It was familiar language - familiar rhetoric from a president who appears much more comfortable in this second term to speak his mind, to be as controversial as he wants to be. \"I have been right about everything,\" he said."

        "Content": " Content creators with autism say Donald Trump's claims that there is a link between paracetamol and the condition are \"really dangerous for the autism community\". The US president said on Monday that there had been a \"meteoric rise\" in cases of autism and suggested that the use of Tylenol - an American-branded version of paracetamol - during pregnancy is a potential cause. While the rates of autism diagnoses are going up, studies suggesting a correlation between mothers who took paracetamol during pregnancy and the birth of a child with autism have been far from conclusive. Sky News has spoken to content creators in the autism community who are concerned about the potential impact of Mr Trump's claims. Chelsea Webster, founder of the online Autism Support Group, says she believes that the president is shifting the narrative around autism from supporting those struggling to prevention of diagnosis, and that she's concerned this will lead research, awareness and advocacy efforts away from improving the lives of those who need help. \"What this actually does is it raises political opinion above science and data, which is really dangerous because it undermines peer-backed science and data,\" she explains. \"And we don't want that because that spreads misinformation, which is really dangerous for the autism community.\"  She acknowledges that there was a study which connected Tylenol taken during pregnancy to the potential of autism in babies, but adds it is \"a correlation, not a causation\". \"And the fact that we let political leaders say things willy-nilly, unaccountably, without there being sort of fact-based dissection of that is really harmful,\" she adds. \"It sets the precedent that that can continue, which spreads more misinformation, which makes people vulnerable to things like wack cures or preventative methods that are unproven.\" Ellie Middleton, a content creator and author with autism and ADHD, has also refuted Mr Trump's claims, suggesting the increase in diagnoses is because more people on the spectrum are aware of autism than they once were and are therefore more likely to get tested for it and eventually diagnosed.  Like Ms Webster, she believes Mr Trump's comments could prove dangerous for the autism community. \"All of the conversation that's happening around this conversation is very thinly veiled eugenics ideology,\" she warns. Eugenics is the now widely discredited study of the selective breeding of humans, with the perceived aim of \"improving\" the human species. Read more:What is autism and how is it diagnosed?Trump's health claims - and what experts have said \"We're hearing phrases like, 'We need to eradicate autism,' but you can't eradicate autism without eradicating autistic people,\" Ms Middleton says. \"It's not something that can be separated. I can't have my autism taken out of me and fixed, it's part of who I am and the way that I think, feel, process [and] exist. \"We need to be really careful of where this sort of ideology and rhetoric leads.\" She says her first reaction to Mr Trump's comments was \"an eye roll\" and that they are now \"another thing on a long list of unhelpful misinformation that's spread about autism\".  \"And for it to have come from literally the most powerful man in the world is incredibly frustrating, because it just pushes back all the hard work that so many of us in the autistic community are doing to beat stigma and change people's perceptions.\" Autistic people not being heard, creators say Both Ms Webster and Ms Middleton suggest this is just the latest instance in which the voices in the autism community are not being listened to. \"Instead of looking for a cause or trying to eradicate autism, it would be much more useful for time, energy and resources to go into actually speaking to autistic people and the people closest to them,\" Ms Middleton says, adding it would help those in power discover how they could be better supported. Similarly, Ms Webster says: \"I wish political figures, particularly leaders in charge, would support autistic people and listen to autistic people when we say we need X, Y, Z, and then to provide that support. \"For instance, here in the UK, for example, waitlists for autism diagnosis are extremely long. In more remote places like Scotland and Wales, autism services are being shut down. \"So what we need is for leaders to look at the actual problems and what autistic people are saying about them and then fix those problems. She says she's \"not surprised\" to see Mr Trump sharing what she calls \"misinformation\", because she thinks it's a tactic aimed at moving the focus away from contentious issues like the war in Gaza, climate change, wealth inequalities and health disparities."

        "Content": " Donald Trump said he had been waiting 20 years to make an announcement linking paracetamol use in pregnancy to an increased risk of autism. Speaking from the White House on Monday, surrounded by medical professionals and US health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, the US leader also made a number of other health recommendations involving vaccines and a so-called autism \"treatment\". Various medical bodies, health professionals and charities have since rebuked many of his comments. Here is what has been said. Mr Trump began with warning pregnant women not to take paracetamol, or acetaminophen as it is known in America - or by its leading brand name, Tylenol. Not backing up the claim with any scientific evidence, the White House later released a list of studies that it said have \"evidence\" of the link. While an August study from Harvard University did suggest that taking Tylenol during pregnancy may lead to children developing neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD, it recommended that pregnant women should take low-doses of acetaminophen or for a short period of time under medical guidance, rather than an overall \"broad limitation\" of the drug. What do experts say? Autism expert, David Mandell of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that while some studies suggest a link, many others haven't found that concern. For example, a far larger and more comprehensive Swedish study from last year, found no association between paracetamol, autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Read more: What is autism? Reacting to the president's claim, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stressed it does not believe taking acetaminophen causes autism. \"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers and parents,\" it said in a statement. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), also said in a statement that there was \"no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children\". She said paracetamol remains the \"recommended pain relief option for pregnant women\" in the UK and is important to manage untreated pain or fever that could pose risks to an unborn baby.  The UK's Health Secretary Wes Streeting urged pregnant women not to pay attention \"whatsoever\" to Mr Trump, adding: \"I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this.\" While Dr Zubir Ahmed MP, the UK's patient safety minister, said on social media: \"For the avoidance of any doubt, Paracetamol remains the safest painkiller to take during pregnancy.\" Further afield, the European Medicines Agency, said there was no new evidence that would mean its recommendations for the use of paracetamol during pregnancy would change. Tarik Jasarevic, a World Health Organisation spokesperson, added that the links between the use of the drug and autism \"remains inconsistent\". On vaccinations, Mr Trump suggested that the MMR vaccine - a combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella - should be taken in separate doses. Mr Trump again did not cite any scientific evidence for the claim, instead saying: \"This is based on what I feel.\" What do experts say? NHS advice states that children should have three doses of the MMR vaccine, the first when they reach the age of one. Until now, no country has recommended immunisation with three separate vaccines, according to the MHRA. The regulatory body said single vaccines are also less safe than MMR because they leave children \"vulnerable to dangerous diseases for longer\". Elsewhere in the speech, Mr Trump said he recommends raising the age of when children are given the hepatitis B vaccine to 12 years old. Hepatitis B is a liver infection that is spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids. What do experts say? The NHS currently uses the 6-in-1 vaccine to protect against the infection, recommending babies as young as eight weeks old get their first dose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), America's national public health agency, also recommends the vaccine for all infants, children and adolescents younger than 19 who have not been vaccinated, adults aged 19-59 and adults over 60 who have risk factors for the infection. Before routine vaccination of American babies against hepatitis B, around 18,000 a year were infected with the virus in the first 10 years of life, either during birth, or as a result of living with someone with it. Nearly a quarter of those were likely to develop a chronic infection, leading to liver disease or liver cancer. Since the vaccine was introduced, hepatitis B infections in US children have fallen by 95%. Speaking after Mr Trump, Marty Makary, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced that the government body is approving the use of leucovorin as a treatment option for patients with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). The FDA described CFD as a neurological condition that affects the transportation of folate - a vitamin essential for brain health - into the brain. Low levels of folate can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, some of which are seen in people with autism. Leucovorin, also known as folinic acid, works by boosting folate levels. It is currently used in the US to counteract the side effects of various prescription drugs, including chemotherapy and other high-dose medications that can negatively impact the immune system. Read more:Why are child vaccination rates so low?What vaccines are children recommended to have and when?  The FDA said it had analysed literature published on the topic between 2009-2024 and \"has determined that the information supports a finding that leucovorin calcium can help individuals suffering from CFD\". What do experts say? While a handful of studies in recent years have suggested positive results when high-dose folic acid is used to treat children with autism, expert David Mandell, told AP that the studies are \"really tiny\" and larger, more rigorous trials would be needed to prove a concrete effect. The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, added that the science regarding leucovorin and autism \"is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached\"."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Sean \"Diddy\" Combs's lawyers have called for the music mogul to be given no more than 14 months in prison when he is sentenced next month - meaning he would walk free almost immediately. In a new written legal submission, the defence team also detailed \"inhumane\" conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York - saying food sometimes contains maggots, that the rapper is routinely subjected to violence, and that he has \"not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months\". Combs, 55, was found guilty of two prostitution-related charges following his high-profile trial in the summer, but cleared of the more serious charges of sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has already served a year in custody in New York following his arrest in September 2024, and is due to be sentenced on 3 October.   His defence lawyers have now made their arguments for sentencing in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who heard the trial. \"In the past two years, Mr Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" his lawyers said in the document. \"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment.\" They said Combs has been \"adequately punished\" already, having been jailed in \"terrible conditions\". He has also become sober \"for the first time in 25 years\" and had an \"incident-free record\", they added, and helped other inmates by creating an educational programme on business management and entrepreneurship. It is now time for the rapper \"to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life\", the defence team said. 'Maggots and limited clean water' The defence's submission provides new information about what life behind bars has been like for Combs, a Grammy-winning artist and Bad Boy Records founder who was one of the most influential hip-hop producers of the 1990s and 2000s, and for his family and previous associates. The rapper had to let more than 100 employees go from his businesses following his arrest, it said, and many have been unable to find work due to their previous association with him. Combs's seven children have also faced \"devastating consequences\", according to the legal filing, including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and music. The rapper and his family were also set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public. Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was also stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, it said. The defence's document also goes into detail about the alleged conditions at the detention centre where Combs is being held. \"Mr Combs is routinely subject to violence - both directed at him and at others,\" they said. On 12 September, they said members of the defence counsel were in the middle of a call with the rapper that had to be ended suddenly \"because of a stabbing that locked the facility down for the next several days\". Living conditions are \"inhumane\", they argued, and Combs has been \"under constant suicide watch\", meaning every two hours he \"must present his identification card to the guards to show he is alive and well. While he is sleeping, he is awoken by an officer to ensure he is well and subjected to bright lights illuminated 24 hours per day\". He also has limited access to clean water, they said, and often \"heats his water to have clean water to drink without getting sick\". Describing the dorm-style room he sleeps in, they said he is within \"two feet from other inmates with the bathroom in the same room, with no door\". Read more:How the trial unfoldedThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' Combs The rapper \"has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin\", the document added, while food \"on any given day can contain maggots\". The judge has already rejected a proposed $50m bail package for Combs. Prosecutors, who will also submit their recommendations for sentencing ahead of the hearing, have already said they will call for him to remain in prison for a substantial period. Combs was found guilty of two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution - for flying girlfriends and male sex workers around the US and abroad for sexual encounters referred to as \"freak offs\". Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  Britain's largest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), faces a prolonged shutdown of its global operations after the company announced an extension of the current closure, which began on 31 August, to at least 1 October. The extension will cost JLR tens of millions of pounds a day in lost revenue, raise major concerns about companies and jobs in the supply chain, and raise further questions about the vulnerability of UK industry to cyber assaults. The company \"clearly haven't resolved the problem\" of the attack on its IT systems, \"because the factory hasn't restarted\", industry minister Chris McDonald said. Money latest: I was charged Â£885 for airport parking error A spokesperson said of the move: \"We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation. \"Our teams continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the NCSC and law enforcement to ensure we restart in a safe and secure manner. \"Our focus remains on supporting our customers, suppliers, colleagues, and our retailers who remain open. We fully recognise this is a difficult time for all connected with JLR and we thank everyone for their continued support and patience.\" A fix has been created, allowing tens of thousands of completed vehicles to be rolled out to forecourts. The cars have been ordered, but were unable to be registered with the systems offline. Now, a workaround has been created with the Department for Transport and the Drivers and Vehicles Licensing Agency (DVLA) to allow cars to move to buyers.  More than 33,000 people work directly for JLR in the UK, many of them employed on assembly lines in the West Midlands, the largest of which is in Solihull, and a plant at Halewood on Merseyside. An estimated 200,000 more are employed by several hundred companies in the supply chain, who face a prolonged interruption to trade with what for many will be their largest client. The \"just-in-time\" nature of automotive production means that many had little choice but to shut down immediately after JLR announced its closure, and no incentive to resume until it is clear when it will be back in production. Industry sources estimate that around 25% of suppliers have already taken steps to pause production and lay off workers, many of them by \"banking hours\" they will have to work in future. Read more:More than a quarter of cars sold in August were electric vehicles FCA considers compensation scheme for car finance scandal - raising payout hopes Another quarter are expected to make decisions this week, following JLR's previous announcement that production would be paused until at least Wednesday. JLR, which produces the Jaguar, Range Rover and Land Rover marques, has also been forced to halt production and assembly at facilities in China, Slovakia, India and Brazil after its IT systems were effectively disabled by the cyber attack. JLR's Solihull plant has been running short shifts with skeleton staff, with some teams understood to be carrying out basic maintenance while the production lines stand idle, including painting floors. Among workers who had finished a half-shift last Friday, there was resignation to the uncertainty. \"We have been told not to talk about it, and even if we could, we don't know what's happening,\" said one. Calls for support The government has faced calls from unions to introduce a furlough-style scheme to protect jobs in the supply chain, but with JLR generating profits of Â£2.2bn last year, the company will face pressure to support its suppliers. Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said while government support should be the last resort, it should not be off the table. \"Whatever happens to JLR will reverberate through the supply chain,\" chief executive Mike Hawes told Sky News. \"There are a huge number of suppliers in the UK, a mixture of large multinationals, but also a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises, and those are the ones who are most at risk. Some of them, maybe up to a quarter, have already had to lay off people. There'll be another further 20-25% considering that in the next few days and weeks. \"It's a very high bar for the government to intervene, but without the supply chain, you don't have the major manufacturers and you don't have an industry.\" What happened to the IT system? JLR, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, has provided no details of the nature of the attack, but it is presumed to be a ransomware assault similar to that which debilitated Marks and Spencer and the Co-Op earlier this year. As well as interrupting vehicle production, dealers have been unable to register vehicles or order spare parts, and even diagnostic software for analysing individual vehicles has been affected. Last week, it said it was conducting a \"forensic\" investigation and considering how to stage the \"controlled restart\" of global production. Speculation has centred on the vulnerability of IT support desks to surreptitious activity from hackers posing as employees to access passwords, as well as 'phishing' or other digital means of accessing systems. In September 2023, JLR outsourced its IT and digital services to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), also a Tata-owned company, intended, it said, to \"transform, simplify, and help manage its digital estate, and build a new future-ready, strategic technology architecture\". Resilience risks Three months earlier, TCS extended an existing agreement with M&S, saying it would \"improve resilience and pace of innovation, and drive sustainable growth.\" Officials from the National Cyber Security Centre are thought to be assisting JLR with their investigations, while officials and ministers from the Department for Business and International Trade have been kept informed of the situation. Liam Byrne, a Birmingham MP and chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the JLR closure raises concerns about the resilience of UK business. \"British business is now much more vulnerable for two reasons. One, many of these cyber threats have got bad states behind them. Russia, North Korea, Iran. These are serious players. \"Second, the attack surface that business is exposed to is now much bigger, because their digital operations are much bigger. They'll be global organisations. They might have their IT outsourced in another country. So the vulnerability is now much greater than in the past.\""

        "Headline": "The chancellor is expected to outline significant tax rises in the upcoming budget in November, as borrowing costs soar. Months of speculation has included talk of a potential wealth tax, changes to council tax, and more.",
        "Content": "Rachel Reeves has been urged by a thinktank to cut national insurance and increase income tax to create a \"level playing field\" and protect workers' pay. The Resolution Foundation said the chancellor should send a \"decisive signal\" that she will make \"tough decisions\" on tax. Ms Reeves is expected to outline significant tax rises in the upcoming budget in November. The Resolution Foundation has suggested these changes should include a 2p cut to national insurance as well as a 2p rise in income tax, which Adam Corlett, its principal economist, said \"should form part of wider efforts to level the playing field on tax\". The thinktank, which used to be headed by Torsten Bell, a Labour MP who is now a key aide to Ms Reeves and a pensions minister, said the move would help to address \"unfairness\" in the tax system. It released its report as a closely-watched survey of business activity suggested a loss of momentum and confidence ahead of possible new tax increases in the budget. S&P Global's preliminary UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, covering the services and manufacturing sectors, also showed a further rise in job losses. The prospects ahead also look gloomy as recent official data has pointed to a slowdown in growth. A report by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that higher taxes and spending cuts are set to weigh on UK output next year. The issue of tax is dominating the build-up to the chancellor's speech as she stares down a deepening black hole in the public finances. As more people pay income tax than national insurance, including pensioners and landlords, the foundation estimates the switch it is suggesting would go some way in raising the Â£20bn in tax it thinks would be needed by 2029/2030 to offset increased borrowing costs, flat growth and new spending commitments. Other estimates go as high as Â£51bn. 'Significant tax rises needed' Another proposal by the think tank would see a gradual lowering of the threshold at which businesses pay VAT from Â£90,000 to Â£30,000, as this would help \"promote fair competition\" and raise Â£2bn by the end of the decade. The Resolution Foundation also recommends increasing the tax on dividends, addressing a \"worrying\" growth in unpaid corporation tax from small businesses, applying a carbon charge to long-haul flights and shipping, and expanding taxation of sugar and salt. \"Policy U-turns, higher borrowing costs and lower productivity growth mean that the chancellor will need to act to avoid borrowing costs rising even further this autumn,\" Mr Corlett said. \"Significant tax rises will be needed for the chancellor to send a clear signal that the UK's public finances are under control.\" He added that while any tax rises are \"likely to be painful\", Ms Reeves should do \"all she can to avoid loading further pain onto workers' pay packets\". The government has repeatedly insisted it will keep its manifesto promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. A Treasury spokesperson said in response to the thinktank report, it does \"not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy\".  Chancellor urged to freeze alcohol duty Meanwhile, Ms Reeves has been urged to freeze alcohol duty in the upcoming budget and not increase the rate of excise tax on alcohol until the end of the current parliament. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), UK Spirits Alliance, Welsh Whisky Association, English Whisky Guild and Drinks Ireland said in an open letter that the current regime was \"unfair\" and has put a \"strain\" on members who are \"struggling\". The bodies are also urging Ms Reeves \"to ensure there will be no further widening of the tax differential between spirits and other alcohol categories\". A Treasury spokesperson said there will be no export duty, lower licensing fees, reduced tariffs, and a cap on corporation tax to make it easier for British distilleries to thrive. Leave retailers alone, Reeves told This comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that food inflation will rise and remain above 5% into next year if the retail industry is hit by further tax rises in the November budget. The BRC voiced concerns that around 4,000 large shops could experience a rise in their business rates if they are included in the government's new surtax for properties with a rateable value - an estimation of how much it would cost to rent a property for a year - over Â£500,000, and this could lead to price rises for consumers. Read more:Food inflation at 18-month high'Stealth' and 'sin' taxes expected to riseFirms cut jobs at fastest pace since 2021 Latest ONS figures put food inflation at 4.9%, the highest level since 2022/2023. The Bank of England left the interest rate unchanged last week amid fears that rising food prices were putting mounting pressure on headline inflation. \"The biggest risk to food prices would be to include large shops - including supermarkets - in the new surtax on large properties,\" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She added: \"Removing all shops from the surtax can be done without any cost to the taxpayer, and would demonstrate the chancellor's commitment to bring down inflation.\""

He identified a void left by the major UK high street banks, utilising Open Banking data to provide a digital service to help fund SMEs' working capital requirements. The company's board members include Dan Cobley, a former Google UK managing director, and co-founder of the UK-based fintechs ClearScore and Salary Finance. Mr Le Luel, who also worked at Barclays and Capital One, said: \"We solve one of the biggest problems in the real economy - suppliers and staff need to be paid on time, yet clients take time to pay. \"With 55 days of average payment terms, UK small businesses are constantly owed Â£150bn in commercial invoices waiting to be paid. \"Triver allows these businesses to turn their client invoices into instant cash flow, at any time, to fund working capital needs.\" He described it as \"the most flexible and cost-effective solution to smooth cashflow without taking new debt\". Since launching, Triver has built a client base of more than 1,500 businesses and funded more than 17,000 invoices worth roughly Â£180m, it said. The company says its SME clients are typically granted a new facility within ten minutes of starting their application, with invoices taking less than 5 minutes to fund. This compares to a standard period for high street banks of four weeks to open a facility, and up to 24 hours to advance an invoice. Clare Mitchell, director, fintech at HSBC Innovation Banking UK, said the new debt facility would enable Triver \"to continue to scale its cashflow finance offering to an ever-growing number of small businesses across the UK\"."

At the same time OpenAI, like Google, Amazon and others, has been working on plans to build its own AI chips, aiming for a cheaper alternative to Nvidia. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the partnership: \"For Nvidia, the prize is huge - every gigawatt of AI data centre capacity is worth about $50bn in revenue, meaning this project could be worth as much as $500bn. \"This move cements Nvidiaâs position as the undisputed king of AI at a time when custom chips from hyperscalers and startups had started to nibble at its dominance. \"By locking in OpenAI as a strategic partner and co-optimizing hardware and software roadmaps, Nvidia is ensuring its GPUs remain the backbone of next-gen AI infrastructure. \"The market is clearly big enough for multiple players, but this deal underscores that, when it comes to scale and ecosystem depth, Nvidia is still setting the pace - and raising the stakes for everyone else.\" "

The government has said up to 50 people a week could be deported under the scheme initially, but it believes numbers would grow and eventually act as a deterrent to those considering making the dangerous journey across the Channel. \n                  Iranian man becomes third migrant deported under UK-France deal\n                 \n                  David Lammy defends migrant returns deal with France - as 1,000 people cross Channel in one day\n                 \n                  Second deportation flight of week under UK-France deal set to take place today\n                 Last Friday saw more than 1,000 people cross the Channel to the UK in small boats - the day after the first migrant was deported under the \"one in, one out\" deal. The latest Home Office figures show 1,072 people made the journey in 13 boats - averaging more than 82 people per boat. It means the number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel has topped 30,000 for the year so far. Shabana Mahmood, who was promoted to home secretary in the prime minister's reshuffle earlier this month, has accused migrants who try to block their deportation of making a \"mockery\" of the UK's modern slavery laws. She has vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to end crossings - but the Conservatives have branded the \"one in, one out\" deal with France \"meagre\" and have called for their Rwanda policy to be reinstated.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: \"Yet again the courts have stepped in to block a deportation, proving what we warned from the start, unless you tackle the lawfare strangling Britain's borders, nothing will change. \"This is nothing but a gimmick. Even if by some miracle it worked, it would still be no deterrent, as 94 per cent of arrivals would still stay.\" Meanwhile, Reform UK has promised to crack down on both legal and illegal migration. Last month, party leader Nigel Farage outlined plans to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants in the first parliament of a potential Reform UK government. On Monday, he announced fresh policies to reduce legal migration, saying his party would ban access to benefits to migrants and get rid of indefinite leave to remain - the term used to describe the right to settle in the UK, with access to benefits, after five years."

        "Content": "Sir Ed Davey has used his keynote speech to warn that the UK has a choice between \"the real change people crave\", and a Reform government turning Britain into \"Trump's America\". The leader of the Liberal Democrats has sought to paint a picture of the country at a crossroads, and has heaped accusations on Nigel Farage - suggesting he would reverse gun laws and scrap the NHS. Sir Ed has spent the past few days of the party's conference in Bournemouth attacking tech titan Elon Musk and the Reform UK leader. But now he has used his speech to try and tie the ideas of Mr Farage and President Trump together in voters' minds. He said: \"Imagine living in the Trump-inspired country Farage wants us to become. \"Where there's no NHS, so patients are hit with crippling insurance bills. Or denied healthcare altogether. \"Where we pay Putin for expensive fossil fuels and destroy our beautiful countryside with fracking - while climate change rages on. \n                  Why Ed Davey is taking the fight to Farage - despite the Lib Dems and Reform sharing few voters\n                 \n                  Davey accuses Trump of overseeing 'biggest threat to fight against cancer'\n                 \n                  Sir Ed Davey refuses to rule out deal with Sir Keir Starmer to stop Reform winning power\n                 \"Where gun laws are rolled back, so schools have to teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting. Where social media barons are free to poison young minds with impunity.\" Sir Ed also accused Mr Farage's party of allowing \"the government [to] trample on our basic rights and freedoms\" by saying it will pull the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) - and of giving \"tacit support\" to racism and misogyny. The Lib Dem claimed a Reform government would be \"where everything is in a constant state of chaos\". Under Mr Farage, those with mental health problems would be told they are \"making it up\", and children with special educational needs that they have \"been wrongly diagnosed\", Sir Ed said. \"That is Trump's America. Don't let it become Farage's Britain,\" he warned. But Sir Ed has not only attacked Reform UK for what could happen if they came to power, but also for the \"crisis\", which he accused Mr Farage of having already caused. He pointed to the Reform leader's support for leaving the EU, which led to 27 existing migrant return agreements being abolished. Sir Ed said: \"He caused this [small boats] crisis, and he should apologise. \"And look at this hypocrite's big announcement on deportation last month. \"Look at what his plan really means. Sending men, women and children who have fled the Taliban back to Afghanistan to be murdered by them. And even paying the Taliban to do it. \"That isn't patriotic. That isn't British. That isn't who we are. \"So much that is broken in our country today is broken thanks to Nigel Farage. And now he wants to break it even more. Unless we stop him.\"  In fact, Sir Ed directly mentioned Mr Farage by name in his speech 30 times, a point made by our political editor Beth Rigby, who has argued that the Reform UK leader is living 'rent-free' in the Lib Dem's head. Farage is allied with Musk, Putin and Trump, Davey claims But Sir Ed also had tech billionaire, Elon Musk, in his sights once again. The Lib Dem leader repeated his allegation that the X owner was \"inciting far-right violence\" with his speech at the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally last weekend. He called for the UK to stand up to Mr Musk, and for the government to \"properly enforce our laws so he can't get away with inflicting harm on our kids\". \"Nigel Farage is on the side of Elon Musk, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,\" he alleged. \"Liberal Democrats are on the side of the British people.\" Sky News has approached X and Elon Musk for comment about these comments that he has made previously, but as of publication has received no response. X maintains it has \"zero tolerance for child sexual abuse material\" and claims tackling those who exploit children is a \"top priority\". Read more:UK faces 'crisis' of child-on-child sexual abuse Trump is 'the biggest threat to the fight against cancer' Another person to face Sir Ed's ire was President Trump, who the leader accused of becoming \"the biggest threat to the fight against cancer\". \"The US is by far the world's biggest funder of cancer research - mostly through its National Cancer Institute,\" the leader said. \"But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, he has cancelled hundreds of grants for cancer research projects. \"He's slashing billions of dollars from the National Cancer Institute's budget.\"  Sir Ed appealed for scientists who have had projects cancelled or funding cut to \"come here and finish it in the UK\". He said a dedicated scheme should be established to allow them to move to work at British research institutions, without having to pay large visa fees. He also used his speech to pledge to boost healthcare and cancer research more widely. He told party members: \"The UK should step up and say: if Trump won't back this research, we will. \"We'll boost funding for cancer research in the UK. We'll rebuild a National Cancer Research Institute, after it was closed under the Conservatives, to coordinate research and drive it forward. \"We'll pass a Cancer Survival Research Act to ensure funding for research into the deadliest cancers.\" He also announced a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that each patient in the UK diagnosed with cancer will start treatment within two months under the Liberal Democrats.

After saying that Mr Kennedy Jr \"wants to be very careful with what he says,\" the US president added: \"Taking Tylenol is not good. All right. I'll say it. It's not good. \"For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  Britain's largest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), faces a prolonged shutdown of its global operations after the company announced an extension of the current closure, which began on 31 August, to at least 1 October. The extension will cost JLR tens of millions of pounds a day in lost revenue, raise major concerns about companies and jobs in the supply chain, and raise further questions about the vulnerability of UK industry to cyber assaults. The company \"clearly haven't resolved the problem\" of the attack on its IT systems, \"because the factory hasn't restarted\", industry minister Chris McDonald said. Money latest: I was charged Â£885 for airport parking error A spokesperson said of the move: \"We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation. \"Our teams continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the NCSC and law enforcement to ensure we restart in a safe and secure manner. \"Our focus remains on supporting our customers, suppliers, colleagues, and our retailers who remain open. We fully recognise this is a difficult time for all connected with JLR and we thank everyone for their continued support and patience.\" A fix has been created, allowing tens of thousands of completed vehicles to be rolled out to forecourts. The cars have been ordered, but were unable to be registered with the systems offline. Now, a workaround has been created with the Department for Transport and the Drivers and Vehicles Licensing Agency (DVLA) to allow cars to move to buyers.  More than 33,000 people work directly for JLR in the UK, many of them employed on assembly lines in the West Midlands, the largest of which is in Solihull, and a plant at Halewood on Merseyside. An estimated 200,000 more are employed by several hundred companies in the supply chain, who face a prolonged interruption to trade with what for many will be their largest client. The \"just-in-time\" nature of automotive production means that many had little choice but to shut down immediately after JLR announced its closure, and no incentive to resume until it is clear when it will be back in production. Industry sources estimate that around 25% of suppliers have already taken steps to pause production and lay off workers, many of them by \"banking hours\" they will have to work in future. Read more:More than a quarter of cars sold in August were electric vehicles FCA considers compensation scheme for car finance scandal - raising payout hopes Another quarter are expected to make decisions this week, following JLR's previous announcement that production would be paused until at least Wednesday. JLR, which produces the Jaguar, Range Rover and Land Rover marques, has also been forced to halt production and assembly at facilities in China, Slovakia, India and Brazil after its IT systems were effectively disabled by the cyber attack. JLR's Solihull plant has been running short shifts with skeleton staff, with some teams understood to be carrying out basic maintenance while the production lines stand idle, including painting floors. Among workers who had finished a half-shift last Friday, there was resignation to the uncertainty. \"We have been told not to talk about it, and even if we could, we don't know what's happening,\" said one. Calls for support The government has faced calls from unions to introduce a furlough-style scheme to protect jobs in the supply chain, but with JLR generating profits of Â£2.2bn last year, the company will face pressure to support its suppliers. Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said while government support should be the last resort, it should not be off the table. \"Whatever happens to JLR will reverberate through the supply chain,\" chief executive Mike Hawes told Sky News. \"There are a huge number of suppliers in the UK, a mixture of large multinationals, but also a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises, and those are the ones who are most at risk. Some of them, maybe up to a quarter, have already had to lay off people. There'll be another further 20-25% considering that in the next few days and weeks. \"It's a very high bar for the government to intervene, but without the supply chain, you don't have the major manufacturers and you don't have an industry.\" What happened to the IT system? JLR, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, has provided no details of the nature of the attack, but it is presumed to be a ransomware assault similar to that which debilitated Marks and Spencer and the Co-Op earlier this year. As well as interrupting vehicle production, dealers have been unable to register vehicles or order spare parts, and even diagnostic software for analysing individual vehicles has been affected. Last week, it said it was conducting a \"forensic\" investigation and considering how to stage the \"controlled restart\" of global production. Speculation has centred on the vulnerability of IT support desks to surreptitious activity from hackers posing as employees to access passwords, as well as 'phishing' or other digital means of accessing systems. In September 2023, JLR outsourced its IT and digital services to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), also a Tata-owned company, intended, it said, to \"transform, simplify, and help manage its digital estate, and build a new future-ready, strategic technology architecture\". Resilience risks Three months earlier, TCS extended an existing agreement with M&S, saying it would \"improve resilience and pace of innovation, and drive sustainable growth.\" Officials from the National Cyber Security Centre are thought to be assisting JLR with their investigations, while officials and ministers from the Department for Business and International Trade have been kept informed of the situation. Liam Byrne, a Birmingham MP and chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the JLR closure raises concerns about the resilience of UK business. \"British business is now much more vulnerable for two reasons. One, many of these cyber threats have got bad states behind them. Russia, North Korea, Iran. These are serious players. \"Second, the attack surface that business is exposed to is now much bigger, because their digital operations are much bigger. They'll be global organisations. They might have their IT outsourced in another country. So the vulnerability is now much greater than in the past.\""

        "Headline": "The chancellor is expected to outline significant tax rises in the upcoming budget in November, as borrowing costs soar. Months of speculation has included talk of a potential wealth tax, changes to council tax, and more.",
        "Content": "Rachel Reeves has been urged by a thinktank to cut national insurance and increase income tax to create a \"level playing field\" and protect workers' pay. The Resolution Foundation said the chancellor should send a \"decisive signal\" that she will make \"tough decisions\" on tax. Ms Reeves is expected to outline significant tax rises in the upcoming budget in November. The Resolution Foundation has suggested these changes should include a 2p cut to national insurance as well as a 2p rise in income tax, which Adam Corlett, its principal economist, said \"should form part of wider efforts to level the playing field on tax\". The thinktank, which used to be headed by Torsten Bell, a Labour MP who is now a key aide to Ms Reeves and a pensions minister, said the move would help to address \"unfairness\" in the tax system. It released its report as a closely-watched survey of business activity suggested a loss of momentum and confidence ahead of possible new tax increases in the budget. S&P Global's preliminary UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, covering the services and manufacturing sectors, also showed a further rise in job losses. The prospects ahead also look gloomy as recent official data has pointed to a slowdown in growth. A report by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that higher taxes and spending cuts are set to weigh on UK output next year. The issue of tax is dominating the build-up to the chancellor's speech as she stares down a deepening black hole in the public finances. As more people pay income tax than national insurance, including pensioners and landlords, the foundation estimates the switch it is suggesting would go some way in raising the Â£20bn in tax it thinks would be needed by 2029/2030 to offset increased borrowing costs, flat growth and new spending commitments. Other estimates go as high as Â£51bn. 'Significant tax rises needed' Another proposal by the think tank would see a gradual lowering of the threshold at which businesses pay VAT from Â£90,000 to Â£30,000, as this would help \"promote fair competition\" and raise Â£2bn by the end of the decade. The Resolution Foundation also recommends increasing the tax on dividends, addressing a \"worrying\" growth in unpaid corporation tax from small businesses, applying a carbon charge to long-haul flights and shipping, and expanding taxation of sugar and salt. \"Policy U-turns, higher borrowing costs and lower productivity growth mean that the chancellor will need to act to avoid borrowing costs rising even further this autumn,\" Mr Corlett said. \"Significant tax rises will be needed for the chancellor to send a clear signal that the UK's public finances are under control.\" He added that while any tax rises are \"likely to be painful\", Ms Reeves should do \"all she can to avoid loading further pain onto workers' pay packets\". The government has repeatedly insisted it will keep its manifesto promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. A Treasury spokesperson said in response to the thinktank report, it does \"not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy\".  Chancellor urged to freeze alcohol duty Meanwhile, Ms Reeves has been urged to freeze alcohol duty in the upcoming budget and not increase the rate of excise tax on alcohol until the end of the current parliament. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), UK Spirits Alliance, Welsh Whisky Association, English Whisky Guild and Drinks Ireland said in an open letter that the current regime was \"unfair\" and has put a \"strain\" on members who are \"struggling\". The bodies are also urging Ms Reeves \"to ensure there will be no further widening of the tax differential between spirits and other alcohol categories\". A Treasury spokesperson said there will be no export duty, lower licensing fees, reduced tariffs, and a cap on corporation tax to make it easier for British distilleries to thrive. Leave retailers alone, Reeves told This comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that food inflation will rise and remain above 5% into next year if the retail industry is hit by further tax rises in the November budget. The BRC voiced concerns that around 4,000 large shops could experience a rise in their business rates if they are included in the government's new surtax for properties with a rateable value - an estimation of how much it would cost to rent a property for a year - over Â£500,000, and this could lead to price rises for consumers.

She added: \"Removing all shops from the surtax can be done without any cost to the taxpayer, and would demonstrate the chancellor's commitment to bring down inflation.\""

The Health, Social Care and Sport Committee has concerns with the proposal and said it will require \"significant amendments\" if it is to reach stage two. The bill, introduced by Scottish Tory MSP Douglas Ross, seeks to give those diagnosed with drug or alcohol addiction a statutory right to receive treatment from a relevant professional. MSP Clare Haughey, convener of the committee, said a majority of the committee \"do not believe this bill is the correct vehicle to effectively support those suffering harm from alcohol or drug use\".  Current availability and access to support services for those experiencing harm from drug or alcohol misuse was revealed to have a high level of dissatisfaction in the stage one scrutiny. However, the report also highlighted widespread stakeholder concerns that the bill's focus is too narrow and could also put further pressure on over-stretched resources. A proposed three-week statutory deadline in the bill raised concerns that it could compromise treatment quality, limit choice, increase relapse risk, and could lead to a rise in litigation in cases where health services are unable to meet the legal rights on time. The costs of implementation set out in the financial memorandum were also said to be a \"significant underestimate\". And should the bill proceed to stage two, the committee has called on Mr Ross to consider further ways of ensuring that it works in tandem, \"rather than in conflict\", with the existing policy and legal framework governing the rights of people suffering from alcohol or drug misuse. Ms Haughey said: \"Our report highlights our serious concerns with the bill in its current form and it is because of those concerns that a majority of our committee is unable to recommend to parliament that the bill should proceed to stage two. \"We acknowledge the bill's aim of helping those suffering from drug and alcohol misuse. \"However, our evidence has highlighted that the bill in its current form could negatively impact individuals who are suffering and put even greater strain on services that are already deeply stretched.\" Read more:Living beside the UK's first drug consumption roomDigger mobilised to clean up drugs den near The Thistle On Tuesday, data from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) showed there were 1,185 alcohol specific deaths in 2024 - a decrease of 92 (7%) on the previous year.

NRS data also recently showed there were a total of 1,017 deaths due to drug misuse in 2024 - a decrease of 155 (13%) on the previous year. Despite the drop, Scotland remains the drugs death capital of Europe. And while the UK's first safer drug consumption room opened in Glasgow in January, a Westminster committee said last week it should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\" to tackle the crisis. Mr Ross said: \"Scotland is the drugs death capital of Europe, so it's clear the status quo is failing and that we require a new approach to tackle this national emergency. \"The committee's concerns are over the implementation of the bill, rather than its underlying principles. \"These concerns can be addressed during the parliamentary process, so I would urge MSPs to vote for the bill at stage one, rather than block it and condemn more families to the heartache of losing a loved one to drugs. \"Yes, there will be additional costs to providing residential rehab on the scale required - but if we are serious about tackling the appalling number of drug fatalities in Scotland, we have to provide this funding and make tackling addiction the priority it should be.\""

        "Content": "Scientists have discovered the remains of a new dinosaur - feasting on an ancient crocodile bone. The new find in Argentina hails from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans - and was thought to be 23ft long. It probably lived between 66 and 70 million years ago - close to the time dinosaurs went extinct - and was at least 19 years old when it died, although scientists do not know what killed it. Researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as an arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhue Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realise this could be a new species. The front leg bone pressed against its jaws - belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles - could reveal clues to its diet.

They were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws\", the scientists added. This latest member of the megaraptoran clan - named Joaquinraptor casali - \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet\", said Federico Agnolin, with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia. Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, who was part of the discovery team, named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. The research was published in the journal Nature Communications."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n NASA is accelerating plans to send humans back to the moon, with a possible launch as early as 5 February. The US space agency said the mission to fly four astronauts around the moon for the first time in more than 50 years would give people a \"front row seat to history\". It had previously committed to the first crewed flight of its Artemis moon return programme by April next year. But preparations are ahead of schedule, and it is now more optimistic of an earlier lift off. Lakiesha Hawkins, one of NASA's acting deputy associate administrators, told a news conference that the 10-day mission would be a milestone in space exploration. \"We together have a front row seat to history,\" she said. \"We are working to accelerate preparations to potentially as early as February, but we want to emphasise that safety is our top priority.\" The crew of three Americans and one Canadian includes the first person of colour and the first woman to head beyond Earth's orbit. The launch was delayed by problems with the first, uncrewed, test flight in 2022. Most critical was the loss of material from the heatshield that should protect the crew capsule from a temperature of almost 3,000 degrees Celsius during re-entry to the atmosphere. Engineering fixes have now been completed, and the capsule will be hoisted on top of the rocket in the next few weeks. NASA then needs to complete a series of systems checks before rolling the rocket out to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. The mission will take 10 days to fly by the moon at a distance of 5,000 miles, then return, with a splashdown off the Californian coast.  If successful, the agency hopes to launch the third Artemis mission in 2027, this time with a crew that will land on the surface. That looks highly ambitious. SpaceX is due to fly astronauts on the last leg, from lunar orbit down to the surface, in its huge Starship. But development has been badly delayed by a series of explosions.

It is also testing a rocket that it hopes will launch a human mission to the lunar surface by 2030. At a news conference to reveal a new class of NASA astronauts, Sean Duffy, the agency's acting chief, said winning the race would need money and grit. \"I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA or beat America back to the moon,\" he said. \"We're going to win: we love challenges, we love competition. And we are going to win the second space race back to the moon.\""

Daniel Bannister, 50, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting a single charge of breaching a restraining order. He was also given a new restraining order, which warns him against contacting the former Girls Aloud singer. \"You are causing her anxiety,\" Judge Alan Blake told him. \"She does not wish any contact with you. You have shown defiance to the court order. You need to draw a line under that behaviour.\" Bannister turned up at Tweedy's rural home for the fourth time on 19 June. Reading Crown Court heard he arrived in a taxi just before 10pm and rang the intercom twice before peering over the gate. Bannister believed the singer had invited him to her home over Microsoft Teams, the court was told. Tweedy said she was \"stunned\" when Bannister visited her home yet again and had been forced to hire security. \"Each time he returns the worry of his intentions intensifies,\" she said in a victim impact statement. \"I'm worried, nervous and on edge every time I open my gate.

During that appearance, the court heard that Tweedy \"immediately panicked\" and was \"terrified\" when she saw him outside her home, fearing for the safety of her eight-year-old son Bear. Bannister killed Rajendra Patel, 48, at a south London YMCA shelter in 2012 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Mr Patel died from an injury to his leg, a court heard.

        "Content": "Noel Clarke has been ordered to pay at least Â£3m of The Guardian publisher's legal costs after losing his \"far-fetched\" libel case over allegations of sexual misconduct reported by the newspaper. The first article, published in April 2021, said some 20 women who knew the actor and filmmaker in a professional capacity had come forward with allegations including harassment and sexually inappropriate behaviour. Clarke, best known for his 2006 film Kidulthood and for starring in Doctor Who, sued Guardian News and Media (GNM) over seven articles in total, as well as a podcast, and vehemently denied \"any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing\".  Following a trial earlier this year, a High Court judge found the newspaper's reporting was substantially true, agreeing with the publisher's defence of its reporting as both true and in the public interest. At a hearing to determine costs on Tuesday, Clarke represented himself - saying in written submissions to the court that his legal team had resigned as he was unable to provide funding for the hearing. Mrs Justice Steyn ruled that he must pay Â£3m ahead of a further assessment into the total costs to be recovered, which lawyers for the publisher estimate to be more than Â£6m. \"The claimant maintained a far-fetched and indeed a false case that the articles were not substantially true, by pursuing allegations of dishonesty and bad faith against almost all of the defendant's truth witnesses,\" the judge said. The sum of Â£3m sought by GNM was \"appropriate and no more than what ought to be reasonably ordered in this case\", she added, and \"substantially lower than the defendant's likely level of recovery\". Clarke describes proposed costs as 'excessive' Clarke, 49, told the court he used AI platform ChatGPT to help prepare his response to GNM's barrister Gavin Millar KC, who asked the judge to order Â£3m as an interim payment - which he said was \"significantly less\" than the \"norm\" of asking for 75%-80%. The actor described the proposed costs order as \"excessive\", \"inflated\" and \"caused by their own choices\", and asked the court to \"consider both the law and the human reality of these proceedings\". He also requested that the order on costs be held pending an appeal. \"I have not been vexatious and I have not tried to play games with the court,\" Clarke said. \"I have lost my work, my savings, my legal team, my ability to support my family and much of my health. \"My wife and children live every day under the shadow of uncertainty. We remortgaged our home just to survive. Any costs or interim payments must be proportionate to my means as a single household, not the unlimited resources of a major media conglomerate. \"A crushing order would not just punish me, it would punish my children and wife, and they do not deserve that.\" Read more:The key allegations - and the judge's response Detailing GNM's spend, Mr Millar said about 40,000 documents, including audio recordings and transcripts, had to be reviewed as a result of Clarke bringing the case against them. He highlighted a number of \"misconceived applications\" made by the actor which \"required much work from the defendant's lawyers in response\". During the trial, the actor accused GNM - as well as a number of women who made accusations against him - of being part of a conspiracy aiming to destroy his career. This conspiracy allegation \"massively increased the scale and costs of the litigation by giving rise to a whole new unpleaded line of attack against witnesses and third parties\", Mr Millar said in written submissions to the court. Clarke originally asked for damages of Â£10m, increasing to Â£40m and then Â£70m as the case progressed, the barrister said. He must now pay GNM the Â£3m within 28 days, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Sean \"Diddy\" Combs's lawyers have called for the music mogul to be given no more than 14 months in prison when he is sentenced next month - meaning he would walk free almost immediately. In a new written legal submission, the defence team also detailed \"inhumane\" conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York - saying food sometimes contains maggots, that the rapper is routinely subjected to violence, and that he has \"not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months\". Combs, 55, was found guilty of two prostitution-related charges following his high-profile trial in the summer, but cleared of the more serious charges of sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has already served a year in custody in New York following his arrest in September 2024, and is due to be sentenced on 3 October.   His defence lawyers have now made their arguments for sentencing in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who heard the trial. \"In the past two years, Mr Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" his lawyers said in the document. \"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment.\" They said Combs has been \"adequately punished\" already, having been jailed in \"terrible conditions\". He has also become sober \"for the first time in 25 years\" and had an \"incident-free record\", they added, and helped other inmates by creating an educational programme on business management and entrepreneurship. It is now time for the rapper \"to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life\", the defence team said. 'Maggots and limited clean water' The defence's submission provides new information about what life behind bars has been like for Combs, a Grammy-winning artist and Bad Boy Records founder who was one of the most influential hip-hop producers of the 1990s and 2000s, and for his family and previous associates. The rapper had to let more than 100 employees go from his businesses following his arrest, it said, and many have been unable to find work due to their previous association with him. Combs's seven children have also faced \"devastating consequences\", according to the legal filing, including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and music. The rapper and his family were also set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public. Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was also stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, it said. The defence's document also goes into detail about the alleged conditions at the detention centre where Combs is being held. \"Mr Combs is routinely subject to violence - both directed at him and at others,\" they said. On 12 September, they said members of the defence counsel were in the middle of a call with the rapper that had to be ended suddenly \"because of a stabbing that locked the facility down for the next several days\". Living conditions are \"inhumane\", they argued, and Combs has been \"under constant suicide watch\", meaning every two hours he \"must present his identification card to the guards to show he is alive and well. While he is sleeping, he is awoken by an officer to ensure he is well and subjected to bright lights illuminated 24 hours per day\". He also has limited access to clean water, they said, and often \"heats his water to have clean water to drink without getting sick\". Describing the dorm-style room he sleeps in, they said he is within \"two feet from other inmates with the bathroom in the same room, with no door\". Read more:How the trial unfoldedThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' Combs The rapper \"has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin\", the document added, while food \"on any given day can contain maggots\". The judge has already rejected a proposed $50m bail package for Combs. Prosecutors, who will also submit their recommendations for sentencing ahead of the hearing, have already said they will call for him to remain in prison for a substantial period. Combs was found guilty of two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution - for flying girlfriends and male sex workers around the US and abroad for sexual encounters referred to as \"freak offs\". Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison."
