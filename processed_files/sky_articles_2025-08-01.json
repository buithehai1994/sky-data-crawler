        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n The world's most secretive state is a mystery for billions of people - but not Anastasiya Samsonova. She has returned from a week's holiday in North Korea. \"We saw nothing terrible there, there is no danger there,\" the 33-year-old HR manager tells me. \"Frankly speaking, we really liked it.\" She was part of a group of 15 Russian tourists who were the first foreign visitors to a new seaside resort, which was opened to great fanfare by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in June. Her holiday snaps show a white sand beach, shimmering seas and high-rise hotels. But something's missing - people. There are rows of sun loungers, but not a soul sitting on them. A glittering banquet hall that's devoid of diners. That's because, when it comes to international tourists, the Wonsan-Kalma resort is currently only open to Russians. \"The hotel was absolutely new,\" Anastasiya enthuses, unfussed by the absence of others. \"Everything was done very beautifully, a good interior ... very developed infrastructure.\" But why not Turkey? Or Thailand? I gently suggest that people in Britain might be shocked at the idea of a summer break in a country better known for famines and forced labour than parasols and pina coladas. \"We were interested in seeing how people live there,\" Anastasiya explains. \"There were a lot of prejudices about what you can and can't do in North Korea, how you can behave. But actually, we felt absolutely free.\" Anastasiya is one of a growing number of Russians who are choosing to visit their reclusive neighbour as the two allies continue to forge closer ties following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, North Korean troops supplied military support in Russia's Kursk region, and now there is economic cooperation too. North Korean produce, including apples and beer, has started appearing on supermarket shelves in Russia's far east. And last month, Moscow launched direct passenger flights to Pyongyang for the first time in decades. But can this hermit nation really become a holiday hotspot? The Moscow office of the Vostok Intur travel agency believes so. The company runs twice-weekly tours there, and I'm being given the hard sell. \"North Korea is an amazing country, unlike any other in the world,\" director Irina Kobeleva gushes, before listing some unusual highlights. \"It is a country where you will not see any advertising on the streets. And it is very clean - even the asphalt is washed.\" She shows me the brochures, which present a glossy paradise. There are images of towering monuments, pristine golf greens and immaculate ski slopes. But again, no people. Ms Kobeleva insists the company's tours are increasingly popular, with 400 bookings a month. \"Our tourists are mostly older people who want to return to the USSR,\" she says, \"because there is a feeling that the real North Korea is very similar to what was once in the Soviet Union. \"But at the same time, there is a huge growing demand among young people.\" Sure enough, while we're chatting, two customers walk in to book trips. The first is Pavel, a young blogger who likes to \"collect\" countries. North Korea will be number 89. \"The country has opened its doors to us, so I'm taking this chance,\" he tells me when I ask why he wants to go. Read more from Sky News:Trump's tariffs are back - here's who is in his sights this timeCoca-Cola and Brewdog beer on Russian shelves despite sanctions For pensioner Tatiana, the reason is sentimental. \"My husband wanted to go there, but now he's gone. So I want his wish to come true,\" she says. It'll certainly cost them. One week's trip that takes in Pyongyang, a circus and the new beach resort, costs roughly Â£1,500 without flights. At that price, I suspect most tourists will be content for this secretive state to remain hidden."

        "Content": "Donald Trump says he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the \"appropriate regions\" in a row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. It comes after Mr Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, told the US president on Thursday to remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort. On Friday, Mr Trump wrote on social media: \"Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. \"Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Speaking outside the White House later in the day, Mr Trump was asked about why he had moved the submarines and replied: \"We had to do that. We just have to be careful. \"A threat was made and we didn't think it was appropriate, so I have to be very careful. So I do that on the basis of safety for our people. A threat was made by a former president of Russia and we're going to protect our people.\" The spat between Mr Trump and Mr Medvedev came after the US president warned Russia on Tuesday it had \"10 days from today\" to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tariffs, along with its oil buyers. Moscow has shown no sign that it will agree to Mr Trump's demands. Moscow correspondent Normally it's Moscow rattling the nuclear sabres, but this time it's Washington in what marks a dramatic escalation in Donald Trump's war of words with the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. More importantly, it appears to signal a significant deterioration in his relationship with Vladimir Putin. The US president's patience with the Kremlin was already at its thinnest earlier this week, when he shrank his deadline for progress towards a peace deal from 50 days to 10. But Russia's lack of outward concern with this stricter ultimatum - which has swung from dismissive to (in Medvedev's case) insulting - seems to have flicked a switch. For this is the first time Trump's pressure on Moscow has amounted to anything more than words. We don't know where the subs are, or how far they had to move to get closer to Russia, but it's an act that sits several rungs higher than the usual verbal threats to impose sanctions. How will Russia respond? I'm not sure Vladimir Putin has ever caved to an ultimatum and I doubt he'll start now. But I don't think he'll want the situation to deteriorate further. So I suspect he'll make another offer to the US, that's dressed up as a concession, but in reality may prove to be anything but. It's a tactic that's worked before, but the stakes have suddenly got higher. Read more:Who are the winners (if any) and losers of Trump's tariffs? On Thursday, Mr Medvedev reminded Mr Trump that Russia possessed a Soviet-era automated nuclear retaliatory system - or \"dead hand\". Mr Medvedev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was referring to a secretive semi-automated Soviet command system designed to launch Russia's missiles if its leadership was taken out in a decapitating strike. He made the remarks after Mr Trump told him to \"watch his words\" after Mr Medvedev said the US president's threat of hitting Russia and its oil buyers with punitive tariffs was \"a game of ultimatums\" and added that \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\" between Russia and the US. Mr Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 and 2012, when Mr Putin was barred from seeking a third consecutive term, but then stepped aside to let him run again. As deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, he has become known for his provocative and inflammatory statements since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022."

However the court sided with one of the claimants, Marcus Johnson, and awarded him individual compensation due to the circumstances in his case - but on other points the court overturned a Court of Appeal ruling that the customers had a case. The judgment is likely to significantly limit the scope of potential payouts to motorists after the Court of Appeal last year ruled \"secret\" commission payments to car dealers as part of finance arrangements without the buyer's fully informed consent were unlawful. The court found three motorists, including Mr Johnson, had not been told clearly or at all that the car dealers, acting as credit brokers, would receive a commission from the lenders for introducing business to them. The drivers had all bought their cars before 2021 and the court said they should receive compensation. Read more: What is the car finance scandal?

Lords Reed, Hodge, Lloyd-Jones, Briggs and Hamblen handed down their judgment to Friday. Giving a summary of the ruling, Lord Reed said: \"For the reasons set out in detail in a judgment published today, the Supreme Court allows the appeals brought by the finance companies.\" He continued: \"However, we uphold Mr Johnson's claim that the relationship between him and the finance company was unfair, and we allow the appeal in his case only because the Court of Appeal made a number of mistakes in reaching its decision. \"Retaking the decision on a proper basis, we award him the amount of a commission plus interest. \"The other customers' claims are rejected.\" The FCA will study the judgment and could consult on an industry-wide consultation scheme to provide fairness for consumers, the authority's chief executive has said. Speaking after the ruling on Friday, Nikhil Rathi said there are cases where there could be arrangements that have been unfair. The FCA has said it will decide whether it will consult on a compensation scheme by Monday. Business and economics correspondent Lord Reed has effectively found the Court of Appeals' ruling, on many grounds, was incorrect. So largely, this is a win for the banks. The Supreme Court judges looked at a few key details, including whether there was bribery or if the dealers owed the car buyers loyalty.  One question was whether the car dealers have been acting in the customers' interests.  Lord Reed spoke about the relationship the dealers had with the banks, as well as with the customers, and effectively said: no. He said they do not owe loyalty to the customers and and as a result, these commissions don't amount to bribery.  He said the dealers were motivated throughout to sell cars at a profit and that should have been clear to everyone.  The motorists in the Supreme Court case all used car dealers as brokers for finance arrangements for second-hand vehicles worth less than Â£10,000. Only one finance option was presented to each of them, with the car dealers making a profit from the sale of the car and receiving commission from the lender. Mr Johnson was buying his first car in 2017 and paid Â£1,650.95 in commission as part of his finance agreement with FirstRand. The commission paid to dealers was affected by the interest rate on the loan. Mr Johnson said he was \"dumbfounded\" by the ruling, adding that it \"does not sit right with me\". He said: \"I am obviously happy that my case was successful, but for so many other people that were also overcharged, I just don't like the message it sends to the UK consumer.\" What does the second case involve? Some drivers could still receive compensation, as a separate case on car finance is ongoing at the FCA. The second case focuses on discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) - a practice banned by the FCA in 2021. Under these arrangements, brokers and dealers increased the amount of interest they earned without telling buyers and received more commission for it. This is said to have then incentivised sellers to maximise interest rates. In January 2024, the FCA announced a review into whether motor finance customers had been overcharged because of past use of DCAs. It is using its powers to review historical motor finance commission arrangements across multiple firms - all of whom deny acting inappropriately."

        "Content": "Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas, officials have said. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of helping Epstein traffic and sexually abuse underage girls in 2021. She was being held at a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women. The federal Bureau of Prisons said on Friday that Maxwell has been transferred to a prison camp in Bryan, Texas, but did not explain the circumstances. Her lawyer confirmed the move but also declined to discuss the reasons for it. The Texas camp houses solely female prisoners, the majority of whom are serving time for nonviolent offences and white-collar crimes, Sky's US partner NBC News reports. Minimum-security federal prison camps house inmates considered to be the lowest security risk and some facilities do not even have fences. A senior administration official told NBC: \"Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd. \"Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns.\" Maxwell has received renewed attention in recent weeks, after the US Justice Department said it would not be releasing the so-called 'Epstein files'. The department said a review of the Epstein case had found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and \"no credible evidence\" the jailed financier - who killed himself in prison in 2019 - had blackmailed famous men. Read more:All we know about Trump and Epstein's 'friendship'Analysis: Trump hopes to escape Epstein controversy  Officials from the Trump administration have since tried to cast themselves as promoting transparency in the case.

Epstein survivor's family criticises move Maxwell's move to a lower security facility has been criticised by the family of Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, and accusers Annie and Maria Farmer. They said in a statement: \"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. \"Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. \"Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas.\" The statement concluded: \"This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.\""

According to forecasters, Floris is set to bring \"unseasonably strong winds\" to the UK on Monday, along with \"heavy rain\". Northern areas of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are set to be the worst-hit areas, according to the Met Office, with a yellow warning in place. The warning is in effect from 6am on Monday to 6am on Tuesday. The areas under the yellow alert could see westerly wind gusts of 40-50mph inland and up to 60-70mph along exposed coasts and hills. Winds could reach 85mph in Scotland. The strongest winds will most likely affect Scotland on Monday afternoon and night, but \"there remains some uncertainty in the depth and track of Floris\", the Met Office said.

Travel may also be disrupted on road, rail, air and ferry services, with longer journey times and cancellations possible. No warnings are in place for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The weekend will bring a mix of sunshine and showers, according to the forecaster. Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/2025 storm naming season, which runs from September last year to 31 August this year. Storm Eowyn in late January was the last named storm to hit the UK. It comes after the fifth warmest July on record, which had a mean average temperature across the month of 16.8C, according to provisional figures from the Met Office. It was slightly below the warmest July on record in 2006, when the average reached 17.8C, and was also behind 2019 (17.2C), 1983 (17.1C) and 2013 (17C). July was also the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK. It followed the warmest June on record for England and the second warmest June for the country as a whole."

        "Content": " Heathrow Airport has said it can build a third runway for Â£21bn within the next decade - with the total cost of expanding the airport estimated at Â£49bn. Europe's busiest travel hub has submitted its plans to the government - with opponents raising concerns about carbon emissions, noise pollution and environmental impacts. The west London airport wants permission to create a 3,500m (11,400ft) runway, but insists it is open to considering a shorter one instead.  Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it's \"essential\" the UK increases its airport capacity \"to ensure the things that we make here in Britain can be exported and sold throughout the world\". \"It will create new jobs, not just around Heathrow, but all around the UK, as it gives new export opportunities to businesses right across Britain,\" she told broadcasters. But London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan is still against a new runway because of \"the severe impact\" it will have on the capital's residents. Under Heathrow's proposal, the runway would be constructed to the northwest of its existing location - allowing for an additional 276,000 flights per year. \n                  Hotel tycoon announces expansion plan for Heathrow Airport which includes shorter third runway\n                 \n                  Airlines furious after another technical glitch cancels flights\n                 \n                  Heathrow-funded group sending 'incredibly misleading' mail to homes across west London, campaigners allege \n                 The airport also wants to create new terminal capacity for 150 million annual passengers - up from 84 million - with plans involving a new terminal complex named T5XW and T5XN. Terminal 2 would be extended, while Terminal 3 and the old Terminal 1 would be demolished. The runway would be privately funded, with the total plan costing about Â£49bn, but some airlines have expressed concern that the airport will hike its passenger charges to pay for the project. EasyJet chief executive Kenton Jarvis said an expansion would \"represent a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers\". Read more:Who's behind these Heathrow leaflets?A long history of Heathrow's third runway plans Thomas Woldbye, the airport's chief executive, said in a statement that \"it has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow\". \"We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity,\" he added. \"With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose, regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. \"We are uniquely placed to do this for the country. It is time to clear the way for take-off.\" The M25 motorway would need to be moved into a tunnel under the new runway under the airport's proposal. London mayor still opposed Sir Sadiq says City Hall will \"carefully scrutinise\" the proposals, adding: \"I'll be keeping all options on the table in how we respond.\" Tony Bosworth, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, also said that if Sir Keir Starmer wants to be \"seen as a climate leader\", then backing Heathrow expansion is \"the wrong move\". Earlier this year, Longford resident Christian Hughes told Sky News that his village and others nearby would be \"decimated\" if an expansion were to go ahead.  It comes after hotel tycoon Surinder Arora published a rival Heathrow expansion plan, which involves a shorter runway to avoid the need to divert the M25 motorway. The billionaire's Arora Group said a 2,800m (9,200ft) runway would result in \"reduced risk\" and avoid \"spiralling cost\". Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander will consider all plans over the summer so that a review of the Airports National Policy Statement can begin later this year.

The group, called Back Heathrow, sent leaflets to people living near the airport, claiming expansion could be the route to a \"greener\" airport and suggesting it would mean only the \"cleanest and quietest aircraft\" fly there.  Opponents of the airport's expansion said the information provided by the group is \"incredibly misleading\". Back Heathrow told Sky News it had \"always been open\" about the support it receives from the airport. The funding is not disclosed on Back Heathrow's newsletter or website."

The idea that big tech companies like Meta, Apple, Microsoft and others could work together against both the UK and EU laws was made by Republican senator Scott Fitzgerald, who is chair of the judiciary subcommittee and an ally of President Donald Trump. He was part of a trip that US politicians made to this side of the Atlantic recently around the topic of online regulation. This included meetings with both the UK, EU and European member states, as well as discussions with big tech companies. Speaking to journalists, Mr Fitzgerald said he asked Facebook owner Meta whether the businesses had been working together - but said they \"wouldn't confirm that\". He added: \"There may be some value in some type of united front in trying to fight these things off in Europe.\" This was in reference to both the UK's Online Safety Act, and similar European regulation. \n                  Trump orders two nuclear subs to be moved closer to Russia\n                 \n                  Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre wanted files released, her family say\n                 \n                  US officials to make 'highly unusual' visit to Gaza - amid warnings of 'politically manmade' famine\n                 Mr Fitzgerald went on to say that he thinks the White House \"certainly is interested in finding out\" what the delegation discovered. \"I'm not sure if it can be elevated to a level of something that the president would talk about publicly and on the global stage, but this stuff is dangerous. \"And I think it needs to be addressed, and so I certainly expect to talk to the platforms and talk to the White House as well.\"  Read moreTrump ally to criticise UK law in meetingThousands of people backlash against internet safety  As well as Mr Fitzgerald, Republicans Jim Jordan and Kevin Kiley were also on the trip - both of whom are politically close to Mr Trump. In a recent thread on social media, Mr Jordan accused the UK government of trying to censor US tech companies last summer during the riots that took place after the Southport killings. He shared emails the committee obtained from tech organisations showing the UK government asking for information and wanting to know what was being done by the companies during the rioting. A report by the UK Commons Science and Technology Committee into the events last year found that \"social media business models incentivise the spread of content that is damaging and dangerous, and did so in a manner that endangered public safety in the hours and days following the Southport murders\". ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð But Mr Jordan said that the government asking for companies to tell them what was being done to tackle reports of a \"two-tiered system\" was concerning. He added that such an attempt by the UK government to get information from technology companies would \"chill speech\". Mr Jordan and the delegation met the UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle on Wednesday. The topic of the impact of UK law on American companies came up, in what is understood to have been a polite meeting."

She has returned from a week's holiday in North Korea. \"We saw nothing terrible there, there is no danger there,\" the 33-year-old HR manager tells me. \"Frankly speaking, we really liked it.\" She was part of a group of 15 Russian tourists who were the first foreign visitors to a new seaside resort, which was opened to great fanfare by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in June. Her holiday snaps show a white sand beach, shimmering seas and high-rise hotels. But something's missing - people. There are rows of sun loungers, but not a soul sitting on them. A glittering banquet hall that's devoid of diners. That's because, when it comes to international tourists, the Wonsan-Kalma resort is currently only open to Russians. \"The hotel was absolutely new,\" Anastasiya enthuses, unfussed by the absence of others. \"Everything was done very beautifully, a good interior ... very developed infrastructure.\" But why not Turkey? Or Thailand? I gently suggest that people in Britain might be shocked at the idea of a summer break in a country better known for famines and forced labour than parasols and pina coladas. \"We were interested in seeing how people live there,\" Anastasiya explains. \"There were a lot of prejudices about what you can and can't do in North Korea, how you can behave. But actually, we felt absolutely free.\" Anastasiya is one of a growing number of Russians who are choosing to visit their reclusive neighbour as the two allies continue to forge closer ties following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, North Korean troops supplied military support in Russia's Kursk region, and now there is economic cooperation too. North Korean produce, including apples and beer, has started appearing on supermarket shelves in Russia's far east. And last month, Moscow launched direct passenger flights to Pyongyang for the first time in decades. But can this hermit nation really become a holiday hotspot? The Moscow office of the Vostok Intur travel agency believes so. The company runs twice-weekly tours there, and I'm being given the hard sell. \"North Korea is an amazing country, unlike any other in the world,\" director Irina Kobeleva gushes, before listing some unusual highlights. \"It is a country where you will not see any advertising on the streets. And it is very clean - even the asphalt is washed.\" She shows me the brochures, which present a glossy paradise. There are images of towering monuments, pristine golf greens and immaculate ski slopes. But again, no people. Ms Kobeleva insists the company's tours are increasingly popular, with 400 bookings a month. \"Our tourists are mostly older people who want to return to the USSR,\" she says, \"because there is a feeling that the real North Korea is very similar to what was once in the Soviet Union. \"But at the same time, there is a huge growing demand among young people.\" Sure enough, while we're chatting, two customers walk in to book trips. The first is Pavel, a young blogger who likes to \"collect\" countries. North Korea will be number 89. \"The country has opened its doors to us, so I'm taking this chance,\" he tells me when I ask why he wants to go.

At that price, I suspect most tourists will be content for this secretive state to remain hidden."

It comes after Mr Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, told the US president on Thursday to remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort. On Friday, Mr Trump wrote on social media: \"Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. \"Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Speaking outside the White House later in the day, Mr Trump was asked about why he had moved the submarines and replied: \"We had to do that. We just have to be careful. \"A threat was made and we didn't think it was appropriate, so I have to be very careful. So I do that on the basis of safety for our people. A threat was made by a former president of Russia and we're going to protect our people.\" The spat between Mr Trump and Mr Medvedev came after the US president warned Russia on Tuesday it had \"10 days from today\" to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tariffs, along with its oil buyers. Moscow has shown no sign that it will agree to Mr Trump's demands. Moscow correspondent Normally it's Moscow rattling the nuclear sabres, but this time it's Washington in what marks a dramatic escalation in Donald Trump's war of words with the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. More importantly, it appears to signal a significant deterioration in his relationship with Vladimir Putin. The US president's patience with the Kremlin was already at its thinnest earlier this week, when he shrank his deadline for progress towards a peace deal from 50 days to 10. But Russia's lack of outward concern with this stricter ultimatum - which has swung from dismissive to (in Medvedev's case) insulting - seems to have flicked a switch. For this is the first time Trump's pressure on Moscow has amounted to anything more than words. We don't know where the subs are, or how far they had to move to get closer to Russia, but it's an act that sits several rungs higher than the usual verbal threats to impose sanctions. How will Russia respond? I'm not sure Vladimir Putin has ever caved to an ultimatum and I doubt he'll start now. But I don't think he'll want the situation to deteriorate further. So I suspect he'll make another offer to the US, that's dressed up as a concession, but in reality may prove to be anything but. It's a tactic that's worked before, but the stakes have suddenly got higher. Read more:Who are the winners (if any) and losers of Trump's tariffs? On Thursday, Mr Medvedev reminded Mr Trump that Russia possessed a Soviet-era automated nuclear retaliatory system - or \"dead hand\". Mr Medvedev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was referring to a secretive semi-automated Soviet command system designed to launch Russia's missiles if its leadership was taken out in a decapitating strike. He made the remarks after Mr Trump told him to \"watch his words\" after Mr Medvedev said the US president's threat of hitting Russia and its oil buyers with punitive tariffs was \"a game of ultimatums\" and added that \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\" between Russia and the US. Mr Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 and 2012, when Mr Putin was barred from seeking a third consecutive term, but then stepped aside to let him run again. As deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, he has become known for his provocative and inflammatory statements since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022."

It was also \"to learn the truth\", according to US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, who accompanied Mr Witkoff to an aid site. They gave themselves around five hours to do this. The American delegation will report their assessments back to Washington and \"help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza\". There's very little confidence in either of those objectives. Images of Mr Witkoff sitting around a table at a calm and ordered aid site in Gaza does not suggest Donald Trump will hear a full picture of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And America's plans to deliver aid to Palestinians in Gaza has proved deeply flawed in recent months.  When Mr Witkoff last visited Israel in May, it was a very different picture. Palestinians were suffering in Gaza and getting killed in airstrikes but deaths were not largely a result of hunger. It was around that same time the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was launched as the new way of distributing food in the enclave by America and Israel. \"GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!\", wrote Mike Huckabee after his visit to site 3 with Trump's envoy. It paints a very different picture to the images and reports we receive on a daily basis of Palestinians getting killed and injured attempting to reach aid at these sites close to areas of conflict.

A UN-backed authority on food crises this week reported the \"worst case scenario of famine\" is now playing out in Gaza. The UN has decades of experience as humanitarians distributing aid in Gaza yet it seems America is still backing its GHF model run by inexperienced armed security contractors. In light of this, reports that a new plan is being formed for Gaza between the US and Israel don't instill a huge amount of confidence."

        "Content": "Two Cambodian soldiers have been returned by Thailand ahead of a key meeting aimed at maintaining a ceasefire between the countries. In Bangkok, Thai government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said on Friday that two Cambodian soldiers had been sent back, and the remaining 18 were being processed for violating immigration law. \"The Cambodian soldiers intruded on Thai territory and the army took them into custody, treating them based on humanitarian principles,\" he said. In a statement, the Cambodian defence ministry asked Thailand to return all the detained soldiers. \"Cambodia is actively engaging in negotiations to secure their release, and reiterates its firm call for their immediateand unconditional release in accordance with the international humanitarian law,\" a ministry spokesperson said. It follows days of deadly fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border which saw at least 43 people killed and left over 300,000 people displaced.  The violence - the worst fighting between the neighbours in over a decade - ended with a truce reached on Monday following a push from Malaysia and calls from US President Donald Trump who threatened to hold off tariff negotiations with both countries until fighting ceased. \n                  Thailand and Cambodia agree to immediate ceasefire, Malaysian PM says\n                 \n                  Thailand and Cambodia agree to peace talks after Trump intervention - but shelling continues\n                 \n                  Dozens killed and tens of thousands flee as border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia escalates\n                 Thailand and Cambodia previously faced tariffs of 36% for sending goods to the US, their largest export markets. Following further negotiations, they will now pay a 19% tariff, the White House announced on Friday.

The two nations have been at loggerheads over border areas for decades, and simmering tensions escalated into an exchange of gunfire, shelling and rockets on last week, with both sides accusing one another of initiating the violence. Both countries recalled their ambassadors, and Thailand closed its border crossings with Cambodia. Relations between the pair deteriorated sharply after an armed confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier. Nationalist passions on both sides have further inflamed the situation."

The 35-year-old was drugged before the killing, according to La Repubblica, and his body was put in a bin and covered with quicklime to hide the smell. TG24 says police went to the property at about 10.30am after being called by one of suspects. It's believed the victim was killed several days ago.

It comes after Mr Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, told the US president on Thursday to remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort. On Friday, Mr Trump wrote on social media: \"Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. \"Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Speaking outside the White House later in the day, Mr Trump was asked about why he had moved the submarines and replied: \"We had to do that. We just have to be careful. \"A threat was made and we didn't think it was appropriate, so I have to be very careful. So I do that on the basis of safety for our people. A threat was made by a former president of Russia and we're going to protect our people.\" The spat between Mr Trump and Mr Medvedev came after the US president warned Russia on Tuesday it had \"10 days from today\" to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tariffs, along with its oil buyers. Moscow has shown no sign that it will agree to Mr Trump's demands. Moscow correspondent Normally it's Moscow rattling the nuclear sabres, but this time it's Washington in what marks a dramatic escalation in Donald Trump's war of words with the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. More importantly, it appears to signal a significant deterioration in his relationship with Vladimir Putin. The US president's patience with the Kremlin was already at its thinnest earlier this week, when he shrank his deadline for progress towards a peace deal from 50 days to 10. But Russia's lack of outward concern with this stricter ultimatum - which has swung from dismissive to (in Medvedev's case) insulting - seems to have flicked a switch. For this is the first time Trump's pressure on Moscow has amounted to anything more than words. We don't know where the subs are, or how far they had to move to get closer to Russia, but it's an act that sits several rungs higher than the usual verbal threats to impose sanctions. How will Russia respond? I'm not sure Vladimir Putin has ever caved to an ultimatum and I doubt he'll start now. But I don't think he'll want the situation to deteriorate further. So I suspect he'll make another offer to the US, that's dressed up as a concession, but in reality may prove to be anything but. It's a tactic that's worked before, but the stakes have suddenly got higher. Read more:Who are the winners (if any) and losers of Trump's tariffs? On Thursday, Mr Medvedev reminded Mr Trump that Russia possessed a Soviet-era automated nuclear retaliatory system - or \"dead hand\". Mr Medvedev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was referring to a secretive semi-automated Soviet command system designed to launch Russia's missiles if its leadership was taken out in a decapitating strike. He made the remarks after Mr Trump told him to \"watch his words\" after Mr Medvedev said the US president's threat of hitting Russia and its oil buyers with punitive tariffs was \"a game of ultimatums\" and added that \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\" between Russia and the US. Mr Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 and 2012, when Mr Putin was barred from seeking a third consecutive term, but then stepped aside to let him run again. As deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, he has become known for his provocative and inflammatory statements since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022."

        "Content": "Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas, officials have said. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of helping Epstein traffic and sexually abuse underage girls in 2021. She was being held at a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women. The federal Bureau of Prisons said on Friday that Maxwell has been transferred to a prison camp in Bryan, Texas, but did not explain the circumstances. Her lawyer confirmed the move but also declined to discuss the reasons for it. The Texas camp houses solely female prisoners, the majority of whom are serving time for nonviolent offences and white-collar crimes, Sky's US partner NBC News reports. Minimum-security federal prison camps house inmates considered to be the lowest security risk and some facilities do not even have fences. A senior administration official told NBC: \"Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd. \"Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns.\" Maxwell has received renewed attention in recent weeks, after the US Justice Department said it would not be releasing the so-called 'Epstein files'. The department said a review of the Epstein case had found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and \"no credible evidence\" the jailed financier - who killed himself in prison in 2019 - had blackmailed famous men.

Epstein survivor's family criticises move Maxwell's move to a lower security facility has been criticised by the family of Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, and accusers Annie and Maria Farmer. They said in a statement: \"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. \"Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. \"Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas.\" The statement concluded: \"This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.\""

The idea that big tech companies like Meta, Apple, Microsoft and others could work together against both the UK and EU laws was made by Republican senator Scott Fitzgerald, who is chair of the judiciary subcommittee and an ally of President Donald Trump. He was part of a trip that US politicians made to this side of the Atlantic recently around the topic of online regulation. This included meetings with both the UK, EU and European member states, as well as discussions with big tech companies. Speaking to journalists, Mr Fitzgerald said he asked Facebook owner Meta whether the businesses had been working together - but said they \"wouldn't confirm that\". He added: \"There may be some value in some type of united front in trying to fight these things off in Europe.\" This was in reference to both the UK's Online Safety Act, and similar European regulation. \n                  Trump orders two nuclear subs to be moved closer to Russia\n                 \n                  Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre wanted files released, her family say\n                 \n                  US officials to make 'highly unusual' visit to Gaza - amid warnings of 'politically manmade' famine\n                 Mr Fitzgerald went on to say that he thinks the White House \"certainly is interested in finding out\" what the delegation discovered. \"I'm not sure if it can be elevated to a level of something that the president would talk about publicly and on the global stage, but this stuff is dangerous. \"And I think it needs to be addressed, and so I certainly expect to talk to the platforms and talk to the White House as well.\"  Read moreTrump ally to criticise UK law in meetingThousands of people backlash against internet safety  As well as Mr Fitzgerald, Republicans Jim Jordan and Kevin Kiley were also on the trip - both of whom are politically close to Mr Trump.

He shared emails the committee obtained from tech organisations showing the UK government asking for information and wanting to know what was being done by the companies during the rioting.

The topic of the impact of UK law on American companies came up, in what is understood to have been a polite meeting."

        "Content": " British banks and lenders have been spared a huge bill as the Supreme Court has overturned a ruling that could have meant millions of motorists were due compensation for mis-sold car finance. However the court sided with one of the claimants, Marcus Johnson, and awarded him individual compensation due to the circumstances in his case - but on other points the court overturned a Court of Appeal ruling that the customers had a case. The judgment is likely to significantly limit the scope of potential payouts to motorists after the Court of Appeal last year ruled \"secret\" commission payments to car dealers as part of finance arrangements without the buyer's fully informed consent were unlawful. The court found three motorists, including Mr Johnson, had not been told clearly or at all that the car dealers, acting as credit brokers, would receive a commission from the lenders for introducing business to them. The drivers had all bought their cars before 2021 and the court said they should receive compensation. Read more: What is the car finance scandal? Two lenders, FirstRand Bank and Close Brothers, took the row to the Supreme Court and said at a three-day hearing in April that the decision was an \"egregious error\". \n                  Money latest: Blow to motorists as Supreme Court overturns key car finance ruling\n                 \n                  US trade war: The state of play as Trump signs order imposing new tariffs - but there are more delays\n                 \n                  Trump's tariffs are back - here's who is in his sights this time\n                 The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also intervened in the case and told the UK's highest court that the Court of Appeal ruling \"goes too far\", while the three motorists - Amy Hopcraft, Mr Johnson and Andrew Wrench - opposed the challenge. Lords Reed, Hodge, Lloyd-Jones, Briggs and Hamblen handed down their judgment to Friday. Giving a summary of the ruling, Lord Reed said: \"For the reasons set out in detail in a judgment published today, the Supreme Court allows the appeals brought by the finance companies.\" He continued: \"However, we uphold Mr Johnson's claim that the relationship between him and the finance company was unfair, and we allow the appeal in his case only because the Court of Appeal made a number of mistakes in reaching its decision. \"Retaking the decision on a proper basis, we award him the amount of a commission plus interest. \"The other customers' claims are rejected.\" The FCA will study the judgment and could consult on an industry-wide consultation scheme to provide fairness for consumers, the authority's chief executive has said. Speaking after the ruling on Friday, Nikhil Rathi said there are cases where there could be arrangements that have been unfair. The FCA has said it will decide whether it will consult on a compensation scheme by Monday. Business and economics correspondent Lord Reed has effectively found the Court of Appeals' ruling, on many grounds, was incorrect. So largely, this is a win for the banks. The Supreme Court judges looked at a few key details, including whether there was bribery or if the dealers owed the car buyers loyalty.  One question was whether the car dealers have been acting in the customers' interests.  Lord Reed spoke about the relationship the dealers had with the banks, as well as with the customers, and effectively said: no. He said they do not owe loyalty to the customers and and as a result, these commissions don't amount to bribery.  He said the dealers were motivated throughout to sell cars at a profit and that should have been clear to everyone.  The motorists in the Supreme Court case all used car dealers as brokers for finance arrangements for second-hand vehicles worth less than Â£10,000. Only one finance option was presented to each of them, with the car dealers making a profit from the sale of the car and receiving commission from the lender. Mr Johnson was buying his first car in 2017 and paid Â£1,650.95 in commission as part of his finance agreement with FirstRand. The commission paid to dealers was affected by the interest rate on the loan. Mr Johnson said he was \"dumbfounded\" by the ruling, adding that it \"does not sit right with me\". He said: \"I am obviously happy that my case was successful, but for so many other people that were also overcharged, I just don't like the message it sends to the UK consumer.\" What does the second case involve? Some drivers could still receive compensation, as a separate case on car finance is ongoing at the FCA. The second case focuses on discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) - a practice banned by the FCA in 2021. Under these arrangements, brokers and dealers increased the amount of interest they earned without telling buyers and received more commission for it. This is said to have then incentivised sellers to maximise interest rates. In January 2024, the FCA announced a review into whether motor finance customers had been overcharged because of past use of DCAs. It is using its powers to review historical motor finance commission arrangements across multiple firms - all of whom deny acting inappropriately."

        "Content": " Heathrow Airport has said it can build a third runway for Â£21bn within the next decade - with the total cost of expanding the airport estimated at Â£49bn. Europe's busiest travel hub has submitted its plans to the government - with opponents raising concerns about carbon emissions, noise pollution and environmental impacts. The west London airport wants permission to create a 3,500m (11,400ft) runway, but insists it is open to considering a shorter one instead.  Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it's \"essential\" the UK increases its airport capacity \"to ensure the things that we make here in Britain can be exported and sold throughout the world\". \"It will create new jobs, not just around Heathrow, but all around the UK, as it gives new export opportunities to businesses right across Britain,\" she told broadcasters. But London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan is still against a new runway because of \"the severe impact\" it will have on the capital's residents. Under Heathrow's proposal, the runway would be constructed to the northwest of its existing location - allowing for an additional 276,000 flights per year. \n                  Hotel tycoon announces expansion plan for Heathrow Airport which includes shorter third runway\n                 \n                  Airlines furious after another technical glitch cancels flights\n                 \n                  Heathrow-funded group sending 'incredibly misleading' mail to homes across west London, campaigners allege \n                 The airport also wants to create new terminal capacity for 150 million annual passengers - up from 84 million - with plans involving a new terminal complex named T5XW and T5XN. Terminal 2 would be extended, while Terminal 3 and the old Terminal 1 would be demolished. The runway would be privately funded, with the total plan costing about Â£49bn, but some airlines have expressed concern that the airport will hike its passenger charges to pay for the project. EasyJet chief executive Kenton Jarvis said an expansion would \"represent a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers\". Read more:Who's behind these Heathrow leaflets?A long history of Heathrow's third runway plans Thomas Woldbye, the airport's chief executive, said in a statement that \"it has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow\". \"We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity,\" he added. \"With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose, regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. \"We are uniquely placed to do this for the country. It is time to clear the way for take-off.\" The M25 motorway would need to be moved into a tunnel under the new runway under the airport's proposal. London mayor still opposed Sir Sadiq says City Hall will \"carefully scrutinise\" the proposals, adding: \"I'll be keeping all options on the table in how we respond.\" Tony Bosworth, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, also said that if Sir Keir Starmer wants to be \"seen as a climate leader\", then backing Heathrow expansion is \"the wrong move\". Earlier this year, Longford resident Christian Hughes told Sky News that his village and others nearby would be \"decimated\" if an expansion were to go ahead.  It comes after hotel tycoon Surinder Arora published a rival Heathrow expansion plan, which involves a shorter runway to avoid the need to divert the M25 motorway. The billionaire's Arora Group said a 2,800m (9,200ft) runway would result in \"reduced risk\" and avoid \"spiralling cost\". Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander will consider all plans over the summer so that a review of the Airports National Policy Statement can begin later this year.

The group, called Back Heathrow, sent leaflets to people living near the airport, claiming expansion could be the route to a \"greener\" airport and suggesting it would mean only the \"cleanest and quietest aircraft\" fly there.  Opponents of the airport's expansion said the information provided by the group is \"incredibly misleading\". Back Heathrow told Sky News it had \"always been open\" about the support it receives from the airport. The funding is not disclosed on Back Heathrow's newsletter or website."

When Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader in 2020, Ms Dodds was his first pick for shadow chancellor. However, she did not last long and was replaced by Ms Reeves, who then got the government job after last year's election win. Speaking to the Sky News political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Ms Dodds said she had examined wealth taxes when she was briefly in the shadow chancellor job and how one could be implemented. She said: \"I would hope the Treasury is considering that kind of evidence, as well as other changes that have been put forward.\"  Asked today if about Ms Dodds' intervention, Ms Reeves said: \"Decisions around tax are decisions that are made at a budget and we'll make those decisions in the appropriate way, but the number-one priority of this government is to grow the economy. \"And that means bringing more investment into Britain, creating more good jobs paying decent wages here in Britain.

The government's financial position is stretched ahead of the next budget, due at the end of autumn. Ms Reeves has committed herself to not changing her fiscal rules, leaving little wiggle room to avoid tax rises or spending cuts. This is due to the government's inability to save money through policies like welfare reform, which were gutted due to a rebellion of backbench Labour MPs. Last week, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds branded the suggestion of a wealth tax \"daft\" - but he has less influence over the writing of the budget than the chancellor.

Rachel says she was told her previous performances there had resulted in the venue having to pay for graffiti to be removed from toilet doors every three days. \"Again, we didn't see evidence of that at all,\" she says. \"We're not the ones writing itâ¦ but if it was bothering them and they worried it was bothering us, then maybe we'd have volunteered to help them - or to help clean it.\" She claims she was also told the venue was responding to staff concerns about their own safety should Creeger's show go ahead. \"It's a pub in Edinburgh, it's a music venue, they themselves have bouncers most eveningsâ¦ And perhaps they might say if there's a concern about extra risk, we should do all we can to make our performers safe.\" 'More unites us than divides us' Creeger says her show is in no way political. \"It's based around the idea that a Jewish mother can answer any question, solve any problem... I will make it better for you, the audience gets to write a question and put it into a chicken soup potâ¦ The reason I kind of love it is because by the end of it people leave feeling actually more unites us than divides us. \"We're not the people making the trouble,\" she adds. \"I've certainly never started a protest, I've never done graffiti, I've never caused harm anywhere; my show doesn't do that, my show is lovely.\" As Britain's only touring comedian who is also a practising Orthodox Jew, she says since the 7 October attack she and other Jewish comedians are experiencing a significant increase in antisemitism while performing. \"We're not Israeli, we're British Jews,\" says Creeger. \"The situation there is horrendous and distressing and painful for people of any number of religions and racesâ¦ To be kind of scapegoated with dog whistles around that is clearly very, very unpleasant.\" The Fringe Society has said its role is to provide support and advice to all participants at the festival \"with a vision to give anyone a stage and everyone a seat\". A spokesperson explained they don't manage or programme venues and \"we understand that the show cancellations have been a choice made by the venue\". Whistle Binkies hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment. Police Scotland told Sky News it hasn't \"received any reports of concern\" about Creeger's show. There are, of course, huge sensitivities when it comes to discussing what's going on in the world right now. American stand-up Zainab Johnson is making her Fringe debut this year. While her show Toxically Optimistic is all about putting a positive spin on life's challenges, she doesn't shy away from tackling the serious stuff if it comes up. 'Shows becoming serious is a part of life' \"If I'm doing a show and somebody wants to yell out Free Palestine, well let's talk about it,\" she tells Sky News. \"I am the comedian where, if the show has to become serious, it becomes serious. That's a part of life, you know?\" Johnson adds: \"I'm from the United States and they talk about free speech all the time, but then you find out free speech ain't really free because the moment you say something that is contrary to what the majority feels or wants to be heard, then you can be penalised... \"But isn't that the beauty of this festival? So many people just telling their story, whatever their story is.\" Read more from Sky News:The carpenter sleeping roughHuge rise in prison drone incidentsThird runway plans revealed Comedian Andy Parsons has had a long-standing career in satire, appearing regularly on shows like BBC2's Mock the Week. While he has the likes of Elon Musk and Nigel Farage in his sights for his stand-up show, Please #@!$ Off to Mars, they're not his only focus. He says stand-ups \"should be able to talk about anything and find a way to get that to work, including Israel and Gaza\". He explains jokingly: \"I've got some stuff about Israel in the show and obviously it can work both ways. It can give you some publicity and obviously it can get you cancelled.\" Irish-Palestinian comedian Sami Abu Wardeh - a clown comic - is the only Palestinian doing a full run of a comedy show at this year's Fringe.â¯ \"My show is clowning, it's storytelling, it's even got a bit of stand-up and it's heavily inspired by the comedian Dave Allen, who is one of my comedy heroes,\" says Wardeh. \"It felt really important that I come and just exist in this space, as a Palestinian, and speak my words and have my voice heard.â¯ \"I've used all of these skills to make a show that is about really what's going on in this country and in the world at the moment. \"I think most people in this country are going to recognise that Britain is in a very dark placeâ¦ and I'm hoping to reach those people and to give a voice to the dissatisfaction.\" 'Plans in place' for disruption He's had to consider the possibility of protests and take steps to \"make sure that the audience and myself are safe and secure\". \"We have plans in place to know how to deal with people who are disruptive,\" he says. \"And particularly anybody who wants to bring any kind of bigoted views into the room.\" As one of the very few Palestinians at the festival, Wardeh says it is \"not only my duty\" but \"an honour to be here and to represent my people\". He also feels it's wrong that Rachel Creeger has had her venue cancelled. \"I sincerely support free speech and I think everyone should be able to get on the stage and say what they want, within reason obviously,\" says Wardeh. Rachel says she hopes to confirm a new venue for her show on social media in the coming days. \"We've thankfully had a number of venues approach us to say that they have space available, so I'm hopeful that I'll get - if not a full - then at least part of the run for the show.\" Since arriving in Edinburgh she's been overwhelmed by how many hugs of support she's received. \"To have super high-profile comedians put their heads above the parapet to say 'this is wrong', it means so muchâ¦In a way the story is that someone's done something very hurtful... But look at all the love, that's amazing.\" Sami Abu Wardeh's Palestine: Peace de Resistance is at the Pleasance Dome in Edinburgh until 24 AugustAndy Parsons' Please #@!$ Off to Mars is at Pleasance Courtyard's Cabaret Bar until 10 AugustZainab Johnson: Toxically Optimistic is at Pleasance Courtyard until 24 August"

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  Hollywood actor Brian Cox has told Sky News that Donald Trump is talking \"bollocks\" after suggesting there should be 50 or 75 years between Scottish independence referendums. The US president said a country \"can't go through that too much\" when questioned by reporters during his visit to Scotland this week. The Emmy-winning star, who is an independence supporter, has hit back, branding him \"that idiot in America\". The 79-year-old told Sky News: \"He's talking bollocks. I'm sorry, but he does. It's rubbish. Let's get on with it and let's get it [independence] done. We can do it. \"It's been tough as there's a great deal of undermining that has gone on.\"  SNP fraud probe causing 'harm' Mr Cox said the police fraud investigation examining the SNP's finances has done \"enormous harm\" to the party and wider independence movement. \n                  Why the Oasis reunion tour is 'catastrophic' for Edinburgh Fringe performers \n                 \n                  Jewish comedian says shows cancelled as Gaza in the spotlight at Edinburgh Fringe\n                 \n                  Flintoff praises NHS staff who treated him after crash, as doctor says his injuries were 'among most complex' he's ever seen\n                 Nicola Sturgeon was arrested as part of the long-running police probe but cleared of any wrongdoing earlier this year. The former first minister's estranged husband Peter Murrell, who was SNP chief executive for two decades, appeared in court in April to face a charge of alleged embezzlement. He has entered no plea. Brian Cox is preparing to return to the Scottish stage for the first time in a decade in a play about the Royal Bank of Scotland's role in the 2008 financial crash. Ahead of the Edinburgh festival performances, the veteran actor told Sky News: \"I think it's a masterpiece. It's certainly one of the best pieces of work I've been involved in. 'My friend Spacey should be forgiven' The Succession star was also asked about his \"old friend\" Kevin Spacey. The former House of Cards actor, 65, was exiled from the showbiz world in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct. Spacey has admitted to \"being too handsy\" in the past and \"touching someone sexually\" when he didn't know they \"didn't want him to\". Spacey stood trial in the UK for multiple sexual offences against four men in July 2023 but was acquitted on all counts. Mr Cox told Sky News: \"I am so against cancel culture. Kevin has made a lot of mistakes, but there is a sort of viciousness about it which is unwarranted. \"Everybody is stupid as everybody else. Everybody is capable of the same mistakes and the same sins as everybody else.\" Asked if he could see a return to showbiz for Spacey, Cox replied: \"I would think so eventually, but it's very tough for him. \"He was tricky, but he has learnt a big lesson. He should be allowed to go on because he is a very fine actor. I just think we should be forgiving.\" He concluded: \"What is the joy you get out of kicking somebody in the balls when they are down? That is what I cannot stand.\""

The cricket legend was seriously injured during the incident on the Top Gear track in Surrey in December 2022.

Shamim Umarji, who also treated the 47-year-old, said it was \"wonderful to see Freddie again and his visit gave staff a real boost\". \"He spent a lot of time chatting to everyone and it meant a lot,\" added the trauma and orthopaedic surgeon.
