        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in prison in Russia after being poisoned with a deadly toxin found in the skin of Ecuadorian dart frogs, the UK and other allies have revealed. The \"barbaric\" act - using a neurotoxin that is classed as a chemical weapon - could only have been carried out by Vladimir Putin's government, they said on Saturday. The poisoning \"highly likely\" resulted in Mr Navalny's death in 2024. Moscow dismisses allegations - latest Sky News understands it is likely the toxin was manufactured in a laboratory rather than actually taken from the frogs. It is not clear how the frog poison - called epibatidine - was allegedly administered to the dissident, who had been in a penal colony in Siberia when he died almost exactly two years ago. Indigenous tribes in South America are said to use the toxin in blow darts or blowguns when they hunt. \n                  Why Navalny dart frog poison announcement was deliberately timed\n                 \n                  The science behind the frog poison that allegedly killed Alexei Navalny\n                 \n                  Lab tests show Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Russian jail, his widow says\n                 The poison - described as \"one of the deadliest on earth\" - is 200 times stronger than morphine. It causes paralysis, breathing difficulties and death. Yulia Navalnaya, the Russian dissident's widow, appeared at a press conference on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich to announce the discovery, flanked by the foreign ministers of the UK, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The four countries and France have been working together to establish how Mr Navalny, 47, died. They plan to submit their findings to the international chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). \"It is hard for me to find the right words,\" Mrs Navalnya said in English, looking visibly upset. She had been at the Munich Security Conference when the news of her husband's death broke on 16 February 2024. \"It was the most horrible day in my life. I came to the stage and I said my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned. What could else happen with Putin's number one enemy in a Russian prison? \"But now I understand and I know it is not just words. It is scientific proof.\" Russian authorities have previously claimed the dissident's death was not suspicious but had been caused as a result of \"combined diseases\", including an irregular heartbeat. But Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, said the UK and its allies had been working \"with fierce determination\" to establish what really happened. It is understood that British scientists at Porton Down played a key role in the discovery of the frog poison scheme. It was not immediately clear how they were able to obtain samples from Mr Navalny's body to test for the toxin, though Ms Navalnaya has previously said they were smuggled out of Russia. The opposition leader was buried in the suburbs of Moscow in March 2024. \"As a result of the work of the UK, Sweden and other partners, we have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body,\" Ms Cooper told journalists, \"And that toxin has been identified as a toxin that is found in Ecuadorian Dart Frogs.\" She said: \"Only the Russian government had the means, the motive and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison and that is why we are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempt to silence Alexei Navalny's voice. \"To show that the Russian government has contempt for its citizens and the willingness to use this deadly toxin.\" The top British diplomat also quoted Mr Navalny himself about the need to hold the Russian government to account.

It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death.\" Sweden's foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, explained why it was necessary to understand the true cause of Mr Navalny's death. \"This is extremely important in order to be able to hold Russia accountable for what they have been doing and to continue to shine a light on their continuous lies,\" he said. \"We will now move forward with this information to the OPCW... This is yet another way to increase the pressure on Russia.\" The Kremlin dismissed the allegation, with foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova telling the TASS news agency it was part of a disinformation campaign \"aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West\". The Russian Embassy in the UK went further, calling it a \"ridiculous circus performance\" aimed at stoking \"waning anti-Russian sentiment\", adding that \"if there's no pretext, they [media outlets] laboriously invent one. \"This isn't a quest for justice, but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of a Russian citizen, London and European capitals cannot give him peace, which speaks volumes about the instigators of this campaign.\" President Putin's government has already been accused of previously trying to kill Mr Navalny in 2020 using a Novichok nerve agent - the same chemical weapon that Russia is believed to have deployed on the streets of Salisbury in a failed attempt to kill a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in 2018. Mr Navalny survived the original poisoning and recuperated in Germany before returning home to Russia, where he was arrested and jailed."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n It is no coincidence that the UK and its allies chose a security conference in Munich to accuse the Kremlin of killing Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with dart frog poison. The extraordinary announcement on Saturday seemed deliberately timed to grab global headlines in much the same way as the dissident's actual death did. The news that Mr Navalny, 47, had died in prison in Russia broke on the opening day of the same Munich Security Conference of global leaders almost exactly two years ago. Naming the person or government allegedly responsible for such a political assassination - if the claim of poisoning is substantiated - is a form of information weapon. The intent is to make sure perpetrators cannot hide in the shadows and could face serious consequences such as sanctions or even criminal convictions. The thinking - which might well be wildly optimistic - is that greater scrutiny could make a hostile state think twice before sanctioning plots to kill political opponents or other enemies. It is doubtful that the efforts by Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, and her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts, who made the poisoning announcement, along with Mr Navalny's widow, will deter the Kremlin from such allegedly ruthless action in the future. \n                  The science behind the frog poison that allegedly killed Alexei Navalny\n                 \n                  Russia killed Alexei Navalny with dart frog poison, UK and allies say\n                 \n                  Lab tests show Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Russian jail, his widow says\n                 However, their words are at the very least evidence of a growing resolve amongst NATO allies to stand up to what they regard as attempts by President Vladimir Putin to attack their countries and societies in the grey zone - under the threshold of conventional war. This also includes acts of sabotage, cyber hacks and disinformation spread online. Speaking to a group of journalists about the case, Ms Cooper spelt out clearly the charges she was levying against Moscow. \"We have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body and that toxin has been identified as a toxin that is found in Ecuadorian dart frogs,\" she said. \"Only the Russian government had the means, the motive and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison and that is why we are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempt to silence Alexi Navalny's voice. To show that the Russian government has contempt for its citizens and the willingness to use this deadly toxin.\" Yulia Navalnaya, Mr Navalny's widow, also spoke. She learnt about her husband's death while at the Munich conference on 16 February, 2024. \"It was the most horrible day in my life,\" she recalled, visibly upset. \"I came to the stage and I said my husband Alexei Navalny was poisoned. What could else happen with Putin's number one enemy in Russian prison? \"But - sorry, it is very difficult for me to say this - what could else happen with my husband in Russian prison? But now I understand and I know it is not just words. It is scientific proof.\" British scientists played a key role in identifying the deadly neurotoxin - called epibatidine - that was allegedly administered to Mr Navalny. The poison is found in the skin of the South American dart frogs, although Sky News understands it is likely the version used in the alleged murder was manufactured in a laboratory. The effects of the poison are devastating, causing paralysis, respiratory arrest and an agonising death. If - as claimed by Britain - the Kremlin did choose to use such an exotic substance to silence a critic, it demonstrates an unusual level of ruthlessness. The Kremlin is already accused of trying to kill Mr Navalny in 2020 with a Novichok nerve agent - the same chemical weapon deployed against a former Russian spy on the streets of Salisbury two years earlier. Fighting back, Moscow is well-practised and highly adept in the information space. Its embassy in London was quick to respond to the allegations about dart frog poisonings. \"The goal of this ridiculous circus performance is transparent: to stoke waning anti-Russian sentiment in Western society. If there's no pretext, they laboriously invent one,\" it said. \"The method chosen by Western politicians - necropropaganda - is truly shocking. This isn't a quest for justice, but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of a Russian citizen, London and European capitals cannot give him peace, which speaks volumes about the instigators of this campaign.\""

        "Content": "Four new astronauts have arrived at the International Space Station to replace their colleagues who pulled out early over health concerns. SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts to the orbital research laboratory 277 miles (446km) up in space, a day after they launched from Cape Canaveral. The new crew members include NASA's Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France's Sophie Adenot and Russia's Andrey Fedyaev. The last group of astronauts were forced to evacuate after one of them suffered what officials described as a serious health issue. The withdrawal left only three crew members on board the space station - one American and two Russians - prompting Nasa to pause space walks and reduce research output. Ms Meir, a marine biologist, and Mr Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have previously lived on the space station. On her first mission to the station in 2019, Ms Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk. \n                  Fuel leak delays NASA's mega-rocket moon mission\n                 \n                  Everything to know about Artemis II - the NASA mission to send astronauts around the moon\n                 \n                  Huge NASA rocket reaches launch pad after painstaking 1mph journey\n                 Ms Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space.

The crew will spend eight to nine months on board the International Space Station. Last month's medical evacuation was NASA's first in 65 years of space exploration. NASA has declined to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or provide details of what happened, citing privacy concerns. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back in a hospital before returning to Houston."

        "Content": "A former imam who coerced his victims, some as young as 12, into believing he had supernatural powers, has been found guilty of 21 sexual offences, including nine counts of rape. Abdul Halim Khan, 54, of Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green, in east London, used his position as a respected faith leader to abuse multiple women and girls between 2004 and 2015, the Metropolitan Police said. He was convicted of nine counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, two counts of sexual assault of a child under 13, five counts of rape of a child under 13 and one count of assault by penetration at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Friday. Khan persuaded victims to meet him at isolated spots, including flats and quiet, hidden locations, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. He would then rape or sexually abuse them, saying he would be possessed or disguised as a jinn, or supernatural spirit, the CPS added. Victims felt they had to keep these acts hidden and quiet from families and friends, or they may be harmed by \"black magic\", the CPS said. His offending came to police attention in 2018 when the youngest victim reported him to a teacher at her school, the force said. \n                  Boy, 13, charged with attempted murder after double stabbing at Kingsbury High School in London\n                 \n                  Moped rider killed in alleged hit-and-run with car\n                 \n                  Man charged with string of sex offences\n                 When questioned, Khan repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy and saying the victims had made them up for revenge, police said. Khan was eventually charged in March 2023. A survivor of his abuse, speaking after the verdict, said what she suffered as a child \"has had a profound and lasting impact\". She said she still carried the trauma with her, having \"lived with shame, fear and confusion that were not mine to carry. The loss of trust, in people, in systems, and at times in myself, shaped much of my adult life. \"I hope this outcome acknowledges not only the abuse itself, but the deep and lasting harm it causes.

Melissa Garner, specialist prosecutor for the CPS, said Khan \"abused his position of trust and authority to carry out a vicious series of rapes and sexual abuses against seven victims, including three vulnerable teenage girls.\" She added: \"Khan coerced and deceived them into thinking that he possessed supernatural powers which could protect them and their families from harm in exchange for hideous acts of sexual abuse without their consent\". Khan will be sentenced next month."

Weapons storage facilities and other IS infrastructure were targeted in 10 strikes between 3 February and Thursday, US Central Command said, in its campaign to maintain \"relentless military pressure\" on what remains of the terrorist network. \"Precision munitions [were] delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and unmanned aircraft [drones],\" CENTCOM said in a statement on Saturday. It follows five strikes on a communication site, part of a critical logistics network and weapons storage facilities between 27 January and 2 February. The military action is part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched after Islamic State fighters attacked US and Syrian forces in Palmyra, in southern Syria, on 13 December, in which the three Americans were killed. Two sergeants, Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar and William Nathaniel Howard, died, along with interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat.

Authorities in Baghdad had asked for them to be sent to Iraq, in a move welcomed by the US-led coalition that had fought IS for years. Pictures were published of IS prisoners in the Al-Karkh Central Prison in Baghdad. On Thursday, Syria's defence ministry said the Al-Tanf military base in the east of the country, which was run for years by US troops as part of the fight against IS, was now under its control. IS declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014, imposing a brutal regime of strict Sharia law before it was destroyed by US-led allied forces."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n BrewDog, the leading independent craft brewer behind brands including Punk IPA and Elvis Juice, has called in advisers to oversee a sale that could trigger a break-up of one of Scotland's best-known businesses. Sky News has learnt that the board of BrewDog has appointed AlixPartners, the restructuring experts, to field interest from potential bidders. Sources said that AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective suitors in the last few days, with a quickfire deadline for indicative offers understood to have been set. A deal could see many of BrewDog's roughly 220,000 individual shareholders, who became investors through its 'Equity for Punks' scheme, left with little return from their average outlay of about £400. Others, however, made a significant return on their investment by selling their stock in previous funding rounds. The company raised about £75m overall from the sale of shares to customers, offering perks such as discounts and early access to new craft beers. Its first such crowdfunding took place in 2009, with the most recent in 2021. \n                  Investment giant KKR ditches Mandelson lobbying firm\n                 \n                  Pay by bank - what is it and what protections do you give up when you use it?\n                 \n                  EasyJet's £5.99 cabin bag price claim is 'misleading', says regulator\n                 The sale process comes amid tough conditions for independent brewers, with the group behind Black Sheep recently being sold through a pre-pack administration. Founded in 2007, BrewDog earned a reputation for innovation, with founders James Watt and Martin Dickie frequently courting controversy with the brand's marketing campaigns. Mr Watt, who remains one of BrewDog's biggest shareholders, is now reportedly considering a bid to buy the company back, with sources indicating that he is canvassing support from financial backers. One insider said the company would now command a price tag of far less than a once-mooted valuation of £2bn, which had stoked hopes among investors of an eventual stock market listing. In 2017, TSG Consumer Partners took a 21% stake in BrewDog in a deal which implied a unicorn valuation of at least $1bn. Since then, however, BrewDog has continued to face mounting losses, closing a string of bars and axing chunks of its workforce. Last year, the company lost £37m on turnover of £357m. Read more from Sky News:Mandelson's assistant sent Epstein government speechStarmer to claim 'lamps would go out' under Reform or Greens BrewDog trades from 72 bars globally, including in London and Las Vegas. It employs roughly 1,400 people, and boasts a 4% share of the UK off-trade grocery market by value. The company produces five of the top eight UK craft beer brands, including Hazy Jane, Wingman and Lost. Its four breweries - at Ellon in Scotland, as well as sites in the US, Australia and Germany - could be sold separately from the rest of the group, depending on the progress of the AlixPartners-run process. Five years ago, BrewDog was rocked by allegations made by dozens of former employees that it operated \"a culture of fear\". Mr Watt stepped down as chief executive in 2024, and one source said this weekend that BrewDog's appearance in recent lists of reputable employers underscored a transformation in its culture. \"As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company. \"Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. \"This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.\" The company added that BrewDog \"remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK and with a highly engaged global community\". \"We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.\" \"Our breweries, bars, and venues continue to operate as normal. \"We will not comment on any further speculation.\""

        "Content": "When Matt Weston came 15th in the skeleton at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, he asked himself whether he should continue competing at the sport.  Instead, he used his failure to fuel his route to victory at the Milano Cortina Games on Friday evening. Speaking to Sky Sports News after he won a gold medal, the British athlete said the journey \"hadn't been easy\". He said: \"After Beijing it was really, really tough. I had a few weeks off after it where I was like, 'why am I doing this? I don't want to put myself through this anymore' because it was so emotionally hard. \"But I kind of used that to really set the fire and get the motivation to come here and do what I've done over the last few days. So that was pretty insane.\" The 28-year-old, a world and European champion, had been the favourite for gold after leading at the halfway stage of the men's singles skeleton on Thursday, with track records in the first two heats. On Friday, the British athlete posted another track record on his third run - recording a 0.39-second advantage at the top of the leader board. He then set a fourth track record to win gold with a final margin of victory of 0.88 seconds - a significant margin in the sport. Weston, who has previously won the world and European championships, said that an Olympic gold was the high point of his career. He told Sky Sports News: \"Winning this blows them all out the water. You probably saw it yesterday on the footage, I kind of couldn't control my emotions at the bottom. It meant absolutely everything to me.\" Weston said he had improved his performance by working on the psychological aspect of his game. \"For me, a lot of the difference is mentality,\" he said. \"I do a lot of work with psychologists, like sport psychologists as well as clinical psychologists so they've made a massive difference in how I approach races, in how consistent I can be.\" Until he finished the race and checked his time, however, he did not know that he had taken first place. He said: \"The last couple of corners I knew I'd done a good job but you can never tell - it's racing. You don't know. I had no idea what anyone else had done. \"I kind of keep my helmet just low enough I can't see any of the times when I'm at the block and as soon as I just came up in the outrun all I was looking for was green numbers and I saw them and then the tears hit.\" After retiring from a successful teenage taekwondo career due to injury, Weston made his debut in skeleton in 2019. He said the journey from starting the sport nine years ago to becoming world champion was \"pretty mad\". In March 2025, Weston took his second world champion crown and last month he clinched his third successive overall World Cup title. His Olympic win marks the first-ever gold in the men's skeleton for Team GB.

Abdul Halim Khan, 54, of Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green, in east London, used his position as a respected faith leader to abuse multiple women and girls between 2004 and 2015, the Metropolitan Police said. He was convicted of nine counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, two counts of sexual assault of a child under 13, five counts of rape of a child under 13 and one count of assault by penetration at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Friday. Khan persuaded victims to meet him at isolated spots, including flats and quiet, hidden locations, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. He would then rape or sexually abuse them, saying he would be possessed or disguised as a jinn, or supernatural spirit, the CPS added. Victims felt they had to keep these acts hidden and quiet from families and friends, or they may be harmed by \"black magic\", the CPS said. His offending came to police attention in 2018 when the youngest victim reported him to a teacher at her school, the force said. \n                  Boy, 13, charged with attempted murder after double stabbing at Kingsbury High School in London\n                 \n                  Moped rider killed in alleged hit-and-run with car\n                 \n                  Man charged with string of sex offences\n                 When questioned, Khan repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy and saying the victims had made them up for revenge, police said. Khan was eventually charged in March 2023. A survivor of his abuse, speaking after the verdict, said what she suffered as a child \"has had a profound and lasting impact\". She said she still carried the trauma with her, having \"lived with shame, fear and confusion that were not mine to carry. The loss of trust, in people, in systems, and at times in myself, shaped much of my adult life. \"I hope this outcome acknowledges not only the abuse itself, but the deep and lasting harm it causes.

Melissa Garner, specialist prosecutor for the CPS, said Khan \"abused his position of trust and authority to carry out a vicious series of rapes and sexual abuses against seven victims, including three vulnerable teenage girls.\" She added: \"Khan coerced and deceived them into thinking that he possessed supernatural powers which could protect them and their families from harm in exchange for hideous acts of sexual abuse without their consent\". Khan will be sentenced next month."

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent  The crisis in NHS dentistry is so bad that a charity set up to run clinics in poorer countries is now spending more time working in the UK. Millions of people are struggling to access services, with huge regional variations in care. And those from poorer areas are worse affected. The British Dental Association warns \"fundamental reform\" is needed to guarantee the survival of NHS dentistry. In Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the charity Dentaid has partnered with a local support group to provide free dental care for people unable to access NHS dentists. Demand is high in this area, with volunteers saying there's a four to five-year wait for dentists. Carl Parkin is having a check-up and told Sky News his toothache was so painful he recently resorted to DIY dentistry. \"I took a ring pull from a can of pop and tried to take it out myself,\" he said. \"It only made things worse, and I ended up seeing the emergency dentist.\" Read more from Sky News:What Palestine Action's court win meansHow police foiled terrorist pairAnother patient is Roy Wake who is recovering from alcohol and drug addiction. It's been eight years since he last saw a dentist. \"I've got no real chewing teeth left, just nothing to chew with. It makes you so self-conscious,\" he said. Volunteer dentist Dr Priya Sharry-Khan says a shortage of dentists means that clinics are always busy. \"I think if there was more access to care, there'd be less problems that we'd see with patients, and we wouldn't be having to have a van set up on multiple days treating as many patients as we can.\" The Dewsbury Dentaid clinic isn't open to the general public but the charity's CEO, Andy Evans, says demand across the country is high. \"It's just the changing dynamics, there are different communities coming in who maybe haven't had access to dentists at any time, so the world is changing and yes we want to carry on expanding what we're doing.\" The most recent analysis suggests 13 million people in England alone can't access an NHS dentist. Children in the north have poorer oral health, and those from the most deprived communities are twice as likely to have tooth decay than youngsters living in affluent areas. British Dental Association chairman Eddie Crouch said: \"Whether NHS dentistry even has a future will depend on the choices made in the next few years. \"Underfunding and failed contracts have fuelled a crisis that's left millions without options. This service's survival hinges on fundamental reform backed up by real investment.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are rolling out extra urgent dental appointments and reforming the dental contract to prioritise patients with the greatest need.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n BrewDog, the leading independent craft brewer behind brands including Punk IPA and Elvis Juice, has called in advisers to oversee a sale that could trigger a break-up of one of Scotland's best-known businesses. Sky News has learnt that the board of BrewDog has appointed AlixPartners, the restructuring experts, to field interest from potential bidders. Sources said that AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective suitors in the last few days, with a quickfire deadline for indicative offers understood to have been set. A deal could see many of BrewDog's roughly 220,000 individual shareholders, who became investors through its 'Equity for Punks' scheme, left with little return from their average outlay of about £400. Others, however, made a significant return on their investment by selling their stock in previous funding rounds. The company raised about £75m overall from the sale of shares to customers, offering perks such as discounts and early access to new craft beers. Its first such crowdfunding took place in 2009, with the most recent in 2021. \n                  Investment giant KKR ditches Mandelson lobbying firm\n                 \n                  Pay by bank - what is it and what protections do you give up when you use it?\n                 \n                  EasyJet's £5.99 cabin bag price claim is 'misleading', says regulator\n                 The sale process comes amid tough conditions for independent brewers, with the group behind Black Sheep recently being sold through a pre-pack administration. Founded in 2007, BrewDog earned a reputation for innovation, with founders James Watt and Martin Dickie frequently courting controversy with the brand's marketing campaigns. Mr Watt, who remains one of BrewDog's biggest shareholders, is now reportedly considering a bid to buy the company back, with sources indicating that he is canvassing support from financial backers. One insider said the company would now command a price tag of far less than a once-mooted valuation of £2bn, which had stoked hopes among investors of an eventual stock market listing. In 2017, TSG Consumer Partners took a 21% stake in BrewDog in a deal which implied a unicorn valuation of at least $1bn. Since then, however, BrewDog has continued to face mounting losses, closing a string of bars and axing chunks of its workforce. Last year, the company lost £37m on turnover of £357m.

It employs roughly 1,400 people, and boasts a 4% share of the UK off-trade grocery market by value. The company produces five of the top eight UK craft beer brands, including Hazy Jane, Wingman and Lost. Its four breweries - at Ellon in Scotland, as well as sites in the US, Australia and Germany - could be sold separately from the rest of the group, depending on the progress of the AlixPartners-run process. Five years ago, BrewDog was rocked by allegations made by dozens of former employees that it operated \"a culture of fear\". Mr Watt stepped down as chief executive in 2024, and one source said this weekend that BrewDog's appearance in recent lists of reputable employers underscored a transformation in its culture. \"As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company. \"Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. \"This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.\" The company added that BrewDog \"remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK and with a highly engaged global community\". \"We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.\" \"Our breweries, bars, and venues continue to operate as normal. \"We will not comment on any further speculation.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in prison in Russia after being poisoned with a deadly toxin found in the skin of Ecuadorian dart frogs, the UK and other allies have revealed. The \"barbaric\" act - using a neurotoxin that is classed as a chemical weapon - could only have been carried out by Vladimir Putin's government, they said on Saturday. The poisoning \"highly likely\" resulted in Mr Navalny's death in 2024. Moscow dismisses allegations - latest Sky News understands it is likely the toxin was manufactured in a laboratory rather than actually taken from the frogs. It is not clear how the frog poison - called epibatidine - was allegedly administered to the dissident, who had been in a penal colony in Siberia when he died almost exactly two years ago. Indigenous tribes in South America are said to use the toxin in blow darts or blowguns when they hunt. \n                  Why Navalny dart frog poison announcement was deliberately timed\n                 \n                  The science behind the frog poison that allegedly killed Alexei Navalny\n                 \n                  Lab tests show Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Russian jail, his widow says\n                 The poison - described as \"one of the deadliest on earth\" - is 200 times stronger than morphine. It causes paralysis, breathing difficulties and death. Yulia Navalnaya, the Russian dissident's widow, appeared at a press conference on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich to announce the discovery, flanked by the foreign ministers of the UK, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The four countries and France have been working together to establish how Mr Navalny, 47, died. They plan to submit their findings to the international chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). \"It is hard for me to find the right words,\" Mrs Navalnya said in English, looking visibly upset. She had been at the Munich Security Conference when the news of her husband's death broke on 16 February 2024. \"It was the most horrible day in my life. I came to the stage and I said my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned. What could else happen with Putin's number one enemy in a Russian prison? \"But now I understand and I know it is not just words. It is scientific proof.\" Russian authorities have previously claimed the dissident's death was not suspicious but had been caused as a result of \"combined diseases\", including an irregular heartbeat. But Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, said the UK and its allies had been working \"with fierce determination\" to establish what really happened. It is understood that British scientists at Porton Down played a key role in the discovery of the frog poison scheme. It was not immediately clear how they were able to obtain samples from Mr Navalny's body to test for the toxin, though Ms Navalnaya has previously said they were smuggled out of Russia. The opposition leader was buried in the suburbs of Moscow in March 2024. \"As a result of the work of the UK, Sweden and other partners, we have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body,\" Ms Cooper told journalists, \"And that toxin has been identified as a toxin that is found in Ecuadorian Dart Frogs.\" She said: \"Only the Russian government had the means, the motive and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison and that is why we are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempt to silence Alexei Navalny's voice. \"To show that the Russian government has contempt for its citizens and the willingness to use this deadly toxin.\" The top British diplomat also quoted Mr Navalny himself about the need to hold the Russian government to account. Read more from Sky News:Mandelson's assistant sent Epstein government speech prior to deliveryThis shocking illegal M25 waste site has kept on growing \"He said: 'We must do what they fear, tell the truth, spread the truth that is the most powerful weapon'.\" Ms Navalnaya shared details about the effect of being poisoned dart frog toxin. \"My husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine - a neurotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on earth,\" she said in a post of social media. \"In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of the Ecuadorian dart frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death.\" Sweden's foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, explained why it was necessary to understand the true cause of Mr Navalny's death. \"This is extremely important in order to be able to hold Russia accountable for what they have been doing and to continue to shine a light on their continuous lies,\" he said. \"We will now move forward with this information to the OPCW... This is yet another way to increase the pressure on Russia.\" The Kremlin dismissed the allegation, with foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova telling the TASS news agency it was part of a disinformation campaign \"aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West\". The Russian Embassy in the UK went further, calling it a \"ridiculous circus performance\" aimed at stoking \"waning anti-Russian sentiment\", adding that \"if there's no pretext, they [media outlets] laboriously invent one. \"This isn't a quest for justice, but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of a Russian citizen, London and European capitals cannot give him peace, which speaks volumes about the instigators of this campaign.\" President Putin's government has already been accused of previously trying to kill Mr Navalny in 2020 using a Novichok nerve agent - the same chemical weapon that Russia is believed to have deployed on the streets of Salisbury in a failed attempt to kill a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in 2018. Mr Navalny survived the original poisoning and recuperated in Germany before returning home to Russia, where he was arrested and jailed."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n It is no coincidence that the UK and its allies chose a security conference in Munich to accuse the Kremlin of killing Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with dart frog poison. The extraordinary announcement on Saturday seemed deliberately timed to grab global headlines in much the same way as the dissident's actual death did. The news that Mr Navalny, 47, had died in prison in Russia broke on the opening day of the same Munich Security Conference of global leaders almost exactly two years ago. Naming the person or government allegedly responsible for such a political assassination - if the claim of poisoning is substantiated - is a form of information weapon. The intent is to make sure perpetrators cannot hide in the shadows and could face serious consequences such as sanctions or even criminal convictions. The thinking - which might well be wildly optimistic - is that greater scrutiny could make a hostile state think twice before sanctioning plots to kill political opponents or other enemies. It is doubtful that the efforts by Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, and her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts, who made the poisoning announcement, along with Mr Navalny's widow, will deter the Kremlin from such allegedly ruthless action in the future. \n                  The science behind the frog poison that allegedly killed Alexei Navalny\n                 \n                  Russia killed Alexei Navalny with dart frog poison, UK and allies say\n                 \n                  Lab tests show Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Russian jail, his widow says\n                 However, their words are at the very least evidence of a growing resolve amongst NATO allies to stand up to what they regard as attempts by President Vladimir Putin to attack their countries and societies in the grey zone - under the threshold of conventional war. This also includes acts of sabotage, cyber hacks and disinformation spread online. Speaking to a group of journalists about the case, Ms Cooper spelt out clearly the charges she was levying against Moscow. \"We have confirmed that a deadly toxin was found in Alexei Navalny's body and that toxin has been identified as a toxin that is found in Ecuadorian dart frogs,\" she said. \"Only the Russian government had the means, the motive and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison and that is why we are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin's barbaric attempt to silence Alexi Navalny's voice. To show that the Russian government has contempt for its citizens and the willingness to use this deadly toxin.\" Yulia Navalnaya, Mr Navalny's widow, also spoke. She learnt about her husband's death while at the Munich conference on 16 February, 2024. \"It was the most horrible day in my life,\" she recalled, visibly upset. \"I came to the stage and I said my husband Alexei Navalny was poisoned. What could else happen with Putin's number one enemy in Russian prison? \"But - sorry, it is very difficult for me to say this - what could else happen with my husband in Russian prison? But now I understand and I know it is not just words. It is scientific proof.\" British scientists played a key role in identifying the deadly neurotoxin - called epibatidine - that was allegedly administered to Mr Navalny. The poison is found in the skin of the South American dart frogs, although Sky News understands it is likely the version used in the alleged murder was manufactured in a laboratory. The effects of the poison are devastating, causing paralysis, respiratory arrest and an agonising death. If - as claimed by Britain - the Kremlin did choose to use such an exotic substance to silence a critic, it demonstrates an unusual level of ruthlessness. The Kremlin is already accused of trying to kill Mr Navalny in 2020 with a Novichok nerve agent - the same chemical weapon deployed against a former Russian spy on the streets of Salisbury two years earlier. Fighting back, Moscow is well-practised and highly adept in the information space. Its embassy in London was quick to respond to the allegations about dart frog poisonings. \"The goal of this ridiculous circus performance is transparent: to stoke waning anti-Russian sentiment in Western society. If there's no pretext, they laboriously invent one,\" it said. \"The method chosen by Western politicians - necropropaganda - is truly shocking. This isn't a quest for justice, but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of a Russian citizen, London and European capitals cannot give him peace, which speaks volumes about the instigators of this campaign.\""

Could Alexei Navalny have been killed by the toxin of a poisonous frog? \"I can imagine that these kinds of poisons are interesting [to Russia] because they are quite difficult to detect,\" says Dr Eric Franssen, doctor in clinical toxicology and pharmacology at the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis hospital in the Netherlands. Dr Franssen said: \"Because in hospitals, we will not detect them in a routine toxicology screen. So perhaps this is a way to disguise intoxications.\" The UK and its allies say the toxin was derived from an Ecuadorian dart frog. These are produced naturally to ward off predators. Sky News understands it is likely the toxin was manufactured in a laboratory rather than actually taken from the frogs. In humans, the effects are deadly. Dr Franssen added: \"We do not know very much of these toxins in humans because you cannot experiment, of course, with this kind of toxins in real life, only in animals. \"But there have been reports that people may die after 10 to 20 minutes of intake of this when you have a certain amount of these toxins.\" \n                  Why Navalny dart frog poison announcement was deliberately timed\n                 \n                  Russia killed Alexei Navalny with dart frog poison, UK and allies say\n                 \n                  Lab tests show Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Russian jail, his widow says\n                 \"This can be done by ingestion or injection in the bloodstream. I suppose then it has a direct effect on the muscles and the heart. \"And it paralyses the muscles, also your respiratory muscles. And then you become very low in your oxygen in blood. And also by cardiac failure, your brain does not receive any oxygen anymore and this may cause death.\" \"Nausea and vomiting are side effects of these kinds of toxins.\" Dr Franssen's description tallies with photos, published by Navalny's foundation, of the prison cell where he was taken ill: vomit is clearly visible. Read more:Tests show Navalny was poisoned in jail, widow saysRussian journalists accused of working with Navalny jailed Navalny was a political dissident who challenged Putin. He survived being poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent. When he returned to Russia in 2021, he was imprisoned and convicted on trumped-up charges. In December 2023 Navalny was transferred from a prison outside Moscow to a penal colony in Russia's Far North, in Kharp: the Polar Wolf colony, known for its brutal conditions, capable of holding around 1,000 prisoners. Despite those conditions, Navalny seemed in good health - and good spirits - in a court appearance on 15 February, 2025, before his death. Navalny died the next day. The initial Russian explanation was that he lost consciousness after a walk. His body was only returned to his family eight days after his death. And the official state post mortem concluded the official cause of death was high blood pressure brought about by a chronic abnormal heart rhythm. In September last year, Navany's widow, Yulia Navalniya, made a dramatic revelation. She posted on social media: \"In February 2024 we were able to obtain samples of Alexei's biological material and securely smuggle them abroad. Labs in at least two countries examined these samples independently of each other and these labs in 2 diff countries reached the same conclusion Alexei was killed, more specifically he was poisoned.\"Dr Franssen said this sort of testing was feasible. He said: \"Normally, when people die, you may have autopsies, then you cool the body because you do not want that the toxins degrade in the human body after death [in order to] detect them. So it may be possible to measure toxin levels in tissue. \"That can be the lung, that can be the heart, it can be blood and urine also. But it can also be possible to detect not the native drugs but also the metabolites of these toxins. So these can stay longer in the body.\" That lab work has now been revealed by Britain and its allies. Russian authorities insist Navalny's death was natural."

        "Content": "Donald Trump says regime change in Iran \"would be the best thing that could happen\" as a second US aircraft carrier is deployed to the Middle East.  The US president made the remarks after visiting troops at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Friday, where he was pressed by reporters on whether he wanted to see a change in government in Iran. \"It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,\" Mr Trump said. \"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. \"In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs ‌blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time.\" Mr Trump declined to name who he hoped would assume control from the clerical regime, saying only \"there are people\". He said the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was being sent to the Middle East in case talks between the US and Iran fail to produce an agreement. \n                  Journalist Don Lemon vows to fight 'baseless charges' from Minnesota church protest\n                 \n                  Trump's major breakaway from climate science\n                 \n                  Defend yourselves and don't rely on the US, senior Washington official tells Europe \n                 \"In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it,\" he said. \"It'll be leaving very soon.\" The USS Gerald R Ford reallocation forms part of a build-up of US military assets in the Middle East amid deepening tensions between Washington and Tehran. The USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying guided-missile destroyers were deployed last month. Last week, US forces shot down an Iranian drone that approached the USS Abraham Lincoln on the same day that Iran tried to stop a US-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian and American officials met in Oman last week for talks, but an agreement has not been reached. Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to take military action against Iran if the government uses force to suppress anti-regime protests. On Friday, Mr Trump suggested that a deal could still be struck with Iran to avoid US military action. \"Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time,\" he said. \"If they give us the right deal, we won't do that.\" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that any US military action against the country would plunge the entire region into war.

Iran's nuclear programme has also been a repeated source of tension, with Mr Trump suggesting that one of his top priorities was for Tehran to scale back its atomic programme. 👉 Tap here to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts👈  But on Friday he suggested that was only one aspect of the concessions the US expected from Iran. \"If we do it, that would be the least of the mission,\" Mr Trump said about targeting Tehran's nuclear programme. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with Mr Trump in Washington this week for talks, has pushed for any deal to include steps to neutralise Iran's ballistic missile programme. The US targeted Iran's nuclear facilities ⁠in strikes in June in the culmination of the 12-day war between Iran and Israel."

        "Content": "Four new astronauts have arrived at the International Space Station to replace their colleagues who pulled out early over health concerns. SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts to the orbital research laboratory 277 miles (446km) up in space, a day after they launched from Cape Canaveral. The new crew members include NASA's Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France's Sophie Adenot and Russia's Andrey Fedyaev. The last group of astronauts were forced to evacuate after one of them suffered what officials described as a serious health issue. The withdrawal left only three crew members on board the space station - one American and two Russians - prompting Nasa to pause space walks and reduce research output. Ms Meir, a marine biologist, and Mr Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have previously lived on the space station.

The crew will spend eight to nine months on board the International Space Station. Last month's medical evacuation was NASA's first in 65 years of space exploration. NASA has declined to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or provide details of what happened, citing privacy concerns. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back in a hospital before returning to Houston."

Tunga-Makeri, Konkoso, and Pissa, all located in the Borgu area of Niger state, were targeted in dawn raids on Saturday. Six people died in the assault on Tunga-Makeri, Niger State police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said, adding that it was not clear how many people had been abducted. Mr Abiodun said that Konkoso was also attacked, but gave no other details. He did say that security teams have been sent to the scene and a rescue operation for those who were abducted was under way. Abdullahi Adamu, from Konkoso, said 26 people were killed in the attack there, describing how the attackers were \"operating freely without the presence of any security\".

        "Content": "By Sky News correspondent Tom Cheshire and Sky News' Data and Forensics team  Scattered through the three and a half million files released by the Department of Justice are the accounts of Jeffrey Epstein's victims themselves: their words, their voices.  They are perhaps best summed up in one diary entry: \"It is ALL horror.\" The recollections of their abuse in these files are recorded in personal diaries, private messages or confidential legal interviews. The names of all the survivors in this article have been changed. WARNING: This article contains graphic content, including details of sexual and emotional abuse Lauren's scrapbook This scrapbook documents one young woman's encounters with Epstein - we don't know exactly when but we estimate around 2007. It includes details of their meetings, trips around the world, and intimate thoughts about their relationship. It starts with her saying: Once upon a time, there was a clueless little girl... Then... what is he doing? He wouldn't. Mmm... elastic. Charlotte's testimony In interviews conducted by Palm Beach Police Department, unidentified victims recounted their experiences with Epstein and his then-girlfriend, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In this transcript, 'Charlotte’ recounts her visits to Epstein's Palm Beach residence in November 2005 - and how Epstein groomed reluctant girls. Investigator: Tell me about the time you first met Jeffrey. Charlotte: It was something in high school, everybody was like, trying to make money and at the time I had like two jobs, I guess. That was like two years ago or so... I was 17. Charlotte: It seems really weird, the whole situation and there were more girls in the house. And then they just told me, just go upstairs, you know, they showed me the room, it was the massage room, like pretty normal… and then he came like, you know, and I gave him a massage. Investigator: He offered you more money to get naked? Charlotte: Well, he told me just to take my shirt off... he didn't say anything else. Investigator: And did you? Charlotte: No. Investigator: And you went more times? Charlotte: It was like, around like three or four times, and then I just... I was just scared he was gonna do something. Investigator: And each time he went, did he offer you more money to do more things? Charlotte: Yes. Charlotte: She said he would offer me more money if I had sex with him and I said that’s never going to happen. There's no way I'm gonna do it for money. Investigator: Talk to me about the third time you went... Obviously, more stuff happened because he paid you more to do more stuff, right? Charlotte: The third time, it was when I took my shirt off. And that was when he paid me $300. Kimberley's journal One survivor's personal journal documents her emotional and, at times, excruciating journey through Epstein's world. The journal written by 'Kimberley' is in a basic code. We don't know when it was written but we estimate sometime between 2001 and 2004. No one can prepare you for this shit. I am so f***ing lost.  Jeffrey treats me like I am 'special' property  The other girls well some are nice but 3 I hate!  Alice in f***ing wonderland? In a plane or a yacht. In NY, in DC, at the vineyard. On the island. In Palm Beach. It doesn't matter. Disgusting pigs. I feel broken and exhausted. I am so f***ing tired of this sick and twisted 'game' that's causing such physical and emotional pain! Later in her diary, 'Kimberley' detailed what appear to be traumatic experiences of multiple pregnancies. I think I am going to break. Why would they allow [REDACTED] wait this long? Why would he bring a friend and make a video? I am so broken. And the procedure was so painful and blood all over the sheets. I can't play this game anymore. I have to ask Ghislaine for help. ...I am now over 20 weeks with baby. We are certain is his, and I had to go to the Bahamas like this. And for some reason no plan has been made because he doesn't want a procedure and she does. I am too young and he is too old! Why is no one doing anything, I don't understand! I don't want this! I don't want another painful procedure but I don't want this! That company doesn't protect kids. They use it to find us. And they are everywhere! I cannot escape! I am so very exhausted. My body feels so tired. Will I ever be free?

Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff's department said. The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since 1 February, the day Ms Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff's department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.

The US president made the remarks after visiting troops at Fort Bragg in North Carolina on Friday, where he was pressed by reporters on whether he wanted to see a change in government in Iran. \"It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,\" Mr Trump said. \"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. \"In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk.

The USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying guided-missile destroyers were deployed last month. Last week, US forces shot down an Iranian drone that approached the USS Abraham Lincoln on the same day that Iran tried to stop a US-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian and American officials met in Oman last week for talks, but an agreement has not been reached. Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to take military action against Iran if the government uses force to suppress anti-regime protests. On Friday, Mr Trump suggested that a deal could still be struck with Iran to avoid US military action. \"Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time,\" he said. \"If they give us the right deal, we won't do that.\" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that any US military action against the country would plunge the entire region into war.

Pictures were published of IS prisoners in the Al-Karkh Central Prison in Baghdad.

        "Content": "Journalist Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges stemming from a protest against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown at a Minnesota church. The former CNN host was among nine people who were charged over a protest at a Southern Baptist church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Protesters interrupted a service at the church last month, chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Lemon maintains he was at the Cities Church in Saint Paul to cover protest and was not a participant, vowing to fight the \"baseless charges\". The now independent journalist entered the courthouse in Saint Paul for his arraignment on Friday local time wearing a black suit and waved to supporters. \"For more than 30 years, I've been a journalist, and the power and protection of the First Amendment has been the underpinning of my work,\" Lemon said outside the courthouse. \"The First Amendment, the freedom of the press, are the bedrock of our democracy. \n                  Trump says Iran regime change would be the 'best thing that could happen'\n                 \n                  Trump's major breakaway from climate science\n                 \n                  Defend yourselves and don't rely on the US, senior Washington official tells Europe \n                 \"And like all of you here in Minnesota, the great people of Minnesota, I will not be intimidated, I will not back down.\" The defendants have been charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits interference or intimidation of anyone \"seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom\" at a place of worship. Civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong was among the other defendants who pleaded not guilty on Friday. Two more defendants accused in the protest are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. 'Lying under oath is a serious federal offence' The hearing came as two immigration agents were placed on leave after they appeared to make \"untruthful statements\" about a shooting in Minneapolis last month. One officer fired a single shot from a handgun that stuck Venezuelan man Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the thigh on 14 January, just days after Ms Good was killed, Sky News' US partner NBC reports. Read more from Sky News:Trump says Iran regime change is the 'best thing that could happen'Robert F Kennedy Jr admits he used to 'snort cocaine off toilet seats' Mr Sosa-Celis and Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, also from Venezuela, had been accused of beating an ICE officer with a broom handle and snow shovel. But video later emerged that was \"materially inconsistent\" with testimony filed against the men, leading to the charges against them being dismissed. The incident is among at least five shootings in which initial descriptions by immigration officials were later contradicted by video evidence. In an unusual turn of events, prosecutors asked to dismiss the cases citing new video evidence that contradicted allegations made against the men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month. Acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons said in a statement the agents could be fired and criminally charged after an investigation into the matter is carried out. \"Lying under oath is a serious federal offence,\" he said."

Ahead of this year's BAFTAs and Oscars, the cinematographer has already made history for her stand-out work on Ryan Coogler's vampire horror film. She is the first woman of colour ever to be nominated for cinematography in the history of both awards, as well as being one of just a handful of women ever to have been nominated. Her work on Sinners, filming in the stifling heat of the deep south, certainly meant she earned her place in this year's competition. \"There was the humidity, the bugs,\" she laughs. \"I started wearing like the mesh over my head, but then they would get inside the mesh, and all over my face.\" Speaking to Sky News, she explained part of the job is \"to put the camera in the best spot so it feels real\". Which, in the case of Sinners, meant getting in the line of fire for quite a bit of blood. \"Because I operate the camera, [the] team covers you in plastic or tarp.\" But being in the thick of it, she says, makes a difference to the feel of a film. \"I'm essentially an audience member so if it feels real to me, then I know that you're going to feel it too, that's important.\" So how does it feel to have already made Oscar and BAFTA history? \"It means a lot to me because this came from Ryan - the opportunity itself - and he's someone that advocates for women in film.

Remarkably, it remains the only Oscar that's never known a female winner. She explains: \"I do feel like it is a boys' club, because there needs to be more opportunities. \"Women [cinematographers] have been out there, I know, because when I went to film school in 2009, there were 11 girls in my class of 28. \"They're there but the doors haven't been open… the opportunities haven't been there.\" She says one of the nicest aspects of being nominated has been being approached by young girls who are keen to follow her career path. \"I'm already a winner,\" she says. \"When you start out as a filmmaker, you just want people to see your work and have them embrace it and I think that's happening.\" Before adding: \"I can only cross my fingers to see.\""

Sky News has learnt that the board of BrewDog has appointed AlixPartners, the restructuring experts, to field interest from potential bidders. Sources said that AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective suitors in the last few days, with a quickfire deadline for indicative offers understood to have been set. A deal could see many of BrewDog's roughly 220,000 individual shareholders, who became investors through its 'Equity for Punks' scheme, left with little return from their average outlay of about £400. Others, however, made a significant return on their investment by selling their stock in previous funding rounds. The company raised about £75m overall from the sale of shares to customers, offering perks such as discounts and early access to new craft beers. Its first such crowdfunding took place in 2009, with the most recent in 2021. \n                  Investment giant KKR ditches Mandelson lobbying firm\n                 \n                  Pay by bank - what is it and what protections do you give up when you use it?\n                 \n                  EasyJet's £5.99 cabin bag price claim is 'misleading', says regulator\n                 The sale process comes amid tough conditions for independent brewers, with the group behind Black Sheep recently being sold through a pre-pack administration. Founded in 2007, BrewDog earned a reputation for innovation, with founders James Watt and Martin Dickie frequently courting controversy with the brand's marketing campaigns. Mr Watt, who remains one of BrewDog's biggest shareholders, is now reportedly considering a bid to buy the company back, with sources indicating that he is canvassing support from financial backers. One insider said the company would now command a price tag of far less than a once-mooted valuation of £2bn, which had stoked hopes among investors of an eventual stock market listing. In 2017, TSG Consumer Partners took a 21% stake in BrewDog in a deal which implied a unicorn valuation of at least $1bn. Since then, however, BrewDog has continued to face mounting losses, closing a string of bars and axing chunks of its workforce. Last year, the company lost £37m on turnover of £357m.

It employs roughly 1,400 people, and boasts a 4% share of the UK off-trade grocery market by value. The company produces five of the top eight UK craft beer brands, including Hazy Jane, Wingman and Lost. Its four breweries - at Ellon in Scotland, as well as sites in the US, Australia and Germany - could be sold separately from the rest of the group, depending on the progress of the AlixPartners-run process. Five years ago, BrewDog was rocked by allegations made by dozens of former employees that it operated \"a culture of fear\". Mr Watt stepped down as chief executive in 2024, and one source said this weekend that BrewDog's appearance in recent lists of reputable employers underscored a transformation in its culture. \"As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company. \"Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. \"This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.\" The company added that BrewDog \"remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK and with a highly engaged global community\". \"We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.\" \"Our breweries, bars, and venues continue to operate as normal. \"We will not comment on any further speculation.\""

Nick Hillman, who was working for the Conservative shadow education team at the time, told Sky News: \"I cannot fathom why Peter Mandelson thought this would be of interest to the sort of people with the power to move the markets.\" Sky News asked the Cabinet Office if it would look into the speech sent outside of government, but was referred to the police investigation into misconduct in public office, which has so far only identified Lord Mandelson as being connected. The Metropolitan Police referred Sky News to a previous statement, which said: \"This will be a complex investigation requiring a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis. \"It will take some time to do this work comprehensively and we will not be providing a running commentary.\" Asked about the possibility that the speech broke the law, legal experts said the bar for prosecution on misconduct in public office is very high. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Jo Grady, the head of the University and College Union, told Sky News: \"This is yet another example of Mandelson's close ties to the convicted paedophile, and he should be made to explain why he was giving Epstein advance sight of his speeches on the funding of higher education. \"Our thoughts should always be with the victims who have suffered at the hands of these abusive and powerful men. But we should not forget that Mandelson's impact on public life has been corrosive, and this includes higher education.\" Sky News has approached the ministerial assistant for comment."

        "Content": "Four new astronauts have arrived at the International Space Station to replace their colleagues who pulled out early over health concerns. SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts to the orbital research laboratory 277 miles (446km) up in space, a day after they launched from Cape Canaveral. The new crew members include NASA's Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France's Sophie Adenot and Russia's Andrey Fedyaev. The last group of astronauts were forced to evacuate after one of them suffered what officials described as a serious health issue. The withdrawal left only three crew members on board the space station - one American and two Russians - prompting Nasa to pause space walks and reduce research output. Ms Meir, a marine biologist, and Mr Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have previously lived on the space station. On her first mission to the station in 2019, Ms Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk. \n                  Fuel leak delays NASA's mega-rocket moon mission\n                 \n                  Everything to know about Artemis II - the NASA mission to send astronauts around the moon\n                 \n                  Huge NASA rocket reaches launch pad after painstaking 1mph journey\n                 Ms Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space.

NASA has declined to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or provide details of what happened, citing privacy concerns. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back in a hospital before returning to Houston."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Wagner Moura and Kleber Mendonca Filho, star and director of political thriller The Secret Agent, have been delayed, slightly, I'm told. A few minutes turn into quite a few more minutes, which is not usually a promising sign when it comes to interviewing film stars and filmmakers, but it turns out there's a good reason - an unexpected phone call from the president of Brazil. Not the kind of caller you send to voicemail. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, wanted to congratulate them on the film's success: a string of honours starting with major wins at the Cannes Film Festival back in May, which now includes a Critics Choice award, Golden Globe wins for best actor and best non-English language film, plus two BAFTA and four Oscar nominations. As the first Brazilian ever to be nominated for best actor, Moura has made Academy Awards history. \"I think it's meaning a lot to Brazilians, especially because we went through a very bad moment in our history where artists and culture were seen in a very negative way,\" says Moura. \"It's a huge transformation, you know, and it's a big change.\" Veteran leftist Da Silva returned as Brazil's president after beating the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in 2022. In November last year, Bolsonaro began a 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after his election loss. The former leader's three-year tenure was marked by misogynistic and homophobic rhetoric, and a hostility towards culture and the arts; things have changed dramatically under Da Silva. \"We went from living in a country where we were seen, perceived by the power as enemies of the people to a moment where the president himself is calling us to say that, hey, we are proud of you,\" says Moura. \"The president saying that 'I see the culture, I see films, I see books, I see this as an important tool to the development of the country'. It's a reconnection.\" The Secret Agent is set in 1977, during the brutal military dictatorship in Brazil that lasted for more than 20 years, and Moura plays Armando, a professor forced into hiding after clashing with a regime official. While it started as a period thriller, the echoes of recent history are there. 'It requires courage to stick to your values' The Portuguese-language film is up there among the most celebrated of Hollywood's awards season, particularly following Moura's best actor win at the Globes, over favourite Michael B Jordan for his portrayal of twin brothers in Sinners. Mendonca Filho says the part of Armando was \"tailor-made\" for Moura. After years of talk about making something together, \"it only worked when I finally sat down to write a script thinking specifically about working with him\". Moura, who is better known globally for his portrayal of notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in the hit series Narcos, says the film is about generational trauma and values, and he was able to draw from his own experiences. \"This film is about a man who is sticking with the values he has, during the dictatorship, which are obviously values that are opposite to [his],\" he says. \"What Kleber and I went through during the Bolsonaro time in Brazil is a big example of that. It requires a lot of... courage to stick with your values when what's established around you says the opposite, especially in this polarised world. \"I think that it's getting harder and harder because the idea of truth is disappearing, you know... facts, they don't matter anymore.\" There was once a time when the right and the left \"would discuss and we would even fight over something, but we were both seeing the same thing\", he continues. \"Nowadays, it's not about facts anymore, it's about versions, so we are not living in the same mental space, which is a very dangerous thing.\" Red carpet award controversy But people are connecting with The Secret Agent. Since Cannes, Moura says, \"this film has been receiving so much attention, steadily - it hasn't dropped - which is very rare and kind of amazing, especially for a Brazilian film\". Which is why a move to hand out the Critics Choice award for best international feature film on the red carpet, rather than during the ceremony itself, proved particularly controversial. The awards hierarchy is nothing new, with the Oscars criticised in recent years over plans not to televise certain technical (read: not enough star-power) awards to tighten the broadcast time. But Filho, who was clearly caught by surprise as he was unceremoniously handed his Critics Choice prize, says now - as Donald Trump's controversial immigration crackdown continues in the US - is a particularly troubling time to make such a decision around international films.

And it's happening in many different areas and authoritarians are also back in a big way. \"So as much as it feels so bad and we worry to death about what is taking place, it's also a very fertile moment to develop stories and tell stories, because the irony of present-day use of power is something that is part of our lives.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       If you are a film fan, Autumn Durald Arkapaw is a name to remember this award season. Ahead of this year's BAFTAs and Oscars, the cinematographer has already made history for her stand-out work on Ryan Coogler's vampire horror film. She is the first woman of colour ever to be nominated for cinematography in the history of both awards, as well as being one of just a handful of women ever to have been nominated. Her work on Sinners, filming in the stifling heat of the deep south, certainly meant she earned her place in this year's competition. \"There was the humidity, the bugs,\" she laughs. \"I started wearing like the mesh over my head, but then they would get inside the mesh, and all over my face.\" Speaking to Sky News, she explained part of the job is \"to put the camera in the best spot so it feels real\". Which, in the case of Sinners, meant getting in the line of fire for quite a bit of blood. \"Because I operate the camera, [the] team covers you in plastic or tarp.\" But being in the thick of it, she says, makes a difference to the feel of a film. \"I'm essentially an audience member so if it feels real to me, then I know that you're going to feel it too, that's important.\" So how does it feel to have already made Oscar and BAFTA history? \"It means a lot to me because this came from Ryan - the opportunity itself - and he's someone that advocates for women in film. All of our heads of department are women that are like sisters to me now.\" Read more from Sky News:Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni appear in courtKatie Holmes leads tributes to James Van Der Beek If she wins for cinematography at this year's Academy Awards, she will be the first ever woman to do so. Remarkably, it remains the only Oscar that's never known a female winner. She explains: \"I do feel like it is a boys' club, because there needs to be more opportunities. \"Women [cinematographers] have been out there, I know, because when I went to film school in 2009, there were 11 girls in my class of 28. \"They're there but the doors haven't been open… the opportunities haven't been there.\" She says one of the nicest aspects of being nominated has been being approached by young girls who are keen to follow her career path. \"I'm already a winner,\" she says. \"When you start out as a filmmaker, you just want people to see your work and have them embrace it and I think that's happening.\" Before adding: \"I can only cross my fingers to see.\""
