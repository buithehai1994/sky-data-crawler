        "Content": " The National Guard will be deployed to Los Angeles after \"riots\" in response to immigration raids extended into a second day. California Governor Gavin Newsom confirmed that the Trump administration is deploying \"2,000 soldiers\" to Los Angeles after local police used tear gas, stun guns, and riot shields to push back immigration protesters on Saturday. Demonstrations began outside the Los Angeles Federal Building in the downtown area of LA on Friday after officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out raids in the area. On Saturday, several dozen protesters were involved in police standoffs in Paramount, a city south of LA. Mr Newsom warned in a post on X: \"The federal government is sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate. That is not the way any civilized country behaves.\" He described the deployment as \"purposefully inflammatory\" and claimed it will \"only escalate tensions\". President Donald Trump hit back at Mr Newsom in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday. \n                  British man charged over plot to smuggle US military technology to China\n                 \n                  This gravely ill girl has been ordered to leave the US by the White House - but doctors say she could die within days\n                 \n                  Trump's tariffs hit the West's busiest port - with traffic down by nearly a third\n                 \"If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!,\" he wrote. Mr Trump's defence secretary Pete Hegseth claimed that active duty marines would also be mobilised if \"violence continues\". LA mayor Karen Bass said that amid the recovery from this year's wildfires, \"many in our community are feeling fear\" following \"recent federal immigration enforcement actions\" across LA County. \"We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward,\" she said. \"Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable.\" Reports the guard would be deployed to LA came earlier on Saturday, from Mr Trump's border tsar Tom Homan on Fox News.

The raids saw street vendors and day workers rounded up across Home Depots, a clothing factory, and a warehouse, Salas of Chirla (The Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles) said. In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"violent mobs\" had \"attacked ICE officers and federal law enforcement agents carrying out basic deportation operations\". She described such activity as \"essential to halting and reversing the invasion of illegal criminals into the United States\". Ms Leavitt said Californian politicians were \"feckless\" and had \"completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens\", prompting Mr Trump's order to send in the guard. Protests spread to second city On Saturday, protests spread to the Paramount area, where there is a significant Latino population, after demonstrators spotted ICE employees in a Home Depot car park they appeared to be using as a base. Law enforcement officers faced off protesters at a road junction at around 5pm where a car had been set on fire earlier in the day. The roads were pictured strewn with trolleys and rubbish bins set on fire, as gas canisters and fireworks were also set off. Commenting on Saturday's protests, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said: \"It appeared that federal law enforcement officers were in the area, and that members of the public were gathering to protest.\" Vice President JD Vance claimed that \"insurrectionists\" were seen \"carrying foreign flags\" and \"attacking immigration enforcement officers\" in Paramount. \"One half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil,\" he posted on X. \"Time to pass President Trump's beautiful bill and further secure the border.\" The clashes come amid Trump's nationwide crackdown on illegal migration. As soon as he was re-elected in January he set a target of arresting 3,000 suspected illegal migrants per day - and promised to lock down the US-Mexico border."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n        The moment we step into Willow Rise, the smell of damp is overpowering. There are water stains across the carpet and rotten wood on the doors. Around the corner, there's a hole in the wall, barely patched up with a piece of polystyrene sheet. We're meeting a resident on the 13th floor of the building in Kirkby, Merseyside - but the lifts are broken and wires hang out of the service panel. Like everyone living here, we will have to walk. The disrepair in this block is everywhere you look. It has now been deemed so unsafe by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service that they are days away from serving a rare prohibition notice on this tower and its neighbour, Beech Rise, meaning residents will have to leave with immediate effect. \n                  Hundreds face imminent eviction as Merseyside tower blocks condemned by firefighters\n                 \n                  Get building or lose your land: Labour propose strict new demands for developers\n                 \n                  At least 91,000 new affordable homes could be built with cladding money, social housing providers say\n                 In total, 160 households here face instant homelessness. After climbing 13 flights of stairs, we meet Chris Penfold-Ivany. 'A catastrophic scandal' He has terminal cancer, and after chemotherapy and a liver transplant, that climb is now the only way he can get up to his flat. He tells us it's making him breathless. He can no longer get his prescriptions delivered, as the drivers won't come up all the stairs. \"It's a catastrophic scandal that we have been left like this,\" he says. He has lived in this flat for 15 years and has watched the block slowly begin to fall apart over the last decade. He tells us that numerous complaints have achieved nothing. \"I'm going to say it,\" he says, \"this is another Grenfell in the making.\" 'Nobody can live like this' A few floors down, Arunee Leerasiri opens the door to us, in floods of tears. The stress of the last few weeks has left her anxious and overwhelmed. There are boxes everywhere, bare hooks on the walls where pictures hung. She is packing up her life just three years after putting her life savings into buying this flat. Her elderly mother has come to visit, but she had to hire removal men already to take her mattress into storage as she couldn't manage without the lifts. Tonight, and until they are told they must leave, they will sleep on the floor. \"I can't eat, I can't sleep,\" she tells us, through tears. \"Sometimes, if I'm honest, I can't even think. This used to be my home, and now I look around and I don't even recognise it.\" \"Nobody can live like this,\" she adds. 'Danger, 415 volts' She shows us a video she filmed just a few weeks ago, of one of the electrical risers on the ground floor. None of us can quite believe what we are seeing - water is pouring through the ceiling, directly on to fuse boxes and electrical wiring. Arunee takes us down to show us the cupboard. The water has now stopped but there are damp stains all over the floor and around the electrical equipment. The water pipes and electric boxes are just inches away from one another within the cupboard. One of the boxes, marked 'Danger, 415 volts', is rusted through. Next to it, there is a notice stuck to a resident's door telling them a leak has been identified in their flat - and as a leaseholder, they will be responsible for paying to fix it. \"Tell me, how is this safe?\" Arunee says. \"Why is this building allowed to be open for the public, as a dwelling, with this kind of set-up?\" Hidden owners and a plea to the government Merseyside Fire and Rescue tell us they have been serving enforcement notices on the building managers for years, to no avail. They have now been told there is no money for the millions of pounds worth of repairs that will be needed to bring the blocks up to a safe standard. Read more from Sky News:Reform UK chairman reverses decision to quitPrince William and David Attenborough team upRod Stewart cancels more concerts They have mandated a 'waking watch', where teams physically patrol the buildings daily to check for fire risks, without which they will serve the prohibition notice and tell residents they must leave straight away. Knowsley Council has stepped in to pay for this temporarily - at a cost of £3,000 per day. Their deputy leader tells us, though, that the money will soon run out. Where to go?With a complex management structure and several owners, managers and agents over the years, the council says it doesn't even know who is to blame for the disrepair - or who even has the legal responsibility for maintaining the buildings. It says discussions are ongoing with central government about whether any extra help - or money - can be provided to try to fix the mess. Right now though, all the residents can do is wait. With no date to leave and no idea if anything can be done to keep the buildings open, they are spending every day fearing the call to tell them they have to go. They can only hope there will be somewhere for them if they do."

        "Content": " At least four people have been killed in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv after a series of Russian attacks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described one of the attacks as a \"savage killing\", saying dozens of people had been injured. It comes after Kyiv embarrassed Moscow when it launched a daring drone raid deep inside Russia last weekend, destroying dozens of bombers.   Meanwhile, attempted US-led peace talks between the two appear to be floundering. During the attacks on Saturday, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said: \"Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack in the entire time of the full-scale war.\" The first wave of the Russian strike was a large drone-and-missile attack in the early hours of Saturday morning. Nightly attacks from Moscow have become a routine part of the conflict. At least three people died and 21 others were injured. There are reports that some people remain trapped underneath the rubble. Then, in the afternoon, Russia dropped aerial bombs on the city centre, killing at least one person and wounding more. Ukraine and Russia also accused one another of trying to sabotage a planned prisoner exchange. Residents reckon with Russian strikes As emergency workers fought fires at the attack sites in Kharkiv, residents had to deal with the fallout of strikes that could have claimed their lives.Alina Belous tried to extinguish flames with buckets of water to rescue a young girl trapped inside a burning building, as she called out for help. \"We were trying to put it out ourselves with our buckets, together with our neighbours,\" she said. \"Then the rescuers arrived and started helping us put out the fire, but there was smoke and they worried that we couldn't stay there. \"When the ceiling started falling off, they took us out.\" Vadym Ihnachenko said he initially thought it was a neighbouring building going up in flames - not his own. He was forced to flee after seeing smoke coming from his building's roof. Diplomatic efforts stall Several other areas in Ukraine were also hit, including the regions of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, and the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Sybiha said. Russia acknowledged the attacks, but not the deaths, saying it had targeted military sites, while pictures show apartment blocks on fire.

But bottom line is no.\"   Then, using a different tone, she went on: \"Yeah, but you know they did a bad thing to us, yeah but no. \"But we want that land... and we have history...

In October 2023, Hamas led other militant groups in a cross-border attack, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage.

Prince William's call to action comes as he teamed up with Sir David Attenborough in a social media video to talk about the harmful effects of over-fishing, pollution and temperature rise on our marine environment. On Sunday, the royal will travel to the south of France to deliver what's been described as a \"landmark speech\" at the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco. He is expected to say: \"Halfway through this decisive decade, I call on all of you to think big in your actions. \"Let us act together with urgency and optimism while we still have the chance.\" The forum, organised by the government of Monaco, the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, and the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, with support from France and Costa Rica, will bring together business leaders and government representatives committed to restoring the health of the oceans.

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n        The moment we step into Willow Rise, the smell of damp is overpowering. There are water stains across the carpet and rotten wood on the doors. Around the corner, there's a hole in the wall, barely patched up with a piece of polystyrene sheet. We're meeting a resident on the 13th floor of the building in Kirkby, Merseyside - but the lifts are broken and wires hang out of the service panel. Like everyone living here, we will have to walk. The disrepair in this block is everywhere you look. It has now been deemed so unsafe by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service that they are days away from serving a rare prohibition notice on this tower and its neighbour, Beech Rise, meaning residents will have to leave with immediate effect. \n                  Hundreds face imminent eviction as Merseyside tower blocks condemned by firefighters\n                 \n                  Get building or lose your land: Labour propose strict new demands for developers\n                 \n                  At least 91,000 new affordable homes could be built with cladding money, social housing providers say\n                 In total, 160 households here face instant homelessness. After climbing 13 flights of stairs, we meet Chris Penfold-Ivany. 'A catastrophic scandal' He has terminal cancer, and after chemotherapy and a liver transplant, that climb is now the only way he can get up to his flat. He tells us it's making him breathless. He can no longer get his prescriptions delivered, as the drivers won't come up all the stairs. \"It's a catastrophic scandal that we have been left like this,\" he says. He has lived in this flat for 15 years and has watched the block slowly begin to fall apart over the last decade. He tells us that numerous complaints have achieved nothing. \"I'm going to say it,\" he says, \"this is another Grenfell in the making.\" 'Nobody can live like this' A few floors down, Arunee Leerasiri opens the door to us, in floods of tears. The stress of the last few weeks has left her anxious and overwhelmed. There are boxes everywhere, bare hooks on the walls where pictures hung. She is packing up her life just three years after putting her life savings into buying this flat. Her elderly mother has come to visit, but she had to hire removal men already to take her mattress into storage as she couldn't manage without the lifts. Tonight, and until they are told they must leave, they will sleep on the floor. \"I can't eat, I can't sleep,\" she tells us, through tears. \"Sometimes, if I'm honest, I can't even think. This used to be my home, and now I look around and I don't even recognise it.\" \"Nobody can live like this,\" she adds. 'Danger, 415 volts' She shows us a video she filmed just a few weeks ago, of one of the electrical risers on the ground floor. None of us can quite believe what we are seeing - water is pouring through the ceiling, directly on to fuse boxes and electrical wiring. Arunee takes us down to show us the cupboard. The water has now stopped but there are damp stains all over the floor and around the electrical equipment. The water pipes and electric boxes are just inches away from one another within the cupboard. One of the boxes, marked 'Danger, 415 volts', is rusted through. Next to it, there is a notice stuck to a resident's door telling them a leak has been identified in their flat - and as a leaseholder, they will be responsible for paying to fix it. \"Tell me, how is this safe?\" Arunee says. \"Why is this building allowed to be open for the public, as a dwelling, with this kind of set-up?\" Hidden owners and a plea to the government Merseyside Fire and Rescue tell us they have been serving enforcement notices on the building managers for years, to no avail. They have now been told there is no money for the millions of pounds worth of repairs that will be needed to bring the blocks up to a safe standard. Read more from Sky News:Reform UK chairman reverses decision to quitPrince William and David Attenborough team upRod Stewart cancels more concerts They have mandated a 'waking watch', where teams physically patrol the buildings daily to check for fire risks, without which they will serve the prohibition notice and tell residents they must leave straight away. Knowsley Council has stepped in to pay for this temporarily - at a cost of £3,000 per day. Their deputy leader tells us, though, that the money will soon run out. Where to go?With a complex management structure and several owners, managers and agents over the years, the council says it doesn't even know who is to blame for the disrepair - or who even has the legal responsibility for maintaining the buildings. It says discussions are ongoing with central government about whether any extra help - or money - can be provided to try to fix the mess. Right now though, all the residents can do is wait. With no date to leave and no idea if anything can be done to keep the buildings open, they are spending every day fearing the call to tell them they have to go. They can only hope there will be somewhere for them if they do."

Overall by 2030, Ms Reeves's spending package will be worth more than £22.5bn a year, the government says. \"Britain is the home of science and technology,\" she said on Sunday. \"Through the 'plan for change', we are investing in Britain's renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.\" Science and technology secretary Peter Kyle added: \"Incredible and ambitious research goes on in every corner of our country, from Liverpool to Inverness, Swansea to Belfast, which is why empowering regions to harness local expertise and skills for all of our benefit is at the heart of this new funding - helping to deliver the economic growth at the centre of our plan for change.\" Read moreSpending review 2025: All you need to knowHow much cash will each department get?  Flat real-terms budget 'won't be enough' Regional leaders such as North East Mayor Kim McGuiness and West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker welcomed the funding promise. But the announcement was met with caution by industry leaders. John-Arne Rottingden, chief executive of Wellcome, the UK's biggest non-governmental research funder, said: \"While it's positive under the financial circumstances, a flat real-terms science budget, along with continuing barriers such as high visa costs for talented scientists and the university funding crisis, won't be enough for the UK to make the advances it needs to secure its reputation for science in an increasingly competitive world.\" He claimed the UK should be \"aiming to lead the G7 in research intensity\" to \"bring about economic growth\" and \"advances in health, science, and technology that benefit us all\". 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Director of policy and public affairs at the Institute of Physics Tony McBride expressed similar concerns. \"To fully harness the transformational potential of research and innovation - wherever it takes place - we need a decade-long strategic plan for science,\" he said. Mr McBride said a \"plan for a skilled workforce... starting with teachers and addressing every educational stage\" is key - something he hopes will feature in Ms Reeve's spending review. Among the other announcements expected are a potential scrapping of the two-child benefit cap and a green light to a new nuclear power station in Suffolk - Sizewell C."

        "Headline": "Three years since non-fatal strangulation became an offence in England and Wales, new data sheds light on how the legislation is being used.",
        "Content": "By Joely Santa Cruz, data journalist, and Ashna Hurynag, news correspondent   Around 70% of non-fatal strangulation cases in the last year have been dropped due to evidential issues, data shared exclusively with Sky News shows. It is now three years since it became a standalone offence in England and Wales, in a landmark piece of legislation designed to protect domestic abuse victims. Data from the Institute for Addressing Strangulation (IFAS) shows that police are implementing the offence widely - but outcomes for victims are mixed. Warning: This article contains references to domestic abuse and sexual assault 'Sarah' - whose name has been changed to protect her identity - vividly remembers the first time her ex-partner strangled her, one year into their relationship. She said: \"He was drunk, and he climbed on top me. He put his hands around my throat, and he pinned me down with the strength of his body.\" Terrified, she begged him repeatedly to stop, but he carried on. \n                  Paramedic who survived Israeli attack that killed 15 aid workers describes alleged torture in custody\n                 \n                  Chaos, confusion and killings: How the Israeli-backed aid plan in Gaza is unravelling\n                 \n                  How Elon Musk's mission to cut government spending fell flat\n                 \"I remember I just felt really numb and scared, but it was weird, it felt like an out-of-body experience.\" Afterwards the only words he spoke to her were \"look what you made me do,\" she said, and then when the ordeal was over, he carried on with his day as if nothing had happened. This was the beginning of a pattern of abuse that continued throughout the rest of their relationship, happening on at least 30 more occasions, Sarah estimated. It became so normalised He strangled her when she was pregnant. He strangled her whether her children were in the house or not. It always happened during sex, though Sarah was only later able to recognise that this was rape after talking to the police, because for her it had become so normalised. And, always, he told Sarah it was her fault - that she had somehow 'made' him do it. She later went on to suffer a miscarriage because of the physical abuse. 'A form of control' \"Looking back now I can see it was a form of control he got off on, knowing that he was in control, and he liked seeing me upset,\" she said. \"I thought that he was going to kill me because he used to threaten it to me. It was very, very scary.\" This fear of death is common among victims of strangulation and is a recognised tool of control and intimidation. A US study found that victims of domestic abuse were seven times more likely to be murdered by their current or former partner if there had been an incident of non-fatal strangulation beforehand. But this form of violence often leaves no obvious external signs of injury, meaning in some cases perpetrators could only be investigated for less serious offences like common assault, which did not reflect the severity of the crime. What are the possible effects on health? The potential health impacts are wide-ranging, including loss of consciousness, voice changes, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, bruising, haemorrhages, headaches, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), miscarriage, risk of suicide, and death (including delayed death). Symptoms can arise weeks or months after the event. It is for these reasons that campaigners fought for the introduction of the standalone offence, which came into effect in June 2022. 'Much work to be done' The IFAS has been monitoring the offence since the legislation was introduced and shared its latest report findings exclusively with Sky News. It said there is still \"much work to be done\" to better protect victims of strangulation. New figures obtained by IFAS from the Home Office reveal that over 63,000 crimes of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation were recorded by police in England and Wales in the first two years under the legislation. There were 39,360 recorded crimes in 2023/24, on average 66 offences per 100,000 people compared with 50 per 100,000 the year before, an increase of 20%. \"Survivors who work with us have recognised time and time again how important it is to be able to see strangulation as a standalone offence and have the opportunity to progress with criminal justice proceedings,\" Harriet Smailes, co-author of the report, told Sky News. The volume of crimes recorded suggests that the offence is being widely recognised and reported by police - and the number resulting in charges, at 12%, is high compared to some other offences. However, a significant number of investigations result in no further action due to evidential difficulties. This can happen if police or prosecutors do not believe there is enough evidence to proceed, or if the victim does not support the investigation. This was the outcome in three in five investigations overall, including one in five investigations where the victim did support police action. Outcomes were similar in both years of available data. \"In around half of cases, there are no external, physical, visible signs of injury. That's not to say that there aren't internal injuries that can't be seen just with the naked eye,\" said Ms Smailes, who is a research officer at IFAS. \"It might be that that visible injury isn't present at the time of evidence capture that might develop over time, or because there's a difference in how individuals show bruising, for example those of different skin tones. That can contribute towards there not being enough perceived evidence to be able to progress with a police case,\" she said. In some cases where a victim disengages from police proceedings, it may be that they did not feel supported and believed in the process or felt that there were \"too many obstacles\". On the other hand, not all cases where a victim did not support police action are necessarily negative. \"It might be that initial needs have been met in that instance through reporting to the police, for example, initial containment of the risk of that situation, and referrals to specialist health or mental health services,\" Ms Smailes explained. Police 'determined' to improve  Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe is the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for domestic abuse. She told Sky News that securing prosecutions for strangulation is a priority for tackling violence against women and girls, and a key part of national Domestic Abuse Matters training. \"For us to do well in prosecutions, we need to understand how perpetrators operate, how they use this is a sinister way of controlling their victims. And we also know that many victims are frightened to pursue prosecution,\" she said. Investigators not only have to secure detailed evidence rapidly but also present the best possible case so that prosecutors and juries understand how an abuser is operating, she said. \"That can be a challenging job, for a police service that's under pressure, trying to deal with a myriad of priorities. I know many investigators are passionate about getting this right.\" \"We know we're up against it when it comes to securing convictions, but we're determined to improve,\" she added. Fewer than half were convicted Separate research by IFAS has found that in the first year under the new legislation, only around half of the number of offences charged by police were prosecuted, and less than half of those secured a conviction. Overall, 47% of the 1,437 prosecutions of non-fatal strangulation and suffocation offences in the year to June 2023 resulted in conviction, based on data from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) from all courts in England and Wales. There are several potential reasons that a prosecution may be unsuccessful, including evidential difficulties or a victim withdrawing from the process. The accused may also have been convicted of a separate offence, but not for the strangulation. Without more detailed data, it is hard to determine to what extent each is contributing to the low conviction rate. Reflecting on the figures, head of policy and public affairs at domestic abuse support charity Refuge, Ellie Butt, told Sky News that victims often face \"huge pressure\" from perpetrators to drop out of the criminal justice process. \"When compounded with lengthy court delays and insufficient support, many survivors are forced to withdraw from the process. Police and prosecutors should be working to build cases that can be taken forward even when a survivor can no longer continue,\" she said. The Crown Prosecution Service highlighted to Sky News that the number of new prosecution proceedings has been consistently increasing, particularly domestic abuse-related strangulation offences. In the latest quarter, 2,000 cases reached their first hearing at magistrates' court. Kate Brown, the CPS national lead for domestic abuse, said: \"Three years on, we have continued to bring more charges quarter on quarter, with over 2,000 seen in court in the past three months. \"This standalone offence has shone a light on those who seek to use these violent acts to exert power over another person and harm them. We are determined to continue bringing abusers to justice for victims.\" A gendered crime  The new data from IFAS reinforces that strangulation is a gendered crime. Around 80% of victims whose gender was recorded by police were female, while 88% of suspects were male. The data also shows that while people from all ages are impacted, most victims are younger, with three in five aged 34 or under. The age profile of suspects was slightly higher, with three in five suspects aged between 25 and 44. 'I want to say it's not your fault' Sarah's case ended in evidential difficulties. Though her case was reported before 2022, when strangulation became a specific offence, she said she did provide substantial physical evidence to the police and she feels \"let down\" by the justice system. She said she has been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and other health issues. \"I live with it every day. It can be a song that comes on the radio or a sign or somebody's name and it would just bring everything back to me to that point, that moment,\" she said. \"I want to say it's not your fault. Nobody has the right to control you, nobody has the right to abuse you, rape you, strangle you. \"I would urge anyone to speak out and if you feel like you haven't been heard and your voice has not been listened to, speak out again.\" If you or someone you know is a victim of domestic abuse, support is available.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described one of the attacks as a \"savage killing\", saying dozens of people had been injured. It comes after Kyiv embarrassed Moscow when it launched a daring drone raid deep inside Russia last weekend, destroying dozens of bombers.   Meanwhile, attempted US-led peace talks between the two appear to be floundering. During the attacks on Saturday, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said: \"Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack in the entire time of the full-scale war.\" The first wave of the Russian strike was a large drone-and-missile attack in the early hours of Saturday morning. Nightly attacks from Moscow have become a routine part of the conflict. At least three people died and 21 others were injured. There are reports that some people remain trapped underneath the rubble. Then, in the afternoon, Russia dropped aerial bombs on the city centre, killing at least one person and wounding more.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has warned of \"serious consequences\" if Elon Musk funds the US president's political rivals - as the social media post at the centre of their public falling out was removed. Speaking on Saturday to Sky News' US partner NBC News, Mr Trump warned of repercussions if Musk funded Democrats who opposed his sweeping budget bill. \"If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,\" he said in a phone interview. \"He'll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,\" he added, not specifying what those consequences would be.  'The truth will come out' It comes after the tech billionaire claimed the US president appeared in files relating to the disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein in a post on his social media platform X, as he traded blows with his former colleague in a dramatic public row. In the post, which now appears to have been deleted, Musk said: \"Time to drop the really big bomb: \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.\" He had doubled down in a follow-up post, saying: \"Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.\" He gave no evidence for the claim, which was dismissed by the White House - with the posts disappearing from his social media platform by Sunday.

He made the comments in an interview with comedian and podcaster Theo Von - one of the \"manosphere\" influencers the Trump team targeted to gain votes with young men during the election. \"I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,\" Mr Vance said. He also said such outbursts \"happen to everyone\", adding: \"I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.\" 'Big ugly spending bill' Musk and Mr Trump's relationship broke down publicly on Thursday, just days after the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive left his role as a special government employee. In a fiery exchange, Musk posted a series of messages on X criticising the president's signature tax and spending bill as a \"big ugly spending bill\".

        "Content": "Israel says it has retrieved the body of a Thai hostage kidnapped into Gaza on 7 October.  The prime minister's office said that the body of Nattapong Pinta was returned to Israel \"in a special military operation\". Mr Pinta, who had a wife and son, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity near the start of the war, said the government. Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas militants. Israel's defence minister Israel Katz said that Mr Pinta's body was retrieved from the Rafah area. The 36-year-old went to Israel to work in agriculture. Mr Katz wrote in a post on X: \"I send my deepest condolences to his wife, his young son, and his family, and I thank our heroic fighters who operate under fire time and again to bring back all the hostages, driven by a deep moral commitment. \"We will not rest until all the hostages, the living and the fallen, are returned to Israel.\" \n                  Deadly Russian strikes condemned as 'savage' - as dozens more injured in Ukrainian city\n                 \n                  Donald Trump warns of 'consequences' if Elon Musk funds rivals - as 'big bomb' Epstein post disappears\n                 \n                  Kilmar Abrego Garcia: Man wrongly deported from US to El Salvador has been returned to face criminal charges\n                 The Hostage Families Forum said in a statement: \"We stand with Nattapong's family today and share in their grief. \"While the pain is immense, his family will finally have certainty after 20 terrible and agonising months of devastating uncertainty. \"Every family deserves such certainty to begin their personal healing journey. \"We emphasise once again that decision-makers must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will bring back all 55 remaining hostages - the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial.\" Fifty-five hostages remain in Gaza, of whom Israel says more than half are dead. On Thursday, Israel retrieved the bodies of Gad Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai, both of whom had Israeli and US citizenship. On Saturday at least 15 Palestinians were killed and 50 wounded by airstrikes in the Gaza City district of Sabra in the northern Gaza Strip, local health authorities said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment. "

        "Content": " The National Guard will be deployed to Los Angeles after \"riots\" in response to immigration raids extended into a second day. California Governor Gavin Newsom confirmed that the Trump administration is deploying \"2,000 soldiers\" to Los Angeles after local police used tear gas, stun guns, and riot shields to push back immigration protesters on Saturday. Demonstrations began outside the Los Angeles Federal Building in the downtown area of LA on Friday after officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out raids in the area. On Saturday, several dozen protesters were involved in police standoffs in Paramount, a city south of LA. Mr Newsom warned in a post on X: \"The federal government is sowing chaos so they can have an excuse to escalate. That is not the way any civilized country behaves.\" He described the deployment as \"purposefully inflammatory\" and claimed it will \"only escalate tensions\".

Mr Trump's defence secretary Pete Hegseth claimed that active duty marines would also be mobilised if \"violence continues\". LA mayor Karen Bass said that amid the recovery from this year's wildfires, \"many in our community are feeling fear\" following \"recent federal immigration enforcement actions\" across LA County. \"We've been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward,\" she said. \"Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable.\" Reports the guard would be deployed to LA came earlier on Saturday, from Mr Trump's border tsar Tom Homan on Fox News.

The raids saw street vendors and day workers rounded up across Home Depots, a clothing factory, and a warehouse, Salas of Chirla (The Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles) said. In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"violent mobs\" had \"attacked ICE officers and federal law enforcement agents carrying out basic deportation operations\". She described such activity as \"essential to halting and reversing the invasion of illegal criminals into the United States\". Ms Leavitt said Californian politicians were \"feckless\" and had \"completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens\", prompting Mr Trump's order to send in the guard. Protests spread to second city On Saturday, protests spread to the Paramount area, where there is a significant Latino population, after demonstrators spotted ICE employees in a Home Depot car park they appeared to be using as a base. Law enforcement officers faced off protesters at a road junction at around 5pm where a car had been set on fire earlier in the day. The roads were pictured strewn with trolleys and rubbish bins set on fire, as gas canisters and fireworks were also set off. Commenting on Saturday's protests, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said: \"It appeared that federal law enforcement officers were in the area, and that members of the public were gathering to protest.\" Vice President JD Vance claimed that \"insurrectionists\" were seen \"carrying foreign flags\" and \"attacking immigration enforcement officers\" in Paramount. \"One half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil,\" he posted on X. \"Time to pass President Trump's beautiful bill and further secure the border.\" The clashes come amid Trump's nationwide crackdown on illegal migration. As soon as he was re-elected in January he set a target of arresting 3,000 suspected illegal migrants per day - and promised to lock down the US-Mexico border."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has warned of \"serious consequences\" if Elon Musk funds the US president's political rivals - as the social media post at the centre of their public falling out was removed. Speaking on Saturday to Sky News' US partner NBC News, Mr Trump warned of repercussions if Musk funded Democrats who opposed his sweeping budget bill. \"If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,\" he said in a phone interview. \"He'll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,\" he added, not specifying what those consequences would be.  'The truth will come out' It comes after the tech billionaire claimed the US president appeared in files relating to the disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein in a post on his social media platform X, as he traded blows with his former colleague in a dramatic public row. In the post, which now appears to have been deleted, Musk said: \"Time to drop the really big bomb: \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.\" He had doubled down in a follow-up post, saying: \"Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.\" He gave no evidence for the claim, which was dismissed by the White House - with the posts disappearing from his social media platform by Sunday. Users clicking on the message - first posted on Thursday - were instead greeted with: \"Hmm...this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else.\" Epstein killed himself in his jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. JD Vance has his say Amid the fallout, vice president JD Vance said Musk was making a \"huge mistake\" going after Mr Trump but characterised him as an \"emotional guy\" who got frustrated. He made the comments in an interview with comedian and podcaster Theo Von - one of the \"manosphere\" influencers the Trump team targeted to gain votes with young men during the election. \"I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,\" Mr Vance said. He also said such outbursts \"happen to everyone\", adding: \"I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.\" 'Big ugly spending bill' Musk and Mr Trump's relationship broke down publicly on Thursday, just days after the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive left his role as a special government employee. In a fiery exchange, Musk posted a series of messages on X criticising the president's signature tax and spending bill as a \"big ugly spending bill\". President Trump posted on his own platform Truth Social, saying Musk had been \"wearing thin\" and claimed he \"asked him to leave\" his government position - something Musk denied.

        "Content": "Five members of the far-right group Proud Boys, who were convicted following the attack on the US Capitol in 2021, have filed a lawsuit seeking $100m (£74m) from the US government. They claim their constitutional rights were violated when they were prosecuted for taking part in the riots, which aimed to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's win over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The lawsuit was filed in Orlando federal court by Enrique Tarrio, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Ethan Nordean, who all had leadership roles in the group, plus Dominic Pezzola. The lawsuit claims the men were arrested with insufficient probable cause and that government agents later \"found\" fake incriminating evidence. They also claim they were held for years in pretrial detention, often in solitary confinement. Tarrio, former Proud Boys chairman, suggested they were held as \"hostages\" - repeating a term Donald Trump has also used to refer to those jailed for involvement in the violence which erupted on 6 January 2021 in Washington DC. At a news conference on Friday, Terrio added that the lawsuit was \"important to bring back law and order into our system\". \n                  Elon Musk's X to pay Trump $10m compensation\n                 \n                  Far-right Trump supporter convicted over January 6 attack defends 'civil war' threat\n                 \n                  Former 'MAGA cult' member rejects Capitol riot pardon from 'narcissist' Trump\n                 Tarrio, Biggs, Rehl and Nordean were all convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes. Pezzola was jailed after stealing a police officer's riot shield and using it to smash a window. They received sentences ranging between 10 and 22 years but were released after Mr Trump returned to office this year. The US president granted pardons to almost all of the more than 1,500 people who stormed the Capitol. Stewart Rhodes, who founded the so-called Oath Keepers, received an 18-year prison sentence after being found guilty of seditious conspiracy but was also later freed. He told Sky News he was convicted in a \"show trial\".  The Proud Boys lawsuit adds that: \"The plaintiffs themselves did not obstruct the proceedings at the Capitol, destroy government property, resist arrest, conspire to impede the police, or participate in civil disorder, nor did they plan for or order anyone else to do so.\" \"The plaintiffs bring this suit to seek redress for the multiple violations of their constitutional rights,\" the document read.

Shane Lamond, a lieutenant for the Metropolitan Police Department in the capital, denied handing over details about an investigation into Tarrio. But he was convicted of obstructing justice and making false statements. Tarrio was under investigation for burning a Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020, which he later admitted stealing from a church in Washington DC. Tarrio, who attended Lamond's sentencing, called for Mr Trump to pardon Lamond."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The family behind River Island, the high street fashion retailer, is drawing up a radical rescue plan which could put significant numbers of stores and jobs at risk. Sky News has learnt that the chain's owners have drafted in advisers from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to devise a formal restructuring plan. The proposals, which are expected to be finalised within weeks, are subject to sign-off, with sources insisting this weekend that any firm decisions about the future of the business have yet to be taken. River Island is one of Britain's best-known clothing chains, operating roughly 230 stores across the country, and employing approximately 5,500 people. Previously named Lewis and Chelsea Girl, the business was founded in 1948 by Bernard Lewis, finally adopting its current brand four decades later. Accounts for River Island Clothing Co for the 52 weeks ending 30 December, 2023 show the company made a £33.2m pre-tax loss. Turnover during the year fell by more than 19% to £578.1m. \n                  Spending Review 2025: Faster drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries to come from £86bn science and tech package\n                 \n                  Weekend Money: Renowned chef talks about life after being conned out of £300,000 by his own mum\n                 \n                  Ashley's Frasers explores bid for ailing Revolution Beauty\n                 A restructuring plan is a court-supervised process which enables companies facing financial difficulties to compromise creditors such as landlords in order to avoid insolvency proceedings. In recent years, it has been used by companies including the casual dining chain Prezzo and, more recently, Hobbycraft, the retailer now owned by Modella Capital. One source said that if it proceeded a restructuring plan at River Island could emerge within weeks. This weekend, it was unclear how many stores and jobs might be under threat from a formal rescue deal. In its latest accounts at Companies House, River Island Holdings Limited warned of a multitude of financial and operational risks to its business. \"The market for retailing of fashion clothing is fast changing with customer preferences for more diverse, convenient and speedier shopping journeys and with increasing competition especially in the digital space,\" it said. \"The key business risks for the group are the pressures of a highly competitive and changing retail environment combined with increased economic uncertainty. \"A number of geopolitical events have resulted in continuing supply chain disruption as well as energy, labour and food price increases, driving inflation and interest rates higher and resulting in weaker disposable income and lower consumer confidence.\" In January, Sky News reported that River Island had hired AlixPartners, the consulting firm, to undertake work on cost reductions and profit improvement. AlixPartners' role is now understood to have been superseded by that of PwC. Retailers have complained bitterly about the impact of tax changes announced by Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, in last autumn's Budget. Since then, a cluster of well-known chains, including Lakeland and The Original Factory Shop, have been forced to seek new owners. Poundland, the discount retail giant, is in the latter stages of an auction process, with Hilco Capital and Gordon Brothers remaining interested in acquiring it. A spokesperson for River Island declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Mike Ashley, the high street billionaire, is exploring a cut-price takeover bid for struggling Revolution Beauty – a move that would stoke animosity between him and rival London-listed retailer Debenhams. Sky News has learnt that Frasers Group, which owns retailers ranging from House of Fraser to Evans Cycles, has approached Revolution Beauty about a potential offer for the company. Retail industry sources said this weekend that Frasers was considering whether to bid but was not certain to do so. Revolution Beauty, which sells branded cosmetics, put itself up for sale last month as it warned investors that it was evaluating options to establish \"a more robust capital structure with additional capital to invest into the company\". It said it had received a takeover approach from a third party - thought to be a reference to a bidder other than Frasers Group - and invited other suitors to contact its advisers at Panmure Liberum, the investment bank. To facilitate the sale process, Revolution Beauty has parachuted in Iain McDonald, an experienced City figure whose directorships include a seat on the board of Debenhams Group, as chairman. Debenhams holds a large minority stake in Revolution Beauty, while Frasers is a big shareholder in Debenhams and blocked the change of its legal name from Boohoo earlier this year by voting against the plan. \n                  River Island owners draw up rescue plan for high street chain\n                 \n                  Spending Review 2025: Faster drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries to come from £86bn science and tech package\n                 \n                  Weekend Money: Renowned chef talks about life after being conned out of £300,000 by his own mum\n                 Revolution Beauty has had a torrid run on the London stock market, and now has a market capitalisation of barely £20m. Its stock has collapsed by over 70% in the last 12 months alone. The company has at various points been embroiled in probes relating to its accounting and a multimillion pound settlement with its founder, Adam Minto. In January, it reached a settlement with Chrysalis Investments, its former shareholder, after it made a series of allegations against the company. Revolution, which positions itself as a mass market beauty range, is sold through thousands of outlets including Superdrug stores in the UK. It built a strong following among younger consumers by forging collaborations with media properties including the ITV dating show Love Island. Frasers' interest in acquiring Revolution Beauty would reflect its growing interest in expanding beyond pure retailing in recent years. Under chief executive Michael Murray, it has also built stakes in companies such as THG, the owner of beauty brands such as LookFantastic. Because the auction of Revolution Beauty is taking place through a formal sale process, the identity of prospective bidders does not have to be disclosed in the usual way. It was unclear on Saturday whether Frasers intends to make a statement confirming its interest to the London stock market next week. On Friday, shares in Frasers closed at 728.5p, giving it a market value of £3.3bn. Any offer for Revolution Beauty is thought to be unlikely to ascribe a significant premium to its current valuation. Spokespeople for Frasers and Revolution Beauty both declined to comment."

The £2.2bn Home Office estimate to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) in this financial year is only slightly less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25. The vast majority is used for the accommodation for asylum seekers who have arrived in the UK, with recent figures showing more than 32,000 were being housed in hotels at the end of March. Labour has pledged \"to end the use of asylum hotels\" and the government says it has reduced the overall asylum support costs by half a billion pounds, including £200m in ODA savings, which had been passed back to the Treasury. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he will cut the overall ODA from its current level of 0.5% of gross national income (GNI) to 0.3% in 2027. Foreign aid is supposed to be spent on providing humanitarian and development assistance in other countries, but the UK is allowed to count refugee-hosting costs as ODA under internationally agreed rules. Labour MP Sarah Champion previously said a \"scandalously large amount\" of ODA has been diverted to the Home Office and has called for a cap on how much can be spent supporting asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. \n                  Arrests of illegal migrant workers increase by 51% in year since Labour elected\n                 \n                  UK to open talks with Kosovo about hosting 'return hub' for failed asylum seekers - report\n                 \n                  An embarrassment for Starmer on migrant return hubs?\n                 Asylum seekers and their families are housed in temporary accommodation if they are waiting for the outcome of a claim or an appeal and have been assessed as not being able to support themselves independently. They are housed in hotels if there is not enough space in accommodation provided by local authorities or other organisations. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We inherited an asylum system under exceptional pressure, and are urgently taking action to restore order, and reduce costs. \"This will ultimately reduce the amount of Official Development Assistance spent to support asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. \"We are immediately speeding up decisions and increasing returns so that we can end the use of hotels and save the taxpayer £4bn by 2026.\""

The popular actress and comedian said she apologised \"unreservedly\" after posting a video in a \"mocking tone\".

But bottom line is no.\"   Then, using a different tone, she went on: \"Yeah, but you know they did a bad thing to us, yeah but no. \"But we want that land... and we have history... No. \"Those people aren't really even people, are they really? No.\" On Saturday afternoon, she issued an apology, saying that in an effort to convey \"an important message\" she had \"clumsily used a mocking tone\". \"My intention was NEVER to mock, or dismiss, or diminish the horror of what happened on 7 October 2023,\" she posted on X and Instagram. She said her intention was to \"point the finger of shame at the behaviour of the cruel leader on ALL sides of this atrocious war\". French faced criticised after her initial post. Actress Tracy-Ann Oberman said she was \"saddened\" by it. She said: \"This mocking voice 'bad thing' of October 7 that Dawn (who I revere by the way) appears ro [sic] be mocking involved the most horrific terrorist attack.\" Read more from Sky News:Thunderstorm warning issuedRod Stewart cancels more concertsMeghan shares video of Disneyland trip MP Rosie Duffield responded to Oberman's post, saying: \"One can, and should hate what is happening in Gaza and also condemn the hideous events of October 7th. \"It is agonising to see events unfold, and requires extremely careful, measured and well-considered comments and actions. This is not that.\" Some social media users tried to pressure M&S, who French voices adverts for, over the incident. In October 2023, Hamas led other militant groups in a cross-border attack, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. Since then, Israel has launched a number of large-scale campaigns in the region, including in Gaza where over 54,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the enclave. Many of these are said to be women and children. Israel claims to be targeting militants and blames collateral deaths on Hamas fighters positioning themselves in densely populated areas."
