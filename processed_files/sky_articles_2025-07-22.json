        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne has died aged 76, just weeks after reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates and performing a huge farewell concert for fans. In a statement, his family said: \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.\" Latest: Tributes paid to Ozzy Osbourne As he performed from a throne on stage at Villa Park less than three weeks ago, Osbourne told 42,000 fans: \"You've no idea how I feel - thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" It was a gig put together with performances from some of his favourite acts, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, for the star's \"final bow\". Osbourne and his fellow original Black Sabbath members - Tony Iommi, Terence \"Geezer\" Butler and Bill Ward - reunited for the first time in 20 years and were the last to appear on stage for the Back To The Beginning concert on 5 July. Following his death, Metallica posted a photo on X of the band with Osbourne, along with a broken heart emoji. Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, wrote: \"I am so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\" Black Sabbath's account on X posted a photo of Osbourne from the gig with the caption: \"Ozzy Forever!\" And Ali Campbell, singer with Birmingham band UB40, wrote: \"Rest In Peace Ozzy. The Prince of Darkness. A true Birmingham legend. The undisputed king of heavy metal. You didn't just shape a culture, you defined it. You led from the front and never looked back. My thoughts are with Sharon and the entire Osbourne family during this time.\" Sir Elton John described his \"dear friend\" as a \"huge trailblazer\" who \"secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods\". \"He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met,\" the singer also wrote on Instagram. Born John Michael Osbourne on 3 December 1948 in Aston, Birmingham, he became known as the godfather of heavy metal. The self-styled Prince of Darkness pioneered the music genre with Black Sabbath before going on to have huge success in his own right. He was famous for hits including Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Crazy Train and Changes, both with the band and as a solo star. Black Sabbath's eponymous debut album in 1970 made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of tracks. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. The singer also found a different kind of fame thanks to noughties MTV reality show The Osbournes, which followed the Birmingham-raised star's somewhat chaotic life in Los Angeles with wife Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. And he was also known for the famous anecdotes of hellraising during his rock star heyday - most infamously, the tale of how he bit the head off a bat while on stage. Black Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir Into The Void. Osbourne re-emerged the next year as a solo artist with his album Blizzard of Ozz. In 1981, he released his second album Diary Of A Madman - both were hard rock classics that went multiplatinum. He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered other health problems in recent years, including complications from injuries sustained in a fall in 2019. After being forced to cancel tour shows, he made a one-off surprise appearance on stage in Birmingham to close the Commonwealth Games in 2022. The Villa Park gig was announced earlier this year by Sharon, who said he was determined to give fans the \"perfect farewell\".

He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame - as well as in Birmingham's Broad Street - an Ivor Novello, and five Grammy wins from 12 nominations. Plus, he received other honours such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend prize, over the years. Osbourne leaves behind his wife, Sharon, and their children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack, as well his two older children, Jessica and Louis, from his first marriage to Thelma Riley, and grandchildren."

        "Content": "London and the UK's leading status in the global financial system is \"fragile\", the boss of Goldman Sachs has warned, as the government grapples with a tough economy. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the prime minister, David Solomon - chairman and chief executive of the huge US investment bank - told Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost's The Master Investor Podcast of several concerns related to tax and regulation. He urged the government not to push people and business away through poor policy that would damage its primary aim of securing improved economic growth, arguing that European rivals were currently proving more attractive. Money latest: Mortgage shake-up to save 'time and money' He said: \"The financial industry is still driven by talent and capital formation. And those things are much more mobile than they were 25 years ago. \"London continues to be an important financial centre. But because of Brexit, because of the way the world's evolving, the talent that was more centred here is more mobile. \"We as a firm have many more people on the continent. Policy matters, incentives matter. \n                  Government borrowing soars to second-highest level on record\n                 \n                  The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bind\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \"I'm encouraged by some of what the current government is talking about in terms of supporting business and trying to support a more growth oriented agenda. \"But if you don't set a policy that keeps talent here, that encourages capital formation here, I think over time you risk that.\" He had a stark warning about the recent reversal of the \"Non Dom\" tax policy, which occurred across both the prior Conservative government and the current Labour government, which has played a part in some senior Goldman partners relocating away from London.  Richard Gnodde, one of the bank's vice-chairs, left for Milan earlier this year. \"Incentives matter if you create tax policy or incentives that push people away, you harm your economy,\" Mr Solomon continued. \"If you go back, you know, ten years ago, I think we probably had 80 people in Paris. You know, we have 400 people in Paris now... And so in Goldman Sachs today, if you're in Europe, you can live in London, you can live in Paris, you can live in Germany, in Frankfurt or Munich, you can live in Italy, you can live in Switzerland. \"And we've got, you know, real offices. You just have to recognise talent is more mobile.\" Goldman is understood to have about 6,000 employees in the UK. Rachel Reeves is currently seeking ways to fill a black hole in the public finances and has refused to rule out wealth taxes at the next budget. Mr Solomon expressed sympathy for her as her tears in parliament earlier this month led to speculation about the pressure of the job. \"I have sympathy, I have empathy not just for the chancellor, but for anyone who's serving in one of these governments,\" he said, referring to the turbulent political landscape globally. Commenting on the chancellor's Mansion House speech last week, he added: \"The chancellor spoke here about regulation, she's talking about regulation not just for safety and soundness, but also for growth.  \"And now we have to see the action steps that actually follow through and encourage that.\" One area he was particularly keen to see follow through from her Mansion House speech was ringfencing - the post financial crisis regulation that requires banks to separate their retail activities from their investment banking activities. \"It's a place where the UK is an outlier, and by being an outlier, it prevents capital formation and growth. \"What's the justification for being an outlier? Why is this so difficult to change? It's hard to make a substantive policy argument that this is like a great policy for the UK. So why is it so hard to change?\" The Master Investor Podcast with Wilfred Frost is available across multiple podcast platforms "

        "Content": " For the first time since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, Palestinian officials have said that dozens of people are dying of hunger. At least 101 people are known to have died of malnutrition during the conflict, including 80 children, most of them in recent weeks, according to officials. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has said malnourishment is soaring and starvation is knocking on every door in Gaza, describing the situation as a \"horror show\". Latest updates on the Middle East Israel controls all supplies entering Gaza and has denied it is responsible for food shortages. Some food stocks in the Palestinian territory have run out since Israel cut off all supplies in March and then lifted the blockade in May with new measures it said were needed to prevent aid from being diverted to militant groups. Israel has blamed the UN for failing to protect aid it says is stolen by Hamas and other groups. The fighters deny stealing it. \n                  Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity says - as tank attack reportedly kills 12 at camp\n                 \n                  Gazan doctor being held in 'inhumane' conditions in Israeli jail, says lawyer\n                 \n                  Watch Deir al Balah skyline live from Gaza amid reports of Israeli offensive\n                 'There is nothing left' The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has said its aid stocks are completely depleted in Gaza and some of its staff are starving, with the organisation accusing Israel of paralysing its work. \"Our last tent, our last food parcel, our last relief items have been distributed. There is nothing left,\" said Jan Egeland, the council's secretary-general. The NRC said that for the last 145 days, it has not been able to get hundreds of truckloads of tents, water, sanitation, food and education materials into Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military aid coordination agency, and Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel denies accusations it is preventing aid from reaching Gaza.  Aid workers 'fainting due to hunger' The NRC comments echo those made earlier by the head of the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA), who said doctors and aid workers have been fainting on duty due to hunger and exhaustion. \"Caretakers, including UNRWA colleagues in Gaza, are also in need of care now. Doctors, nurses, journalists, humanitarians, among them. UNRWA staff are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger and exhaustion while performing their duties,\" UNRWA commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini said. He warned that seeking food has become \"as deadly as the bombardments\", describing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid distribution scheme as a \"sadistic death trap\". \"This cannot be our new norm, humanitarian assistance is not the job of mercenaries,\" he added.  The UK, and several other countries, have condemned the current aid delivery model, backed by the Israeli and American governments, which has reportedly resulted in Israeli troops firing on Palestinian civilians in search of food on multiple occasions. More than 800 people have reportedly been killed in recent weeks trying to reach food, mostly in shootings by Israeli soldiers posted near distribution centres. Read more:Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity saysIsrael launches ground assault on central Gazan city  Israel 'risking more civilian deaths' Meanwhile, Israeli displacement orders followed by intensive attacks on the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah will lead to further civilian deaths, the head of the UN human rights office has said. On Monday, Israeli tanks pushed into southern and eastern districts of the city for the first time after Israel issued an evacuation order. The area is packed with Palestinians who have been displaced during the war in the coastal territory, and Israeli sources said the military believes hostages may be held there. Now, Volker Turk, the head of the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights, has said: \"It seemed the nightmare couldn't possibly get worse. \"And yet it does... given the concentration of civilians in the area, and the means and methods of warfare employed by Israel until now, the risks of unlawful killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law are extremely high.\"  Tents sheltering displaced people 'hit by strikes' Also, at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza on Tuesday, according to officials in the Hamas-run strip. Among them were 12 who died when tents sheltering displaced people in the Shati refugee camp on the western side of Gaza City were hit, according to Shifa Hospital, which treated casualties. The dead included three women and three children, said hospital director Dr Mohamed Abu Selmiyah, who added that 38 other Palestinians were injured. And eight people were killed in an overnight strike that hit crowds of people waiting for aid trucks in Gaza City, according to hospitals. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 118 people were wounded. Israel blames the deaths of Palestinian civilians on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas. It accuses the group of prolonging the war because Hamas has not accepted Israel's terms for a ceasefire - including calls to give up power and disarm. Health officials say Israeli forces have killed almost 60,000 Palestinians in airstrikes, shelling and shooting since launching their assault on Gaza in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, when 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage."

        "Content": "Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes has told Sky News she believes JK Rowling is \"wrong about some things\" when it comes to her stance on trans issues - but says it is also wrong for the author to be left out of \"celebrations\" for her famous books. Margolyes, who played Professor Sprout in the film series, said it was \"fair enough\" to criticise Rowling, who has been outspoken in her gender critical views. However, the 84-year-old actress said the backlash against the writer had become \"unkind\", and highlighted her absence from certain celebrations of the Harry Potter story. In 2022, Rowling did not appear in a 25th anniversary TV reunion featuring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who starred in all of the films. All three stars have spoken out in support of the trans community. Speaking to Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost, Margolyes said: \"I think everybody can be criticised, I think that's fair enough, but everybody's so horrid and nasty and unkind and I don't like that. \"I don't want people to be unkind about trans... I mean, I'm a gay woman myself and you have to just put up with it. I don't know if [Rowling's] been badly treated but I think it was wrong that she wasn't invited to the celebrations for Harry Potter. You know, she created the whole thing. \"She may be wrong about some things. And women's bodies are tremendously important - I love my body, even though it's fat and misshapen, and I wouldn't be a man for anything. But trans - who cares? Let's be kind, let's be inclusive. I think there's an awful lot of nonsense talked about it.\" Between 1997 and 2007, Rowling published seven Harry Potter books - which were turned into eight films between 2001 and 2011. The movies generated more than $7.7bn at the global box office. The author will be involved in the upcoming Harry Potter series. Margolyes said she does not know Rowling and has never met her, but praised her work and highlighted her series of crime novels, written under the pen name Robert Galbraith. \"I salute her as a very great writer and I think I like the detective stories best,\" she told Frost.

And that's why I want people to come to this museum and enjoy it.\" During the interview, Margolyes also made her thoughts clear on artificial intelligence - an issue that many creatives are concerned about. \"I loathe AI and everything connected with it,\" she said. \"That is not about everybody sharing, it's about people stealing and lying, which is what goes on a great deal these days. No, AI is a very bad thing and I won't have anything to do with it - and I'm pretty sure that Mr Dickens would not like it either.\""

        "Content": "Coca-Cola will launch a version of its signature drink in the US made with cane sugar days after Donald Trump said he had spoken to the company about the move. The iconic beverage is sweetened with cane sugar in Mexico but has been made with high-fructose corn syrup in the US since the 1980s to save costs. However many US consumers, including Mr Trump, believe the Mexican version tastes better. The US president, known to be a big lover of both Coke and its diet variety, posted on his Truth Social platform last week that he had been \"speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so\". He added: \"I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them - You'll see. It's just better!\" Coca-Cola didn't confirm the move at the time but said it would share details on new products soon. In an earnings release this morning, the company said a version of its flagship drink made with US cane sugar would be available on the American market later this year, Sky News' US partner network NBC News reports. \n                  Ozzy Osbourne dies just weeks after farewell show\n                 \n                  Black Sabbath, Elton John and Rod Stewart among music giants paying tribute to Ozzy Osbourne \n                 \n                  Goldman Sachs boss sounds warning to Reeves on tax and regulation\n                 The drink will complement Coca-Cola's existing product line in the United States, the company added. Trump latest: Follow live updates Meanwhile, Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive James Quincey said in a conference call with investors today that the move shows the company is expanding its product range \"to reflect consumer interest in differentiated experiences\". He added: \"We appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand. \"This addition is designed to complement our strong core portfolio and offer more choice across occasions and preferences.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the Coca-Cola announcement. In the US, Coca-Cola made with cane sugar is colloquially known as \"Mexican Coke\" as it is often imported into the country from its southern neighbour. Sky News' US correspondent Martha Kelner is one of those who prefers the so-called \"Mexican\" variety. She told the Trump 100 podcast last week: \"In support of the president of the United States on a very important issue... Coke in Mexico is way better than Coke in the US, there's no doubt about it.\" Coca-Cola in the UK and other European nations is mostly sweetened with beet sugar but some cane sugar is also used, the company said in 2011. Is sugar-switch a 'MAHA' move? The Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative has pushed food companies to alter their formulations to remove ingredients such as artificial dyes. A report by the MAHA Commission, a panel convened by Trump and tasked with identifying the root causes of chronic disease, has earlier said substantial consumption of high-fructose corn syrup could play a role in childhood obesity and other conditions. However, while taste preferences may differ, the health impact of cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is reported to be essentially the same. Mr Kennedy has been critical of the amount of sugar consumed in the American diet and has said that updated dietary guidelines released this summer will advise Americans to eat \"whole food\".

During the same year he wrote on Twitter, now called X, that the \"Coca Cola company is not happy with me - that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage\". More than a decade later in January this year, Mr Quincey travelled to Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and presented him with a custom bottle commemorating his upcoming inauguration."

        "Content": " A man who killed his wife as she pushed their seven-month-old baby in a pram has been handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 28 years.  Habibur Masum was last month found guilty of murdering Kulsuma Akter, 27, in a \"ferocious\" knife attack after tracing her to a refuge she was staying in to escape his \"violence, jealousy and controlling behaviour\", a court heard. He was also found guilty of one count of assault, one of making threats to kill and one charge of stalking. Passing sentence on Tuesday, Mr Justice Barry Cotter told Masum: \"Having considered the entirety of the evidence, I'm sure that you can be properly described as violent, self-centred, jealous, controlling and coercive with a firmly held view that your wife was not your equal and should do what you told her to do.\" Ms Akter suffered more than 25 knife injuries after Masum found her through her phone location and confronted her in a street in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 6 April last year. The judge added that the \"nature and extent\" of Masum's attack \"proves beyond all reasonable doubt that you intended to kill her,\" and that Ms Akter's wounds were \"unsurvivable, as was your intention\". Ms Akter's family called Masum a \"monster,\" saying in a statement after he was jailed: \"We do not wish to utter his name. It does not deserve to be mentioned. \"The monster who savagely took Kulsuma from not only us, but also from her baby son. He will never know her beauty and her kindness.\" After fleeing the scene, Masum, 27, boarded a bus and CCTV footage showed him smiling, prosecutor Steve Wood KC told Bradford Crown Court. Masum was arrested after a four-day manhunt, having been found 150 miles away in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where he and Ms Akter lived when they first came to the UK from Bangladesh. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possession of a knife but denied murder, claiming he had intended to kill himself in front of his wife but \"totally lost control\". The court heard during his murder trial that Ms Akter had attempted to escape Masum by staying at a refuge in Bradford after the killer had held a knife to her throat at their home in Greater Manchester. Masum found out Ms Akter was staying at the refuge through her phone location on Snapchat, and stayed in streets around the hostel, and sent her messages threatening to kill her family members if she did not return to him. The judge told Masum that \"such was your behaviour, Kulsuma was able to predict her own death at your hands\". In a victim impact statement read to the court on Tuesday, Ms Akter's brother Imran Hussain said he \"cannot comprehend that this has happened\" to his \"baby sister\". \"My parents still struggle with losing their daughter, their youngest daughter, their baby,\" he added. \"There is now such a deep, painful void in our lives. She did not deserve what she experienced at the hands of Masum. \"This for us will be a life sentence.\" Read more from Sky News:Inside a whites-only communityBus driver arrested after 20 people injured in crashTory Senedd member defects to Reform UK Marie Walsh, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said on Tuesday that Masum is \"a violent and dangerous man who subjected his estranged wife to violence and domestic abuse causing her to flee their home to live in a safehouse\". She added: \"This was a callous and shocking murder for which Masum has now been jailed by the court. \"We hope the imprisonment of Masum has brought some comfort to the family and friends of Kulsuma.\""

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A nine-year-old girl was shot in the head by a motorbike-riding gunman in east London in an attempted assassination of rival gang members, a court has heard. Ali Nasser, 43, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Mustafa Kiziltam, 38 - who are linked to the Hackney Turks - were sat outside the busy Evin restaurant on Kingsland High Street, Hackney, when six shots were fired at the group in two seconds, a jury was told. The first bullet missed and hit the girl, who was sitting at an inside table with her family on the evening of 29 May last year, and lodged in her brain, the Old Bailey heard. All of the victims survived the attack - which was caught on CCTV in footage described as \"distressing to watch\". But the girl needed operations to rebuild her skull with titanium and was in hospital for three months before being allowed to go home. She will have physical and cognitive difficulties for the rest of her life. Prosecutors say the shooting was part of an ongoing dispute between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks, also known as the Bombacilars (Bombers), whose \"intense rivalry\" over more than a decade has seen \"extreme violence\" used between them. James Mulholland KC told a jury that members of the Tottenham Turks had ordered the \"planned assassination of members of a rival gang\". Javon Riley, 33, of Farnborough, Hampshire, is on trial at the Old Bailey, where he denies four charges of attempted murder and an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent relating to the girl, who cannot be identified because of her age. Prosecutors say Riley wasn't a member of the Tottenham Turks but was linked to them and knew they were behind the shooting. The gunman, who arrived on the scene on an \"extremely powerful\" red Ducati Monster, has not been arrested, but Riley is said to have played \"a key role\" before, during and after the alleged attempted murders. He is alleged to have been \"an integral part\" of the plan, as he carried out reconnaissance and carried the gunman away from the scene. The court heard that after the shooting, the gunman rode the motorbike to a nearby street where Riley was waiting in a stolen Nissan Juke on false plates before they \"calmly\" headed to north London before transferring into Riley's Range Rover. Vehicles used in the alleged plot were later torched, the court heard. Mr Mulholland said in covert recordings in the months after the shooting, Riley talked about Izzet Eren, who is linked to the Tottenham Turks and was shot in Moldova on 10 July last year in what is believed to have been a revenge attack. He also discussed a man called \"Kem\", who prosecutors say is Kemal Eren, \"one of those closely involved in the Tottenham Turks\". \"It is clear from all the evidence that Javon Riley knew this was a job for individuals connected with Tottenham Turks, the level of violence required and the aim was to kill those seated outside the restaurant and played an integral part in setting the scene so that this came about,\" said Mr Mulholland. \"The only reason someone did not die that night was luck and had nothing to do with Mr Riley.\""

In a statement, his family said: \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.\" Latest: Tributes paid to Ozzy Osbourne As he performed from a throne on stage at Villa Park less than three weeks ago, Osbourne told 42,000 fans: \"You've no idea how I feel - thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" It was a gig put together with performances from some of his favourite acts, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, for the star's \"final bow\". Osbourne and his fellow original Black Sabbath members - Tony Iommi, Terence \"Geezer\" Butler and Bill Ward - reunited for the first time in 20 years and were the last to appear on stage for the Back To The Beginning concert on 5 July. Following his death, Metallica posted a photo on X of the band with Osbourne, along with a broken heart emoji. Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, wrote: \"I am so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\" Black Sabbath's account on X posted a photo of Osbourne from the gig with the caption: \"Ozzy Forever!\" And Ali Campbell, singer with Birmingham band UB40, wrote: \"Rest In Peace Ozzy. The Prince of Darkness. A true Birmingham legend. The undisputed king of heavy metal. You didn't just shape a culture, you defined it. You led from the front and never looked back. My thoughts are with Sharon and the entire Osbourne family during this time.\" Sir Elton John described his \"dear friend\" as a \"huge trailblazer\" who \"secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods\". \"He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met,\" the singer also wrote on Instagram. Born John Michael Osbourne on 3 December 1948 in Aston, Birmingham, he became known as the godfather of heavy metal. The self-styled Prince of Darkness pioneered the music genre with Black Sabbath before going on to have huge success in his own right. He was famous for hits including Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Crazy Train and Changes, both with the band and as a solo star. Black Sabbath's eponymous debut album in 1970 made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of tracks. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. The singer also found a different kind of fame thanks to noughties MTV reality show The Osbournes, which followed the Birmingham-raised star's somewhat chaotic life in Los Angeles with wife Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. And he was also known for the famous anecdotes of hellraising during his rock star heyday - most infamously, the tale of how he bit the head off a bat while on stage. Black Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir Into The Void. Osbourne re-emerged the next year as a solo artist with his album Blizzard of Ozz. In 1981, he released his second album Diary Of A Madman - both were hard rock classics that went multiplatinum. He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered other health problems in recent years, including complications from injuries sustained in a fall in 2019. After being forced to cancel tour shows, he made a one-off surprise appearance on stage in Birmingham to close the Commonwealth Games in 2022. The Villa Park gig was announced earlier this year by Sharon, who said he was determined to give fans the \"perfect farewell\".

Plus, he received other honours such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend prize, over the years. Osbourne leaves behind his wife, Sharon, and their children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack, as well his two older children, Jessica and Louis, from his first marriage to Thelma Riley, and grandchildren."

        "Content": "London and the UK's leading status in the global financial system is \"fragile\", the boss of Goldman Sachs has warned, as the government grapples with a tough economy. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the prime minister, David Solomon - chairman and chief executive of the huge US investment bank - told Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost's The Master Investor Podcast of several concerns related to tax and regulation. He urged the government not to push people and business away through poor policy that would damage its primary aim of securing improved economic growth, arguing that European rivals were currently proving more attractive. Money latest: Mortgage shake-up to save 'time and money' He said: \"The financial industry is still driven by talent and capital formation. And those things are much more mobile than they were 25 years ago. \"London continues to be an important financial centre. But because of Brexit, because of the way the world's evolving, the talent that was more centred here is more mobile. \"We as a firm have many more people on the continent. Policy matters, incentives matter. \n                  Government borrowing soars to second-highest level on record\n                 \n                  The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bind\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \"I'm encouraged by some of what the current government is talking about in terms of supporting business and trying to support a more growth oriented agenda. \"But if you don't set a policy that keeps talent here, that encourages capital formation here, I think over time you risk that.\" He had a stark warning about the recent reversal of the \"Non Dom\" tax policy, which occurred across both the prior Conservative government and the current Labour government, which has played a part in some senior Goldman partners relocating away from London.  Richard Gnodde, one of the bank's vice-chairs, left for Milan earlier this year. \"Incentives matter if you create tax policy or incentives that push people away, you harm your economy,\" Mr Solomon continued. \"If you go back, you know, ten years ago, I think we probably had 80 people in Paris. You know, we have 400 people in Paris now... And so in Goldman Sachs today, if you're in Europe, you can live in London, you can live in Paris, you can live in Germany, in Frankfurt or Munich, you can live in Italy, you can live in Switzerland. \"And we've got, you know, real offices. You just have to recognise talent is more mobile.\" Goldman is understood to have about 6,000 employees in the UK. Rachel Reeves is currently seeking ways to fill a black hole in the public finances and has refused to rule out wealth taxes at the next budget. Mr Solomon expressed sympathy for her as her tears in parliament earlier this month led to speculation about the pressure of the job. \"I have sympathy, I have empathy not just for the chancellor, but for anyone who's serving in one of these governments,\" he said, referring to the turbulent political landscape globally. Commenting on the chancellor's Mansion House speech last week, he added: \"The chancellor spoke here about regulation, she's talking about regulation not just for safety and soundness, but also for growth.  \"And now we have to see the action steps that actually follow through and encourage that.\" One area he was particularly keen to see follow through from her Mansion House speech was ringfencing - the post financial crisis regulation that requires banks to separate their retail activities from their investment banking activities. \"It's a place where the UK is an outlier, and by being an outlier, it prevents capital formation and growth. \"What's the justification for being an outlier? Why is this so difficult to change? It's hard to make a substantive policy argument that this is like a great policy for the UK. So why is it so hard to change?\" The Master Investor Podcast with Wilfred Frost is available across multiple podcast platforms "

It was an exit on his own terms by heavy metal's biggest character, with a supporting line-up of hard rock luminaries including Slayer, Metallica and Guns'n'Roses, all inspired by his music. With Black Sabbath, Osbourne was at the forefront of heavy metal. As Ozzy, he was one of the biggest rock stars in the world. Nowhere was this more evident than at the Back To The Beginning in his home city, where 40,000 fans gathered to see the show billed as his \"final bow\".  \"Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica,\" frontman James Hetfield told the crowd in Birmingham. It was a sentiment echoed by many of the other acts who performed on stage. Announced by his wife Sharon earlier this year, the show was a chance for the performer to reunite with Black Sabbath and say thank you and farewell to fans after years of health problems, including Parkinson's disease, which had forced him to cancel recent tour shows. Other celebrities, from Sir Elton John to Dolly Parton, sent video messages of support. Fans knew it would be his last performance, but could not have known his death, at the age of 76, would come so soon. It was a truly metal goodbye. 'I think there's a wild man in everybody' John Michael Osbourne was born in Solihull in December 1948 and grew up in the Aston area of the West Midlands city. As a teenager, he was bullied at school. Drink and drugs later became a way to escape his fears, he said in interviews, and after leaving school at 15, he worked several jobs, including labouring and in an abattoir. It was hearing The Beatles, he said, that made him want to be a musician. \"I think there's a wild man in everybody,\" he says in a resurfaced interview clip. \"Ozzy Osbourne and John Osbourne is two different people. John Osbourne is talking to you now.\" His eyes widen a little manically, he grins, the voice cranks up. \"But if you want to be Ozzy Osbourne, it's like... it just takes over you.\" In 1967, he was recruited to the band that two years later would become Black Sabbath, inspired by a film of the same title. This was a line-up of four working-class schoolfriends - Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler, alongside Ozzy - who twisted heavy blues into something darker, creating a sound and otherworldly image that felt new, exciting and rebellious. A self-titled debut album was released in 1970 and made the Top 10 in the UK. The follow-up, Paranoid, released just seven months later, topped the charts after the single of the same name became their big breakthrough. The album also included the unforgettable Iron Man and the anti-war protest song War Pigs - its unmistakeable riff inspiring the Arctic Monkeys' 2014 single, Arabella. Black Sabbath went on to release six more albums with Osbourne at the helm before he was fired in 1979 due to his drinking and substance use, something he claimed was no better or worse than other members at the time. In 1980, he returned with his debut solo album, Blizzard Of Oz, and the lead single Crazy Train. As a solo artist, he went on to release 13 studio albums - the last being Patient Number 9, in 2022 - and had hits with songs including Mr Crowley, Diary Of A Madman, No More Tears, Bark At The Moon and Shot In The Dark. His first UK number one was a re-recording of the Black Sabbath ballad Changes, as a duet with his daughter, Kelly, in 2003, and his collaborations over the years included everyone from Alice Cooper (Hey Stoopid in 1991) and Post Malone (Take What You Want in 2019) to, in a somewhat unusual move, Hollywood star Kim Basinger for a re-recording of the dance hit Shake Your Head by Was (Not Was) in 1992. With Black Sabbath and as a solo star, he is estimated to have sold 100 million records throughout his career - for context, this is reportedly on a par with Sir Paul McCartney's solo sales - so the numbers speak for themselves. Biting the bat Osbourne was also a huge personality and played up to his hellraising image - the Prince of Darkness. The most famous Ozzy story goes like this. The singer was on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, 1982, when the bat appeared. He assumed it was a toy. So, like any good hellraiser would do, he bit its head off. For more than 40 years, he found himself jokily fielding questions about bats. What do they taste like? (Salty). What happened afterwards? (Headline news, painful rabies shots). Do you have any pets? (Yes. They're all dead).\"I get a lot of weird people at my concerts,\" he told David Letterman in 1982, of how the animal came to appear in front of him. \"It's rock 'n' roll, y'know\". He was sometimes irritated by the bat connection. But he also played up to the image, recounting the story in interviews, offering plush bat toys among his merch, and appearing as himself, biting a bat, in the 2000 Adam Sandler comedy Little Nicky, about the son of Satan. Known for catapulting raw meat at fans during gigs, there were plenty of other tales of darkness and debauchery. Osbourne's wild persona and on-stage theatrics always went hand-in-hand with the music. From Prince of Darkness to reality TV He was famously managed by his wife, Sharon, whom he first met when her dad, Don Arden, was managing Black Sabbath. As well as the music, Sharon and Ozzy together founded the Ozzfest festival tours in 1996 - and in 2002 came his second act. It's hard to imagine it now, but before the perfectly coiffed Kardashians it was a scruffy 50-something rocker from Birmingham and his family who ruled the Hollywood reality TV scene. As with his music, he was a pioneer - this time round of a new era of addictive viewing. The Osbournes followed the lives of Ozzy and Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack (their eldest daughter, Aimee, famously had nothing to do with the show), and the family fallouts and sunny California culture clash proved to be a ratings winner. The MTV series catapulted the metal star to global mainstream celebrity heights. His marriage to Sharon was tumultuous but the pair always stayed together, and they renewed their wedding vows in 2017. Sharon was the driving force behind Ozzy's successes, to him eventually getting clean, and behind his farewell show. Despite weathering the storm of drink and drug use, Osbourne's air of indestructibility was challenged when a quad bike accident left him with a broken collar bone and ribs, as well as short-term memory loss, in 2003. The 2020 documentary Biography: The Nine Lives Of Ozzy Osbourne, had summed up with its title the performer's seeming ability to defy the odds. However, the health problems started to mount up. Scheduled tours were postponed, and in 2023 he told fans holding on to tickets that he had come to the realisation he was \"not physically capable\" of dealing with life on the road. But there was one gig he couldn't miss - a surprise appearance to close the Commonwealth Games in his home city in 2022, just weeks after undergoing surgery. Now, fans will remember the shows they did get to see, the music that ushered in a new genre - and especially his most recent gig, which was said to have raised around £140m for charities. Just a few days afterwards, his new memoir, Last Rites, was announced. It will be released in October. During his career, Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and the US Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame - twice for both, with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist. \"Countless artists from many genres have credited Ozzy as a major influence, including Metallica, Lita Ford, Rage Against The Machine, and Busta Rhymes,\" reads his US citation. \"With his longevity, impact, and iconic persona, Ozzy Osbourne is a phenomenon unlike any other.\" He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame - as well as in Birmingham's Broad Street - an Ivor Novello, and five Grammy wins from 12 nominations. But other honours, such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend, also give a sense of how much his personality played a part in why he is so beloved by fans and critics alike. In the Nine Lives documentary, daughter Kelly describes him as \"the most irresistible mad man you will ever meet in your life\". Osbourne's was an unlikely journey from Birmingham to LA. He was a working-class hero of heavy metal, a reality TV favourite - forever the Prince of Darkness. \"People say to me, if you could do it all again, knowing what you know now, would you change anything?\" he once said. \"I'm like, f*** no... If I'd done normal, sensible things, I wouldn't be Ozzy.\""

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A nine-year-old girl was shot in the head by a motorbike-riding gunman in east London in an attempted assassination of rival gang members, a court has heard. Ali Nasser, 43, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Mustafa Kiziltam, 38 - who are linked to the Hackney Turks - were sat outside the busy Evin restaurant on Kingsland High Street, Hackney, when six shots were fired at the group in two seconds, a jury was told. The first bullet missed and hit the girl, who was sitting at an inside table with her family on the evening of 29 May last year, and lodged in her brain, the Old Bailey heard. All of the victims survived the attack - which was caught on CCTV in footage described as \"distressing to watch\". But the girl needed operations to rebuild her skull with titanium and was in hospital for three months before being allowed to go home. She will have physical and cognitive difficulties for the rest of her life. Prosecutors say the shooting was part of an ongoing dispute between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks, also known as the Bombacilars (Bombers), whose \"intense rivalry\" over more than a decade has seen \"extreme violence\" used between them. James Mulholland KC told a jury that members of the Tottenham Turks had ordered the \"planned assassination of members of a rival gang\". Javon Riley, 33, of Farnborough, Hampshire, is on trial at the Old Bailey, where he denies four charges of attempted murder and an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent relating to the girl, who cannot be identified because of her age. Prosecutors say Riley wasn't a member of the Tottenham Turks but was linked to them and knew they were behind the shooting. The gunman, who arrived on the scene on an \"extremely powerful\" red Ducati Monster, has not been arrested, but Riley is said to have played \"a key role\" before, during and after the alleged attempted murders. He is alleged to have been \"an integral part\" of the plan, as he carried out reconnaissance and carried the gunman away from the scene. The court heard that after the shooting, the gunman rode the motorbike to a nearby street where Riley was waiting in a stolen Nissan Juke on false plates before they \"calmly\" headed to north London before transferring into Riley's Range Rover. Vehicles used in the alleged plot were later torched, the court heard. Mr Mulholland said in covert recordings in the months after the shooting, Riley talked about Izzet Eren, who is linked to the Tottenham Turks and was shot in Moldova on 10 July last year in what is believed to have been a revenge attack. He also discussed a man called \"Kem\", who prosecutors say is Kemal Eren, \"one of those closely involved in the Tottenham Turks\". \"It is clear from all the evidence that Javon Riley knew this was a job for individuals connected with Tottenham Turks, the level of violence required and the aim was to kill those seated outside the restaurant and played an integral part in setting the scene so that this came about,\" said Mr Mulholland. \"The only reason someone did not die that night was luck and had nothing to do with Mr Riley.\""

        "Content": " A man who killed his wife as she pushed their seven-month-old baby in a pram has been handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 28 years.  Habibur Masum was last month found guilty of murdering Kulsuma Akter, 27, in a \"ferocious\" knife attack after tracing her to a refuge she was staying in to escape his \"violence, jealousy and controlling behaviour\", a court heard. He was also found guilty of one count of assault, one of making threats to kill and one charge of stalking. Passing sentence on Tuesday, Mr Justice Barry Cotter told Masum: \"Having considered the entirety of the evidence, I'm sure that you can be properly described as violent, self-centred, jealous, controlling and coercive with a firmly held view that your wife was not your equal and should do what you told her to do.\" Ms Akter suffered more than 25 knife injuries after Masum found her through her phone location and confronted her in a street in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 6 April last year. The judge added that the \"nature and extent\" of Masum's attack \"proves beyond all reasonable doubt that you intended to kill her,\" and that Ms Akter's wounds were \"unsurvivable, as was your intention\". Ms Akter's family called Masum a \"monster,\" saying in a statement after he was jailed: \"We do not wish to utter his name. It does not deserve to be mentioned. \"The monster who savagely took Kulsuma from not only us, but also from her baby son. He will never know her beauty and her kindness.\" After fleeing the scene, Masum, 27, boarded a bus and CCTV footage showed him smiling, prosecutor Steve Wood KC told Bradford Crown Court. Masum was arrested after a four-day manhunt, having been found 150 miles away in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where he and Ms Akter lived when they first came to the UK from Bangladesh. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possession of a knife but denied murder, claiming he had intended to kill himself in front of his wife but \"totally lost control\". The court heard during his murder trial that Ms Akter had attempted to escape Masum by staying at a refuge in Bradford after the killer had held a knife to her throat at their home in Greater Manchester. Masum found out Ms Akter was staying at the refuge through her phone location on Snapchat, and stayed in streets around the hostel, and sent her messages threatening to kill her family members if she did not return to him. The judge told Masum that \"such was your behaviour, Kulsuma was able to predict her own death at your hands\". In a victim impact statement read to the court on Tuesday, Ms Akter's brother Imran Hussain said he \"cannot comprehend that this has happened\" to his \"baby sister\". \"My parents still struggle with losing their daughter, their youngest daughter, their baby,\" he added. \"There is now such a deep, painful void in our lives. She did not deserve what she experienced at the hands of Masum. \"This for us will be a life sentence.\" Read more from Sky News:Inside a whites-only communityBus driver arrested after 20 people injured in crashTory Senedd member defects to Reform UK Marie Walsh, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said on Tuesday that Masum is \"a violent and dangerous man who subjected his estranged wife to violence and domestic abuse causing her to flee their home to live in a safehouse\". She added: \"This was a callous and shocking murder for which Masum has now been jailed by the court. \"We hope the imprisonment of Masum has brought some comfort to the family and friends of Kulsuma.\""

Torben Stig Hersborg, from Tower Hamlets, east London, was found to have filmed and photographed around 2,000 women across more than a decade at his clinic in Old Street. The 64-year-old - labelled \"one of London's most prolific voyeurs\" - also recorded women on beaches, on footpaths, waiting at bus stops or for the Tube and when they were in their own homes. The Danish national - who had a celebrity client list including sports stars and actors - admitted to eight counts of voyeurism and was jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday.  Alex Weichselbaum, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Hersborg operated in plain sight for too long. \"Having targeted thousands of women over 12 years, we believe the scale and significance of his offending makes him one of London's most prolific voyeurs. \"Hersborg deliberately abused the trust of his unwitting patients by filming them in intimate positions and targeted strangers for his own sexual gratification. \"Women should be free to live their lives without unwanted intrusion - particularly from sexual offenders like Hersborg who deliberately chose to film or photograph them in their most private or intimate moments.\" Read more:Bus driver arrested after 20 injured in crashPossible tornado spotted in Yorkshire Hersborg's crimes were revealed when a member of the public called the police in December last year after they saw him in the backseat of his vehicle, parked outside university accommodation in Islington, north London.

At least 101 people are known to have died of malnutrition during the conflict, including 80 children, most of them in recent weeks, according to officials. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has said malnourishment is soaring and starvation is knocking on every door in Gaza, describing the situation as a \"horror show\". Latest updates on the Middle East Israel controls all supplies entering Gaza and has denied it is responsible for food shortages. Some food stocks in the Palestinian territory have run out since Israel cut off all supplies in March and then lifted the blockade in May with new measures it said were needed to prevent aid from being diverted to militant groups. Israel has blamed the UN for failing to protect aid it says is stolen by Hamas and other groups. The fighters deny stealing it. \n                  Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity says - as tank attack reportedly kills 12 at camp\n                 \n                  Gazan doctor being held in 'inhumane' conditions in Israeli jail, says lawyer\n                 \n                  Watch Deir al Balah skyline live from Gaza amid reports of Israeli offensive\n                 'There is nothing left' The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has said its aid stocks are completely depleted in Gaza and some of its staff are starving, with the organisation accusing Israel of paralysing its work. \"Our last tent, our last food parcel, our last relief items have been distributed. There is nothing left,\" said Jan Egeland, the council's secretary-general. The NRC said that for the last 145 days, it has not been able to get hundreds of truckloads of tents, water, sanitation, food and education materials into Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military aid coordination agency, and Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel denies accusations it is preventing aid from reaching Gaza.  Aid workers 'fainting due to hunger' The NRC comments echo those made earlier by the head of the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA), who said doctors and aid workers have been fainting on duty due to hunger and exhaustion. \"Caretakers, including UNRWA colleagues in Gaza, are also in need of care now. Doctors, nurses, journalists, humanitarians, among them. UNRWA staff are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger and exhaustion while performing their duties,\" UNRWA commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini said. He warned that seeking food has become \"as deadly as the bombardments\", describing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid distribution scheme as a \"sadistic death trap\". \"This cannot be our new norm, humanitarian assistance is not the job of mercenaries,\" he added.  The UK, and several other countries, have condemned the current aid delivery model, backed by the Israeli and American governments, which has reportedly resulted in Israeli troops firing on Palestinian civilians in search of food on multiple occasions. More than 800 people have reportedly been killed in recent weeks trying to reach food, mostly in shootings by Israeli soldiers posted near distribution centres. Read more:Gaza food situation 'worst it's ever been', charity saysIsrael launches ground assault on central Gazan city  Israel 'risking more civilian deaths' Meanwhile, Israeli displacement orders followed by intensive attacks on the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah will lead to further civilian deaths, the head of the UN human rights office has said. On Monday, Israeli tanks pushed into southern and eastern districts of the city for the first time after Israel issued an evacuation order. The area is packed with Palestinians who have been displaced during the war in the coastal territory, and Israeli sources said the military believes hostages may be held there. Now, Volker Turk, the head of the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights, has said: \"It seemed the nightmare couldn't possibly get worse. \"And yet it does... given the concentration of civilians in the area, and the means and methods of warfare employed by Israel until now, the risks of unlawful killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law are extremely high.\"  Tents sheltering displaced people 'hit by strikes' Also, at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza on Tuesday, according to officials in the Hamas-run strip. Among them were 12 who died when tents sheltering displaced people in the Shati refugee camp on the western side of Gaza City were hit, according to Shifa Hospital, which treated casualties. The dead included three women and three children, said hospital director Dr Mohamed Abu Selmiyah, who added that 38 other Palestinians were injured. And eight people were killed in an overnight strike that hit crowds of people waiting for aid trucks in Gaza City, according to hospitals. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 118 people were wounded. Israel blames the deaths of Palestinian civilians on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas. It accuses the group of prolonging the war because Hamas has not accepted Israel's terms for a ceasefire - including calls to give up power and disarm. Health officials say Israeli forces have killed almost 60,000 Palestinians in airstrikes, shelling and shooting since launching their assault on Gaza in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, when 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage."

Italy had been the better team for much of the game following Barbara Bonansea's goal in the 33rd minute, but England had the momentum in extra time as they fought for a winning goal. The game was decided after England forward Beth Mead was brought down in the area in the 116th minute and the Lionesses were awarded a penalty. Chloe Kelly had her initial spot kick saved before she followed it up to slot in the rebound. \n                  Ozzy Osbourne dies just weeks after farewell show\n                 \n                  Black Sabbath, Elton John and Rod Stewart among music giants paying tribute to Ozzy Osbourne \n                 \n                  Goldman Sachs boss sounds warning to Reeves on tax and regulation\n                 The game was arguably even more dramatic than England's quarter finals victory where they came from 2-0 down to equalise and then beat Sweden on penalties - with Agyemang equalising in the 81st minute of that tie. England, who have reached their third major final in a row, will now play the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Spain and Germany. Whoever they play, the final at St Jakob-Park in Basel will be a repeat fixture of England finals in recent years. The Lionesses lost 1-0 to Spain in the final of the Women's World Cup in Sydney in 2023. A year earlier the Lionesses beat Germany in the final of Euro 2022 after Kelly scored an extra-time winner. Super-subs do it again for England The Lionesses' victory was once again secured with help from the bench. Agyemang didn't even enter the field of play until the 85th minute, while Kelly came on in the 77th. Both players were also impactful substitutes when they were brought on late in the quarter-finals clash against Sweden. Kelly assisted England's first goal to make it 2 - 1 in that game, while Agyemang's strike minutes later made it 2 - 2. Kelly also scored her penalty in the shootout that decided the quarter-final. A selection headache for Sarina? Many will feel England boss Sarina Wiegman has some deep thinking to do about who will make the starting line-up for Sunday's final. Some of the team's regular starters have now clocked up a lot of minutes by playing into extra time two games in a row. Meanwhile, Agyemang and Kelly have arguably justified a place in the starting line-up for the final."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n Qatar has confirmed it is in talks to host the 2036 Olympics and Paralympics and bring the games to the Middle East for the first time. The Qatar Olympic Committee said it wants to \"showcase the potential of Arab youth on the global stage\" - building on the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), under the new leadership of Kirsty Coventry, has pledged to involve its members more in the selection of host cities. Qatar had been overlooked for the 2032 Olympics because Thomas Bach's IOC fast-tracked Brisbane as host under a preferred bidder process. The Gulf nation could face a neighbouring challenge from Saudi Arabia, which is staging the men's World Cup in 2034 after also investing its wealth into sports megaprojects. India is also a potentially strong challenger with Nita Ambani, an influential IOC member. She is the wife of India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who heads the Reliance Industries conglomerate. Ms Coventry told Sky News after her election in March: \"New regions and embracing new regions... will be a part of what I would like to see. \n                  Tom Daley says 'it's scary how LGBT rights are being dangerously threatened'\n                 \n                  Could an OnlyFans account capsize this canoeist's Olympic dream?\n                 \n                  Sir Bradley Wiggins 'lucky to be here' after cocaine addiction\n                 \"I think if we can embrace new regions across the entire movement, it opens this up for so many different opportunities, including revenue growth, including being able to reach new audiences.\"  Read more from Sky News:Inside America's whites-only communityBus driver arrested after 20 people injured in crash The Qatar Olympic Committee said it is already involved in \"ongoing discussions\" with the IOC as part of the host city election process and has 95% of the required sports infrastructure already in place. Qatar Olympic Committee president Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al-Thani said: \"Our participation in the ongoing dialogue around hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2036 reflects a national vision that sees sport as a driver of development and a platform for promoting mutual understanding and peace among nations. \"We have made sport a central pillar of our national strategy, and today, we aspire to elevate that role regionally and globally by presenting a new model - one that reflects the diversity of our region and celebrates its authentic human values.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne has died aged 76, just weeks after reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates and performing a huge farewell concert for fans. In a statement, his family said: \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.\" Latest: Tributes paid to Ozzy Osbourne As he performed from a throne on stage at Villa Park less than three weeks ago, Osbourne told 42,000 fans: \"You've no idea how I feel - thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" It was a gig put together with performances from some of his favourite acts, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, for the star's \"final bow\". Osbourne and his fellow original Black Sabbath members - Tony Iommi, Terence \"Geezer\" Butler and Bill Ward - reunited for the first time in 20 years and were the last to appear on stage for the Back To The Beginning concert on 5 July. Following his death, Metallica posted a photo on X of the band with Osbourne, along with a broken heart emoji. Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, wrote: \"I am so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\" Black Sabbath's account on X posted a photo of Osbourne from the gig with the caption: \"Ozzy Forever!\" And Ali Campbell, singer with Birmingham band UB40, wrote: \"Rest In Peace Ozzy. The Prince of Darkness. A true Birmingham legend. The undisputed king of heavy metal. You didn't just shape a culture, you defined it. You led from the front and never looked back. My thoughts are with Sharon and the entire Osbourne family during this time.\" Sir Elton John described his \"dear friend\" as a \"huge trailblazer\" who \"secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods\". \"He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met,\" the singer also wrote on Instagram. Born John Michael Osbourne on 3 December 1948 in Aston, Birmingham, he became known as the godfather of heavy metal. The self-styled Prince of Darkness pioneered the music genre with Black Sabbath before going on to have huge success in his own right. He was famous for hits including Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Crazy Train and Changes, both with the band and as a solo star. Black Sabbath's eponymous debut album in 1970 made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of tracks. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. The singer also found a different kind of fame thanks to noughties MTV reality show The Osbournes, which followed the Birmingham-raised star's somewhat chaotic life in Los Angeles with wife Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. And he was also known for the famous anecdotes of hellraising during his rock star heyday - most infamously, the tale of how he bit the head off a bat while on stage. Black Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir Into The Void. Osbourne re-emerged the next year as a solo artist with his album Blizzard of Ozz. In 1981, he released his second album Diary Of A Madman - both were hard rock classics that went multiplatinum. He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered other health problems in recent years, including complications from injuries sustained in a fall in 2019. After being forced to cancel tour shows, he made a one-off surprise appearance on stage in Birmingham to close the Commonwealth Games in 2022. The Villa Park gig was announced earlier this year by Sharon, who said he was determined to give fans the \"perfect farewell\".

Plus, he received other honours such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend prize, over the years. Osbourne leaves behind his wife, Sharon, and their children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack, as well his two older children, Jessica and Louis, from his first marriage to Thelma Riley, and grandchildren."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n \"You've no idea how I feel - thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" an emotional Ozzy Osbourne told fans as he performed from a throne on stage at his beloved Villa Park, reunited with Black Sabbath, less than three weeks ago. It was an exit on his own terms by heavy metal's biggest character, with a supporting line-up of hard rock luminaries including Slayer, Metallica and Guns'n'Roses, all inspired by his music. With Black Sabbath, Osbourne was at the forefront of heavy metal. As Ozzy, he was one of the biggest rock stars in the world. Nowhere was this more evident than at the Back To The Beginning in his home city, where 40,000 fans gathered to see the show billed as his \"final bow\".  \"Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica,\" frontman James Hetfield told the crowd in Birmingham. It was a sentiment echoed by many of the other acts who performed on stage. Announced by his wife Sharon earlier this year, the show was a chance for the performer to reunite with Black Sabbath and say thank you and farewell to fans after years of health problems, including Parkinson's disease, which had forced him to cancel recent tour shows. Other celebrities, from Sir Elton John to Dolly Parton, sent video messages of support. Fans knew it would be his last performance, but could not have known his death, at the age of 76, would come so soon. It was a truly metal goodbye. 'I think there's a wild man in everybody' John Michael Osbourne was born in Solihull in December 1948 and grew up in the Aston area of the West Midlands city. As a teenager, he was bullied at school. Drink and drugs later became a way to escape his fears, he said in interviews, and after leaving school at 15, he worked several jobs, including labouring and in an abattoir. It was hearing The Beatles, he said, that made him want to be a musician. \"I think there's a wild man in everybody,\" he says in a resurfaced interview clip. \"Ozzy Osbourne and John Osbourne is two different people. John Osbourne is talking to you now.\" His eyes widen a little manically, he grins, the voice cranks up. \"But if you want to be Ozzy Osbourne, it's like... it just takes over you.\" In 1967, he was recruited to the band that two years later would become Black Sabbath, inspired by a film of the same title. This was a line-up of four working-class schoolfriends - Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler, alongside Ozzy - who twisted heavy blues into something darker, creating a sound and otherworldly image that felt new, exciting and rebellious. A self-titled debut album was released in 1970 and made the Top 10 in the UK. The follow-up, Paranoid, released just seven months later, topped the charts after the single of the same name became their big breakthrough. The album also included the unforgettable Iron Man and the anti-war protest song War Pigs - its unmistakeable riff inspiring the Arctic Monkeys' 2014 single, Arabella. Black Sabbath went on to release six more albums with Osbourne at the helm before he was fired in 1979 due to his drinking and substance use, something he claimed was no better or worse than other members at the time. In 1980, he returned with his debut solo album, Blizzard Of Oz, and the lead single Crazy Train. As a solo artist, he went on to release 13 studio albums - the last being Patient Number 9, in 2022 - and had hits with songs including Mr Crowley, Diary Of A Madman, No More Tears, Bark At The Moon and Shot In The Dark. His first UK number one was a re-recording of the Black Sabbath ballad Changes, as a duet with his daughter, Kelly, in 2003, and his collaborations over the years included everyone from Alice Cooper (Hey Stoopid in 1991) and Post Malone (Take What You Want in 2019) to, in a somewhat unusual move, Hollywood star Kim Basinger for a re-recording of the dance hit Shake Your Head by Was (Not Was) in 1992. With Black Sabbath and as a solo star, he is estimated to have sold 100 million records throughout his career - for context, this is reportedly on a par with Sir Paul McCartney's solo sales - so the numbers speak for themselves. Biting the bat Osbourne was also a huge personality and played up to his hellraising image - the Prince of Darkness. The most famous Ozzy story goes like this. The singer was on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, 1982, when the bat appeared. He assumed it was a toy. So, like any good hellraiser would do, he bit its head off. For more than 40 years, he found himself jokily fielding questions about bats. What do they taste like? (Salty). What happened afterwards? (Headline news, painful rabies shots). Do you have any pets? (Yes. They're all dead).\"I get a lot of weird people at my concerts,\" he told David Letterman in 1982, of how the animal came to appear in front of him. \"It's rock 'n' roll, y'know\". He was sometimes irritated by the bat connection. But he also played up to the image, recounting the story in interviews, offering plush bat toys among his merch, and appearing as himself, biting a bat, in the 2000 Adam Sandler comedy Little Nicky, about the son of Satan. Known for catapulting raw meat at fans during gigs, there were plenty of other tales of darkness and debauchery. Osbourne's wild persona and on-stage theatrics always went hand-in-hand with the music. From Prince of Darkness to reality TV He was famously managed by his wife, Sharon, whom he first met when her dad, Don Arden, was managing Black Sabbath. As well as the music, Sharon and Ozzy together founded the Ozzfest festival tours in 1996 - and in 2002 came his second act. It's hard to imagine it now, but before the perfectly coiffed Kardashians it was a scruffy 50-something rocker from Birmingham and his family who ruled the Hollywood reality TV scene. As with his music, he was a pioneer - this time round of a new era of addictive viewing. The Osbournes followed the lives of Ozzy and Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack (their eldest daughter, Aimee, famously had nothing to do with the show), and the family fallouts and sunny California culture clash proved to be a ratings winner. The MTV series catapulted the metal star to global mainstream celebrity heights. His marriage to Sharon was tumultuous but the pair always stayed together, and they renewed their wedding vows in 2017. Sharon was the driving force behind Ozzy's successes, to him eventually getting clean, and behind his farewell show. Despite weathering the storm of drink and drug use, Osbourne's air of indestructibility was challenged when a quad bike accident left him with a broken collar bone and ribs, as well as short-term memory loss, in 2003. The 2020 documentary Biography: The Nine Lives Of Ozzy Osbourne, had summed up with its title the performer's seeming ability to defy the odds. However, the health problems started to mount up. Scheduled tours were postponed, and in 2023 he told fans holding on to tickets that he had come to the realisation he was \"not physically capable\" of dealing with life on the road. But there was one gig he couldn't miss - a surprise appearance to close the Commonwealth Games in his home city in 2022, just weeks after undergoing surgery. Now, fans will remember the shows they did get to see, the music that ushered in a new genre - and especially his most recent gig, which was said to have raised around £140m for charities. Just a few days afterwards, his new memoir, Last Rites, was announced. It will be released in October. During his career, Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and the US Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame - twice for both, with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist. \"Countless artists from many genres have credited Ozzy as a major influence, including Metallica, Lita Ford, Rage Against The Machine, and Busta Rhymes,\" reads his US citation. \"With his longevity, impact, and iconic persona, Ozzy Osbourne is a phenomenon unlike any other.\" He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame - as well as in Birmingham's Broad Street - an Ivor Novello, and five Grammy wins from 12 nominations. But other honours, such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend, also give a sense of how much his personality played a part in why he is so beloved by fans and critics alike. In the Nine Lives documentary, daughter Kelly describes him as \"the most irresistible mad man you will ever meet in your life\". Osbourne's was an unlikely journey from Birmingham to LA. He was a working-class hero of heavy metal, a reality TV favourite - forever the Prince of Darkness. \"People say to me, if you could do it all again, knowing what you know now, would you change anything?\" he once said. \"I'm like, f*** no... If I'd done normal, sensible things, I wouldn't be Ozzy.\""

        "Content": " A former Kentucky police officer has been sentenced to nearly three years in prison for using excessive force during the botched drugs raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Brett Hankison's 10 shots did not hit anyone - but he is the only person at the scene charged over her death in 2020. The sentence comes despite the US Department of Justice recommending he should not be locked up. District judge Rebecca Grady Jennings disagreed, arguing that not imprisoning him would minimise the jury's verdict. She said she was \"startled\" people weren't hurt by his excessive shooting. Hankison's shots narrowly missed a neighbouring family after they pierced the walls of Ms Taylor's apartment. Ms Taylor, 26, was killed in March 2020 when Louisville officers carried out a \"no-knock\" warrant and broke down her door. Her boyfriend thought it was someone breaking in and fired a single shot in self-defence, hitting one officer in the leg. \n                  Tyre Nichols: Kamala Harris and family members of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor to attend funeral \n                 \n                  Former Louisville detective pleads guilty to Breonna Taylor shooting cover-up\n                 \n                  Black Lives Matter: Police launch investigation after mural of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd vandalised\n                 Three officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck and killed Ms Taylor. She was hit in her hallway by bullets from two officers, but neither was charged after prosecutors said they were justified in returning fire.  It later emerged police were actually searching for an ex-partner of Ms Taylor - an alleged drug dealer - who did not live at the address. Her death, along with other killings of black people in 2020 including George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, sparked protests around the US and the world.  On Monday, Hankison, 49, was sentenced to 33 months with three years of supervised probation. He won't be locked up immediately and it will be for the US Bureau of Prisons to decide when and where he will be imprisoned. A statement from Ms Taylor's family said: \"While today's sentence is not what we had hoped for - nor does it fully reflect the severity of the harm caused - it is more than what the Department of Justice sought. That, in itself, is a statement.\" Three other former police officers who weren't at the scene have been charged with crafting a falsified warrant but have not gone to trial."

        "Content": "A huge trove of documents relating to the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr has been released by the US government. The disclosure, which was opposed by many of the civil rights hero's family, includes more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under court seal since 1977. Dr King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a \"captivating public curiosity for decades\". But they emphasised the personal nature of their father's death and urged that the files be \"viewed within their full historical context\". Gunshots ring out in Tennessee Dr King was shot and killed on 4 April, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, while headed to dinner with friends. The night before the assassination, Dr King delivered his famous \"Mountaintop\" speech on a stormy night. \n                  Martin Luther King Jr: Thousands gather on National Mall to mark the March on Washington's 60th anniversary\n                 \n                  MLK/FBI: 'They thought his illicit affairs would destroy him… but the press wouldn't touch it'\n                 \n                  'Get your knee off our necks': Struggle for justice continues 57 years after famous speech\n                 James Earl Ray was eventually apprehended after a long manhunt and pleaded guilty to the killing, but he later renounced his plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998. Members of Dr King's family and others have questioned if Ray acted alone or if he was even involved at all. Keen interest in the files Historians, journalists and the public have been waiting to study the now-unsealed documents to see what else can be learned about Dr King's death. It has long been established that then-FBI Director J Edgar Hoover was intensely interested in Dr King and others he considered radicals.

        "Headline": "Harvard's lawsuit accuses the government of freezing billions in funding after the university rejected a list of 10 demands from a federal antisemitism task force.",
        "Content": " The Trump administration and Harvard University have gone head-to-head in federal court over the government's threats to cut billions from the school's funding. The Ivy League institution, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sued the Trump administration in April for seeking \"unprecedented and improper\" control of the school, after it froze $2.6bn (£1.9bn) of its federal funding. Harvard's lawsuit accuses the government of waging a retaliation campaign against the university after it rejected a list of 10 demands from a federal antisemitism task force, which included sweeping changes related to campus protests, academics and admissions. The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, with the department of justice arguing that funding cuts are a means to protect against antisemitism, after it accused Harvard of ideological bias and violating the rights of its Jewish students when campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza took place last year. The case is now being heard before US district judge Allison Burroughs, who was appointed by former president Barack Obama. Both sides have sought a summary judgement, which ends a legal case early without the need of a full trial. But there is no indication on when Judge Burroughs will deliver a verdict. With the ruling potentially leading to larger implications on how much influence the US government has over schools, here is what you need to know. Research, careers and labs at stake During Monday's hearing at Moakley Federal Courthouse, Harvard lawyer Steven Lehotsky asked Judge Burroughs to reverse the series of funding freezes. He said if the cuts remain in place, it could lead to the loss of research, damage careers and the closing of labs. \"It's not about Harvard's conduct,\" he said. \"It's about the government's conduct toward Harvard.\" Already, government agencies have begun to end their contracts with the school, citing a clause that allows grants to be scrapped if they no longer align with government policies. Sky News' US partner network NBC News reported the cancelled contracts were worth an estimated $100m (£74m). Despite having a $53bn endowment - a collection of assets, typically built up from donations, that generate income for the school - Harvard has said it cannot absorb the full cost of the cuts. Although, it has begun to self-fund some research. Donald Trump also separately warned in a post on Truth Social that Harvard could lose its tax exempt status and be \"taxed as a political entity\". 'The government is pro-Jewish students' In court, the parties continually went over whether antisemitism on campus justified the removal of federal funding. Michael Velchik, the lawyer representing the Trump administration, argued Harvard allowed antisemitism to flourish at the university following the 7 October 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, including protesters chanting antisemitic slogans and Jewish students being attacked. \"Harvard claims the government is anti-Harvard. I reject that,\" Mr Velchik, who is a Harvard graduate, said. \"The government is pro-Jewish students at Harvard. The government is pro-Jewish faculty at Harvard.\" Harvard has said it has made changes to combat antisemitism, but Mr Lehotsky argued that the issue is not relevant to cutting research to do with, for example, Alzheimer's research. Judge Burroughs also pushed back at Mr Velchik, saying the government had provided \"no documentation, no procedure\" to \"suss out\" whether Harvard administrators have or haven't done enough to combat antisemitism. \"The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,\" she said. \"I don't think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech.\" Mr Velchik responded by saying the case comes down to the government choosing how best to spend billions in research funding. After Monday's hearing, Mr Trump took to Truth Social, calling Judge Burroughs a \"total disaster\". Enrolling international students row The lawsuit over federal funding is separate to a complaint Harvard filed in a Boston federal court in May over the Trump administration's plan to stop the school from enrolling international students. Judge Burroughs, who is overseeing both cases, issued a temporary restraining order which stops the government from revoking Harvard's certification in the student and exchange visitor programme, which allows the university to host international students with visas to study in the US.  The government first brought about the plan after accusing Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to assault Jewish students on its premises. Read more from Sky News:Inside the far right community excluding people based on their raceTrump diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency It also accused the university of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. Harvard argued the move violated the First Amendment and would have had an \"immediate and devastating effect\" on the school and \"more than 7,000 visa holders\"."

The US firm was seeking to recoup up to £4bn of losses from Mike Lynch - the UK tech entrepreneur and co-founder of Autonomy - in a damages lawsuit that found in HP's favour in 2022.

HP brought the High Court case after it significantly wrote down Autonomy's value by £5.5bn soon after it completed the £8.3bn acquisition, claiming it had been deliberately overstated. Mr Lynch had intended to appeal the judgment before his tragic death. Mr Justice Hildyard ruled that HP suffered losses amounting to £697,876,753, some of which is set to be paid by Mr Lynch's estate.

        "Content": "Coca-Cola will launch a version of its signature drink in the US made with cane sugar days after Donald Trump said he had spoken to the company about the move. The iconic beverage is sweetened with cane sugar in Mexico but has been made with high-fructose corn syrup in the US since the 1980s to save costs. However many US consumers, including Mr Trump, believe the Mexican version tastes better. The US president, known to be a big lover of both Coke and its diet variety, posted on his Truth Social platform last week that he had been \"speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so\". He added: \"I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them - You'll see. It's just better!\" Coca-Cola didn't confirm the move at the time but said it would share details on new products soon. In an earnings release this morning, the company said a version of its flagship drink made with US cane sugar would be available on the American market later this year, Sky News' US partner network NBC News reports. \n                  Ozzy Osbourne dies just weeks after farewell show\n                 \n                  Black Sabbath, Elton John and Rod Stewart among music giants paying tribute to Ozzy Osbourne \n                 \n                  Goldman Sachs boss sounds warning to Reeves on tax and regulation\n                 The drink will complement Coca-Cola's existing product line in the United States, the company added. Trump latest: Follow live updates Meanwhile, Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive James Quincey said in a conference call with investors today that the move shows the company is expanding its product range \"to reflect consumer interest in differentiated experiences\". He added: \"We appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand. \"This addition is designed to complement our strong core portfolio and offer more choice across occasions and preferences.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the Coca-Cola announcement. In the US, Coca-Cola made with cane sugar is colloquially known as \"Mexican Coke\" as it is often imported into the country from its southern neighbour. Sky News' US correspondent Martha Kelner is one of those who prefers the so-called \"Mexican\" variety. She told the Trump 100 podcast last week: \"In support of the president of the United States on a very important issue... Coke in Mexico is way better than Coke in the US, there's no doubt about it.\" Coca-Cola in the UK and other European nations is mostly sweetened with beet sugar but some cane sugar is also used, the company said in 2011. Is sugar-switch a 'MAHA' move? The Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative has pushed food companies to alter their formulations to remove ingredients such as artificial dyes. A report by the MAHA Commission, a panel convened by Trump and tasked with identifying the root causes of chronic disease, has earlier said substantial consumption of high-fructose corn syrup could play a role in childhood obesity and other conditions. However, while taste preferences may differ, the health impact of cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is reported to be essentially the same. Mr Kennedy has been critical of the amount of sugar consumed in the American diet and has said that updated dietary guidelines released this summer will advise Americans to eat \"whole food\".

During the same year he wrote on Twitter, now called X, that the \"Coca Cola company is not happy with me - that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage\". More than a decade later in January this year, Mr Quincey travelled to Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and presented him with a custom bottle commemorating his upcoming inauguration."

        "Content": "London and the UK's leading status in the global financial system is \"fragile\", the boss of Goldman Sachs has warned, as the government grapples with a tough economy. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the prime minister, David Solomon - chairman and chief executive of the huge US investment bank - told Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost's The Master Investor Podcast of several concerns related to tax and regulation. He urged the government not to push people and business away through poor policy that would damage its primary aim of securing improved economic growth, arguing that European rivals were currently proving more attractive. Money latest: Mortgage shake-up to save 'time and money' He said: \"The financial industry is still driven by talent and capital formation. And those things are much more mobile than they were 25 years ago. \"London continues to be an important financial centre. But because of Brexit, because of the way the world's evolving, the talent that was more centred here is more mobile. \"We as a firm have many more people on the continent. Policy matters, incentives matter. \n                  Government borrowing soars to second-highest level on record\n                 \n                  The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bind\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \"I'm encouraged by some of what the current government is talking about in terms of supporting business and trying to support a more growth oriented agenda. \"But if you don't set a policy that keeps talent here, that encourages capital formation here, I think over time you risk that.\" He had a stark warning about the recent reversal of the \"Non Dom\" tax policy, which occurred across both the prior Conservative government and the current Labour government, which has played a part in some senior Goldman partners relocating away from London.  Richard Gnodde, one of the bank's vice-chairs, left for Milan earlier this year. \"Incentives matter if you create tax policy or incentives that push people away, you harm your economy,\" Mr Solomon continued. \"If you go back, you know, ten years ago, I think we probably had 80 people in Paris. You know, we have 400 people in Paris now... And so in Goldman Sachs today, if you're in Europe, you can live in London, you can live in Paris, you can live in Germany, in Frankfurt or Munich, you can live in Italy, you can live in Switzerland. \"And we've got, you know, real offices. You just have to recognise talent is more mobile.\" Goldman is understood to have about 6,000 employees in the UK. Rachel Reeves is currently seeking ways to fill a black hole in the public finances and has refused to rule out wealth taxes at the next budget. Mr Solomon expressed sympathy for her as her tears in parliament earlier this month led to speculation about the pressure of the job. \"I have sympathy, I have empathy not just for the chancellor, but for anyone who's serving in one of these governments,\" he said, referring to the turbulent political landscape globally. Commenting on the chancellor's Mansion House speech last week, he added: \"The chancellor spoke here about regulation, she's talking about regulation not just for safety and soundness, but also for growth.  \"And now we have to see the action steps that actually follow through and encourage that.\" One area he was particularly keen to see follow through from her Mansion House speech was ringfencing - the post financial crisis regulation that requires banks to separate their retail activities from their investment banking activities. \"It's a place where the UK is an outlier, and by being an outlier, it prevents capital formation and growth. \"What's the justification for being an outlier? Why is this so difficult to change? It's hard to make a substantive policy argument that this is like a great policy for the UK. So why is it so hard to change?\" The Master Investor Podcast with Wilfred Frost is available across multiple podcast platforms "

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Government borrowing rose significantly more than expected last month as debt interest payments soared. Official figures show the cost of public services and interest payments on government debt rose faster than the increases in income tax and national insurance contributions. It means government borrowing reached the second-highest level in June since records began in 1993, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Money latest: Britons are eating out earlier - here's what's going on June's borrowing figures - £20.684bn - were second only to the highs seen in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many workers were furloughed. The figure was a surprise, nearly £4bn higher than anticipated by economists polled by Reuters. State borrowing - the difference between income from things like taxes and expenditure on the likes of public services - was more than £6bn higher than the same month last year. Read more:The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bindThe 'mad' situation blamed for slowing building projects Pushing the borrowing figure up was the high cost of interest payments, which was the second-highest June figure since those records began in 1997. Only June 2022 saw higher spending on government debt. News of the sum pushed yields - the risk premium demanded by investors to hold UK government bonds - up. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote: \"Higher than expected government borrowing pushed up UK gilt yields and pulled down the UK stock market. \"10-year gilt yields briefly nudged up to 4.645%, which is the market's way of saying it isn't impressed with the state of public finances.\" But despite the latest rise, borrowing this year is in line with the March forecast from the independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), though it's the second month in a row borrowing was above its projections. It's bad news for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has vowed to bring down government debt and balance the budget by 2030 as part of her self-imposed fiscal rules. She's expected to increase taxes to meet the gap between spending and tax revenue. The pressure is such that analysts from economic research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"Autumn tax hikes are likely and will probably be backloaded.\"  Rob Wood, its chief UK economist, estimated the size of the gap between government expenditure and income has grown. \"All told, we estimate that the chancellor's £9.9bn of headroom has turned into a £13bn hole, meaning that Ms Reeves would need to raise taxes or cut spending by a little over £20bn in the autumn budget to restore her slim margin of headroom,\" he said. \"We expect 'sin tax' and duty hikes, freezing income tax thresholds for an extra year in 2029 and a pensions tax raid - reinstating the lifetime limit on pension pots and cutting relief - to fill most of the hole.\" Taxes on goods such as alcohol and tobacco are classed as sin taxes. Darren Jones, Ms Reeves's deputy as the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"We are committed to tough fiscal rules, so we do not borrow for day-to-day spending and get debt down as a share of our economy.\" \"This commitment to economic stability means we can get on with investing in Britain's renewal.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Unresolved talks between India's richest family and the county cricket club which hosts the Oval Invincibles Hundred team are threatening to delay the delivery of a vast windfall for the sport. Sky News has learnt that RISE Worldwide - a subsidiary of the Ambani family's vast conglomerate, Reliance Industries - and Surrey County Cricket Club have yet to agree on several key issues relating to the sale of a 49% stake in one of the competition's most lucrative franchises. Cricket insiders said on Tuesday that the name under which the team would play upon completion of the deal was among the outstanding issues. Money latest: Economists issue warning as government borrowing soars Reliance owns the Indian Premier League's Mumbai Indians, as well as teams in South Africa, the UAE and the US. One source said that talks between RISE Worldwide and Surrey were not at a complete impasse but could still take time to resolve, even as English cricket's governing body is keen to announce that a £520m windfall for the sport had been finalised. The Indian billionaires agreed to pay roughly £60m for a 49% stake in the Oval Invincibles, with Surrey CCC retaining ownership of the remaining 51%. \n                  Goldman Sachs boss sounds warning to Reeves on tax and regulation\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'Sin taxes' and pension raid on way, Britons warned\n                 \n                  Government borrowing soars to second-highest level on record\n                 In a statement issued at the time the deal was struck, Akash Ambani said: \"We are glad to be part of Oval Invincibles-the most successful team in The Hundred-and welcome them into the Mumbai Indians family. \"England, with its rich cricketing culture, has always been special to the game. \"To have the iconic Oval, which has witnessed some of cricket's greatest moments, as our home venue is truly special. \"We look forward to collaborating with like-minded partners, Surrey CCC, who share our passion and ethos for the sport.\" On Tuesday, sources indicated that the remaining issues between the Indian investors and Surrey CCC could be resolved imminently. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been waiting for investors in the eight Hundred franchises to sign participation agreements for several months following an auction in February which valued the participating teams at just over £975m. The proceeds of its stake sales will be distributed to all of English cricket's professional counties as well as to the grassroots game. The windfalls are being seen as a lifeline for many cash-strapped counties which have been struggling under significant debt piles for many years. Each group of investors in the Hundred - where host counties include Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire - has been asked to sign a venue hire agreement and shareholder agreement with the owner of the venue at which their team plays. Sources said that RISE Worldwide had yet to formally sign these two contracts with Surrey CCC. Oli Slipper, Surrey CCC's chair, said in February: \"We said at the outset that we wanted the best partner to ensure that Surrey continue to lead the way in English cricket and in Mumbai Indians that is what we have got. \"They share our passion for cricket, they own the biggest and most successful team in the IPL, the Mumbai Indians, and we believe this partnership will bring continued success to both Surrey CCC and our Hundred team. \"Beyond cricket, the huge success of RIL's global business will help Surrey to thrive off the field too.\" The most valuable Hundred sale saw a group of technology tycoons, including executives from Google and Microsoft, paying about £145m for a minority stake in Lord's-based London Spirit. A majority of the new investors in the Hundred have now agreed to revised terms with the ECB, after negotiations which will result in the host venues retaining control of their teams' intellectual property rights. Investors will also hold an effective veto over future expansion of the Hundred, while the ECB will be barred from launching any other short-form professional version of the sport while the Hundred remains operational. Some details relating to future broadcast rights have yet to be completely finalised. Surrey CCC and the ECB declined to comment, while RISE Worldwide could not be reached for comment."

        "Content": "The government has given the final go-ahead for a £38bn nuclear power plant in eastern England. The Sizewell C project in Suffolk will be jointly funded by Canadian pension fund La Caisse, UK energy firm Centrica and Amber Infrastructure. The Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) said Sizewell C will deliver clean power for the equivalent of six million homes, as well as support 10,000 jobs and create 1,500 apprenticeships once it is operational, which is expected to be in the 2030s. The government will be the largest shareholder in the project with a 44.9% stake. La Caisse will hold a 20% stake, Centrica 15% and Amber Infrastructure will take an initial 7.6%. Earlier this month, French energy giant EDF announced it was taking a 12.5% stake, lower than its previously stated 16.2% ownership. Sizewell C was initially proposed by EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group in the early 2010s, but in 2022 the Conservative government bought the Chinese company out. The cost of construction was forecast to be around £20bn by EDF five years ago. DESNZ said the cost is around 20% cheaper than the development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"It is time to do big things and build big projects in this country again - and today we announce an investment that will provide clean, homegrown power to millions of homes for generations to come. \"This government is making the investment needed to deliver a new golden age of nuclear, so we can end delays and free us from the ravages of the global fossil fuel markets to bring bills down for good.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"La Caisse, Centrica and Amber's multibillion-pound investment is a powerful endorsement of the UK as the best place to do business and as a global hub for nuclear energy. \"Delivering next generation, publicly owned clean power is vital to our energy security and growth, which is why we backed Sizewell C.\" Alison Downes of campaign group Stop Sizewell C said: \"This much-delayed final investment decision has only crawled over the line thanks to guarantees that the public purse, not private investors, will carry the can for the inevitable cost overruns. \"Even so, UK households will soon be hit with a new Sizewell C construction tax on their energy bills. It is astounding that it is only now, as contracts are being signed, that the government has confessed that Sizewell C's cost has almost doubled to an eye-watering £38bn - a figure that will only go up. Given that ministers claimed not to recognise the cost was close to £40bn is there any wonder there is so little trust in this project?\" The government considers nuclear power to be an increasingly important energy source as it seeks to decarbonise Britain's energy grid by 2030. The last time Britain completed a nuclear plant was the Sizewell B plant in 1987."

        "Content": "London and the UK's leading status in the global financial system is \"fragile\", the boss of Goldman Sachs has warned, as the government grapples with a tough economy. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the prime minister, David Solomon - chairman and chief executive of the huge US investment bank - told Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost's The Master Investor Podcast of several concerns related to tax and regulation. He urged the government not to push people and business away through poor policy that would damage its primary aim of securing improved economic growth, arguing that European rivals were currently proving more attractive. Money latest: Mortgage shake-up to save 'time and money' He said: \"The financial industry is still driven by talent and capital formation. And those things are much more mobile than they were 25 years ago. \"London continues to be an important financial centre. But because of Brexit, because of the way the world's evolving, the talent that was more centred here is more mobile. \"We as a firm have many more people on the continent. Policy matters, incentives matter. \n                  Government borrowing soars to second-highest level on record\n                 \n                  The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bind\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \"I'm encouraged by some of what the current government is talking about in terms of supporting business and trying to support a more growth oriented agenda. \"But if you don't set a policy that keeps talent here, that encourages capital formation here, I think over time you risk that.\" He had a stark warning about the recent reversal of the \"Non Dom\" tax policy, which occurred across both the prior Conservative government and the current Labour government, which has played a part in some senior Goldman partners relocating away from London.  Richard Gnodde, one of the bank's vice-chairs, left for Milan earlier this year. \"Incentives matter if you create tax policy or incentives that push people away, you harm your economy,\" Mr Solomon continued. \"If you go back, you know, ten years ago, I think we probably had 80 people in Paris. You know, we have 400 people in Paris now... And so in Goldman Sachs today, if you're in Europe, you can live in London, you can live in Paris, you can live in Germany, in Frankfurt or Munich, you can live in Italy, you can live in Switzerland. \"And we've got, you know, real offices. You just have to recognise talent is more mobile.\" Goldman is understood to have about 6,000 employees in the UK. Rachel Reeves is currently seeking ways to fill a black hole in the public finances and has refused to rule out wealth taxes at the next budget. Mr Solomon expressed sympathy for her as her tears in parliament earlier this month led to speculation about the pressure of the job. \"I have sympathy, I have empathy not just for the chancellor, but for anyone who's serving in one of these governments,\" he said, referring to the turbulent political landscape globally. Commenting on the chancellor's Mansion House speech last week, he added: \"The chancellor spoke here about regulation, she's talking about regulation not just for safety and soundness, but also for growth.  \"And now we have to see the action steps that actually follow through and encourage that.\" One area he was particularly keen to see follow through from her Mansion House speech was ringfencing - the post financial crisis regulation that requires banks to separate their retail activities from their investment banking activities. \"It's a place where the UK is an outlier, and by being an outlier, it prevents capital formation and growth. \"What's the justification for being an outlier? Why is this so difficult to change? It's hard to make a substantive policy argument that this is like a great policy for the UK. So why is it so hard to change?\" The Master Investor Podcast with Wilfred Frost is available across multiple podcast platforms "

According to documents handed over to the National Archives, Downing Street officials advised Sir Tony to repay more than £7,600 for items purchased from designers Nicole Farhi and Paul Smith. The discounts were negotiated by Mrs Blair's style adviser and lifestyle coach Carole Caplin. She claimed she had secured discounts of up to 60% on the designer items as she bought them wholesale, but officials were concerned that the large discounts would not be available to ordinary members of the public. The prime minister and Mrs Blair spent £8,021.50 between July 2001 to December 2002 with Ms Farhi alone, when the retail price would have been £20,855.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Government borrowing rose significantly more than expected last month as debt interest payments soared. Official figures show the cost of public services and interest payments on government debt rose faster than the increases in income tax and national insurance contributions. It means government borrowing reached the second-highest level in June since records began in 1993, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Money latest: Britons are eating out earlier - here's what's going on June's borrowing figures - £20.684bn - were second only to the highs seen in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many workers were furloughed. The figure was a surprise, nearly £4bn higher than anticipated by economists polled by Reuters. State borrowing - the difference between income from things like taxes and expenditure on the likes of public services - was more than £6bn higher than the same month last year. Read more:The wealth tax options Reeves could take to ease her fiscal bindThe 'mad' situation blamed for slowing building projects Pushing the borrowing figure up was the high cost of interest payments, which was the second-highest June figure since those records began in 1997. Only June 2022 saw higher spending on government debt. News of the sum pushed yields - the risk premium demanded by investors to hold UK government bonds - up. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote: \"Higher than expected government borrowing pushed up UK gilt yields and pulled down the UK stock market. \"10-year gilt yields briefly nudged up to 4.645%, which is the market's way of saying it isn't impressed with the state of public finances.\" But despite the latest rise, borrowing this year is in line with the March forecast from the independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), though it's the second month in a row borrowing was above its projections. It's bad news for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has vowed to bring down government debt and balance the budget by 2030 as part of her self-imposed fiscal rules. She's expected to increase taxes to meet the gap between spending and tax revenue. The pressure is such that analysts from economic research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \"Autumn tax hikes are likely and will probably be backloaded.\"  Rob Wood, its chief UK economist, estimated the size of the gap between government expenditure and income has grown. \"All told, we estimate that the chancellor's £9.9bn of headroom has turned into a £13bn hole, meaning that Ms Reeves would need to raise taxes or cut spending by a little over £20bn in the autumn budget to restore her slim margin of headroom,\" he said. \"We expect 'sin tax' and duty hikes, freezing income tax thresholds for an extra year in 2029 and a pensions tax raid - reinstating the lifetime limit on pension pots and cutting relief - to fill most of the hole.\" Taxes on goods such as alcohol and tobacco are classed as sin taxes.

        "Content": "The government has given the final go-ahead for a £38bn nuclear power plant in eastern England. The Sizewell C project in Suffolk will be jointly funded by Canadian pension fund La Caisse, UK energy firm Centrica and Amber Infrastructure. The Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) said Sizewell C will deliver clean power for the equivalent of six million homes, as well as support 10,000 jobs and create 1,500 apprenticeships once it is operational, which is expected to be in the 2030s. The government will be the largest shareholder in the project with a 44.9% stake. La Caisse will hold a 20% stake, Centrica 15% and Amber Infrastructure will take an initial 7.6%. Earlier this month, French energy giant EDF announced it was taking a 12.5% stake, lower than its previously stated 16.2% ownership. Sizewell C was initially proposed by EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group in the early 2010s, but in 2022 the Conservative government bought the Chinese company out. The cost of construction was forecast to be around £20bn by EDF five years ago. DESNZ said the cost is around 20% cheaper than the development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"It is time to do big things and build big projects in this country again - and today we announce an investment that will provide clean, homegrown power to millions of homes for generations to come. \"This government is making the investment needed to deliver a new golden age of nuclear, so we can end delays and free us from the ravages of the global fossil fuel markets to bring bills down for good.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"La Caisse, Centrica and Amber's multibillion-pound investment is a powerful endorsement of the UK as the best place to do business and as a global hub for nuclear energy. \"Delivering next generation, publicly owned clean power is vital to our energy security and growth, which is why we backed Sizewell C.\" Alison Downes of campaign group Stop Sizewell C said: \"This much-delayed final investment decision has only crawled over the line thanks to guarantees that the public purse, not private investors, will carry the can for the inevitable cost overruns. \"Even so, UK households will soon be hit with a new Sizewell C construction tax on their energy bills. It is astounding that it is only now, as contracts are being signed, that the government has confessed that Sizewell C's cost has almost doubled to an eye-watering £38bn - a figure that will only go up. Given that ministers claimed not to recognise the cost was close to £40bn is there any wonder there is so little trust in this project?\" The government considers nuclear power to be an increasingly important energy source as it seeks to decarbonise Britain's energy grid by 2030. The last time Britain completed a nuclear plant was the Sizewell B plant in 1987."

        "Content": "Kemi Badenoch has reshuffled her shadow cabinet today - with former foreign secretary Sir James Cleverly returning to the Conservative frontbench. It is the first reorganisation of her shadow cabinet since she became Conservative leader - and leader of the opposition - in November 2024. Politics latest: Another Tory defects to Reform Sky News understands Sir James will become shadow secretary for housing, communities and local government, opposite Angela Rayner, who is also deputy prime minister. Sir James will not be made shadow deputy PM, with Ms Badenoch not filling that role. However, Alex Burghart informally deputises for her. It is understood Sir James will focus on \"bread and butter\" Conservative causes such as keeping council tax low and raising house building targets. The senior Tory served as foreign and home secretary and many thought he would beat Ms Badenoch to the leadership last year, but he failed to make the final two and was not in her initial shadow cabinet after committing himself to the backbenches. Last week, asked if he still had leadership ambitions, Sir James said: \"I've forced a discipline on myself which is not to jump at something.\" Sir James takes over the role from Kevin Hollinrake, who has been appointed Conservative Party chair and was a businessman before entering parliament. Earlier on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch announced Ed Argar was stepping down as shadow health secretary following a recent health scare and another last year, which he said \"has continued to impact me\". In his resignation letter, Mr Argar said he has listened to his doctors and family and concluded he needed to lighten his workload to complete his recovery and \"fully restore my health\" - and hopes he can be on the frontbench again. Mr Argar will be replaced by Stuart Andrew, who was shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary and worked with care homes before becoming an MP. Conservative chair Nigel Huddleston will take over Mr Andrew's brief. As Reform welcomed another Tory defector to the party, leader Nigel Farage said the reshuffle was a non-entity and believes the Conservatives \"will cease to be a national party\" after the May local elections next year. Welsh Senedd member Laura Anne Jones defected to Reform at midday on Tuesday, moments before details of the reshuffle got out."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n        New rules for the internet will start being enforced on Friday, which may well change how you browse. Ofcom's Children's Codes, a set of regulations designed to protect young people online, will mean sites hosting adult content like pornography will need to have \"highly effective\" age verification in place. Social media sites will need to make sure their algorithms aren't pushing harmful content to young people and if their terms and conditions say those kinds of posts aren't allowed, the sites will have to make sure their own rules are properly enforced. So what's going to change? The biggest change you'll notice straight away is around age verification. Many adult sites currently have simple boxes for users to tick and say they're over 18 - that's no longer good enough, according to Ofcom. Instead, they'll have to properly verify their users' ages before allowing them to see adult content. So on Friday, users visiting adult websites should be presented with a screen that offers them a few different ways to verify their age. That could be by checking credit card details, checking ID or by using AI facial age estimation. This is different to AI facial recognition; whereas facial recognition \"recognises\" a face by comparing it to an ID or to a database, facial age estimation doesn't attempt to identify the individual. Instead, it judges faces based on the positions of their features and other ageing traits to estimate how old a user is. \"Facial age estimation is effectively taking a selfie in front of your mobile phone or your laptop, and we capture that image [...] on behalf of the business,\" Robin Tombs, the chief executive of age estimation company Yoti, told Sky News. \"[The AI] checks 'liveness' to ensure it isn't a photo of somebody older and then estimates the age from that selfie, and then returns an over-18 or under-18 message to the business. \"It then deletes the image.\" Every company with adult content on its site is obliged to put these rules into place and Ofcom is willing to \"be tough\" with non-compliers, according to Jessica Smith, the regulator's online safety principal. It can impose fines of up to £18m or 10% of revenue and, in very serious cases, stop sites operating in the UK.  Will it actually make a difference? Plenty of people hope so - the government, Ofcom, children's groups and campaigners are all banking on these new rules to change children's experience on the internet. \"We've had unrestricted access to this content for a generation of children which has had a lot of impacts,\" Ms Smith told Sky News. \"It is widely accepted that you have to check your age before you can drink alcohol, and so this is a kind of social change as well as a technical one. \"It's about what we, as a society, say is normal for our online experiences. And I think these protections will be important for children in all walks of life.\" Read more from science, climate and tech:Could your summer holiday be greener?Watchdog must fine social media firms slow to remove racismThe huge cost of Musk's fallout with Trump revealed This isn't necessarily going to stop determined young people from seeking out adult content, according to Ms Smith, but it should stop inappropriate posts from popping up unexpectedly on young people's feeds. \"The most common way that children come across pornography, at least at first, is that they come across it accidentally,\" she told Sky News. \"So they're not seeking out, they are just scrolling through a social media service and then they'll see something that they don't want to see. And that can be really shocking and disturbing for them. \"But it also shows them what content is out there and introduces them to a new type of online content.\" Some websites and apps have already announced they'll implement the changes, including the UK's biggest pornography site PornHub, social media sites Discord and Reddit, and dating app Grindr. Reddit is already enforcing age verification on content like self-harm, suicide and pornography."

Osbourne's death on Tuesday morning was announced in a statement, which said he died surrounded by his family.

Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, wrote: \"I am so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\" Born John Michael Osbourne on 3 December 1948 in Aston, Birmingham, he became known as the godfather of heavy metal. The self-styled Prince of Darkness pioneered the music genre with Black Sabbath before going on to have huge success in his own right. He was famous for hits including Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Crazy Train and Changes, both with the band and as a solo star. Legendary American heavy metal band Metallica shared an image of them with Osbourne from 1986 along with an emoji of a broken heart. Posting on Instagram, Sir Rod Stewart said: \"Sleep well, my friend. I'll see you up there - later rather than sooner.\" Queen guitarist Sir Brian May said he was \"grateful I was able to have a few quiet words\" with Osbourne after his farewell show at Villa Park three weeks ago. He said the world will miss the singer's \"unique presence and fearless talent\"."

It was an exit on his own terms by heavy metal's biggest character, with a supporting line-up of hard rock luminaries including Slayer, Metallica and Guns'n'Roses, all inspired by his music. With Black Sabbath, Osbourne was at the forefront of heavy metal. As Ozzy, he was one of the biggest rock stars in the world. Nowhere was this more evident than at the Back To The Beginning in his home city, where 40,000 fans gathered to see the show billed as his \"final bow\".  \"Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica,\" frontman James Hetfield told the crowd in Birmingham. It was a sentiment echoed by many of the other acts who performed on stage. Announced by his wife Sharon earlier this year, the show was a chance for the performer to reunite with Black Sabbath and say thank you and farewell to fans after years of health problems, including Parkinson's disease, which had forced him to cancel recent tour shows. Other celebrities, from Sir Elton John to Dolly Parton, sent video messages of support. Fans knew it would be his last performance, but could not have known his death, at the age of 76, would come so soon. It was a truly metal goodbye. 'I think there's a wild man in everybody' John Michael Osbourne was born in Solihull in December 1948 and grew up in the Aston area of the West Midlands city. As a teenager, he was bullied at school. Drink and drugs later became a way to escape his fears, he said in interviews, and after leaving school at 15, he worked several jobs, including labouring and in an abattoir. It was hearing The Beatles, he said, that made him want to be a musician. \"I think there's a wild man in everybody,\" he says in a resurfaced interview clip. \"Ozzy Osbourne and John Osbourne is two different people. John Osbourne is talking to you now.\" His eyes widen a little manically, he grins, the voice cranks up. \"But if you want to be Ozzy Osbourne, it's like... it just takes over you.\" In 1967, he was recruited to the band that two years later would become Black Sabbath, inspired by a film of the same title. This was a line-up of four working-class schoolfriends - Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler, alongside Ozzy - who twisted heavy blues into something darker, creating a sound and otherworldly image that felt new, exciting and rebellious. A self-titled debut album was released in 1970 and made the Top 10 in the UK. The follow-up, Paranoid, released just seven months later, topped the charts after the single of the same name became their big breakthrough. The album also included the unforgettable Iron Man and the anti-war protest song War Pigs - its unmistakeable riff inspiring the Arctic Monkeys' 2014 single, Arabella. Black Sabbath went on to release six more albums with Osbourne at the helm before he was fired in 1979 due to his drinking and substance use, something he claimed was no better or worse than other members at the time. In 1980, he returned with his debut solo album, Blizzard Of Oz, and the lead single Crazy Train. As a solo artist, he went on to release 13 studio albums - the last being Patient Number 9, in 2022 - and had hits with songs including Mr Crowley, Diary Of A Madman, No More Tears, Bark At The Moon and Shot In The Dark. His first UK number one was a re-recording of the Black Sabbath ballad Changes, as a duet with his daughter, Kelly, in 2003, and his collaborations over the years included everyone from Alice Cooper (Hey Stoopid in 1991) and Post Malone (Take What You Want in 2019) to, in a somewhat unusual move, Hollywood star Kim Basinger for a re-recording of the dance hit Shake Your Head by Was (Not Was) in 1992. With Black Sabbath and as a solo star, he is estimated to have sold 100 million records throughout his career - for context, this is reportedly on a par with Sir Paul McCartney's solo sales - so the numbers speak for themselves. Biting the bat Osbourne was also a huge personality and played up to his hellraising image - the Prince of Darkness. The most famous Ozzy story goes like this. The singer was on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, 1982, when the bat appeared. He assumed it was a toy. So, like any good hellraiser would do, he bit its head off. For more than 40 years, he found himself jokily fielding questions about bats. What do they taste like? (Salty). What happened afterwards? (Headline news, painful rabies shots). Do you have any pets? (Yes. They're all dead).\"I get a lot of weird people at my concerts,\" he told David Letterman in 1982, of how the animal came to appear in front of him. \"It's rock 'n' roll, y'know\". He was sometimes irritated by the bat connection. But he also played up to the image, recounting the story in interviews, offering plush bat toys among his merch, and appearing as himself, biting a bat, in the 2000 Adam Sandler comedy Little Nicky, about the son of Satan. Known for catapulting raw meat at fans during gigs, there were plenty of other tales of darkness and debauchery. Osbourne's wild persona and on-stage theatrics always went hand-in-hand with the music. From Prince of Darkness to reality TV He was famously managed by his wife, Sharon, whom he first met when her dad, Don Arden, was managing Black Sabbath. As well as the music, Sharon and Ozzy together founded the Ozzfest festival tours in 1996 - and in 2002 came his second act. It's hard to imagine it now, but before the perfectly coiffed Kardashians it was a scruffy 50-something rocker from Birmingham and his family who ruled the Hollywood reality TV scene. As with his music, he was a pioneer - this time round of a new era of addictive viewing. The Osbournes followed the lives of Ozzy and Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack (their eldest daughter, Aimee, famously had nothing to do with the show), and the family fallouts and sunny California culture clash proved to be a ratings winner. The MTV series catapulted the metal star to global mainstream celebrity heights. His marriage to Sharon was tumultuous but the pair always stayed together, and they renewed their wedding vows in 2017. Sharon was the driving force behind Ozzy's successes, to him eventually getting clean, and behind his farewell show. Despite weathering the storm of drink and drug use, Osbourne's air of indestructibility was challenged when a quad bike accident left him with a broken collar bone and ribs, as well as short-term memory loss, in 2003. The 2020 documentary Biography: The Nine Lives Of Ozzy Osbourne, had summed up with its title the performer's seeming ability to defy the odds. However, the health problems started to mount up. Scheduled tours were postponed, and in 2023 he told fans holding on to tickets that he had come to the realisation he was \"not physically capable\" of dealing with life on the road. But there was one gig he couldn't miss - a surprise appearance to close the Commonwealth Games in his home city in 2022, just weeks after undergoing surgery. Now, fans will remember the shows they did get to see, the music that ushered in a new genre - and especially his most recent gig, which was said to have raised around £140m for charities. Just a few days afterwards, his new memoir, Last Rites, was announced. It will be released in October. During his career, Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and the US Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame - twice for both, with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist. \"Countless artists from many genres have credited Ozzy as a major influence, including Metallica, Lita Ford, Rage Against The Machine, and Busta Rhymes,\" reads his US citation. \"With his longevity, impact, and iconic persona, Ozzy Osbourne is a phenomenon unlike any other.\" He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame - as well as in Birmingham's Broad Street - an Ivor Novello, and five Grammy wins from 12 nominations. But other honours, such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend, also give a sense of how much his personality played a part in why he is so beloved by fans and critics alike. In the Nine Lives documentary, daughter Kelly describes him as \"the most irresistible mad man you will ever meet in your life\". Osbourne's was an unlikely journey from Birmingham to LA. He was a working-class hero of heavy metal, a reality TV favourite - forever the Prince of Darkness. \"People say to me, if you could do it all again, knowing what you know now, would you change anything?\" he once said. \"I'm like, f*** no... If I'd done normal, sensible things, I wouldn't be Ozzy.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Being in the crowd for Ozzy Osbourne's Back To The Beginning show, I felt incredibly privileged to watch his final performance. Like the 42,000 fans who packed Villa Park in Birmingham to see his Black Sabbath reunion on 5 July, I knew this was a goodbye - but had no idea the farewell would come so soon. Osbourne sang from a throne, encrusted with skulls, of course. But despite the seated performance, his voice carried across Villa Park and he was more than capable of giving the crowd a few flickers of the Prince of Darkness - rising up on to the stage as the ominous O Fortuna soundtracked a montage of footage from his career. \"Let the madness begin!\" he cried as he started the show. Singing fan favourites including Mr Crowley and Crazy Train, and Iron Man and Paranoid with Black Sabbath, he conducted the crowd to sing \"louder, louder\", and \"go f****** crazy\".

It was a sentiment echoed by many other artists on stage. In the crowd, the love and gratitude was also palpable. Ben Sutton, 24, from Chester, told us beforehand: \"I feel like it's important - we're of the younger generation - for us to see some of the heritage and history of the genre we love, metal in general. It's such an honour to say goodbye to him.\" Steve Townson, from Lincolnshire, said: \"I saw him the first time round and the fact that he's still going is incredible, isn't it? I was there at the start, I'm happy to be here at the end.\" But perhaps Anthrax's Scott Ian summed it up best. \"We're not here to say goodbye. We're just here to say thank you.\" Read more entertainment news:Christina Aguilera on bringing Burlesque to the stageHarry Potter star talks about JK Rowling's trans stance It's the kind of show that for many others might well have been organised with the bands he loved following his death. But Ozzy's determination to perform one final time, despite his health problems - and with his wife Sharon behind him every step of the way, making sure it happened - meant he got to star and conduct his own tribute. A truly heavy metal farewell."

        "Content": "Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes has told Sky News she believes JK Rowling is \"wrong about some things\" when it comes to her stance on trans issues - but says it is also wrong for the author to be left out of \"celebrations\" for her famous books. Margolyes, who played Professor Sprout in the film series, said it was \"fair enough\" to criticise Rowling, who has been outspoken in her gender critical views. However, the 84-year-old actress said the backlash against the writer had become \"unkind\", and highlighted her absence from certain celebrations of the Harry Potter story. In 2022, Rowling did not appear in a 25th anniversary TV reunion featuring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who starred in all of the films. All three stars have spoken out in support of the trans community. Speaking to Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost, Margolyes said: \"I think everybody can be criticised, I think that's fair enough, but everybody's so horrid and nasty and unkind and I don't like that. \"I don't want people to be unkind about trans... I mean, I'm a gay woman myself and you have to just put up with it. I don't know if [Rowling's] been badly treated but I think it was wrong that she wasn't invited to the celebrations for Harry Potter. You know, she created the whole thing. \"She may be wrong about some things. And women's bodies are tremendously important - I love my body, even though it's fat and misshapen, and I wouldn't be a man for anything. But trans - who cares? Let's be kind, let's be inclusive. I think there's an awful lot of nonsense talked about it.\" Between 1997 and 2007, Rowling published seven Harry Potter books - which were turned into eight films between 2001 and 2011. The movies generated more than $7.7bn at the global box office. The author will be involved in the upcoming Harry Potter series. Margolyes said she does not know Rowling and has never met her, but praised her work and highlighted her series of crime novels, written under the pen name Robert Galbraith. \"I salute her as a very great writer and I think I like the detective stories best,\" she told Frost.

The museum is based at 48 Doughty Street, central London, where Dickens lived for two years and wrote works including Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist. \"A life was lived here,\" she said. \"A great writer, and he belongs to all of us. And that's why I want people to come to this museum and enjoy it.\" During the interview, Margolyes also made her thoughts clear on artificial intelligence - an issue that many creatives are concerned about. \"I loathe AI and everything connected with it,\" she said. \"That is not about everybody sharing, it's about people stealing and lying, which is what goes on a great deal these days. No, AI is a very bad thing and I won't have anything to do with it - and I'm pretty sure that Mr Dickens would not like it either.\""

        "Content": " Christina Aguilera has told Sky News it is \"magical\" to see her hit film Burlesque being brought to London's West End - and also opened up about her rise to fame in the late 1990s. The US star topped the US and UK charts with Genie In A Bottle in 1999, before finding an even bigger audience with her acclaimed album Stripped and hits including Dirrty, Beautiful and Fighter in the early 2000s. In 2010, she starred in Burlesque alongside Cher, Julianne Hough and Stanley Tucci, and now, 15 years later, is a producer for the stage version of the show alongside the film's original director and writer, Steven Antin. Speaking ahead of the show's gala night, Aguilera told Sky News presenter Leah Boleto she has enjoyed taking a backseat and seeing the fresh interpretation of her character - a small-town girl turned into a star. \"It's just so beautiful to see the talent that's on this stage and to absorb it and appreciate the fresh takes on things,\" she said. \"I love actually taking a step back and a backseat… it's beautiful to see the reinvention. \"When you're in it, you focus on the choreography, all these different elements, that being able to take a backseat and being more of a visionary of the bigger picture, it's really a special thing.\" Aguilera said she had been \"blown away\" by Jess Folley, who plays her character Ali in the show, and has fully embraced the \"powerhouse vocals\" as well as the vulnerability needed for the role. \"She just is doing such a magnificent, magnificent job and likewise inspires me as well,\" she said. Aguilera said she would love to see her film co-star Cher popping by to see the show in London. \"She's always welcome to grace us with her incredible, iconic presence. And I'm just so grateful that I had the time to be with her. I mean, looking back, it's just - did that even happen?\" Aguilera arrived on the scene at the same time as Britney Spears, at a time when young female pop stars were celebrated, sexualised and scrutinised. After the success of her debut album, she took a different direction with Stripped - embracing her sexuality and famously taking on a less girlish image with chaps, a nose stud and black streaks in her hair for the Dirrty video, and opening up about her life and emotions through songs such as Fighter and Beautiful. She also took on the patriarchy in Can't Hold Us Down, a duet with Lil' Kim, and performed on the hit cover of Lady Marmalade alongside Lil' Kim, Maya and Pink for Moulin Rouge! \"I always want to stay true to authenticity,\" she said. \"And for me, with that first album it was wonderful to get my foot in the door... \"It's important to me that I stepped out on my own and reflected all sides of me as a woman, embracing my sexuality and sensuality, and my body... Dirrty, I just loved those chaps and everything about that was just so fun and raw.\" Read more:Danny Dyer on Mr Bigstuff and OasisOpera scuffle after performer unfurls Palestinian flag So would she do it all again, then? Or would she prefer to be an artist starting out now? \"The '90s, it was a pretty special time in music. And it was a time when you could still like go to Virgin records or like wherever and look at the CDs, look at the packaging. And, you know, sometimes the authenticity is missed.\" However, the good thing about social media now is that it has given stars the means to tell their own stories, she adds. \"You have an opportunity now to really present yourself in ways that it's not just about the music, to become more the narrator in real time… this is what it is like, be your own voice rather than reading about yourself in an article.\" But still, she wouldn't swap. \"It has to stay where it was.\" Burlesque The Musical is showing at The Savoy theatre in London now"

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne has died aged 76, just weeks after reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates and performing a huge farewell concert for fans. In a statement, his family said: \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love.\" Latest: Tributes paid to Ozzy Osbourne As he performed from a throne on stage at Villa Park less than three weeks ago, Osbourne told 42,000 fans: \"You've no idea how I feel - thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" It was a gig put together with performances from some of his favourite acts, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, for the star's \"final bow\". Osbourne and his fellow original Black Sabbath members - Tony Iommi, Terence \"Geezer\" Butler and Bill Ward - reunited for the first time in 20 years and were the last to appear on stage for the Back To The Beginning concert on 5 July. Following his death, Metallica posted a photo on X of the band with Osbourne, along with a broken heart emoji. Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, wrote: \"I am so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\" Black Sabbath's account on X posted a photo of Osbourne from the gig with the caption: \"Ozzy Forever!\" And Ali Campbell, singer with Birmingham band UB40, wrote: \"Rest In Peace Ozzy. The Prince of Darkness. A true Birmingham legend. The undisputed king of heavy metal. You didn't just shape a culture, you defined it. You led from the front and never looked back. My thoughts are with Sharon and the entire Osbourne family during this time.\" Sir Elton John described his \"dear friend\" as a \"huge trailblazer\" who \"secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods\". \"He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met,\" the singer also wrote on Instagram. Born John Michael Osbourne on 3 December 1948 in Aston, Birmingham, he became known as the godfather of heavy metal. The self-styled Prince of Darkness pioneered the music genre with Black Sabbath before going on to have huge success in his own right. He was famous for hits including Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Crazy Train and Changes, both with the band and as a solo star. Black Sabbath's eponymous debut album in 1970 made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of tracks. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. The singer also found a different kind of fame thanks to noughties MTV reality show The Osbournes, which followed the Birmingham-raised star's somewhat chaotic life in Los Angeles with wife Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. And he was also known for the famous anecdotes of hellraising during his rock star heyday - most infamously, the tale of how he bit the head off a bat while on stage. Black Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir Into The Void. Osbourne re-emerged the next year as a solo artist with his album Blizzard of Ozz. In 1981, he released his second album Diary Of A Madman - both were hard rock classics that went multiplatinum. He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered other health problems in recent years, including complications from injuries sustained in a fall in 2019. After being forced to cancel tour shows, he made a one-off surprise appearance on stage in Birmingham to close the Commonwealth Games in 2022. The Villa Park gig was announced earlier this year by Sharon, who said he was determined to give fans the \"perfect farewell\". Read more entertainment news:Christina Aguilera on bringing Burlesque to the stageHarry Potter star talks about JK Rowling's trans stance During his career, Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and the US Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame - twice for both, with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist. He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame - as well as in Birmingham's Broad Street - an Ivor Novello, and five Grammy wins from 12 nominations. Plus, he received other honours such as the NME's Godlike Genius award, and Classic Rock's Living Legend prize, over the years. Osbourne leaves behind his wife, Sharon, and their children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack, as well his two older children, Jessica and Louis, from his first marriage to Thelma Riley, and grandchildren."
