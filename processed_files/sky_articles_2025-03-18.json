        "Content": " Two NASA astronauts have splashed down off the coast of Florida after spending more than nine months stuck in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams waved as they left their capsule - nearly an hour after it returned to Earth at about 6pm local time (10pm UK time). Dolphins were seen swimming nearby while work was under way to remove it from the water.  The astronauts' journey back from the International Space Station took 17 hours. Senior NASA administrator Joel Montalbano described the landing as \"beautiful\" - and said their 150 experiments and 900 hours of research will inform future moon missions. \"The crew's doing great... eventually they'll make their way back to Houston,\" NASA manager Steve Stich said - telling reporters they'll get some \"well-deserved time off\" with their families once debriefs are complete. They were only meant to be on the ISS for eight days when they blasted off from Earth on 5 June last year. They were testing out Boeing's long-awaited Starliner - a vessel designed to rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is currently used to ferry astronauts into space. But by the time they docked at the ISS, the Starliner had suffered major problems - with five helium leaks, five dead manoeuvring thrusters and a propellant valve that failed to close completely. It returned to Earth without them after it was decided Mr Wilmore, 62, and Ms Williams, 59, would be safer waiting in orbit. During their long wait in space, the two US Navy veterans completed spacewalks, experiments and even helped sort out the plumbing onboard the ISS. The astronauts repeatedly said they enjoyed the mission, with Ms Williams describing the space station as her \"happy place\". Swept up in NASA's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels. The SpaceX vehicle that has brought them home arrived at the space station in September carrying NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with two empty seats. The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at about 5.45pm local time on Tuesday. Using two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown. The astronauts will soon be flown to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before NASA flight surgeons allow them to go home to their families. Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.  Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?This is what happens to your health from being in space for so longCrew welcomed to ISS to replace stranded astronauts The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams - and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden had \"abandoned\" them for political reasons. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. Crew Dragon is America's only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams threw its development future into uncertainty. \"We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Mr Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe NASA's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics. \"That's what your nation's human spaceflight program's all about,\" he said. \"Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\""

        "Content": " Vladimir Putin has agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on energy infrastructure in Ukraine during a lengthy phone call with Donald Trump. The Russian and US presidents spoke for around an hour and a half as the Trump administration aims to bring about an end to the conflict which started after Moscow's forces carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin agreed to the limited ceasefire but stopped short of backing a broader 30-day pause in fighting that the White House is pushing for. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the call that he supports the US proposal to stop Kyiv's strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Mr Zelenskyy added that the hopes to speak to Mr Trump to find out \"what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians\" during his conversation with Mr Putin. He also said that future talks about Ukraine without Kyiv at the table will not bring results.

However, Mr Putin said during his call with Mr Trump on Tuesday that any long-term deal would require a complete halt to intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Mr Zelenskky said in an online briefing after the call that Ukraine's partners would never agree to such a move and that he hopes supplies will continue. He added that Moscow's demand was simply an example of Mr Putin attempting to weaken Ukraine.  US correspondent The outcome of this call will allow both side to claim a win. For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire.  He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict.  For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire (energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted) but he can still continue his war along the frontline. He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.\n This is a war all about territory. Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan. US hopes call marks first step towards peace The White House has said Mr Trump and Mr Putin agreed to a \"movement to peace\" it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the fighting. \"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,\" the White House added. Mr Putin welcomed Mr Trump's calls for the maritime ceasefire and \"agreed to begin negotiations to further work out specific details of such an agreement\", according to the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials had earlier proposed a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes and the release of prisoners at their meeting with the US delegation in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. Read more:What Sky's correspondents think about Trump-Putin callWhat would peace in Ukraine look like? Prisoner swaps and hockey matches The Kremlin also said after the call that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday. Moscow added that it will also hand over 23 badly wounded soldiers to Ukraine. Mr Zelenskyy responded by saying Russia could show it was serious about peace talks by freeing all prisoners. Meanwhile, Moscow said in its recap of the call that Mr Trump supported an idea from Mr Putin to organise ice hockey matches in the US between professional players from America and Russia. The White House's account of the conversation did not mention hockey. Shortly after the call, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: \"We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.\" Mr Zelenskyy remains sceptical that Mr Putin is ready for peace as Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine. Mr Putin last week said he agreed in principle with the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, but emphasised that Russia would seek guarantees that Ukraine would not use a break in hostilities to rearm and continue mobilisation. He has also demanded that Ukraine renounce joining the NATO military alliance, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit. Fears Washington favours Moscow The call between Mr Trump and Mr Putin is just the latest turn in a dramatically shifting relationship between the two superpowers. Mr Trump made bringing about a quick end to the conflict a top priority when he took office in January - straining ties with allies who want Mr Putin to pay a price for the invasion. Mr Trump, who has long shown admiration for Mr Putin, has blamed Ukraine for Russia's unprovoked invasion. European countries have continued to show support for Ukraine as Mr Trump has appeared to favour Moscow as he aims to secure an end to the war. Mr Zelenskyy said he spoke to German leader Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron following Tuesday's call between the US and Russian presidents. Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"We welcome the progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire and in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. \"This process must lead to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to ensure Russia can never launch an illegal invasion again.\" Shortly after the call, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv which were followed by explosions in the city. It comes after the AES Group private oil refinery was badly damaged after a shock Russian attack in the Kharkiv region on Monday. The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it."

        "Content": "By Dylan Donnelly and Claire Gilbody-Dickerson, news reporters   Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's overnight airstrikes on Gaza are \"just the beginning\", despite the United Nations condemning them as \"horrifying\". At least 413 people were killed and a further 562 were injured in the attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The airstrikes put an end to a fragile ceasefire between Hamas, the militant group ruling Gaza, and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had \"gone back to fighting with great might\" after Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it is holding following its attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Mr Netanyahu promised \"growing action against Hamas with greater intensity\" and reaffirmed his intention to carry on fighting until all hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed. The IDF has issued evacuation orders for a number of areas in Gaza, after the ceasefire had allowed for hundreds of thousands of displaced people to return to their homes across the enclave. Many of the dead in the latest strikes were children, according to Palestinian health ministry officials. The Hamas-run government media office called the attacks a \"blatant violation of all international and humanitarian conventions\". In a speech at the United Nations, the Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said \"we want peace\", adding that the choice facing member states was \"crystal clear\". He urged the General Assembly to \"act with us to make peace... make war not acceptable... and [for] ceasefire to prevail\". Brett Jonathan Miller, Israel's deputy permanent representative at the UN, said a return to fighting was \"a necessity\". The UK's ambassador to Israel, Simon Walters, said on X that Israel's attacks will neither help defeat Hamas nor bring hostages home and will only cause \"more death\". Read more:What happened to the ceasefire?Thousands of new tents near Gaza border area under Israeli evacuation order There are 59 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas - 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. For their release, Hamas wanted the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an end to hostilities as part of the second phase of the deal. Hamas, the militant group running Gaza and whose massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel 17 months ago sparked Israel's bombing of the enclave, has claimed it is \"working with mediators to curb the aggression\" seen on Tuesday. 'Tragedy on to tragedy' More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign since October 2023, Gazan health officials say. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but said more than half of the fatalities were women and children. A surgeon working in Gaza has described the \"utter carnage and destruction\" he witnessed on Tuesday morning during Israel's air attack. Dr Feroze Sidhwa is working at the Nasser Medical Complex in Deir Al Balah, where he said most of the people he has seen who were killed were women and children. \"I did six operations overnight,\" he told Sky News Breakfast presenter Wilfred Frost. \"Half of them were small children, probably six and below, I wasn't exactly sure. Most of them are going to die, unfortunately.\" He said this \"carnage\" is what should be expected \"when you drop bombs on tents\".\n\n UN High Commissioner Volker Turk said: \"I am horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza. \"This will add tragedy on to tragedy.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News the Trump administration was consulted by Israel about the airstrikes. Middle East correspondent The waves of airstrikes and tank fire throughout the night came as a surprise and brought an end to a ceasefire that lasted almost two months. Only a small circle of IDF military commanders were aware of the plans, so Hamas had no forewarning. Neither did the civilians of Gaza, who have started to slowly rebuild what they can of their lives following the devastating war. The IDF says it is targeting mid-ranking Hamas officials, although I've also seen pictures of dead and wounded children amongst the casualties. Talks to extend the ceasefire and release more hostages had been ongoing in recent days, but Hamas and Israel couldn't agree on the format of a continued truce. Israel had already cut off humanitarian deliveries into Gaza and threatened a resumption of the war if Hamas didn't change its position - they are now following through on that threat. Israeli intelligence will have spent the last seven weeks of ceasefire gathering information of living Hamas commanders - these airstrikes will be an attempt to take them out and put pressure on Hamas to agree the ceasefire deal that Israel, and Washington, wants. If they don't, the IDF has already drawn up plans for an extensive campaign, and ground operations will follow. They have the White House's backing. 'Extensive' strikes The IDF and Israel Security Agency Shin Bet said the \"extensive\" strikes were aimed at \"terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip\". A Palestinian source, who lives in central Gaza, told Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone \"we were sure that this war wouldn't end\" and added: \"I wish they (Israel) would open the Rafah border crossing (into Egypt). I wish to leave. I cannot take it anymore.\" It comes two months after a three-phase ceasefire deal was agreed by Hamas and Israel to pause the war. Over the six-week first phase, Hamas released 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and five Thai nationals, in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. But since the first phase officially concluded, both Israel and Hamas have failed to agree on how to progress with the second phase - which would see the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.  'A death sentence' Izzat al Risheq, a senior Hamas official, said Mr Netanyahu's decision to return to war amounts to a \"death sentence\" for the remaining hostages. Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure at home over his handling of the hostage crisis. Furthermore, his latest appearance at a long-running corruption trial was cancelled after the strikes, which resumed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. US Middle East envoy Mr Witkoff had proposed extending the first phase of the ceasefire through to the end of Ramadan and Passover or until 20 April, which Hamas rejected. At the start of March, Israel said it stopped all goods and supplies to Gaza after claiming Hamas was refusing to \"accept the Witkoff outline for continuing the talks, which Israel agreed to\". Five days later, Israel said it had cut off the electricity supply to Gaza."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @laurabundock\n Legal documents about Prince Harry's US visa application have been released - albeit with very heavy redactions. The released records show the judge concluded in September it wasn't in the public interest to disclose information about the Duke of Sussex's immigration status. He argued that Harry could be subject to \"harm in the form of harassment\" as well as \"unwanted contact\" from the media. So much of the text has been blacked out that there are still many unanswered questions, particularly about whether the prince admitted on his forms he'd taken drugs. One of the lawyers pushing for the release of information told Sky News they will keep pursuing the case and there will be more proceedings in the \"near future\". Samuel Dewey, attorney for the conservative thinktank The Heritage Foundation, said: \"It's always been a puzzle and we've always taken the view it may take some time to get answers... we will use this additional data to keep moving forward.\"  The six litigation files which were previously secret have been unsealed after a challenge by The Heritage Foundation. The thinktank submitted freedom of information requests to establish whether the Duke of Sussex received special dispensation with his visa application. It follows admissions in Harry's memoir Spare that he had taken drugs including cannabis, cocaine and psychedelics. The Heritage Foundation wanted to establish whether this was disclosed in his visa application and whether the US government had followed immigration laws. Listed as Exhibit 1, one of the files also states that the records contain \"very specific private and personal\" information, the release of which would be an invasion of personal privacy. In one document, the singer Sting is also mentioned, but with so many redactions we learn little more. It is almost impossible to decipher the documents. There is mention of a \"waiver\" but no further details. Read more from Sky News:What we learnt from Duchess of Sussex's Netflix seriesAstronauts back on Earth after months stuck in space This was never about revealing Prince Harry's visa application forms, that's private. But it is about one of the questions he had to answer; whether he's taken drugs. We're no closer to understanding what he wrote. Harry's team has always insisted he told the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK in 2020, and are now living in Montecito in California. In his memoir, Harry wrote how cocaine \"didn't do anything for me\", but that \"marijuana is different, that actually really did help me\". He also wrote about taking magic mushrooms he'd found in a fridge at a party thrown by the Friends star Courtney Cox. Nile Gardiner, from the Heritage Foundation, posted: \"There is zero accountability and transparency in the heavily redacted documents.\" He added that people \"have a right to know\" about Harry's responses to his drug taking on his visa application."

        "Content": " The work and pensions secretary has not ruled out making further cuts to the welfare budget despite already unveiling reforms designed to save £5bn. Liz Kendall said she had made the changes - which will see the eligibility criteria for disability benefits narrowed - because she wanted to \"tackle a failing system that is failing the people who depend on benefits\". Politics live: Kendall 'cross' about welfare system In an interview with Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the cabinet minister denied the reforms announced today were just a \"drop in the ocean\". She said she had announced a \"substantial package\" - and the changes would also be aimed at getting people into work to stop the overall bill ballooning to a projected £76bn by 2030. Ms Kendall said they would deal with a \"broken assessment process\", fix \"terrible financial incentives\" that force people on to welfare, and would focus benefits \"on those in greatest need\". \"It's providing the largest ever package of employment support,\" she told Rigby. Pressed again on whether she would rule out more savings over the course of this parliament, Ms Kendall replied: \"I'm not saying that. \"I am suggesting we talk about the proposals we are actually making, and not those which we aren't.\"  What changes are being made? Earlier today, Ms Kendall announced a raft of reforms designed to cut the government's expenditure on long-term sickness and disability benefits for working-age people, which has risen by £20bn since the pandemic. High on the agenda were personal independence payments (PIP), which provide money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, like washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive.  But Ms Kendall said from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points. However, Ms Kendall said the government would not freeze PIP - as reports had previously suggested - following a backlash from Labour MPs. Read more:How is PIP changing?All the planned welfare reforms  Minister 'cross' about welfare system Asked by Rigby whether she had wanted to go further by freezing PIP, Ms Kendall said she had \"never started from a sort of macho, tough position\". \"I've never done politics like that,\" she said. \"This is about real people and real lives.\" Ms Kendall, who ran to be Labour leader in the 2015 leadership race won by Jeremy Corbyn, admitted she was \"cross\" about the state of the welfare system, which she described as \"broken\". \"I've seen in my own constituency people written off to a life that is not the life they hoped for themselves, or their children or their families,\" she said. Addressing critics who have derided the changes as morally wrong, Ms Kendall said: \"What I think is morally wrong is writing off people who could work. \"What's morally wrong is looking at a benefit system where we are spending more and more on the costs of failure. \"And if that continues, the welfare state that we created won't be there for the very people who need it.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  One of Tesla's earliest investors has told Sky News that Elon Musk should step aside as the carmaker's chief executive unless he gives up his new government job. Ross Gerber said in an interview with Sky's Business Live that the tycoon and adviser to Donald Trump had lost his focus given his widening interests and was now too \"divisive\". He cited Musk's post-election role at the helm of the Trump administration's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). It has attracted public anger, and protests, over planned swingeing cuts to federal government staff. Money latest: Good news for holidaymakers heading to US Mr Gerber said: \"I think Tesla needs a new CEO and I decided today I was going to start saying it and so this is the first show that I'm saying it on. \"It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.\" Mr Gerber told presenter Darren McCaffrey that the business was \"absolutely\" in crisis and the appointment was among several reasons he had sold off a substantial number of shares in recent months. A slump began shortly before Mr Trump took office, as the first salvoes of the president's trade war were being threatened. Tesla's market value has plunged by more than $800bn since December and it was a further 4% down in US trading on Tuesday.  The business has been struggling on several fronts. Electric car demand appears to have peaked across key Western markets despite steep discounting to boost appeal at a time of continued strain on consumer budgets.

Add the potential for heightened costs due to Mr Trump's trade war, it is of little surprise that investors are concerned. Mr Gerber said that while Tesla's products were undoubtedly the best around, Musk only had 24 hours in the day and he had split his time too thinly since his purchase of Twitter - now called X - in 2022. He added that his social media posts and work with the president since had brought too much negative publicity to Tesla. \"The company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk,\" he said. \"Sales are plummeting so, yeah, it's a crisis. You literally can't sell the best product in the market place because the CEO is so divisive\"."

        "Content": " Two men have been found guilty over the theft of a £4.75m gold toilet from the house where Sir Winston Churchill was born.  Michael Jones helped steal the fully-functioning 18-carat gold toilet, which was an artwork named America, after breaking into Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in the early hours of 14 September 2019. Jones, from Oxford, had visited the stately home twice in the days before the raid but told the jury they were not reconnaissance trips. The 39-year-old was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday. Frederick Doe, 36, also known as Frederick Sines, from Windsor, Berkshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was found not guilty of the same charge. Doe helped James Sheen - who has been described as the mastermind of the raid - to sell some of the gold in the weeks after the theft. Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, earlier pleaded guilty to burglary. He also admitted conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property at Oxford Crown Court in April 2024. Jones had worked as a roofer and builder for Sheen from around 2018 and was effectively his \"right-hand man\", his trial heard. On one of his visits before the burglary, Jones took photos from inside the building of the window that the thieves would use to enter the stately home. The day before the raid he took photos of the toilet itself, the lock on the toilet door and further pictures of the same window from the outside. Prosecutor Julian Christopher KC said during trial that it appears five men carried out the raid - however only Jones and Sheen have been caught. Sheen and his accomplices drove two stolen vehicles, a VW Golf and an Isuzu truck, through locked gates at Blenheim Palace shortly before 5am on the night of the raid.

The carefully planned raid was over within five minutes. The gold was believed to be worth about £2.8m at the time of the theft. However the artwork, which weighed around 98kg, had been insured for the price of £4.75m. A couple of days after the burglary, Sheen contacted Doe about selling the gold. Through coded messages, the two men talked about \"cars\" and getting offered \"26 and a half\" - which the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says refers to the men getting £26,500 per kilo of the stolen gold. Jones was arrested on 16 October 2019 before officers analysed his phone. The force found he had searched for news reports about the stolen toilet on 20 September 2019, jurors were told. Meanwhile, Sheen's DNA was found both on a sledgehammer left at the scene and in the stolen Isuzu truck used in the raid. Tracksuit bottoms seized at his home had hundreds of gold fragments on them, which when analysed were indistinguishable from the gold from which the toilet was made. The sculpture, which was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was the star attraction of an exhibition at the country house before it was stolen. It could be used as a toilet by members of the public - with Jones telling the jury he took advantage of the artwork's \"facilities\" the day before it was taken. Asked what it was like, he replied: \"Splendid.\" None of the gold was ever recovered, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) saying it is likely to have been \"broken up or melted down and sold on soon after it was stolen\". Jones and Sheen will be sentenced at a date yet to be set. Doe will be sentenced on 19 May. Shan Saunders, from the CPS, said it was \"an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed - but those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence\"."

        "Content": "\n          National correspondent\n              @TomSkyNews\n  A teenager who murdered his family and wanted to be the worst mass killer the UK has seen had 33 cartridges on him to carry out an attack on his former school, a court has heard.  Nicholas Prosper shot his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle, 13, and shot and stabbed his brother Kyle, 16, at their family home in Luton on 13 September last year. But the 19-year-old did not plan on stopping there, according to prosecutor Timothy Cray KC, who told Luton Crown Court he had prepared the murders \"for months\" and wanted to kill at least 30 schoolchildren. \"His planning was cold, deliberate and without sympathy or emotion towards the actual victims or potential victims,\" Mr Cray said, speaking at Prosper's sentencing. His \"main wish\", however, was to \"achieve lasting notoriety as a mass killer\", Mr Cray added, specifically to \"imitate and even surpass other mass killers around the world\". \"He had conducted in-depth internet research on shootings in the United States of America, Norway, Australia and New Zealand,\" he said. \"He understood his plans, if realised, would bring about the greatest number of deaths in a school or other mass shooting in the United Kingdom and possibly even in the United States of America.\" The investigation suggests that the defendant \"acted alone\", he added, and \"his plans did not arise from any political or ideological cause\". Prosper had undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the court heard, but he showed an \"extreme lack of empathy with others and an extreme lack of remorse\" that can't be explained by ASD alone. Up until Year 11, the court heard Prosper was a \"geeky\" and quiet boy with a small group of friends who were into computers, but problems began in sixth form and he wouldn't engage with mental health support. 'Extended violent struggle' Prosper never reached St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, which was three-quarters of a mile from his home, as police arrested him after he escaped to a wooded area. After he left, officers broke into his family flat at about 5.50am, following a call from a neighbour. There, the court heard, they found Prosper's little sister underneath a dining table in the living room, \"as if she had been trying to hide there\". His mother and brother - who was stabbed more than 100 times - were both found in the hallway. He had planned to kill his family in their sleep, but when his mother realised something was wrong and challenged him, it led to \"an extended violent struggle\". After the horrific and noisy attack on his family members, Prosper knew police would be on their way and so had to leave three hours earlier than he had anticipated. The teenager was then arrested by a passing police patrol as he walked along a residential road in Luton. He had hidden the shotgun and cartridges nearby. Prosper admitted their murders at a hearing last month, as well as purchasing a shotgun without a certificate, possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life and possession of a kitchen knife in a public place. Plans long in the making These killings were planned for more than a year, the court heard, with Prosper managing to buy a shotgun with a fake firearms certificate. He had put together a black and yellow uniform he wanted to wear for his killing spree, and he had filmed a video of himself holding a plank of wood as a mock gun.

On the same day, Prosper messaged a private seller who had advertised a shotgun for £450, offering to pay £600 if cartridges were included, Mr Cray said. The seller agreed to drop the gun off to him on 12 September, the day before the killings, prompting Prosper to respond in a message: \"I look forward to meeting you.\" Forensic examiners found Prosper had fired seven cartridges, the first being a test shot into a teddy bear in his bedroom. Prosper's step-by-step plan A couple of months later, a prison officer found the notes in Prosper's trainer sole after searching his cell on 13 November. He had written the planned shooting would be \"one of the biggest events ever,\" Mr Cray said. \"I was right in predicting no-one would've called the police had I killed them in their sleep. 3 shots under 30 seconds,\" he had written. \"The only known phone call to police that day was made by the b**** at the door as a result of my B**** mother waking them up and it being turned into a long struggle. \"My plan wasn't 'stupid'. I was f****** right. MY MOTHER IS A STUPID F****** COW.\" The notes continued: \"But why so early? So I'd have time to cannibalise my family, and rape a woman at knife point before the shooting.\" He had also written a step-by-step plan, detailing he would jump two gates and shoot down a glass door while children were together for \"prayer/registration\". He would then \"shout that this is a robbery and for everyone to get down\", before shooting two teachers and killing children at Early Years Foundation Stage - the youngest. That part of the note finished with: \"Go to the next classroom. Kill a couple more.

In a statement read out by Mr Cray, Raymond Prosper said: \"The pain of our loss will never be healed.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @laurabundock\n Legal documents about Prince Harry's US visa application have been released - albeit with very heavy redactions. The released records show the judge concluded in September it wasn't in the public interest to disclose information about the Duke of Sussex's immigration status. He argued that Harry could be subject to \"harm in the form of harassment\" as well as \"unwanted contact\" from the media. So much of the text has been blacked out that there are still many unanswered questions, particularly about whether the prince admitted on his forms he'd taken drugs. One of the lawyers pushing for the release of information told Sky News they will keep pursuing the case and there will be more proceedings in the \"near future\". Samuel Dewey, attorney for the conservative thinktank The Heritage Foundation, said: \"It's always been a puzzle and we've always taken the view it may take some time to get answers... we will use this additional data to keep moving forward.\"  The six litigation files which were previously secret have been unsealed after a challenge by The Heritage Foundation. The thinktank submitted freedom of information requests to establish whether the Duke of Sussex received special dispensation with his visa application. It follows admissions in Harry's memoir Spare that he had taken drugs including cannabis, cocaine and psychedelics. The Heritage Foundation wanted to establish whether this was disclosed in his visa application and whether the US government had followed immigration laws. Listed as Exhibit 1, one of the files also states that the records contain \"very specific private and personal\" information, the release of which would be an invasion of personal privacy. In one document, the singer Sting is also mentioned, but with so many redactions we learn little more. It is almost impossible to decipher the documents. There is mention of a \"waiver\" but no further details. Read more from Sky News:What we learnt from Duchess of Sussex's Netflix seriesAstronauts back on Earth after months stuck in space This was never about revealing Prince Harry's visa application forms, that's private. But it is about one of the questions he had to answer; whether he's taken drugs. We're no closer to understanding what he wrote. Harry's team has always insisted he told the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK in 2020, and are now living in Montecito in California. In his memoir, Harry wrote how cocaine \"didn't do anything for me\", but that \"marijuana is different, that actually really did help me\". He also wrote about taking magic mushrooms he'd found in a fridge at a party thrown by the Friends star Courtney Cox. Nile Gardiner, from the Heritage Foundation, posted: \"There is zero accountability and transparency in the heavily redacted documents.\" He added that people \"have a right to know\" about Harry's responses to his drug taking on his visa application."

        "Content": " The work and pensions secretary has not ruled out making further cuts to the welfare budget despite already unveiling reforms designed to save £5bn. Liz Kendall said she had made the changes - which will see the eligibility criteria for disability benefits narrowed - because she wanted to \"tackle a failing system that is failing the people who depend on benefits\". Politics live: Kendall 'cross' about welfare system In an interview with Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the cabinet minister denied the reforms announced today were just a \"drop in the ocean\". She said she had announced a \"substantial package\" - and the changes would also be aimed at getting people into work to stop the overall bill ballooning to a projected £76bn by 2030. Ms Kendall said they would deal with a \"broken assessment process\", fix \"terrible financial incentives\" that force people on to welfare, and would focus benefits \"on those in greatest need\". \"It's providing the largest ever package of employment support,\" she told Rigby. Pressed again on whether she would rule out more savings over the course of this parliament, Ms Kendall replied: \"I'm not saying that. \"I am suggesting we talk about the proposals we are actually making, and not those which we aren't.\"  What changes are being made? Earlier today, Ms Kendall announced a raft of reforms designed to cut the government's expenditure on long-term sickness and disability benefits for working-age people, which has risen by £20bn since the pandemic. High on the agenda were personal independence payments (PIP), which provide money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, like washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive.  But Ms Kendall said from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points. However, Ms Kendall said the government would not freeze PIP - as reports had previously suggested - following a backlash from Labour MPs. Read more:How is PIP changing?All the planned welfare reforms  Minister 'cross' about welfare system Asked by Rigby whether she had wanted to go further by freezing PIP, Ms Kendall said she had \"never started from a sort of macho, tough position\". \"I've never done politics like that,\" she said. \"This is about real people and real lives.\" Ms Kendall, who ran to be Labour leader in the 2015 leadership race won by Jeremy Corbyn, admitted she was \"cross\" about the state of the welfare system, which she described as \"broken\". \"I've seen in my own constituency people written off to a life that is not the life they hoped for themselves, or their children or their families,\" she said. Addressing critics who have derided the changes as morally wrong, Ms Kendall said: \"What I think is morally wrong is writing off people who could work. \"What's morally wrong is looking at a benefit system where we are spending more and more on the costs of failure. \"And if that continues, the welfare state that we created won't be there for the very people who need it.\""

        "Content": "A member of a \"professional group of travelling burglars\" has been convicted after he broke into the home of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak and stole jewellery worth £68,000. Valentino Nikolov, 32, also took the Swedish footballer's sports car and up to £10,000 in cash when he carried out the raid with three members of his family in April 2024. Isak, who scored during Newcastle's victory over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at the weekend, was not in the Northumberland home at the time. Nikolov's family members - brother Giacomo Nikolov, 28, sister Jela Jovanovic, 43, and her son Charlie Jovanovic, 23 - all admitted conspiracy to burglary. However, Nikolov, from Birmingham, denied the charge and was found guilty on Tuesday following a trial at Newcastle Crown Court. His three family members, who all lived in Italy and travelled to the UK to carry out the burglary, will be sentenced at a later date. Isak noticed bins were moved Dan Cordey, prosecuting, told jurors how Isak left his home between 4pm and 10pm on 4 April and discovered the break-in when he returned and saw his bins had been moved. The gang smashed a glass door to enter the property before entering the TV room and carrying out an \"untidy search\", Mr Cordey said. Isak told detectives that he kept cash in bags upstairs, made up of notes of varying denominations as well as coins, and the amount taken was between £5,000 and £10,000. The 25-year-old striker added that bespoke men's jewellery from Frost of London worth about £68,000 - made up of bracelets, necklaces and rings - was taken, along with his Audi RS6 estate car. A member of the public later found the car abandoned and called the police, the jury heard. The gang also took a safe which had been left by the home's previous tenant and did not contain anything valuable, Mr Cordey said. Isak told police he had never used the safe and he had not been able to open it. Images of raid on 'doggy cam' CCTV images of the break-in were recorded on what Mr Cordey described as a \"doggy cam\". The prosecution said: \"This was a professional group of travelling burglars. \"It contained one female and three men - all related. \"Two of those men and one female have admitted their part in pleading guilty.\" Read more from Sky News:Teen planned on killing 'at least 30 children'The Londoner locked up in a forgotten Syrian prisonEnglish town where nearly a third of adults are not in work Gang used Citroen and Ford motorhome The thieves had already stolen jewellery and clothes worth more than £1m and the CBE medal belonging to Tyneside businesswoman Helen McArdle, as well as designer goods worth £100,000 from a woman in Whitburn, Sunderland, in the days before breaking into Isak's home. The gang arrived in the UK via a ferry from Calais to Dover in a Citroen C3 and a Ford motorhome last March. They headed to London then drove to the North East a few days later, the court has heard. The gang used the Citroen to travel to break-ins and the motorhome was a base where they slept. Nikolov represented himself and used an Italian interpreter during his trial. Safet Ramic, who is the 58-year-old father of Valentino Nikolov's former partner, and who is from Winson Street, Birmingham, was cleared of a single charge of handling stolen goods."

        "Content": " Two men have been found guilty over the theft of a £4.75m gold toilet from the house where Sir Winston Churchill was born.  Michael Jones helped steal the fully-functioning 18-carat gold toilet, which was an artwork named America, after breaking into Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in the early hours of 14 September 2019. Jones, from Oxford, had visited the stately home twice in the days before the raid but told the jury they were not reconnaissance trips. The 39-year-old was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday. Frederick Doe, 36, also known as Frederick Sines, from Windsor, Berkshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was found not guilty of the same charge. Doe helped James Sheen - who has been described as the mastermind of the raid - to sell some of the gold in the weeks after the theft. Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, earlier pleaded guilty to burglary. He also admitted conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property at Oxford Crown Court in April 2024. Jones had worked as a roofer and builder for Sheen from around 2018 and was effectively his \"right-hand man\", his trial heard. On one of his visits before the burglary, Jones took photos from inside the building of the window that the thieves would use to enter the stately home. The day before the raid he took photos of the toilet itself, the lock on the toilet door and further pictures of the same window from the outside. Prosecutor Julian Christopher KC said during trial that it appears five men carried out the raid - however only Jones and Sheen have been caught. Sheen and his accomplices drove two stolen vehicles, a VW Golf and an Isuzu truck, through locked gates at Blenheim Palace shortly before 5am on the night of the raid.

The carefully planned raid was over within five minutes. The gold was believed to be worth about £2.8m at the time of the theft. However the artwork, which weighed around 98kg, had been insured for the price of £4.75m. A couple of days after the burglary, Sheen contacted Doe about selling the gold. Through coded messages, the two men talked about \"cars\" and getting offered \"26 and a half\" - which the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says refers to the men getting £26,500 per kilo of the stolen gold. Jones was arrested on 16 October 2019 before officers analysed his phone. The force found he had searched for news reports about the stolen toilet on 20 September 2019, jurors were told. Meanwhile, Sheen's DNA was found both on a sledgehammer left at the scene and in the stolen Isuzu truck used in the raid. Tracksuit bottoms seized at his home had hundreds of gold fragments on them, which when analysed were indistinguishable from the gold from which the toilet was made. The sculpture, which was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was the star attraction of an exhibition at the country house before it was stolen. It could be used as a toilet by members of the public - with Jones telling the jury he took advantage of the artwork's \"facilities\" the day before it was taken. Asked what it was like, he replied: \"Splendid.\" None of the gold was ever recovered, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) saying it is likely to have been \"broken up or melted down and sold on soon after it was stolen\". Jones and Sheen will be sentenced at a date yet to be set. Doe will be sentenced on 19 May. Shan Saunders, from the CPS, said it was \"an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed - but those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence\"."

According to Met Office forecasts, Britons are set to enjoy temperatures of 21C on the day, thanks to warmer winds coming from the south. Check the forecast where you are This would make it the hottest day of the year so far, beating the previous record of 19.7C set earlier this month. The best of the warm weather is set for the south, but as far north as Glasgow could see temperatures in the mid-teens still. Forecasts would place the UK hotter than both Ibiza and Corfu - the latter of which is set for around 16C on Thursday, but warmer temperatures early next week. Weather producer There'll be plenty of sunshine this week and daytime temperatures are on the rise, becoming several degrees above average.  On Wednesday, 17C is possible in Wales, the Midlands and southern England. On Thursday, temperatures will widely reach 16-19C, perhaps climbing to 20C in England and Wales. That would be the highest temperature of the year so far, and on the same day as the spring equinox – the start of the astronomical spring. It will still be warm for most on Friday, but the highest temperatures will be further north and perhaps aided by the Foehn effect – warming and drying of air on the lee side of a cross-mountain wind. Northern England and Scotland looks most favoured for 20C on Friday. Temperatures might not be quite as high over the weekend, but should remain above average, despite the weather turning more unsettled. There'll be a widespread frost over the next few nights, with known cold spots falling well below freezing and -9C is possible in northern Scotland on Tuesday night.  Weather over the next few days Widespread clear skies over Tuesday will lead to a cold night into Wednesday, with temperatures dipping below freezing for the vast majority.

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n Families of the victims of convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby have hit out at calls for the public inquiry into her crimes to be suspended. They have also dismissed as \"deception\" Letby's claims to have new evidence of her innocence. Senior managers at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where nurse Letby killed seven babies and attempted to kill seven more, have added their voices to her call for Lady Justice Thirlwall's inquiry to be paused. In a submission to the inquiry, they wrote: \"There now appears to be a real likelihood that there are alternative explanations for these deaths and unexplained collapses, namely poor clinical management and care and natural causes.\" Their barrister Kate Blackwell KC told the inquiry there is \"a real possibility\" Letby's convictions may return to the Court of Appeal \"and there be quashed\". Continuing with the inquiry, she said, could potentially lead to unfairness. Families criticise senior managers' move \n                  Lucy Letby's lawyers call for baby deaths inquiry to be suspended\n                 \n                  Lucy Letby: Police investigation into hospital widened to include gross negligence manslaughter\n                 \n                  The whole-life prisoners who will never be released\n                 On Monday, Letby's solicitors had written to the inquiry claiming that its final report - due to be published in the autumn - would \"not only be redundant but likely unreliable\" unless it was stopped pending the outcome of her battle to clear her name. But in their own statement to the inquiry, a group of families of the babies attacked by Letby criticised the move by the senior managers. \"Their lack of insight into their own mistakes is both remarkable and shameful,\" the group said. They added: \"Throughout the hearings, they consistently sought to defend their actions and to deflect blame on to others. \"And they are now attempting, opportunistically, to suspend the inquiry's work pending Letby's third attempt to appeal her convictions.\" They described that as \"a bold and misguided move\". \"From the families' perspective, the only fair and sensible course is for you to complete your work and submit your report based on the established facts,\" they added. Inquiry's scope The inquiry was set up to examine how Letby was able to attack babies and the wider culture within the NHS. It is not examining any questions of Letby's guilt or innocence. She is currently serving 15 whole life terms in prison. Last month, an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists, assembled by Letby's defence team, said bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths attributed to Letby on the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit in 2015 and 2016.  Those findings will be passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hope her case will eventually be referred back to the Court of Appeal after two previous failed bids. But at the inquiry, Peter Skelton KC, on behalf of one group of victims' families, was damning of the defence team's efforts. \"Cursory analysis of the report published by those experts identifies multiple problems with their analysis. What has been presented with great fanfare as new and incontrovertible evidence turns out to be old and full of analytical holes,\" he said. He added that the hypotheses had been advanced based on \"fragile towers of speculation\". Read more:Why are there calls to suspend Letby inquiryHow police caught killer nurse 'It's not new evidence', says group of families of babies In a submission to the inquiry, another group of families of babies, said: \"The key deception in Letby's approach in holding press conferences is that she can present evidence without that risk that it will be analysed, challenged or questioned. \"It permits her to control the narrative without having to explain why she chose not to call that evidence at trial. \"It is not new evidence but rather a re-hash of evidence that was available to her at her trial and which she could have called in her defence.\" Richard Baker KC, on behalf of those families, told the inquiry: \"We cannot let the noise in the background stop the work that this inquiry can achieve.\" Cheshire Police say an investigation into corporate manslaughter at the hospital has now been widened to include gross negligence manslaughter with several individuals notified of the investigation. A separate police investigation into deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neonatal units of the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women's Hospital during Letby's time as a nurse between 2012 to 2016 is also ongoing."

        "Content": " Two NASA astronauts have splashed down off the coast of Florida after spending more than nine months stuck in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams waved as they left their capsule - nearly an hour after it returned to Earth at about 6pm local time (10pm UK time). Dolphins were seen swimming nearby while work was under way to remove it from the water.  The astronauts' journey back from the International Space Station took 17 hours. Senior NASA administrator Joel Montalbano described the landing as \"beautiful\" - and said their 150 experiments and 900 hours of research will inform future moon missions. \"The crew's doing great... eventually they'll make their way back to Houston,\" NASA manager Steve Stich said - telling reporters they'll get some \"well-deserved time off\" with their families once debriefs are complete. They were only meant to be on the ISS for eight days when they blasted off from Earth on 5 June last year. They were testing out Boeing's long-awaited Starliner - a vessel designed to rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is currently used to ferry astronauts into space. But by the time they docked at the ISS, the Starliner had suffered major problems - with five helium leaks, five dead manoeuvring thrusters and a propellant valve that failed to close completely. It returned to Earth without them after it was decided Mr Wilmore, 62, and Ms Williams, 59, would be safer waiting in orbit. During their long wait in space, the two US Navy veterans completed spacewalks, experiments and even helped sort out the plumbing onboard the ISS. The astronauts repeatedly said they enjoyed the mission, with Ms Williams describing the space station as her \"happy place\". Swept up in NASA's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels. The SpaceX vehicle that has brought them home arrived at the space station in September carrying NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with two empty seats. The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at about 5.45pm local time on Tuesday. Using two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown. The astronauts will soon be flown to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before NASA flight surgeons allow them to go home to their families. Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.  Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?This is what happens to your health from being in space for so longCrew welcomed to ISS to replace stranded astronauts The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams - and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden had \"abandoned\" them for political reasons. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. Crew Dragon is America's only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams threw its development future into uncertainty. \"We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Mr Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe NASA's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics. \"That's what your nation's human spaceflight program's all about,\" he said. \"Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\""

The Russian and US presidents spoke for around an hour and a half as the Trump administration aims to bring about an end to the conflict which started after Moscow's forces carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin agreed to the limited ceasefire but stopped short of backing a broader 30-day pause in fighting that the White House is pushing for. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the call that he supports the US proposal to stop Kyiv's strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Mr Zelenskyy added that the hopes to speak to Mr Trump to find out \"what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians\" during his conversation with Mr Putin. He also said that future talks about Ukraine without Kyiv at the table will not bring results.

However, Mr Putin said during his call with Mr Trump on Tuesday that any long-term deal would require a complete halt to intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Mr Zelenskky said in an online briefing after the call that Ukraine's partners would never agree to such a move and that he hopes supplies will continue. He added that Moscow's demand was simply an example of Mr Putin attempting to weaken Ukraine.  US correspondent The outcome of this call will allow both side to claim a win. For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire.  He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict.  For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire (energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted) but he can still continue his war along the frontline. He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.\n This is a war all about territory. Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan. US hopes call marks first step towards peace The White House has said Mr Trump and Mr Putin agreed to a \"movement to peace\" it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the fighting. \"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,\" the White House added. Mr Putin welcomed Mr Trump's calls for the maritime ceasefire and \"agreed to begin negotiations to further work out specific details of such an agreement\", according to the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials had earlier proposed a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes and the release of prisoners at their meeting with the US delegation in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. Read more:What Sky's correspondents think about Trump-Putin callWhat would peace in Ukraine look like? Prisoner swaps and hockey matches The Kremlin also said after the call that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday. Moscow added that it will also hand over 23 badly wounded soldiers to Ukraine. Mr Zelenskyy responded by saying Russia could show it was serious about peace talks by freeing all prisoners. Meanwhile, Moscow said in its recap of the call that Mr Trump supported an idea from Mr Putin to organise ice hockey matches in the US between professional players from America and Russia. The White House's account of the conversation did not mention hockey. Shortly after the call, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: \"We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.\" Mr Zelenskyy remains sceptical that Mr Putin is ready for peace as Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine. Mr Putin last week said he agreed in principle with the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, but emphasised that Russia would seek guarantees that Ukraine would not use a break in hostilities to rearm and continue mobilisation. He has also demanded that Ukraine renounce joining the NATO military alliance, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit. Fears Washington favours Moscow The call between Mr Trump and Mr Putin is just the latest turn in a dramatically shifting relationship between the two superpowers. Mr Trump made bringing about a quick end to the conflict a top priority when he took office in January - straining ties with allies who want Mr Putin to pay a price for the invasion. Mr Trump, who has long shown admiration for Mr Putin, has blamed Ukraine for Russia's unprovoked invasion. European countries have continued to show support for Ukraine as Mr Trump has appeared to favour Moscow as he aims to secure an end to the war. Mr Zelenskyy said he spoke to German leader Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron following Tuesday's call between the US and Russian presidents. Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"We welcome the progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire and in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. \"This process must lead to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to ensure Russia can never launch an illegal invasion again.\" Shortly after the call, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv which were followed by explosions in the city. It comes after the AES Group private oil refinery was badly damaged after a shock Russian attack in the Kharkiv region on Monday. The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it."

By agreeing to a ceasefire on energy infrastructure, he has given Donald Trump enough to ensure the wider US-Russia rapprochement remains intact. \n                  Trump tariffs: UK steel bosses fear dumping and cancelled orders\n                 \n                  Trump 100, Day 58: Is America's rule of law being trumped by the law of the ruler? \n                 \n                  Ukraine war: 'We've never been closer to a peace deal' - Trump and Putin to hold talks on ending conflict\n                 There's been talk in the last month of a reset of relations, of the lifting of sanctions - and Putin certainly doesn't want to jeopardise that. Follow live updates on aftermath of call At the same time, though, Putin didn't want to dilute any of his red lines. And by the sounds of it, they're as indelible as ever. The Kremlin's readout of the call talks of a need to \"eliminate the root causes of the crisis\", which is Kremlin code for \"Russia's security concerns regarding NATO expansion need to be met\". One thing this call has given him though is the time to press home Russia's military advantage. This is particularly important to Putin in Russia's Kursk region, where his forces are seemingly on the verge of eradicating Ukraine's foothold, which would be of huge symbolic importance to the Kremlin. James Matthews, US correspondent They're calling it \"ceasefire-lite\". In Kyiv, they'll choke on it. The respective readouts of the Trump-Putin phone call don't read well for Ukrainians relying on a US ally to do their bidding. They had already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with the Americans who said they were \"on the 10th yard line of peace\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Moscow, clearly, has different ideas. To extend the American football metaphor, Vladimir Putin still has hands on the ball. The Russians know Donald Trump. Prisoner exchanges present a trophy achievement. There was, of all things, talk of US vs Russia ice hockey matches. In Moscow, they know Trump's comfortable talking sport and that many Americans think hockey before they think Ukraine. Read more: What are the options for peace in Ukraine? It was dressing around a deal that is deeply flawed from Kyiv's perspective. Russian talk of eliminating \"root causes of the crisis\" speaks to Moscow's desire to demilitarise Ukraine and lay claim to its territory. Then there was Putin's insistence on a \"cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv\". To cut the supply of weapons and intelligence would weaken Ukraine while Russia strengthens. For Kyiv, it's a line so red, it's purple. What Trump does next is pivotal. What he's done so far boxes Ukraine into a corner, European allies too. A common thread in the readouts was the positive talk of US-Russian relations to come - \"an improved bilateral relationship... has huge upside\" was Washington's take. It's clear Trump and Putin share the vision of a geopolitical shift, built on shared priorities. The fate of Ukraine isn't necessarily top of the list."

        "Content": "By Dylan Donnelly and Claire Gilbody-Dickerson, news reporters   Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's overnight airstrikes on Gaza are \"just the beginning\", despite the United Nations condemning them as \"horrifying\". At least 413 people were killed and a further 562 were injured in the attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The airstrikes put an end to a fragile ceasefire between Hamas, the militant group ruling Gaza, and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had \"gone back to fighting with great might\" after Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it is holding following its attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Mr Netanyahu promised \"growing action against Hamas with greater intensity\" and reaffirmed his intention to carry on fighting until all hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed. The IDF has issued evacuation orders for a number of areas in Gaza, after the ceasefire had allowed for hundreds of thousands of displaced people to return to their homes across the enclave. Many of the dead in the latest strikes were children, according to Palestinian health ministry officials. The Hamas-run government media office called the attacks a \"blatant violation of all international and humanitarian conventions\". In a speech at the United Nations, the Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said \"we want peace\", adding that the choice facing member states was \"crystal clear\". He urged the General Assembly to \"act with us to make peace... make war not acceptable... and [for] ceasefire to prevail\". Brett Jonathan Miller, Israel's deputy permanent representative at the UN, said a return to fighting was \"a necessity\". The UK's ambassador to Israel, Simon Walters, said on X that Israel's attacks will neither help defeat Hamas nor bring hostages home and will only cause \"more death\". Read more:What happened to the ceasefire?Thousands of new tents near Gaza border area under Israeli evacuation order There are 59 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas - 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. For their release, Hamas wanted the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an end to hostilities as part of the second phase of the deal. Hamas, the militant group running Gaza and whose massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel 17 months ago sparked Israel's bombing of the enclave, has claimed it is \"working with mediators to curb the aggression\" seen on Tuesday. 'Tragedy on to tragedy' More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign since October 2023, Gazan health officials say. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but said more than half of the fatalities were women and children. A surgeon working in Gaza has described the \"utter carnage and destruction\" he witnessed on Tuesday morning during Israel's air attack. Dr Feroze Sidhwa is working at the Nasser Medical Complex in Deir Al Balah, where he said most of the people he has seen who were killed were women and children. \"I did six operations overnight,\" he told Sky News Breakfast presenter Wilfred Frost. \"Half of them were small children, probably six and below, I wasn't exactly sure. Most of them are going to die, unfortunately.\" He said this \"carnage\" is what should be expected \"when you drop bombs on tents\".\n\n UN High Commissioner Volker Turk said: \"I am horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza. \"This will add tragedy on to tragedy.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News the Trump administration was consulted by Israel about the airstrikes. Middle East correspondent The waves of airstrikes and tank fire throughout the night came as a surprise and brought an end to a ceasefire that lasted almost two months. Only a small circle of IDF military commanders were aware of the plans, so Hamas had no forewarning. Neither did the civilians of Gaza, who have started to slowly rebuild what they can of their lives following the devastating war. The IDF says it is targeting mid-ranking Hamas officials, although I've also seen pictures of dead and wounded children amongst the casualties. Talks to extend the ceasefire and release more hostages had been ongoing in recent days, but Hamas and Israel couldn't agree on the format of a continued truce. Israel had already cut off humanitarian deliveries into Gaza and threatened a resumption of the war if Hamas didn't change its position - they are now following through on that threat. Israeli intelligence will have spent the last seven weeks of ceasefire gathering information of living Hamas commanders - these airstrikes will be an attempt to take them out and put pressure on Hamas to agree the ceasefire deal that Israel, and Washington, wants. If they don't, the IDF has already drawn up plans for an extensive campaign, and ground operations will follow. They have the White House's backing. 'Extensive' strikes The IDF and Israel Security Agency Shin Bet said the \"extensive\" strikes were aimed at \"terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip\". A Palestinian source, who lives in central Gaza, told Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone \"we were sure that this war wouldn't end\" and added: \"I wish they (Israel) would open the Rafah border crossing (into Egypt). I wish to leave. I cannot take it anymore.\" It comes two months after a three-phase ceasefire deal was agreed by Hamas and Israel to pause the war. Over the six-week first phase, Hamas released 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and five Thai nationals, in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. But since the first phase officially concluded, both Israel and Hamas have failed to agree on how to progress with the second phase - which would see the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.  'A death sentence' Izzat al Risheq, a senior Hamas official, said Mr Netanyahu's decision to return to war amounts to a \"death sentence\" for the remaining hostages. Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure at home over his handling of the hostage crisis. Furthermore, his latest appearance at a long-running corruption trial was cancelled after the strikes, which resumed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. US Middle East envoy Mr Witkoff had proposed extending the first phase of the ceasefire through to the end of Ramadan and Passover or until 20 April, which Hamas rejected. At the start of March, Israel said it stopped all goods and supplies to Gaza after claiming Hamas was refusing to \"accept the Witkoff outline for continuing the talks, which Israel agreed to\". Five days later, Israel said it had cut off the electricity supply to Gaza."

        "Content": " The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seemingly came to an end overnight after Israel launched dozens of air strikes on targets across Gaza. Palestinian authorities have said more than 400 people are either dead or missing. The ceasefire agreed back in mid-January had paused fighting after 15 months of war. It also saw both sides agree to the release of Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks back in 2023, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. So what is left of the ceasefire now, and why did Israel choose to strike Hamas? Gaza strikes latest: Follow live updates  What did the agreed ceasefire look like? The three-stage deal, brokered by mediators the US, Qatar and Egypt, came into effect on 19 January. During the first phase, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza. No further hostage releases were called for under the agreement until the second phase. Negotiations over this second phase of the deal were meant to begin on the 16th day of phase one - 4 February - and were supposed to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of all remaining hostages. According to the deal, a third phase would include the return of the bodies of dead hostages and the beginning of Gaza's reconstruction, a mammoth task that will be supervised by Egypt, Qatar and the UN. It had little detail about the future of Gaza - from how it will be governed, to any guarantees that the ceasefire agreement will bring a permanent end to the war. Read more:The competing plans for rebuilding Gaza after the war  What has actually happened? The first phase of the ceasefire deal officially ended two weeks ago. Israel has since cut off all food, medicine, fuel, electricity and other supplies to Gaza's population of around two million people, to pressure Hamas to accept a new proposal ahead of a second phase of ceasefire. The move was widely criticised, with Hamas accusing Israel of trying to cause famine in Gaza, and the head of the UN Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA) warning the territory will experience another hunger crisis if Israel continues to withhold aid. Israel's new proposal would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages - the militant group's main bargaining chip - in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. It is named the \"Witkoff plan\", after US Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed it last week. Mr Witkoff also demanded the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander and the bodies of four hostages who died in captivity. The proposal made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was Hamas's refusal of this proposal that led to him ordering the strikes on Tuesday. Unless mediators now step in, Israel's attack on Gaza could mean a full return to fighting. Could a new ceasefire be agreed? Last week, Israel sent a delegation to the Qatari capital, Doha, for more ceasefire talks, and Hamas leaders attended a round of talks in Cairo, but there has been no sign of a breakthrough. Reacting to the latest strikes, Egypt's foreign ministry called for all parties to \"exercise restraint\" and to give mediators space to \"complete their efforts to reach a permanent ceasefire\". Hamas claimed it is \"working with mediators to curb the aggression\", adding that it is keen to implement a ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, a statement from the office of Mr Netanyahu said Israel would act against Hamas with \"increasing military strength\". It accused Hamas of repeatedly refusing to release hostages. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has also issued evacuation orders for a number of areas in Gaza - after the ceasefire agreement allowed hundreds of thousands of people to return to their homes across the region. The order tells people to leave the neighbourhoods of Beit Hanoun, Khuza'a, Abasan al-Kabira and al-Jadida and head to shelters in Gaza City and Khan Younis. Sky News Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the order may indicate that an Israeli land force is preparing to enter the area. \"If you're going to have a major ground offensive, and if it could from all angles, I think they would look to force Gazan civilians into humanitarian zones,\" he said. \"That would give the IDF some freedom of operation, freedom of movement, in open areas.\""

He told Sky News he was a \"very cheerful person, always there to be laughter wherever he is\". \"They were always smiling and share happiness everywhere they go,\" Mr Rizik, who himself has three children aged four, two and two months, said in a post on X about the siblings. Mr Rizik founded Gaza Great Minds to give students a chance to learn during Israel's military campaign, which was triggered by Hamas's attacks on 7 October 2023. Father 'really scared' to lose his children He said he is \"terrified\" of losing his family or any more of his pupils now the ceasefire has ended. \"I am really scared to lose my kids […] or even my students because they are in different locations in Gaza City and most of them are in camps and camps are the most-affected or targeted places right now as from what we saw in the last night.\"  Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza in the early hours of Tuesday, bringing to an end a fragile ceasefire agreement with Hamas which had brought relative peace to the enclave for two months. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said the number of dead so far from Tuesday's strikes was 413, with more than 500 others injured. Most of those killed were reported to be women and children. Mr Rizik said he has already been displaced seven times.  \"I lived in a school, in one of its classes, I lived in a tent, lived in the streets, literally, I lived in one of the camps in Gaza inside a very tiny tent, I lived in a partly destroyed house,\" Mr Rizik said. 'Family drink water mixed with sewage' He said his family is forced to drink water mixed with sewage and his children haven't had any protein for more than a year, while milk formula and nappies have been especially hard to find.

The war, sparked by the 7 October 2023 Hamas massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel when around 250 others were taken hostage, has since seen more than 48,000 Palestinians killed in the besieged territory, according to Gazan health officials. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but said more than half of the fatalities were women and children. Speaking of the trauma the war has left on pupils, Mr Rizik said: \"When we told them to draw something, all of our students drew either destroyed houses or people being tortured by the soldiers.\" While in \"normal\" schools most children would laugh if a clown was brought in, Mr Rizik said that wasn't the case at his tent schools. \"They lost the ability to smile again, so this is how they are traumatised,\" he said.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  One of Tesla's earliest investors has told Sky News that Elon Musk should step aside as the carmaker's chief executive unless he gives up his new government job. Ross Gerber said in an interview with Sky's Business Live that the tycoon and adviser to Donald Trump had lost his focus given his widening interests and was now too \"divisive\". He cited Musk's post-election role at the helm of the Trump administration's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). It has attracted public anger, and protests, over planned swingeing cuts to federal government staff. Money latest: Good news for holidaymakers heading to US Mr Gerber said: \"I think Tesla needs a new CEO and I decided today I was going to start saying it and so this is the first show that I'm saying it on. \"It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.\" Mr Gerber told presenter Darren McCaffrey that the business was \"absolutely\" in crisis and the appointment was among several reasons he had sold off a substantial number of shares in recent months. A slump began shortly before Mr Trump took office, as the first salvoes of the president's trade war were being threatened. Tesla's market value has plunged by more than $800bn since December and it was a further 4% down in US trading on Tuesday.  The business has been struggling on several fronts. Electric car demand appears to have peaked across key Western markets despite steep discounting to boost appeal at a time of continued strain on consumer budgets.

Add the potential for heightened costs due to Mr Trump's trade war, it is of little surprise that investors are concerned. Mr Gerber said that while Tesla's products were undoubtedly the best around, Musk only had 24 hours in the day and he had split his time too thinly since his purchase of Twitter - now called X - in 2022. He added that his social media posts and work with the president since had brought too much negative publicity to Tesla. \"The company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk,\" he said. \"Sales are plummeting so, yeah, it's a crisis. You literally can't sell the best product in the market place because the CEO is so divisive\"."

        "Content": " Two NASA astronauts have splashed down off the coast of Florida after spending more than nine months stuck in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams waved as they left their capsule - nearly an hour after it returned to Earth at about 6pm local time (10pm UK time). Dolphins were seen swimming nearby while work was under way to remove it from the water.  The astronauts' journey back from the International Space Station took 17 hours. Senior NASA administrator Joel Montalbano described the landing as \"beautiful\" - and said their 150 experiments and 900 hours of research will inform future moon missions. \"The crew's doing great... eventually they'll make their way back to Houston,\" NASA manager Steve Stich said - telling reporters they'll get some \"well-deserved time off\" with their families once debriefs are complete. They were only meant to be on the ISS for eight days when they blasted off from Earth on 5 June last year. They were testing out Boeing's long-awaited Starliner - a vessel designed to rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is currently used to ferry astronauts into space. But by the time they docked at the ISS, the Starliner had suffered major problems - with five helium leaks, five dead manoeuvring thrusters and a propellant valve that failed to close completely. It returned to Earth without them after it was decided Mr Wilmore, 62, and Ms Williams, 59, would be safer waiting in orbit. During their long wait in space, the two US Navy veterans completed spacewalks, experiments and even helped sort out the plumbing onboard the ISS. The astronauts repeatedly said they enjoyed the mission, with Ms Williams describing the space station as her \"happy place\". Swept up in NASA's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels. The SpaceX vehicle that has brought them home arrived at the space station in September carrying NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with two empty seats. The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at about 5.45pm local time on Tuesday. Using two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown. The astronauts will soon be flown to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before NASA flight surgeons allow them to go home to their families. Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.  Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?This is what happens to your health from being in space for so longCrew welcomed to ISS to replace stranded astronauts The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams - and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden had \"abandoned\" them for political reasons. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. Crew Dragon is America's only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams threw its development future into uncertainty. \"We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Mr Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe NASA's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics. \"That's what your nation's human spaceflight program's all about,\" he said. \"Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\""

        "Content": " Vladimir Putin has agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on energy infrastructure in Ukraine during a lengthy phone call with Donald Trump. The Russian and US presidents spoke for around an hour and a half as the Trump administration aims to bring about an end to the conflict which started after Moscow's forces carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin agreed to the limited ceasefire but stopped short of backing a broader 30-day pause in fighting that the White House is pushing for. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the call that he supports the US proposal to stop Kyiv's strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Mr Zelenskyy added that the hopes to speak to Mr Trump to find out \"what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians\" during his conversation with Mr Putin. He also said that future talks about Ukraine without Kyiv at the table will not bring results. Ukraine war: Follow latest updates \n                  NASA reveals what's next for astronauts safely back on Earth after nine months stuck in space\n                 \n                  Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore latest: 'Wonderful' reunion ahead for astronauts as they splash down back to Earth\n                 \n                  Death row inmate in US executed using nitrogen gas after Supreme Court appeal fails\n                 During talks led by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Saudi Arabia last week, Ukrainian officials agreed to the US proposal for a 30-day pause in fighting. However, Mr Putin said during his call with Mr Trump on Tuesday that any long-term deal would require a complete halt to intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Mr Zelenskky said in an online briefing after the call that Ukraine's partners would never agree to such a move and that he hopes supplies will continue. He added that Moscow's demand was simply an example of Mr Putin attempting to weaken Ukraine.  US correspondent The outcome of this call will allow both side to claim a win. For President Trump, he can and will claim that he has secured a phased ceasefire - an air and sea ceasefire.  He will claim, correctly, that he has moved the dial closer to peace (at least in the short term) in this long conflict.  For President Putin, he has accepted a partial ceasefire (energy and infrastructure facilities will not be targeted) but he can still continue his war along the frontline. He wants to do this because he believes he has the upper hand and can continue the battlefield conflict to push the frontline as far west as he can.\n This is a war all about territory. Russia wants to have control of as much land as possible before it signs any full ceasefire plan. US hopes call marks first step towards peace The White House has said Mr Trump and Mr Putin agreed to a \"movement to peace\" it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the fighting. \"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,\" the White House added. Mr Putin welcomed Mr Trump's calls for the maritime ceasefire and \"agreed to begin negotiations to further work out specific details of such an agreement\", according to the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials had earlier proposed a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes and the release of prisoners at their meeting with the US delegation in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. Read more:What Sky's correspondents think about Trump-Putin callWhat would peace in Ukraine look like? Prisoner swaps and hockey matches The Kremlin also said after the call that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday. Moscow added that it will also hand over 23 badly wounded soldiers to Ukraine. Mr Zelenskyy responded by saying Russia could show it was serious about peace talks by freeing all prisoners. Meanwhile, Moscow said in its recap of the call that Mr Trump supported an idea from Mr Putin to organise ice hockey matches in the US between professional players from America and Russia. The White House's account of the conversation did not mention hockey. Shortly after the call, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: \"We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.\" Mr Zelenskyy remains sceptical that Mr Putin is ready for peace as Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine. Mr Putin last week said he agreed in principle with the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, but emphasised that Russia would seek guarantees that Ukraine would not use a break in hostilities to rearm and continue mobilisation. He has also demanded that Ukraine renounce joining the NATO military alliance, sharply cut its army, and protect Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow's orbit. Fears Washington favours Moscow The call between Mr Trump and Mr Putin is just the latest turn in a dramatically shifting relationship between the two superpowers. Mr Trump made bringing about a quick end to the conflict a top priority when he took office in January - straining ties with allies who want Mr Putin to pay a price for the invasion. Mr Trump, who has long shown admiration for Mr Putin, has blamed Ukraine for Russia's unprovoked invasion. European countries have continued to show support for Ukraine as Mr Trump has appeared to favour Moscow as he aims to secure an end to the war. Mr Zelenskyy said he spoke to German leader Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron following Tuesday's call between the US and Russian presidents. Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"We welcome the progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire and in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. \"This process must lead to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to ensure Russia can never launch an illegal invasion again.\" Shortly after the call, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv which were followed by explosions in the city. It comes after the AES Group private oil refinery was badly damaged after a shock Russian attack in the Kharkiv region on Monday. The AES Group confirmed the destruction of the facility in Merefa after about 20 drones were launched at it."

        "Content": " Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone on Tuesday for at least 90 minutes. Russia has agreed to a partial ceasefire on targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure as a result, for a period of 30 days. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that future talks about Ukraine without Kyiv at the table will not bring any results. Here's what two of Sky's correspondents make of the Trump-Putin phone call. Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent I think Vladimir Putin will be very satisfied with the outcome of this call because even if he hasn't gained a whole lot, he crucially hasn't lost anything. By agreeing to a ceasefire on energy infrastructure, he has given Donald Trump enough to ensure the wider US-Russia rapprochement remains intact. \n                  Trump tariffs: UK steel bosses fear dumping and cancelled orders\n                 \n                  Trump 100, Day 58: Is America's rule of law being trumped by the law of the ruler? \n                 \n                  Ukraine war: 'We've never been closer to a peace deal' - Trump and Putin to hold talks on ending conflict\n                 There's been talk in the last month of a reset of relations, of the lifting of sanctions - and Putin certainly doesn't want to jeopardise that. Follow live updates on aftermath of call At the same time, though, Putin didn't want to dilute any of his red lines. And by the sounds of it, they're as indelible as ever. The Kremlin's readout of the call talks of a need to \"eliminate the root causes of the crisis\", which is Kremlin code for \"Russia's security concerns regarding NATO expansion need to be met\". One thing this call has given him though is the time to press home Russia's military advantage. This is particularly important to Putin in Russia's Kursk region, where his forces are seemingly on the verge of eradicating Ukraine's foothold, which would be of huge symbolic importance to the Kremlin. James Matthews, US correspondent They're calling it \"ceasefire-lite\". In Kyiv, they'll choke on it. The respective readouts of the Trump-Putin phone call don't read well for Ukrainians relying on a US ally to do their bidding. They had already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with the Americans who said they were \"on the 10th yard line of peace\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Moscow, clearly, has different ideas. To extend the American football metaphor, Vladimir Putin still has hands on the ball. The Russians know Donald Trump. Prisoner exchanges present a trophy achievement. There was, of all things, talk of US vs Russia ice hockey matches. In Moscow, they know Trump's comfortable talking sport and that many Americans think hockey before they think Ukraine. Read more: What are the options for peace in Ukraine? It was dressing around a deal that is deeply flawed from Kyiv's perspective. Russian talk of eliminating \"root causes of the crisis\" speaks to Moscow's desire to demilitarise Ukraine and lay claim to its territory. Then there was Putin's insistence on a \"cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv\". To cut the supply of weapons and intelligence would weaken Ukraine while Russia strengthens. For Kyiv, it's a line so red, it's purple. What Trump does next is pivotal. What he's done so far boxes Ukraine into a corner, European allies too. A common thread in the readouts was the positive talk of US-Russian relations to come - \"an improved bilateral relationship... has huge upside\" was Washington's take. It's clear Trump and Putin share the vision of a geopolitical shift, built on shared priorities. The fate of Ukraine isn't necessarily top of the list."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @laurabundock\n Legal documents about Prince Harry's US visa application have been released - albeit with very heavy redactions. The released records show the judge concluded in September it wasn't in the public interest to disclose information about the Duke of Sussex's immigration status. He argued that Harry could be subject to \"harm in the form of harassment\" as well as \"unwanted contact\" from the media. So much of the text has been blacked out that there are still many unanswered questions, particularly about whether the prince admitted on his forms he'd taken drugs. One of the lawyers pushing for the release of information told Sky News they will keep pursuing the case and there will be more proceedings in the \"near future\". Samuel Dewey, attorney for the conservative thinktank The Heritage Foundation, said: \"It's always been a puzzle and we've always taken the view it may take some time to get answers... we will use this additional data to keep moving forward.\"  The six litigation files which were previously secret have been unsealed after a challenge by The Heritage Foundation. The thinktank submitted freedom of information requests to establish whether the Duke of Sussex received special dispensation with his visa application. It follows admissions in Harry's memoir Spare that he had taken drugs including cannabis, cocaine and psychedelics. The Heritage Foundation wanted to establish whether this was disclosed in his visa application and whether the US government had followed immigration laws. Listed as Exhibit 1, one of the files also states that the records contain \"very specific private and personal\" information, the release of which would be an invasion of personal privacy. In one document, the singer Sting is also mentioned, but with so many redactions we learn little more. It is almost impossible to decipher the documents. There is mention of a \"waiver\" but no further details.

But it is about one of the questions he had to answer; whether he's taken drugs. We're no closer to understanding what he wrote. Harry's team has always insisted he told the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK in 2020, and are now living in Montecito in California. In his memoir, Harry wrote how cocaine \"didn't do anything for me\", but that \"marijuana is different, that actually really did help me\". He also wrote about taking magic mushrooms he'd found in a fridge at a party thrown by the Friends star Courtney Cox. Nile Gardiner, from the Heritage Foundation, posted: \"There is zero accountability and transparency in the heavily redacted documents.\" He added that people \"have a right to know\" about Harry's responses to his drug taking on his visa application."

The 5'8\" tall robot performed the first public demonstration in a real-world setting of a real-world task - in this case assembling an engine part - entirely autonomously. Clicking two parts together with a twist of its servo-controlled wrists, and handing it to a human colleague is a basic task. But it's also an important moment in the much-hyped world of human-like robot development. \"This is a really big day for us,\" says Jeff Cardenas, chief executive of Apptronik, the US company behind Apollo. \"We're excited to show this off, excited for the public to see the robot live and in person.\" Mercedes-Benz has announced a multimillion-pound investment in Apptronik and is trialling a handful of the humanoid robots at its factory in Berlin and another in Hungary. Investors and industrial firms - particularly carmakers with long experience of using robots in manufacturing - have been closely following the development of human-like robots. The costs of small, lightweight components have fallen as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and computer vision technology have led to rapid advances in the field of robots that can emulate human movement and tasks. But despite a rising number of increasingly impressive-looking cyborgs being unveiled by tech companies in the US and Asia, few have taken their first steps out of the lab. The Apollo robot looks small and underpowered surrounded by the huge robotic arms that weld, bolt and inspect Mercedes' latest cars at the Berlin-Marienfelde plant. But hosting a robot with a human \"form-factor\" is more than just a photo opportunity, according to Mercedes-Benz. \"There's one big advantage,\" says Jorg Burzer, head of production and supply chain management at the German carmaker. \"A humanoid robot is flexible, so you can basically introduce it to an assembly line or internal logistics or quality inspection... you can basically move it from one place to another.\" Introducing a new assembly line, or upgrading an old one with traditional robotic arms is a major investment. A robot that can be adapted to a range of tasks and work alongside humans would avoid that investment. With hands and feet like ours, they can operate tools and work in the same workspaces as people. Apollo can lift more than 25kg and potentially perform repetitive tasks that are, in the words of humanoid robot developers, too \"dull, dirty or dangerous\" for humans. The purpose of the trial is to establish which tasks humanoid robots can usefully do and help improve the machine learning and dexterity required to do more. \"We want to try to find out what is really possible,\" says Mr Burzer. \"It's also very important to test how a humanoid robot can be integrated in running production together with our colleagues working here every day.\" Read more:Meet the penguins of the FalklandsBadenoch says UK 2050 net zero target is 'impossible'Two astronauts stuck in space set to return to Earth Texas-based Apptronik is reluctant to make claims as bold as some of their rivals. \"Everyone's ready for a robot to come into their home and do all of their laundry and all the things that they don't want to do. But it's very early on,\" says Mr Cardenas. \"Take the analogy of the shift to the personal computer. We're in the early '80s so at the very beginning.\" Investors seem to believe in a robot-dominated future. One recent forecast sees the humanoid market growing 20-fold in the next eight years, with predictions of a population of tens of millions of the machines by 2050. One major hurdle is the AI brains behind them. Apptronik admits a truly \"general purpose\" robot capable of functioning outside a predictable and controlled environment like a factory won't be possible until computer intelligence can understand the real world like we do. So-called \"world models\" are very much a work in progress for AI developers. So the important questions, like when humanoid robots will steal our jobs, or whether they will go rogue and rise up against us can wait... for a little while at least."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  The eligibility criteria for disability benefits will be narrowed in a bid to slash £5bn from the welfare bill, Liz Kendall has announced.  Speaking in the Commons, the work and pensions secretary said the number of new people claiming personal independence payment (PIP) is \"not sustainable\". Politics live: More welfare cuts not ruled out She said the government will not freeze PIP - as reports had previously suggested - but instead make it harder to qualify for the daily living allowance component. PIP is money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, like washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive. Ms Kendall said that from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points. The changes will not affect the mobility component, Ms Kendall said - but it's unclear how many people will be impacted, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's costings report not due until next week's spring statement.  Warning of 'immense suffering' Charities and unions reacted angrily to the announcement, and several backbench Labour MPs raised concerns. Labour MP Jon Trickett said on X that \"cutting welfare payments to sick people is wrong morally, fiscally and economically\" and he will vote against the measures \"when the time comes\". Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people could die as a result of the cuts, telling MPs the cuts will lead to \"immense suffering\". Charles Gillies, of the Disability Benefit Consortium, warned more disabled people would be pushed into poverty. What other measures have been announced? Ms Kendall also announced a review of the PIP assessment, which she said will be done \"in close consultation with disabled people, the organisations that represent them and other experts\". There will also be a consultation on delaying access to the health top-up on universal credit until someone is 22, with the savings to be reinvested into work support and training opportunities. And the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), which determines if a person is fit for work, will be scrapped in 2028, with financial support for people who are sick or disabled determined solely through the PIP assessment. Ms Kendall described the current WCA system as \"complex\" and \"time-consuming\" for people trying to apply. Other reforms include: • Merging jobseeker's allowance and employment and support allowance • Raising the standard universal credit allowance by £775 in 2029/30 • Introducing a \"right to try\" initiative so people who want to attempt to get back into work won't lose their benefits while they do Ms Kendall said: \"This is a significant reform package that is expected to save over £5bn by 2029.\" Read More:Starmer says welfare bill is 'indefensible'The town where almost a third are out of work  Chancellor looking for savings It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves struggles to balance the books due to a grim economic picture, with further spending cuts expected in her spring statement on 26 March. The cost of long-term sickness and disability benefits for working-age people has risen by £20bn since the pandemic and is forecast to hit £70bn over the next five years. Ministers have said there is also a moral case for change, with one in eight young people not in education, training, or employment - prompting fears of a \"wasted generation\". Ms Kendall said that while more people are now living with a disability, the increase in those seeking disability benefits is disproportionate. Claims among young people are up 150%, while claims for mental health conditions are up 190% and claims for learning difficulties are up over 400%, she said.  Tories 'held our country back' Ms Kendall blamed the Tories for creating a system that is \"holding our country back\". She acknowledged that some people can never work, but said many sick and disabled people want to \"with the right help and support\" and they should \"have the same chances and choices as everyone else\". Reports ahead of the announcements suggested Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband were among the ministers to have voiced concerns in private. But the prime minister's spokesman insisted the government is united in its agreement on the need for reform."

The business and trade committee of MPs was told that the tariffs would damage sales and profits for an industry that is already uncompetitive internationally, mainly due to high energy costs. Tata Steel UK's chief executive Rajesh Nair said $100m (£77m) of sales to the US were in peril. Money latest: Good news for holidaymakers heading to US \"The customers are spooked and the customers are wanting to go to other suppliers to make sure that they don't get caught in the tariff warfare\", he explained. \"So customers are already talking to us and wanting to cancel orders and in some cases are asking us for compensation for potential orders.\" Allan Bell, chief commercial officer at British Steel, said it had already lost business in areas where there was an alternative US supplier. \n                  What Sky's correspondents think about the Trump-Putin phone call\n                 \n                  Trump 100, Day 58: Is America's rule of law being trumped by the law of the ruler? \n                 \n                  Ukraine war: 'We've never been closer to a peace deal' - Trump and Putin to hold talks on ending conflict\n                 He expected to lose further orders in around nine months' time when US customers would be in a better position to source alternative steel products. \"We've got customers that are concerned about the impact of the tariffs and, at the moment, are considering order cancellation.\"  Both stated disappointment over the government's response to date but they did not call for reciprocal tariffs. Instead, the industry demanded speedy action from the Trade Remedy Authority to bolster steel import safeguards as the biggest fear was the UK market being swamped by cheaper alternatives that would have been originally destined for the US.  While the European Union has responded to the US tariffs with counter measures due to take effect on 1 April, the UK has held back while wider trade talks continue with the Trump administration. The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds is due in Washington DC later on Tuesday for talks with US counterparts. In addition to securing possible exemptions during the trip, the steel bosses told the MPs that what was urgently needed from ministers were import safeguards in line with the EU's and further assistance with energy bills to bolster competitiveness. Mr Bell said: \"We are paying 50% more for our wholesale energy than competitors in France and Germany.\""

        "Headline": "If there's anyone who understands Asda it's arguably former chief executive and current chair Allan Leighton. But times have changed since he last was at the helm and competition is fierce. ",
        "Content": "\n          Business presenter\n              @iankingsky\n The air is suddenly full of talk about supermarket price wars. Some £4.4bn was wiped from the stock market valuations of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer on Monday following comments from Allan Leighton, the executive chairman of Asda, on Friday in which he promised the grocer was planning its biggest price cuts in 25 years. Mr Leighton, who returned to Asda last November, said there was a \"war chest\" available to Asda and indicated he was prepared to \"materially\" forego profits in the short term to win back market share. Money blog: 'My Deliveroo order was wrong and it refused to replace it. Is that allowed?' He told The Times: \"We have a long way to go. We're three months into what is going to be three years of really getting the basics of the business right and getting the business to outperform the rest of the industry on a like-for-like basis. \"That's what restores our market share and profitability. It ain't going to happen overnight.\" Those remarks are rightly being taken seriously by investors - by the market close on Monday Tesco shares had fallen by nearly 15% since Friday morning and those of Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's by 10% and 9% apiece. That is because nobody, arguably, knows Asda better than Mr Leighton. What's gone wrong at Asda? It was he, along with current Marks & Spencer chairman Archie Norman, who rescued Asda from collapse in the early 1990s before selling the business to US giant Walmart in 1999. Initially, that transaction appeared to go well, with Asda wresting the number two slot in the UK grocery market from Sainsbury's in 2003. But Walmart's insistence on preserving margins gradually saw its share eroded and the number two slot recaptured by Sainsbury's. By 2019, it was clear Asda was no longer regarded as a core asset by Walmart. That was the year an attempt was made, blocked by competition regulators, to merge the business with Sainsbury's. Worse was to follow. In October 2020, Walmart offloaded a majority stake in the grocer to the petrol forecourts billionaires Mohsin and Zuber Issa and the private equity firm TDR Capital. The debt taken on during the takeover blunted Asda's competitiveness and resulted in it losing market share - mainly to Tesco and Sainsbury's but also to the German hard discounters Aldi and Lidl. It went through a series of managers before TDR Capital bought out Zuber Issa in June last year to take a majority 67.5% stake while Mohsin Issa, who retains 22.5% of the business, relinquished the day-to-day running of the business. A new era Cue the return of Mr Leighton. Within weeks, after Asda was the worst-performing supermarket over the Christmas period, he had announced a 'Big Jan Price Drop' price-cutting campaign which saw average price reductions of 26% on selected products. That was dismissed by rivals, most notably Ken Murphy, the chief executive of market leader Tesco, as not representing a genuine price war. Mr Leighton's response has been to reintroduce the 'Rollback' price-cutting promotions he and Mr Norman introduced in the 1990s in a bid to revive the spirit of the old 'That's Asda Price' campaigns, complete with shoppers patting their back pockets, backed by heavy newspaper and television advertising. It is being seen by industry experts as a wider price-cutting initiative than the more limited campaign Asda had been running to 'price match' Aldi and Lidl. While the price cuts are the most eye-catching initiatives, so far as consumers will be concerned, Mr Leighton has also spent £43m on extending opening hours for some stores and has also bolstered his management team. The most important hire was David Lepley, the group retail director at Morrisons, who was appointed in February as chief supply chain officer - a recognition that Asda needed to sharpen up on its product availability. Can the new boss work his magic again?  The big question many in the industry have is whether Mr Leighton - who has since leaving Asda in 2000 had a spell as chairman of the Co-op - can work his magic again. The grocery market now is very different from the one in the 1990s when Tesco was only in the foothills of the explosive growth it was later to enjoy, first under Lord MacLaurin and then under Sir Terry Leahy, while Sainsbury's was going through a fallow period. Morrisons, which acquired the old Safeway chain in 2004, was also a much smaller business than it is today. Moreover, in the 1990s, the hard discounters Aldi and Lidl - who entered the UK in 1990 and 1994 respectively - had a miniscule market presence. Hard discounting in grocery retail was also less developed than today with the old Kwik-Save chain its leading exponent. In other words, the climate was ripe for a player like Asda to seize share with big, well-targeted price cuts, snappy advertising and, crucially, excellent product availability. Compare that with today. A different time Tesco's market position is as dominant as it has ever been while Sainsbury's is a strongly entrenched number two in the market and a revived Morrisons, under Rami Baitiéh, has also returned to growth. Aldi and Lidl, although the former has recently seen its market share slipping, also remain formidable competitors. Tesco and Sainsbury's, who have benefited more than anyone from Asda's travails, have the most to lose in the event of a turnaround. But they are also better placed than anyone else to withstand one: Tesco's Clubcard is arguably the world's most successful supermarket loyalty and rewards scheme and provides the grocer with data and insights that no one else has, enabling it to react rapidly to changes in the market or to shopper habits. Read more:The town where almost a third are economically inactiveThe way economic data is collected is changing - here's why it matters Sainsbury's is trying to do something similar with Nectar, while both schemes are increasingly able to personalise offers to individual customers, entrenching loyalty. That may become even more important if, as Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's chief executive, asserts, the 'big weekly shop' is becoming more important as working from home becomes less common. Tesco and Sainsbury's sharper than they used to be As the renowned sector watcher Clive Black, analyst at investment bank Shore Capital puts it: \"We need to remember that the listed players are better grocers than Asda with a broader customer set, stronger balance sheets and a will to remain competitive\". He points out that, apart from the advantages bestowed by their loyalty programmes, Tesco and Sainsbury's are sharper on price than they used to be, are able to price-match Aldi meaningfully and offer better ranges and more choice than both the German pair and Asda. That view is shared by the retail team at brokerage Jefferies which has questioned whether Asda's price cuts can deliver the increase in grocery volumes in the time it requires without a fresh injection of capital from shareholders. What about consumers? Will this be good news for consumers? Possibly. But the grocery sector will be hit hard by the forthcoming increase in the national living wage and, more especially, the rise in employer's national insurance contributions announced by Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, in her autumn budget. Those measures will not only push up the costs of supermarkets but also those of their suppliers. Those higher costs will at least be partly passed on to customers. So too will be the cost of implementing new recycling regulations due in October. And, all the while, food price inflation is picking up in staples such as eggs, milk and butter. The British Retail Consortium is expecting food price inflation to be north of 4% during the second half of this year. Accordingly, while Asda's price war may bring some relief, it feels more likely at present as if it will merely result in lower price rises than British shoppers would otherwise have experienced rather than an outright drop in prices across the board."

Sky News has learnt that Modella Capital - one of two remaining bidders for WH Smith's high street arm - has drafted in advisers to explore options for TOFS including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). City sources said on Tuesday that Interpath had been engaged to work on the plans. Money blog: Supermarkets values plummet Modella is said to be examining a CVA with a view to closing underperforming stores and forcing through rent cuts on others. A major distribution centre is also thought to feature in potential proposals for a restructuring. It is not thought to be focused on compromising other classes of creditors. Any so-called 'landlord-led' CVA which triggered store closures would inevitably lead to job losses among TOFS' workforce, which was said to number about 1,800 people at the time of last month's takeover. Further details of the plans, including the timetable for launching a CVA - which requires court and creditor approval - were unclear on Tuesday. TOFS, which sells beauty brands such as L'Oreal, the sportswear label Adidas and DIY tools made by Black & Decker, trades from about 180 stores. The chain, which was founded in 1969, was bought by the private equity firm Duke Street in 2007. Duke Street had tried to sell the business before, having supported it through the COVID-19 pandemic with a cash injection of more than £10m. It sold the company to Modella with no remaining bank debt. The possible CVA at TOFS comes amid a frenetic period of dealmaking for Modella.

        "Content": "By Saywah Mahmood and Kate Schneider, data journalists   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is making major changes to how it gathers some of the UK's most important data. These figures shape decisions on wages, benefits, and public spending. One of the biggest shifts involves how inflation is measured, which is changing on Tuesday. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of everyday essentials like food, energy, and transport, is being updated with a new system that aims to capture price changes more accurately. This matters because inflation figures influence the Bank of England's decisions on interest rates, which in turn affect the cost of borrowing, savings, and even rent. For workers, inflation also plays a role in wage negotiations. This is because when prices rise, there's often pressure on employers and the government to increase salaries, pensions, and benefits. The ONS will continue sending researchers to shops to check prices and speak to retailers, but from this month, a new digital system will speed up how the data is processed. It's also testing a new method using real checkout data from supermarkets. Instead of just recording shelf prices, it will track what people actually pay, including discounts from loyalty schemes like Clubcard and Nectar. This should give a more accurate picture of real spending habits, with full rollout expected by 2026. The change has been brought about over concerns the previous method measured price changes but failed to capture how consumers changed what they buy as a result. Take the example of butter, which has gone up in price by 18% in the past year. That increase was reflected in the CPI, influencing the overall inflation figure. However, many consumers will have switched to a dairy spread or margarine rather than keep paying for the more expensive butter. How is inflation data changing? While this should improve inflation accuracy, tracking individual product prices may become harder. Sky News' Spending Calculator, which helps users track price changes, will need updates and won't be refreshed this month. An ONS spokesperson said: \"From next year we will be replacing much of the physical price collection in supermarkets with information from supermarket tills. While we won't know what each consumer has bought, we will know both the price and quality of items sold in shops up and down the country, marking a step-change in our understanding of inflation and consumer behaviour.\" Data reliability concerns prompt changes While these changes to the inflation data are intended to better reflect consumer behaviour, other changes are being introduced due to concerns over reliability. One of the most affected datasets is the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the UK's largest household study, which measures the state of the labour market and helps shape decisions on interest rates and employment. However, plummeting response rates mean its reliability is now in question. \"I think policymakers just don't have as much trust or confidence in the LFS, so they have to find other ways to get the clear insights they used to rely on the LFS for,\" said Michael McMahon, professor of economics at Oxford and former Bank of England economist. \"The Bank of England has a set of regional agents who will go out and speak to businesses. They'll speak to local bodies and even in some cases do citizens' panels. They were doing that before the LFS issue. It's just they have to rely on these alternatives more, because they can rely less on the LFS.\" The pandemic accelerated these issues when face-to-face LFS interviews were replaced with phone surveys, causing a sharp drop in participation. Internal ONS emails, revealed by the Financial Times, showed how one key estimate's sample size had \"collapsed to only five individuals\" — too small for reliable statistics. Resolution Foundation analysis shows that HMRC payroll and self-employment data aligned with LFS estimates before 2020 but after the pandemic began to diverge. To address this, the ONS is developing the Transformed Labour Force Survey (TLFS), using shorter questionnaires and shifting primarily to online responses, with some face-to-face interviews remaining. Survey issues aren't just affecting job figures, they're also complicating GDP estimates. The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), which tracks incomes and spending and is used for GDP estimates, has seen a sharp drop in response rates, with fewer than one in five forms completed as of December 2024. The survey is particularly time-consuming, requiring participants to log spending for two weeks. A new digital tool allowing receipts to be scanned is in development but won't launch until late 2025. For policymakers, these delays are frustrating. \"It's certainly a moment of embarrassment: the idea that the chancellor and the governor [of the Bank of England] go to G7 meetings, talk to other advanced economies, and explain why we don't know how our labour market is doing with any great confidence,\" said McMahon. Flawed migration data Recent improvements to the way the ONS gathers migration data also highlight significant shortcomings in the recent past. Long-term migration estimates are a vital part of public debate and key policy decisions. Before COVID, migration estimates relied on traveller surveys at airports and ports. These surveys frequently underestimated migration levels, as they depended on people's own predictions about how long they would stay in the UK. Now, the ONS has shifted to using visa records, higher education statistics, and tax data to provide a clearer picture but the ONS still frequently revises it's figures. In November 2024, it increased its estimate for the year ending December 2023 from 695,000 to 866,000, a rise of more than 25%. However, while these changes are making migration data more reliable, they also highlight how much of the political debate on immigration in recent years has been built on incomplete figures. The transition to administrative data is a step forward, but further refinements will be needed to ensure long-term accuracy.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  The eligibility criteria for disability benefits will be narrowed in a bid to slash £5bn from the welfare bill, Liz Kendall has announced.  Speaking in the Commons, the work and pensions secretary said the number of new people claiming personal independence payment (PIP) is \"not sustainable\". Politics live: More welfare cuts not ruled out She said the government will not freeze PIP - as reports had previously suggested - but instead make it harder to qualify for the daily living allowance component. PIP is money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, like washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive. Ms Kendall said that from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points. The changes will not affect the mobility component, Ms Kendall said - but it's unclear how many people will be impacted, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's costings report not due until next week's spring statement.  Warning of 'immense suffering' Charities and unions reacted angrily to the announcement, and several backbench Labour MPs raised concerns. Labour MP Jon Trickett said on X that \"cutting welfare payments to sick people is wrong morally, fiscally and economically\" and he will vote against the measures \"when the time comes\". Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people could die as a result of the cuts, telling MPs the cuts will lead to \"immense suffering\". Charles Gillies, of the Disability Benefit Consortium, warned more disabled people would be pushed into poverty. What other measures have been announced? Ms Kendall also announced a review of the PIP assessment, which she said will be done \"in close consultation with disabled people, the organisations that represent them and other experts\". There will also be a consultation on delaying access to the health top-up on universal credit until someone is 22, with the savings to be reinvested into work support and training opportunities. And the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), which determines if a person is fit for work, will be scrapped in 2028, with financial support for people who are sick or disabled determined solely through the PIP assessment. Ms Kendall described the current WCA system as \"complex\" and \"time-consuming\" for people trying to apply. Other reforms include: • Merging jobseeker's allowance and employment and support allowance • Raising the standard universal credit allowance by £775 in 2029/30 • Introducing a \"right to try\" initiative so people who want to attempt to get back into work won't lose their benefits while they do Ms Kendall said: \"This is a significant reform package that is expected to save over £5bn by 2029.\" Read More:Starmer says welfare bill is 'indefensible'The town where almost a third are out of work  Chancellor looking for savings It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves struggles to balance the books due to a grim economic picture, with further spending cuts expected in her spring statement on 26 March. The cost of long-term sickness and disability benefits for working-age people has risen by £20bn since the pandemic and is forecast to hit £70bn over the next five years. Ministers have said there is also a moral case for change, with one in eight young people not in education, training, or employment - prompting fears of a \"wasted generation\". Ms Kendall said that while more people are now living with a disability, the increase in those seeking disability benefits is disproportionate. Claims among young people are up 150%, while claims for mental health conditions are up 190% and claims for learning difficulties are up over 400%, she said.  Tories 'held our country back' Ms Kendall blamed the Tories for creating a system that is \"holding our country back\". She acknowledged that some people can never work, but said many sick and disabled people want to \"with the right help and support\" and they should \"have the same chances and choices as everyone else\". Reports ahead of the announcements suggested Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband were among the ministers to have voiced concerns in private. But the prime minister's spokesman insisted the government is united in its agreement on the need for reform."

        "Content": " The work and pensions secretary has not ruled out making further cuts to the welfare budget despite already unveiling reforms designed to save £5bn. Liz Kendall said she had made the changes - which will see the eligibility criteria for disability benefits narrowed - because she wanted to \"tackle a failing system that is failing the people who depend on benefits\". Politics live: Kendall 'cross' about welfare system In an interview with Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, the cabinet minister denied the reforms announced today were just a \"drop in the ocean\". She said she had announced a \"substantial package\" - and the changes would also be aimed at getting people into work to stop the overall bill ballooning to a projected £76bn by 2030. Ms Kendall said they would deal with a \"broken assessment process\", fix \"terrible financial incentives\" that force people on to welfare, and would focus benefits \"on those in greatest need\". \"It's providing the largest ever package of employment support,\" she told Rigby. Pressed again on whether she would rule out more savings over the course of this parliament, Ms Kendall replied: \"I'm not saying that. \"I am suggesting we talk about the proposals we are actually making, and not those which we aren't.\"  What changes are being made? Earlier today, Ms Kendall announced a raft of reforms designed to cut the government's expenditure on long-term sickness and disability benefits for working-age people, which has risen by £20bn since the pandemic. High on the agenda were personal independence payments (PIP), which provide money for people who have extra care needs or mobility needs as a result of a disability. People who claim it are awarded points depending on their ability to do certain activities, like washing and preparing food, and this influences how much they will receive.  But Ms Kendall said from November 2026, people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of PIP. Currently, the standard rate is given if people score between eight and 11 points overall, while the enhanced rate applies from 12 points. However, Ms Kendall said the government would not freeze PIP - as reports had previously suggested - following a backlash from Labour MPs. Read more:How is PIP changing?All the planned welfare reforms  Minister 'cross' about welfare system Asked by Rigby whether she had wanted to go further by freezing PIP, Ms Kendall said she had \"never started from a sort of macho, tough position\". \"I've never done politics like that,\" she said. \"This is about real people and real lives.\" Ms Kendall, who ran to be Labour leader in the 2015 leadership race won by Jeremy Corbyn, admitted she was \"cross\" about the state of the welfare system, which she described as \"broken\". \"I've seen in my own constituency people written off to a life that is not the life they hoped for themselves, or their children or their families,\" she said. Addressing critics who have derided the changes as morally wrong, Ms Kendall said: \"What I think is morally wrong is writing off people who could work. \"What's morally wrong is looking at a benefit system where we are spending more and more on the costs of failure. \"And if that continues, the welfare state that we created won't be there for the very people who need it.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       Liz Kendall has today announced changes to the disability support system PIP (Personal Independence Payment). Despite rumours that the government would scrap the benefit altogether, the work and pensions secretary has said PIP is here to stay, but it will be harder to qualify for. Ms Kendall said the reforms will save £5bn a year by the end of the decade. Politics latest: Follow live updates But what is PIP, who is able to get it, what is the government planning to change and who would be impacted? Here's what you need to know. What is PIP? PIP is a tax-free payment given to people to help with the extra costs caused by long-term ill-health or disability. There are two parts to it: It's possible to meet the criteria for one part or both parts, and payments vary for each. Those who qualify for the daily living part are given either a lower rate of £72.65 per week or a higher rate of £108.55, and those who qualify for the mobility part either receive £28.70 or £75.75.  What's changed?  Essentially, rather than freezing PIP, Ms Kendall announced a change to the assessment for the benefit, which is aimed at helping the disabled with the increased cost of living associated with their conditions. People will now need to score at least four points in one activity to qualify. The adaptation will require a change in law, which Ms Kendall said the government plans to do. Reacting to the proposed change, the Disability Benefits Consortium, an umbrella body representing more than 100 charities and organisations, said the cuts were \"cruel\". The consortium's policy co-chairman Charles Gillies said: \"These immoral and devastating benefits cuts will push more disabled people into poverty, and worsen people's health.\" How does the government make its decisions? The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) carries out an assessment to work out the level of help a person should receive. A person's needs are judged on a points system whereby the more severe the impact in a particular area and the greater the help that is required, the more points a person gets and the more money they receive. For example, an applicant will get two points on the daily living score if they need to use an aid or appliance (like a prostheses or easy grip handles on utensils) when cooking a meal, or they will get eight points if they cannot prepare food or cook at all. Similarly for the mobility score, the applicant will get four points if they can stand and move between 50 metres and 200 metres, and 12 points if they can only move between one metre and 20 metres. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 The answers are assessed by health professionals who then provide a report for DWP case managers with recommendations on what to give the applicant, if anything. Applicants can provide assessors with additional medical evidence as part of a claim, but it is not a requirement, as a person's self-assessment about the impact their condition is prioritised when making a decision. Who is currently eligible? People aged between 16-64 can get PIP regardless of whether they work if they expect their difficulties to last for at least 12 months from when they started. Those who have been told they may have 12 months or less to live can also apply and may get PIP more quickly. Read more: All the planned reforms to UK welfare system Sufferers of both physical disability and cognitive or mental health conditions like anxiety can meet the criteria for both types of PIP. There is no list of medical conditions that determine who qualifies for PIP. Instead, applicants are assessed on the level of help they need with specific activities. For the daily living part, people might need help with things like: For the mobility payments, there is assistance for things like:"

Big tests on the horizon \"I think we did expect more by now,\" one MP, who backed her for the leadership, tells me. Is Mrs Badenoch, like Margaret Thatcher, being underestimated by her colleagues early on in her leadership? Or was she overestimated by the party when they elected her leader? \"I'm not going to pretend I don't have critics,\" Mrs Badenoch tells me. \"I'm just asking people to listen to what I am saying.\" What's interesting is the wider Conservative Party machine seem happier than MPs in parliament. Insiders at the Tory HQ tell me MPs are being bogged down by, for example, her performance at PMQs, which doesn't cut through with the public. And it's not long until we know what is cutting through.

He's not wrong. It's no exaggeration to say Reform UK is threatening the Conservatives' chances of ever getting back into government. Just a few weeks ago, Nigel Farage summoned journalists in central London to row back on climate targets. Is the Tory leader playing catch up? Her allies say Reform's climate policy is ill-thought through - hers will take time. Mrs Badenoch will need more time if she is to turn the Tory party's fortunes around, but a ruthless party is already showing impatience."

Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, told Politics Hub With Sophy Ridge smartphone usage in schools is a \"massive problem across the country\". Politics live: Benefits cuts being announced She said there's \"lots of evidence\" to show allowing the devices in classrooms leads to students getting lower GCSE grades - yet only 11% of schools have a full ban. Ms Trott said she is so concerned about the impact of screen time, she has told her own young children - twin boys who are six and a girl who is eight - they won't be getting a smartphone until they are 16. \"I have been very clear with them because I see all this evidence about what social media does to children, and they are not getting a smartphone until they're 16,\" she said. \"And they're already not that happy about it.\" Government resists calls for ban Ms Trott was speaking ahead of a failed Conservative attempt in the Commons for a law that would force headteachers to ban phones in schools. The Labour government has resisted such a move, and a Tory amendment to its Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - also backed by MPs from other parties - was defeated by 317 votes to 159. It was put to Ms Trott the Tories often say they have a proud record of trusting headteachers to make decisions, having pushed for most state schools to become academies under the promise of giving them more freedom.

Ms Trott denied the amendment was a \"gimmick\", saying \"parents, teachers, children are all asking for this\". There have been mixed studies about the merits of banning phones in classrooms. In February, research by the University of Birmingham found restricting mobile phones at school does not improve grades or mental wellbeing, or reduce their overall screen time in a day. But a study from last summer found schools that effectively ban mobile phones see better GCSE results.

But in the face of ministerial opposition, the bill now just calls for chief medical officers to review the evidence on screen-based harms within a year - before deciding if there should be higher age restrictions."

Appearing on Sky News' Breakfast with Wilfred Frost, Pat McFadden was asked if the crackdown on government procurement cards (GPCs) was because civil servants are \"fiddling their expenses\". Politics live: What to expect from benefits cuts He said he would \"not use that phrase\", but added: \"I don't think some of the lines of expenditure I've seen are justified.\" \"This is public money - I think people need to take care with it,\" he said. \"So the process now will be, if people want to have one of these cards, they're going to have to justify why they need it and reapply for it.\" It was announced last night that thousands of GPCs will be cancelled as part of a crackdown on wasteful spending in government. Under the plan, departments and their agencies have been instructed to freeze almost all the 20,000 cards in circulation in a bid to cut the number in use by at least 50%. Civil service cardholders will be forced to reapply and justify that they really need them. If they don't, their cards will be cancelled by the end of the month.

Follow Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcasts app In some situations, such as Foreign Office staff in hostile environments, the cards are justified as \"it's the most convenient way to account for small amounts of expenditure\", Mr McFadden said. The limit on expenditure on the cards, which is currently £2,500, will come down to £500 - with anything above this requiring the approval of a senior civil servant, he added. The crackdown on GPCs is part of a wider drive to cut spending and waste across government, as the chancellor seeks to plug a gap in the public finances in next week's spring statement.  More cuts to come Rachel Reeves has lost £9.9bn of fiscal headroom (the amount she could increase spending or cut taxes without breaking her fiscal rules) since the October budget due to a poor economy and geopolitical events. Last week, it was announced NHS England will be abolished because there is too much duplication with the work the Department of Health and Social Care is doing. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has since indicated he will look to scrap other health-related bodies, while integrated care boards have been asked to cut their budget by half. Later today the government is expected to announce measures to slash around £6bn off the soaring welfare budget, which could see some disability benefits reduced."

        "Content": " Two NASA astronauts have splashed down off the coast of Florida after spending more than nine months stuck in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams waved as they left their capsule - nearly an hour after it returned to Earth at about 6pm local time (10pm UK time). Dolphins were seen swimming nearby while work was under way to remove it from the water.  The astronauts' journey back from the International Space Station took 17 hours. Senior NASA administrator Joel Montalbano described the landing as \"beautiful\" - and said their 150 experiments and 900 hours of research will inform future moon missions. \"The crew's doing great... eventually they'll make their way back to Houston,\" NASA manager Steve Stich said - telling reporters they'll get some \"well-deserved time off\" with their families once debriefs are complete. They were only meant to be on the ISS for eight days when they blasted off from Earth on 5 June last year. They were testing out Boeing's long-awaited Starliner - a vessel designed to rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is currently used to ferry astronauts into space. But by the time they docked at the ISS, the Starliner had suffered major problems - with five helium leaks, five dead manoeuvring thrusters and a propellant valve that failed to close completely. It returned to Earth without them after it was decided Mr Wilmore, 62, and Ms Williams, 59, would be safer waiting in orbit. During their long wait in space, the two US Navy veterans completed spacewalks, experiments and even helped sort out the plumbing onboard the ISS. The astronauts repeatedly said they enjoyed the mission, with Ms Williams describing the space station as her \"happy place\". Swept up in NASA's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels. The SpaceX vehicle that has brought them home arrived at the space station in September carrying NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with two empty seats. The four-person crew, formally part of NASA's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at about 5.45pm local time on Tuesday. Using two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown. The astronauts will soon be flown to their crew quarters at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before NASA flight surgeons allow them to go home to their families. Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.  Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?This is what happens to your health from being in space for so longCrew welcomed to ISS to replace stranded astronauts The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams - and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden had \"abandoned\" them for political reasons. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. Crew Dragon is America's only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams threw its development future into uncertainty. \"We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Mr Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe NASA's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics. \"That's what your nation's human spaceflight program's all about,\" he said. \"Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  One of Tesla's earliest investors has told Sky News that Elon Musk should step aside as the carmaker's chief executive unless he gives up his new government job. Ross Gerber said in an interview with Sky's Business Live that the tycoon and adviser to Donald Trump had lost his focus given his widening interests and was now too \"divisive\". He cited Musk's post-election role at the helm of the Trump administration's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). It has attracted public anger, and protests, over planned swingeing cuts to federal government staff. Money latest: Good news for holidaymakers heading to US Mr Gerber said: \"I think Tesla needs a new CEO and I decided today I was going to start saying it and so this is the first show that I'm saying it on. \"It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.\" Mr Gerber told presenter Darren McCaffrey that the business was \"absolutely\" in crisis and the appointment was among several reasons he had sold off a substantial number of shares in recent months. A slump began shortly before Mr Trump took office, as the first salvoes of the president's trade war were being threatened. Tesla's market value has plunged by more than $800bn since December and it was a further 4% down in US trading on Tuesday.  The business has been struggling on several fronts. Electric car demand appears to have peaked across key Western markets despite steep discounting to boost appeal at a time of continued strain on consumer budgets.

Add the potential for heightened costs due to Mr Trump's trade war, it is of little surprise that investors are concerned. Mr Gerber said that while Tesla's products were undoubtedly the best around, Musk only had 24 hours in the day and he had split his time too thinly since his purchase of Twitter - now called X - in 2022. He added that his social media posts and work with the president since had brought too much negative publicity to Tesla. \"The company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk,\" he said. \"Sales are plummeting so, yeah, it's a crisis. You literally can't sell the best product in the market place because the CEO is so divisive\"."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  A humanoid machine called Apollo has just taken a tentative, slightly jerky, but significant step forward in the robot revolution. The 5'8\" tall robot performed the first public demonstration in a real-world setting of a real-world task - in this case assembling an engine part - entirely autonomously. Clicking two parts together with a twist of its servo-controlled wrists, and handing it to a human colleague is a basic task. But it's also an important moment in the much-hyped world of human-like robot development. \"This is a really big day for us,\" says Jeff Cardenas, chief executive of Apptronik, the US company behind Apollo. \"We're excited to show this off, excited for the public to see the robot live and in person.\" Mercedes-Benz has announced a multimillion-pound investment in Apptronik and is trialling a handful of the humanoid robots at its factory in Berlin and another in Hungary. Investors and industrial firms - particularly carmakers with long experience of using robots in manufacturing - have been closely following the development of human-like robots. The costs of small, lightweight components have fallen as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and computer vision technology have led to rapid advances in the field of robots that can emulate human movement and tasks. But despite a rising number of increasingly impressive-looking cyborgs being unveiled by tech companies in the US and Asia, few have taken their first steps out of the lab. The Apollo robot looks small and underpowered surrounded by the huge robotic arms that weld, bolt and inspect Mercedes' latest cars at the Berlin-Marienfelde plant. But hosting a robot with a human \"form-factor\" is more than just a photo opportunity, according to Mercedes-Benz. \"There's one big advantage,\" says Jorg Burzer, head of production and supply chain management at the German carmaker. \"A humanoid robot is flexible, so you can basically introduce it to an assembly line or internal logistics or quality inspection... you can basically move it from one place to another.\" Introducing a new assembly line, or upgrading an old one with traditional robotic arms is a major investment. A robot that can be adapted to a range of tasks and work alongside humans would avoid that investment. With hands and feet like ours, they can operate tools and work in the same workspaces as people. Apollo can lift more than 25kg and potentially perform repetitive tasks that are, in the words of humanoid robot developers, too \"dull, dirty or dangerous\" for humans. The purpose of the trial is to establish which tasks humanoid robots can usefully do and help improve the machine learning and dexterity required to do more. \"We want to try to find out what is really possible,\" says Mr Burzer. \"It's also very important to test how a humanoid robot can be integrated in running production together with our colleagues working here every day.\" Read more:Meet the penguins of the FalklandsBadenoch says UK 2050 net zero target is 'impossible'Two astronauts stuck in space set to return to Earth Texas-based Apptronik is reluctant to make claims as bold as some of their rivals. \"Everyone's ready for a robot to come into their home and do all of their laundry and all the things that they don't want to do. But it's very early on,\" says Mr Cardenas. \"Take the analogy of the shift to the personal computer. We're in the early '80s so at the very beginning.\" Investors seem to believe in a robot-dominated future. One recent forecast sees the humanoid market growing 20-fold in the next eight years, with predictions of a population of tens of millions of the machines by 2050. One major hurdle is the AI brains behind them. Apptronik admits a truly \"general purpose\" robot capable of functioning outside a predictable and controlled environment like a factory won't be possible until computer intelligence can understand the real world like we do. So-called \"world models\" are very much a work in progress for AI developers. So the important questions, like when humanoid robots will steal our jobs, or whether they will go rogue and rise up against us can wait... for a little while at least."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Climate action will make British people's lives more secure, the UK climate envoy has said. Rachel Kyte's comments come after Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed the country's key climate target would \"bankrupt\" the country and drive a drop in living standards. She told an audience this morning: \"This government has a clear commitment to climate leadership at home and abroad. \"Why? Because this is going to make British people more secure.\" She was appointed as the UK's special representative for climate last year by the current Labour government after it reinstated the role that the Tories had axed under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Ms Kyte said at a conference hosted by Chatham House thinktank today that climate action would boost Britons' security by protecting them from extreme weather like flooding, which has saturated farms and homes, and by encouraging other countries to do more to slow global warming. She was not commenting directly on Ms Badenoch's comments, who earlier on Tuesday had declared the UK's primary climate goal - to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - to be \"impossible\". \n                  Kemi Badenoch says UK target to reach net zero by 2050 'impossible'\n                 \n                  An abundance of marine life - but the wildlife of the Falkland Islands is more vulnerable than most\n                 \n                  What we learnt flying over the world's largest iceberg A23a - and why it's not long for this world\n                 Ms Badenoch said the target \"can't be achieved without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us\".  The Conservative leader did not publish analysis to support these claims, but they are at odds with findings from the UK's climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (the CCC). Last month the CCC said reaching net zero would cost on average 0.2% of UK GDP a year until 2050, requiring upfront investment before saving money. That's because clean electric technologies like heat pumps and EVs, which will eventually replace gas boilers and petrol and diesel cars, run on electricity which will be cheaper than gas or petrol and diesel. Ms Badneoch's comments come in the wake of US President Donald Trump attacking US climate laws - rolling back nature protections and wrenching it out of the landmark Paris Agreement. His actions as head of the world's largest economy and second-biggest polluter have raised fears others may be emboldened to follow suit and ditch their own attempts to go green. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 But Ms Kyte, who as a diplomat does not comment on specific countries or parties, said conversations she has with other countries are about how they green their economies, not if. \"There are no conversations about 'well, maybe we should take a pause in the energy transition',\" she said. \"It's a question of 'how do we learn from what's working? How do we push it forward?'.\" She was speaking on a panel alongside Ana Toni, chief executive of the COP30 climate conference in Brazil this year, who said the transition from fossil fuels to clean technology is \"underway. It's inevitable\". \"We are not saying there won't be a fight. But the [energy transition] is unstoppable.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       Two astronauts stuck in space for more than nine months have finally arrived back on Earth. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams first blasted off to the ISS on 5 June, expecting to be up there for just eight days. However, their problem-plagued Boeing Starliner posed too much of a risk for them to return to Earth, and they had been waiting to come home since then - until they splashed down off the Florida coast on Tuesday. Although nine months is a long time to be in orbit, the pair aren't alone in facing extraordinary circumstances in space. Here are some of the final frontier's memorable incidents. The last Soviet citizen Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev is often dubbed the \"last Soviet citizen\". Mr Krikalev, who passed away in 2022, headed up to the Mir space station on 18 May 1991, along with Britain's first astronaut Helen Sharman. But three months later back on Earth, tanks rolled into Moscow's Red Square, beginning a coup that, while unsuccessful, would ultimately cement the end of the Soviet Union. One after another, former Soviet states declared independence while Mr Krikalev watched from space. His hometown of Leningrad became St Petersburg and by December, the communist superpower fractured into 15 nations. \"For us, it was totally unexpected,\" Mr Krikalev later said, according to Discovery magazine. \"We didn't understand what happened. \"When we discussed all this, we tried to grasp how it would affect the space program.\" The political upheaval back on Earth meant there was little money to bring Mr Krikalev home. What was supposed to be a five-month mission turned into 311 days aboard Mir, twice as long as planned. Read more: What can being in space for so long do to your health? When he finally landed in March 1992, Mr Krikalev was a Russian citizen, having left a member of the USSR. He continued working as an astronaut and eventually logged more than 800 days in space. Apollo-13  The most famous space accident, of course, is the Apollo-13 mission of April 1970. Three astronauts, James Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swiger, were sent on humanity's third lunar landing mission but found their lives at \"real risk\" when their ship's oxygen tank began leaking, according to Dr Teasel Muir-Harmony, head curator of the Smithsonian's Apollo collection. \"They had to immediately shut down as much power as possible inside the spacecraft,\" she said; their fuel cells ran on the escaping oxygen and the astronauts needed them to survive. \"It became clear almost immediately that they were not going to land [on the moon],\" said Dr Muir-Harmony. Instead, they needed to work out how to get home, quickly.  Back on Earth, their dramatic mission was gripping the globe, with people holding vigils for the astronauts. The ship's lunar module, designed to land on the moon's surface with only two astronauts onboard, became the three-person crew's best option for returning to Earth. They climbed into the lander, risking their lives if carbon dioxide built up in the cabin. One example of the incredible resourcefulness of the astronauts during this mission was their hacking of the lunar module's air filters, according to Dr Muir-Harmony. The air filters used in the lander were a different shape from the ones on the main ship, and with three people breathing out carbon dioxide instead of the expected two, the air scrubbers were getting overwhelmed. NASA's engineers back on Earth worked out a way of fashioning the air filters with materials the astronauts could find onboard and then had to verbally describe the workaround as no pictures could be beamed to the crew. \"That's just one small example of the problems they encountered in this unprecedented situation,\" said Dr Muir-Harmony. \"But it [shows] the problem-solving involved in addressing that issue and ultimately returning the astronauts safely back to Earth.\" When the Apollo-13 mission landed back on Earth, six dramatic days after it had blasted off, then-President Richard Nixon called it the \"most meaningful day\" he'd ever experienced. Using the heat of the sun Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman used a stroke of ingenuity while out on a spacewalk in 2010. \"He was trying to fix an antenna that had broken,\" said Ed Kellond-Turner from the UK Space Centre. Mr Reisman needed to connect two power cords in order to warm up the antennae - but while floating out in space, he struck a problem. Both ends of the cable were the same size - one wouldn't fit inside the other. He tried jamming the cables together so hard, he saw \"shavings of metal coming off,\" said Mr Kellond-Turner, until Mr Reisman noticed the time. He realised the sun would rise in about ten minutes and hid the male end of the cable in his fist. As the sun rose, he held out the female end and waited. In space, direct sunlight can reach around 150 degrees so, quickly, the cable heated up. \"This warmed up the metal just enough that it started to expand,\" said Mr Kellond-Turner. The astronaut quickly pulled out the cool male end and managed to plug them together, powering up the antenna. There are dozens of stories of astronauts facing extraordinary circumstances in space, from Christina Cook's extended visit to the ISS giving her the record for the longest woman in space, to astronauts watching as snow-like coolant from their shuttle whipped past the window following a collision with some space debris. Now, Butch Wilmore and Suni Wilmore join the leagues of astronauts with an incredible story to tell."

Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, told Politics Hub With Sophy Ridge smartphone usage in schools is a \"massive problem across the country\". Politics live: Benefits cuts being announced She said there's \"lots of evidence\" to show allowing the devices in classrooms leads to students getting lower GCSE grades - yet only 11% of schools have a full ban. Ms Trott said she is so concerned about the impact of screen time, she has told her own young children - twin boys who are six and a girl who is eight - they won't be getting a smartphone until they are 16. \"I have been very clear with them because I see all this evidence about what social media does to children, and they are not getting a smartphone until they're 16,\" she said. \"And they're already not that happy about it.\" Government resists calls for ban Ms Trott was speaking ahead of a failed Conservative attempt in the Commons for a law that would force headteachers to ban phones in schools. The Labour government has resisted such a move, and a Tory amendment to its Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - also backed by MPs from other parties - was defeated by 317 votes to 159. It was put to Ms Trott the Tories often say they have a proud record of trusting headteachers to make decisions, having pushed for most state schools to become academies under the promise of giving them more freedom. But she said a smartphone ban is a \"safeguarding issue\". Asked if that means headteachers who have not banned them have got it wrong, Ms Trott said: \"Yes they have - absolutely.\" \"The evidence is overwhelming,\" she added. \"We know the impact it has on children and that's why it's important that every school up and down the country has this ban in place.\" Read more:Kids seeing 'unavoidable' violent content'One comment can tip you over the edge'  'Parents are asking for this' Government guidance says schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones, but it's right that school leaders make decisions about what works for their individual settings.

Ms Trott denied the amendment was a \"gimmick\", saying \"parents, teachers, children are all asking for this\". There have been mixed studies about the merits of banning phones in classrooms. In February, research by the University of Birmingham found restricting mobile phones at school does not improve grades or mental wellbeing, or reduce their overall screen time in a day. But a study from last summer found schools that effectively ban mobile phones see better GCSE results. Follow Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcasts app Earlier this month, a backbench Labour MP was forced to water down proposed legislation to stop children \"doom-scrolling\" so it would get government backing. Josh MacAlister had planned for his safer phones legislation to include a ban on the devices in classrooms, a well as raising the \"digital age of consent\" at which social media can be used to 16. But in the face of ministerial opposition, the bill now just calls for chief medical officers to review the evidence on screen-based harms within a year - before deciding if there should be higher age restrictions."
