        "Content": " The White House is looking at trade deals drafted by more than 15 countries, its press secretary has said. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said some deals with countries will be announced \"very soon\". It comes after US Vice President JD Vance said he believes the UK will get a \"great agreement\" because of the president's affection for the country. Last week Donald Trump delayed imposing varying tariffs on the entire world by 90 days last week after global markets reacted with horror. But the trade war with China continues with tariffs of up to 145% on goods going from China to the US and 125% on goods flowing the other way. The UK government has been hopeful of a deal to exempt the UK from Mr Trump's tariffs, and in an interview with the website UnHerd on Tuesday, Mr Vance said he was optimistic that both sides could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n When JD Vance puts a positive spin on somethingâ€¦ that's a win. The US vice president speaks his mind. He relishes in the shock factor. And so his encouraging words about a \"trade deal\" with the UK will have pleased British officials both here in Washington and in London. Speaking to UnHerd, Vance said: \"I think there's a good chance that, yes, we'll come to a great agreement that's in the best interest of both countries.\" Behind the scenes, for many weeks - since well before Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' nearly two weeks ago - British trade negotiators led by the UK's ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, have been negotiating as best they could with the US administration. Their engagement with officials close to Mr Trump has facilitated ministerial meetings and White House-Downing Street phone calls. I am told the UK is \"now in the deal space\". Another source told me the UK was \"in the foothills\" of a deal. But it has not been straightforward, and there is some distance to go. Despite the absence of a trade deficit with the US, and notwithstanding the fondness the president has for the UK, Britain was still dealt a 10% tariff plus 25% on cars. Prior to Trump's Liberation Day, there had been some hope that the UK would achieve some sort of deal to avoid them. But it was clear quite quickly that Mr Trump needed his 'moment'.  Many foreign diplomats, including the British, negotiating on their countries' behalf, were also struggling to achieve substantive negotiations because even those close to the president were not clear on his views, his choices and where he would 'land' on issues. This, incidentally, is an issue that can be applied to many aspects of this Trump administration. \"It's always quite speculative,\" one European diplomat said to me.  The clamour for engagement The challenge since Liberation Day has been to re-engage the White House with the offers already laid out over the past few months. Many countries have been doing this. You can imagine the clamour for engagement. A key question is whether the baseline tariff of 10% (applied to Britain - and now to everyone else following the 90-day pause) is negotiable. Mr Vance's language seems to suggest it is. Read more:Smartphones among items excluded from US tariffsChallenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says PM A deal then between the UK and the US may be \"in the foothills\". Watch for a deal with Australia too soon. But to call it a 'trade deal' with the UK would be misleading. It's an 'economic deal' to reduce the tariffs. It is, however, a large step forward for the UK, which has been trying to engage America in closer trade alignment since Brexit. Questions remain The details of any deal will be fascinating, and it is where the controversy will be. Will the UK reduce its trade barriers on US vehicles? Will this impact UK road safety standards? Will the UK make it easier for US farmers to sell in the UK? And if so, what will struggling UK farmers make of this? Will UK food standards (currently aligned with the EU) need to be lowered? The desired 'landing zone' here for the UK would be improved market access for American farmers, but only in areas where the US meets UK standards. Watch too for a deal on digital services. At the moment, the UK taxes here hit US tech companies. So we're in the foothills, but there is a climb ahead still, and on an untrodden, unpredictable path."

        "Content": "\n          Home news correspondent\n              @Mollie_Malone1\n The Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi has been moved back to Belmarsh prison after an alleged attack at HMP Frankland on Saturday. Three prison officers at the high-security jail in County Durham were attacked with cooking oil before being stabbed with an improvised weapon. Abedi has been transferred to Belmarsh prison in southeast London where he'd previously been found guilty of attacking a prison officer in 2020, along with two other convicted terrorists. Belmarsh is considered the most high-security prison in the UK. Abedi has been moved to the only available highly-controlled 'suite' cell in the country - a standalone self-contained unit monitored by a minimum of five people at any one time, and a prison dog. There are only four such cells across England and Wales.

Meanwhile, the government has said it will commission a review into the incident at HMP Frankland, after suspending access to cooking facilities in separation units, which is where the alleged attack took place. Sky News understands the Prison Officers Association, after visiting staff who were on duty at the category A jail this week, have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling for urgent action in order to protect prison staff in the high-security estate. The union wants to see prison officers working there given stab-proof vests, access to tasers in certain situations, and not just a suspension of self cooking facilities in separation units but a full ban. Separation units house the country's most dangerous and violent criminals.

Sky News also understands there was an incident on Tuesday lunchtime at HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire. A specialist 'response group' consisting of officers from outside the prison were deployed to bring the situation under control, along with a 'hostage' situation, while prisoners climbed on the roof and netting. The situation was brought under control within an hour. Prisons minister Lord Timpson said it was \"another sign of the problems we are facing in our prison with prisons that are overcrowded and violent\"."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n        The family of a man who committed murder during an escape from a secure mental health unit have told Sky News they were \"failed\" by the trust that was meant to be caring for him.  Joshua Carroll is currently waiting to be sentenced for the murder of Headley Thomas, known as Barry, after beating him to death in a park in Trafford, Manchester, in September 2022. At the time of the attack, Joshua was in the care of Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH). He was being treated as an inpatient at Park House, a unit which has now closed down. Joshua's mum and sister say he escaped from the unit 21 times - and they repeatedly complained to the trust and asked for help. Leanne Carroll, Joshua's sister, told Sky News: \"The night it happened, Joshua had come to my house. And it was just a normal 'oh Joshua has escaped from hospital again'. Nothing appeared any different.\" She says they didn't find out about what had happened until Joshua was arrested weeks later - and \"everything fell apart from there\". \"My heart broke,\" said Joshua's mum, Julie Carroll. \"It's just a horrible, horrible situation.\" \n                  Woman identified a year after her body was found in River Mersey in Manchester\n                 \n                  Man found guilty of murdering pensioner - whose dismembered body was scattered across Manchester\n                 \n                  Cornwall: Men found guilty of Â£100m cocaine fishing boat plot\n                 Joshua had been diagnosed with conditions including schizoaffective disorder, and had been in and out of inpatient care for around 15 years, his family said. They showed me more than 20 pages of complaints and responses from GMMH about his repeated escapes, dating back eight years before the murder. After Joshua's fourth escape from Park House, his family asked for him to be moved to another unit, saying they were concerned about security. This didn't happen, with the trust citing capacity issues. His family complained once again about his escapes just five weeks before the murder, in August 2022. \"We are very, very angry and disappointed,\" said Julie. \"You think if your child is in hospital, and they are very poorly, that they are going to be looked after - they will be safe and they will be secure. But that wasn't the case for Josh.\" Although Joshua was convicted of murder, Leanne says his family hold GMMH partly responsible. \"If you had done your job properly - none of this would have happened,\" she said. \"Two families wouldn't have been destroyed and so many hearts wouldn't have been broken.\" Since 2022, GMMH has been served with several Section 29A warning notices by the Care Quality Commission. These are issued when the commission decides a service needs to make significant improvements, and there is a risk of harm. In the case of GMMH, their concerns included \"ward security systems not consistently keeping people safe\". Dr John Mulligan is a clinical psychologist for GMMH, working in the community for the early intervention in psychosis service, and a representative for the union Unite. He and his colleagues have been going on strike repeatedly across the past seven months, saying they just don't have the staffing levels they need to keep people safe. \"Thankfully, violent incidents among our service users are quite rare, they are much more likely to be the victims of violence and aggression,\" he said. \"But serious incidents are happening regularly. Far too regularly. \"It's very upsetting for staff and for patients and families.\" Salli Midgley, chief nurse at the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust said: \"On behalf of GMMH, we express our heartfelt condolences to Headley Thomas's loved ones at this very sad time. \"Our thoughts and sympathies remain with everyone who has been affected by this most devastating incident. We are deeply sorry that it happened while Joshua Carroll was under our care. \"Under the trust's new leadership, we have been working closely with NHS England, our commissioners and the CQC to create better, safer and well-led services for all.\" She continued: \"A huge amount of progress has already been made but we know we still have a lot to do to improve our services. \"As part of this work, we are currently carrying out an in-depth investigation into the care and treatment provided to Mr Carroll, and the circumstances leading to Mr Thomas' death, the findings of which will be shared with NHS England. \"We are unable to comment further on this case whilst the investigation is ongoing.\" Barry Thomas's family told Sky News mental health is a very serious issue - but they believe Joshua Carroll tried to \"play down his actions\". They said: \"Let's all remember that a life was taken. Our brother, father, and uncle. The evidence the police gathered was in plain sight for all to see. \"We, the family, would like to thank all the police involved for the work they have done, in bringing justice for Barry.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said it is \"likely\" that British Steel will be nationalised. It comes after he appeared to row back on his claim that he would not bring a Chinese company into the steel sector again after the government had to urgently step in to save the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. Mr Reynolds, speaking to reporters in the Lincolnshire town, said that nationalisation was the \"likely option at this stage\". He added: \"What we are now going to do, having secured both control of the site and the supply of raw materials, so the blast furnaces won't close in a matter of days, is work on the future. \"We've got the ownership question, which is pressing. \"I was clear when I gave the speech in parliament - we know there is a limited lifespan of the blast furnaces, and we know that what we need for the future is a private sector partner to come in and work with us on that transformation and co-fund that transformation.\" Reynolds rows back Mr Reynolds said he would look at Chinese firms \"in a different way\" following the race to save British Steel, but did not rule out their involvement completely. The comments were at odds with his previous remarks to Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, when he said he would not \"personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\" again, describing steel as a \"sensitive area\" in the UK. The government has taken over British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, after talks with its Chinese owners, Jingye, broke down. Politics latest: US 'working very hard' on negotiating 'great' UK trade deal The company recently cancelled orders for supplies of the raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running, sparking a race against time to keep it operational. Materials secured by the government arrived at the site on Tuesday, but questions remain about the long-term future of British Steel and whether it will be fully nationalised or the private sector will get involved. Earlier on Tuesday, industry minister Sarah Jones said she is \"not ruling out\" the possibility of another Chinese partner. She said having a pragmatic relationship with Beijing, the world's second-biggest economy, is still important and stringent tests would apply \"to a Chinese company as they would to any other company\".  Asked for clarity on his position during a visit to the port of Immingham, where materials from two ships are being unloaded and transported to the plant, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think we've got to recognise that steel is a sensitive sector. \"A lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from production and dumping of steel products... so I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way. \"But I'm really keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest, and we had to take the action we did.\" Explainer: Why has the government rescued British Steel? The materials that arrived on Tuesday, including coking coal and iron, are enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, the Department for Business and Trade said. They are needed because if the furnaces cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Science correspondent There's no switch that easily turns a blast furnace on and off. Temperatures inside can approach 2,000C and to protect the structure the interior is lined with ceramic insulation. But the ceramic bricks expand and contract depending on the temperature, and any change needs to be done carefully over several weeks to stop them cracking. Molten material inside the furnace also needs to be drained by drilling a hole through the wall of the furnace. It's a dangerous and expensive process, normally only ever done when thereâ€™s a major planned refurbishment. That's why the government wants to keep the furnaces at Scunthorpe burning. The problem is, supplies for the furnaces are running low.  They need pellets of iron ore â€“ the main raw material for making steel.  And they also need a processed form of coal called coke â€“ the fuel that provides both the heat and the chemical reaction to purify the iron so itâ€™s ready to make strong steel alloy. Without a fresh supply of both the furnaces may have to be turned off in just a fortnight. And that would be a complex, costly nightmare the government wants to avoid. 'Chinese ownership truly dreadful' Opposition politicians have accused China of sabotage to increase reliance on its steel products, and want the country to be prevented from future dealings not only with steel but any UK national infrastructure. Veteran Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to define which industries are \"strategic\" - and prevent China from being allowed to invest in such sectors. Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said reverting to Chinese ownership would be like finding \"your house ransacked and then leaving your doors unlocked\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the same position, saying the thought the government \"could even contemplate another Chinese owner of British steel is truly dreadful\", and that he would not have China \"in our nuclear program, anywhere near our telecoms or anything else\". \"They are not our friends,\" he added. Number 10 said on Monday that it was not aware of any \"sabotage\" at the plant and there is no block on Chinese companies. The Chinese embassy has urged the British government not to \"politicise\" the situation by \"linking it to security issues\", saying it is \"an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Jingye reported losses of around Â£700k a day at Scunthorpe, which will now come at a cost to the taxpayer after emergency legislation on Saturday allowed the government to take it over. During Tuesday morning's interview round, Ms Jones said the government had offered Jingye money in return for investment and \"we think that there is a model there that we could replicate with another private sector company\". But she said there \"isn't another private sector company there waiting in the wings\" currently, and that it may be a \"national solution\" that is needed. She said \"all of the options\" were expensive but that it would have cost more to the taxpayer to allow the site to shut. A YouGov poll shows the majority of the public (61%) support the government's decision to nationalise British Steel."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy previously shared videos of the aftermath of Russia's Palm Sunday attack, showing dead bodies in the middle of a street in Sumy. The Ukrainian president said \"only scoundrels can act like this\" and called for \"tough reaction from the world\" in posts on social media. Meanwhile, Ukraine's foreign ministry said one of the children injured was a baby girl born this year, adding \"even newborns are targets for Russia's crimes\". NATO on Tuesday reaffirmed its \"unwavering\" support for Ukraine as the alliance's secretary-general visited the country. As he met with Mr Zelenskyy at a hospital in Odesa, Mark Rutte said: \"I'm here today because I believe Ukraine's people deserve real peace, real safety and security in their country, in their homes.\" Mr Rutte also said he and Mr Zelenskyy had discussed the Trump administration's peace talks with both Russia and Ukraine. \"These discussions are not easy - not least in the wake of this horrific violence - but we all support President Trump's push for peace,\" he said. Read more:Russia jails four journalistsTrump blames Zelenskyy for war His comment came after Mr Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia. Rebutting this, Mr Rutte added: \"Russia is the aggressor, Russia started this war. There's no doubt.\" It also follows Russian and Ukrainian diplomats accusing each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. \"The Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,\" Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said, adding that Moscow would provide a list of Kyiv's attacks from the past three weeks. Andrii Sybiha, his Ukrainian counterpart, dismissed the claim saying on Saturday that Russia launched \"almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 [exploding] drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians\" since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes."

        "Content": " Social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney has told Sky News discussion about transgender rights should not be political. Mulvaney, who documented her own transition in a viral TikTok series, was speaking ahead of a Supreme Court judgment in London on Wednesday about how women are defined in law. The 28-year-old US social media personality told Sky's Barbara Serra on The World: \"I've seen my family completely accept me and love me. And I think that that's why I haven't given up on any person or any group of people.\"   She also called for \"transness\" to no longer be a political topic - \"because it shouldn't be\". \"We're just humans trying our best,\" she said. \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \n                  UK-US agreement may be 'in the foothills' but to call it a 'trade deal' would be misleading\n                 \n                  Trump threatens Harvard with possibility of losing tax exempt status amid row with university\n                 On Donald Trump's first day back in office, he signed an executive order directing the US government to recognise only two, biologically distinct sexes - male and female. And he directed the state department to change its policies to only issue passports that \"accurately reflect the holder's sex\". The administration has said the policy does not constitute unlawful sex discrimination, does not prevent transgender people from travelling abroad, and is vital to addressing the concerns the order raised that indeterminate definitions of sex undermine \"longstanding, cherished legal rights and values\". Asked about Mr Trump's policies, Mulvaney said: \"It's a sad thing to see someone trying to take away the rights of humans that are just trying to live their lives. Again, we're not monsters. We're people that have woken up and stepped into our authentic selves. For me, that's a very camp, fun, feminine human being who also happens to be a woman. \"And I think what I'm now excited [for] is to step into this next chapter of my life and realise that there are so many other trans people who should be speaking on those things. And I'm finding my way in right now, which is through theatre.\" What's the background to the court case? The landmark Supreme Court case, where five judges at the UK's top court heard arguments last November, is the culmination of a challenge brought by For Women Scotland (FWS) over whether trans women can be regarded as female for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. Wednesday's ruling may have a big influence over how sex-based rights are applied through the act across Scotland, England and Wales, including implications for the running of single-sex spaces. Campaigners from FWS say sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. They are challenging the Scottish government, which says they should also include trans people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The FWS action is seeking to overturn a decision by the Scottish courts in 2023 which found treating someone with a GRC as a woman under the Equality Act was lawful. What have the two sides said? Ruth Crawford KC, for the Scottish government, told the court last November that a person with a GRC, which she said was a document legally recognising a change of sex and gender, was entitled to the \"protection\" afforded to their acquired gender as set out in the 2010 Equality Act. But Aidan O'Neill KC, representing FWS, said \"sex just means sex, as that word and the words woman and man are understood and used in ordinary, everyday language, used every day in everyday situations by ordinary people\". Mr O'Neill called for the court to take account of \"the facts of biological reality rather than the fantasies of legal fiction\". The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges brought by FWS over the definition of \"woman\" in the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, which mandates 50% female representation on public boards. Beer brand ad controversy In 2023, US sales of Bud Light fell and profits dropped following a boycott of the beer brand after it made a promotional deal with Mulvaney. Many conservatives, including former US presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, stopped buying Bud Light after Mulvaney posted an ad for the brand on her social media account and shared an image of a personalised can. Mulvaney told Barbara Serra that for \"writing my book I really wanted to make good of a really dark situation that was happening when I took an unexpected beer brand ad\". \"And I think that while that was such a dark period of time in my life, and I think a lot of trans people's lives, I really wanted to show that if you keep going, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm feeling happy and healthy in my life right now,\" she said. Mulvaney is starring in a new musical in London, called We Aren't Kids Anymore, starting later this month."

        "Headline": "Sky News verifies video of an execution at Zamzam, and finds footage linking one of those present to the nearby RSF presence.",
        "Content": "By Sam Doak, OSINT producer   On 11 April, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its affiliates attacked Zamzam camp in North Darfur. The RSF is a paramilitary organisation comprised of militias that used to be be aligned with Sudan's government. For exactly two years it has been been locked in a civil war with the government's Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). Both sides have been accused of human rights abuses over the course of the conflict. After the capture of Zamzam, the RSF claimed in a statement released on Telegram that the camp was being used as a barracks, accusing the SAF of using civilians as \"human shields\". It further claimed, \"the Rapid Support Forces were able to secure civilians during the liberation operation and prevent them from being harmed\". Satellite imagery and footage from the ground paints a darker picture, showing the execution of an unarmed man and widespread fires within the camp at the time of its capture. Zamzam sits just to the south of Al Fashir, North Darfur's capital city, which has been a key target of the RSF in recent months. \n                  Sudan summit in London is a worthwhile endeavour but lacks ambition\n                 \n                  UK announces Â£120m aid package for Sudan - as Lammy warns 'much of the world continues to look away'\n                 \n                  UN aid chief 'demands answers' over Israeli attack that killed 15 aid workers in Gaza\n                 Filming of an execution Shortly after the RSF attack began on 11 April, a video began circulating on social media. It shows a group of gunmen standing over two unarmed men and a child. One of the men squats in front of a gunman holding an assault rifle. The gunman shoots him at close range, killing him. The child, less than a meter away, lies face down with his hands covering the back of his head. While the footage does not contain much contextual information, the person filming turns the camera to his face before showing a close-up view of the dead body behind him. Sky News has geolocated a second video showing the same man, wearing the same clothing and equipment, at another location within the camp at the time of its capture. The footage shows the fighter with a group of gunmen celebrating as they enter a compound in the south of the camp. Gunfire can be heard, and smoke rises from nearby as the group cheer. At one point, a uniformed fighter wearing an RSF patch can be seen, confirming that at least this individual is affiliated with the organisation. Both videos appear to have been filmed within a short timeframe. The fighter seen in both videos is wearing the same head covering, clothing and tactical gear. The pattern on his head covering is oriented identically in both, suggesting it has not been removed in the time between filming. Widespread fires Available footage and satellite images show the RSF's capture of Zamzam was closely followed by fires being lit across the camp. In one video, a man in an RSF uniform can be seen driving on the camp's main road while thick smoke rises from nearby fires. Data from FIRMS, a NASA project that uses satellite data to detect thermal anomalies, provides a wider view. Following the arrival of the RSF on 11 April, fires were detected across the south and east of the camp. More fires were detected in the east and south on 12 April, with areas in the north of the camp being affected on the 13 April. Satellite images form Maxar confirm buildings burned across the south of the camp on April 11, close to where fighters were seen. On Tuesday, the African Union and European government's including the UK called for an immediate cessation of the hostilities in which tens of thousands of people have been killed in the last two years.

        "Content": "Rat nests and dead rodents have been discovered on Gene Hackman's property, after the actor's wife Betsy Arakawa died of hantavirus - which can be caught from such animals. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found on 26 February, in separate rooms of their Sante Fe home, along with one of their dogs. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities have released a report detailing some of Arakawa's last emails and internet searches, revealing she was investigating information on flu-like symptoms before she died. A separate report by the local health department included an environmental assessment that found evidence of the presence of rats throughout many of the buildings on the late actor's estate.   Arakawa died after developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) around 11 February, a pathologist said. This is a disease that can be caught from exposure to rodents and includes flu-like symptoms, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, according to investigators. The presence of rodents was found in several outbuildings across the property and a live rodent, a dead rodent and nests were found in three other garages. Live traps were also said to have been found on the property. There has so far been no confirmation about any potential link between the rodents and the hantavirus disease that claimed Arakawa's life. Last internet searches and emails Arakawa had open bookmarks on her computer which showed she was actively researching medical conditions linked to COVID and flu-like symptoms. She also mentioned in an email to her masseuse that Hackman had woken up on 11 February with flu-like symptoms so she would reschedule her appointment for the next day \"out of an abundance of caution\". Authorities are expected to release more information soon, including redacted police body camera footage. The materials were released as the result of a recent court order after the Hackman estate and family sought to keep the records sealed, citing the family's right to privacy. Read more from Sky News:Man admits murdering women in Xmas attacksFelling of ancient oak tree reported to policeMurder arrest after house explosion Couple found dead The two-time Oscar winner was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's when he died of heart disease. It was likely he was alone for around a week with the body of his wife after she had died first. Dr Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner for New Mexico, told reporters Arakawa was believed to have died around 11 February. What is HPS? HPS, commonly known as hantavirus disease, is a respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses - which are carried by several types of rodents. It is a rare condition in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. The New Mexico Department of Health said hantaviruses are spread by the saliva, droppings and urine of infected rodents, which in North America is most likely to be the eastern deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The virus is often transmitted through the air when people sweep out sheds or clean closets where mice have been living, or by eating food contaminated with mouse droppings. It is not transmissible from person to person, Dr Jarrell said. The likelihood of death is between 38-50% and there is no cure, treatment or vaccine, but patients have a better chance of survival with an early diagnosis."

        "Content": "\n          Home news correspondent\n              @Mollie_Malone1\n The Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi has been moved back to Belmarsh prison after an alleged attack at HMP Frankland on Saturday. Three prison officers at the high-security jail in County Durham were attacked with cooking oil before being stabbed with an improvised weapon. Abedi has been transferred to Belmarsh prison in southeast London where he'd previously been found guilty of attacking a prison officer in 2020, along with two other convicted terrorists. Belmarsh is considered the most high-security prison in the UK. Abedi has been moved to the only available highly-controlled 'suite' cell in the country - a standalone self-contained unit monitored by a minimum of five people at any one time, and a prison dog. There are only four such cells across England and Wales.

Meanwhile, the government has said it will commission a review into the incident at HMP Frankland, after suspending access to cooking facilities in separation units, which is where the alleged attack took place. Sky News understands the Prison Officers Association, after visiting staff who were on duty at the category A jail this week, have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling for urgent action in order to protect prison staff in the high-security estate. The union wants to see prison officers working there given stab-proof vests, access to tasers in certain situations, and not just a suspension of self cooking facilities in separation units but a full ban. Separation units house the country's most dangerous and violent criminals.

Sky News also understands there was an incident on Tuesday lunchtime at HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire. A specialist 'response group' consisting of officers from outside the prison were deployed to bring the situation under control, along with a 'hostage' situation, while prisoners climbed on the roof and netting. The situation was brought under control within an hour. Prisons minister Lord Timpson said it was \"another sign of the problems we are facing in our prison with prisons that are overcrowded and violent\"."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n        The family of a man who committed murder during an escape from a secure mental health unit have told Sky News they were \"failed\" by the trust that was meant to be caring for him.  Joshua Carroll is currently waiting to be sentenced for the murder of Headley Thomas, known as Barry, after beating him to death in a park in Trafford, Manchester, in September 2022. At the time of the attack, Joshua was in the care of Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (GMMH). He was being treated as an inpatient at Park House, a unit which has now closed down. Joshua's mum and sister say he escaped from the unit 21 times - and they repeatedly complained to the trust and asked for help. Leanne Carroll, Joshua's sister, told Sky News: \"The night it happened, Joshua had come to my house. And it was just a normal 'oh Joshua has escaped from hospital again'. Nothing appeared any different.\" She says they didn't find out about what had happened until Joshua was arrested weeks later - and \"everything fell apart from there\". \"My heart broke,\" said Joshua's mum, Julie Carroll. \"It's just a horrible, horrible situation.\" \n                  Woman identified a year after her body was found in River Mersey in Manchester\n                 \n                  Man found guilty of murdering pensioner - whose dismembered body was scattered across Manchester\n                 \n                  Cornwall: Men found guilty of Â£100m cocaine fishing boat plot\n                 Joshua had been diagnosed with conditions including schizoaffective disorder, and had been in and out of inpatient care for around 15 years, his family said. They showed me more than 20 pages of complaints and responses from GMMH about his repeated escapes, dating back eight years before the murder. After Joshua's fourth escape from Park House, his family asked for him to be moved to another unit, saying they were concerned about security. This didn't happen, with the trust citing capacity issues. His family complained once again about his escapes just five weeks before the murder, in August 2022. \"We are very, very angry and disappointed,\" said Julie. \"You think if your child is in hospital, and they are very poorly, that they are going to be looked after - they will be safe and they will be secure. But that wasn't the case for Josh.\" Although Joshua was convicted of murder, Leanne says his family hold GMMH partly responsible. \"If you had done your job properly - none of this would have happened,\" she said. \"Two families wouldn't have been destroyed and so many hearts wouldn't have been broken.\" Since 2022, GMMH has been served with several Section 29A warning notices by the Care Quality Commission. These are issued when the commission decides a service needs to make significant improvements, and there is a risk of harm. In the case of GMMH, their concerns included \"ward security systems not consistently keeping people safe\". Dr John Mulligan is a clinical psychologist for GMMH, working in the community for the early intervention in psychosis service, and a representative for the union Unite. He and his colleagues have been going on strike repeatedly across the past seven months, saying they just don't have the staffing levels they need to keep people safe. \"Thankfully, violent incidents among our service users are quite rare, they are much more likely to be the victims of violence and aggression,\" he said. \"But serious incidents are happening regularly. Far too regularly. \"It's very upsetting for staff and for patients and families.\" Salli Midgley, chief nurse at the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust said: \"On behalf of GMMH, we express our heartfelt condolences to Headley Thomas's loved ones at this very sad time. \"Our thoughts and sympathies remain with everyone who has been affected by this most devastating incident. We are deeply sorry that it happened while Joshua Carroll was under our care. \"Under the trust's new leadership, we have been working closely with NHS England, our commissioners and the CQC to create better, safer and well-led services for all.\" She continued: \"A huge amount of progress has already been made but we know we still have a lot to do to improve our services. \"As part of this work, we are currently carrying out an in-depth investigation into the care and treatment provided to Mr Carroll, and the circumstances leading to Mr Thomas' death, the findings of which will be shared with NHS England. \"We are unable to comment further on this case whilst the investigation is ongoing.\" Barry Thomas's family told Sky News mental health is a very serious issue - but they believe Joshua Carroll tried to \"play down his actions\". They said: \"Let's all remember that a life was taken. Our brother, father, and uncle. The evidence the police gathered was in plain sight for all to see. \"We, the family, would like to thank all the police involved for the work they have done, in bringing justice for Barry.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said it is \"likely\" that British Steel will be nationalised. It comes after he appeared to row back on his claim that he would not bring a Chinese company into the steel sector again after the government had to urgently step in to save the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. Mr Reynolds, speaking to reporters in the Lincolnshire town, said that nationalisation was the \"likely option at this stage\". He added: \"What we are now going to do, having secured both control of the site and the supply of raw materials, so the blast furnaces won't close in a matter of days, is work on the future. \"We've got the ownership question, which is pressing. \"I was clear when I gave the speech in parliament - we know there is a limited lifespan of the blast furnaces, and we know that what we need for the future is a private sector partner to come in and work with us on that transformation and co-fund that transformation.\" Reynolds rows back Mr Reynolds said he would look at Chinese firms \"in a different way\" following the race to save British Steel, but did not rule out their involvement completely. The comments were at odds with his previous remarks to Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, when he said he would not \"personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\" again, describing steel as a \"sensitive area\" in the UK. The government has taken over British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, after talks with its Chinese owners, Jingye, broke down. Politics latest: US 'working very hard' on negotiating 'great' UK trade deal The company recently cancelled orders for supplies of the raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running, sparking a race against time to keep it operational. Materials secured by the government arrived at the site on Tuesday, but questions remain about the long-term future of British Steel and whether it will be fully nationalised or the private sector will get involved. Earlier on Tuesday, industry minister Sarah Jones said she is \"not ruling out\" the possibility of another Chinese partner. She said having a pragmatic relationship with Beijing, the world's second-biggest economy, is still important and stringent tests would apply \"to a Chinese company as they would to any other company\".  Asked for clarity on his position during a visit to the port of Immingham, where materials from two ships are being unloaded and transported to the plant, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think we've got to recognise that steel is a sensitive sector. \"A lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from production and dumping of steel products... so I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way. \"But I'm really keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest, and we had to take the action we did.\" Explainer: Why has the government rescued British Steel? The materials that arrived on Tuesday, including coking coal and iron, are enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, the Department for Business and Trade said. They are needed because if the furnaces cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Science correspondent There's no switch that easily turns a blast furnace on and off. Temperatures inside can approach 2,000C and to protect the structure the interior is lined with ceramic insulation. But the ceramic bricks expand and contract depending on the temperature, and any change needs to be done carefully over several weeks to stop them cracking. Molten material inside the furnace also needs to be drained by drilling a hole through the wall of the furnace. It's a dangerous and expensive process, normally only ever done when thereâ€™s a major planned refurbishment. That's why the government wants to keep the furnaces at Scunthorpe burning. The problem is, supplies for the furnaces are running low.  They need pellets of iron ore â€“ the main raw material for making steel.  And they also need a processed form of coal called coke â€“ the fuel that provides both the heat and the chemical reaction to purify the iron so itâ€™s ready to make strong steel alloy. Without a fresh supply of both the furnaces may have to be turned off in just a fortnight. And that would be a complex, costly nightmare the government wants to avoid. 'Chinese ownership truly dreadful' Opposition politicians have accused China of sabotage to increase reliance on its steel products, and want the country to be prevented from future dealings not only with steel but any UK national infrastructure. Veteran Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to define which industries are \"strategic\" - and prevent China from being allowed to invest in such sectors. Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said reverting to Chinese ownership would be like finding \"your house ransacked and then leaving your doors unlocked\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the same position, saying the thought the government \"could even contemplate another Chinese owner of British steel is truly dreadful\", and that he would not have China \"in our nuclear program, anywhere near our telecoms or anything else\". \"They are not our friends,\" he added. Number 10 said on Monday that it was not aware of any \"sabotage\" at the plant and there is no block on Chinese companies. The Chinese embassy has urged the British government not to \"politicise\" the situation by \"linking it to security issues\", saying it is \"an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years\". ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Jingye reported losses of around Â£700k a day at Scunthorpe, which will now come at a cost to the taxpayer after emergency legislation on Saturday allowed the government to take it over. During Tuesday morning's interview round, Ms Jones said the government had offered Jingye money in return for investment and \"we think that there is a model there that we could replicate with another private sector company\". But she said there \"isn't another private sector company there waiting in the wings\" currently, and that it may be a \"national solution\" that is needed. She said \"all of the options\" were expensive but that it would have cost more to the taxpayer to allow the site to shut. A YouGov poll shows the majority of the public (61%) support the government's decision to nationalise British Steel."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  It was Margaret Thatcher who famously said that in politics, the unexpected always happens. And the latest evidence for that is a series of bizarre twists in the political fallout over Scunthorpe steelworks and China. First, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has unexpectedly performed a shock U-turn on Chinese involvement in steel. And second, those sworn Brexit enemies the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have agreed on one thing: they want nothing to do with China. Politics latest: US 'working very hard' with UK on negotiating 'great' trade deal So is Mr Reynolds' U-turn the result of being nobbled by Number 10? It certainly looks like it, given what appeared to be a Downing Street slap-down on Monday. On Sunday, he told Sir Trevor Phillips on Sky News: \"I wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.\" Pressed by Sir Trevor, he said: \"I wouldn't, no. I think steel is a very sensitive area.\" He even accused David Cameron - who famously took the Chinese president for a pint in a pub - and George Osborne of being \"far too naive\" about China. And when Sir Trevor said: \"There's a high trust bar now, isn't there?\" Mr Reynolds replied: \"Yes, we've got to recognise that.\" Two days later, pressed on his Sky News interview during a visit to Immingham docks, he said: \"In this case, our difference of opinion on the future was with a specific company. \"I know there's a lot of interest in the wider UK-China relationship, understandably so. But this was about this company.\" And he added: \"I'm really keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in because it was one specific companyâ€¦\" So that's clear then? Or is it? What's changed? What changed is that on Monday, Number 10 insisted there was no block on China from essential industries, even steel. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"We already a have a rigorous regime for assessing any involvement in critical infrastructure. That includes looking at the role of China in our supply chains and investment infrastructure.\" Got that, Mr Reynolds? He has now, obviously. Nigel Farage hasn't. \"The very thought the government could even contemplate another Chinese owner of British Steel is truly dreadful,\" the Reform UK leader declared while campaigning in Durham. \"There's no such thing as a private company in China. They're all effectively under the control of the Chinese Communist Party. Clearly, the government has learned nothing if they're prepared to say this. \"I would go further. I wouldn't have China in our nuclear programme, anywhere near our telecoms or anything else. They are not our friends.\" Guess who agrees with that? \"Giving another Chinese firm ownership of British Steel would be like coming home to find your house ransacked and then leaving your doors unlocked!\" said an outraged Lib Dem MP, Calum Miller. No doubt, the Lib Dems are outraged by China's refusal to allow their MP Wera Hobhouse being denied entry into Hong Kong to visit her newborn grandson. And who can blame them? Mr Farage also spoke about visiting the Scunthorpe blast furnaces last week, claiming: \"Not, by the way, an out-of-character thing for me to do, because I worked for 22 years in the metals business before getting involved in politics.\" Read more:Why did British Steel need saving?Sunak's former aide among charged with election betting offences Really? The metals business? Well, Mr Farage certainly has some brass neck. He was, in fact, a commodities trader in the City of London. OK, so presumably those commodities did include metal. And what of the government? Despite Mr Reynolds accusing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne of naivety, Sir Keir Starmer's senior ministers have actively wooed China too. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, visited China in January to promote \"new opportunities\" for investment. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, signed up to close ties with China on energy during a visit last month and Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, has been in China this week. Yet former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has insisted ministers must ban China from critical infrastructure and claimed former Labour prime minister Clement Attlee \"would be turning in his grave\". And what of Margaret Thatcher and her famous quote? Well, it was the Iron Lady herself who privatised British Steel in the 1980s - and opened the door to Chinese involvement."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n When JD Vance puts a positive spin on somethingâ€¦ that's a win. The US vice president speaks his mind. He relishes in the shock factor. And so his encouraging words about a \"trade deal\" with the UK will have pleased British officials both here in Washington and in London. Speaking to UnHerd, Vance said: \"I think there's a good chance that, yes, we'll come to a great agreement that's in the best interest of both countries.\" Behind the scenes, for many weeks - since well before Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' nearly two weeks ago - British trade negotiators led by the UK's ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, have been negotiating as best they could with the US administration. Their engagement with officials close to Mr Trump has facilitated ministerial meetings and White House-Downing Street phone calls. I am told the UK is \"now in the deal space\". Another source told me the UK was \"in the foothills\" of a deal. But it has not been straightforward, and there is some distance to go. Despite the absence of a trade deficit with the US, and notwithstanding the fondness the president has for the UK, Britain was still dealt a 10% tariff plus 25% on cars. Prior to Trump's Liberation Day, there had been some hope that the UK would achieve some sort of deal to avoid them. But it was clear quite quickly that Mr Trump needed his 'moment'.  Many foreign diplomats, including the British, negotiating on their countries' behalf, were also struggling to achieve substantive negotiations because even those close to the president were not clear on his views, his choices and where he would 'land' on issues. This, incidentally, is an issue that can be applied to many aspects of this Trump administration. \"It's always quite speculative,\" one European diplomat said to me.  The clamour for engagement The challenge since Liberation Day has been to re-engage the White House with the offers already laid out over the past few months. Many countries have been doing this. You can imagine the clamour for engagement. A key question is whether the baseline tariff of 10% (applied to Britain - and now to everyone else following the 90-day pause) is negotiable. Mr Vance's language seems to suggest it is. Read more:Smartphones among items excluded from US tariffsChallenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says PM A deal then between the UK and the US may be \"in the foothills\". Watch for a deal with Australia too soon. But to call it a 'trade deal' with the UK would be misleading. It's an 'economic deal' to reduce the tariffs. It is, however, a large step forward for the UK, which has been trying to engage America in closer trade alignment since Brexit. Questions remain The details of any deal will be fascinating, and it is where the controversy will be. Will the UK reduce its trade barriers on US vehicles? Will this impact UK road safety standards? Will the UK make it easier for US farmers to sell in the UK? And if so, what will struggling UK farmers make of this? Will UK food standards (currently aligned with the EU) need to be lowered? The desired 'landing zone' here for the UK would be improved market access for American farmers, but only in areas where the US meets UK standards. Watch too for a deal on digital services. At the moment, the UK taxes here hit US tech companies. So we're in the foothills, but there is a climb ahead still, and on an untrodden, unpredictable path."

        "Content": "By Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporter and Adele Robinson, correspondent  Victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal have been urged to take legal action against the government over compensation delays.  In an email to victims seen by Sky News, Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates suggested it would be November 2027 before all the claims are finished based on the current rate of progress. He told them going to court was \"probably the quickest way to ensure fairness for all\". Money: The UK areas where houses take just 19 days to sell Hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully prosecuted for theft and false accounting after Fujitsu-made accounting software Horizon inaccurately generated financial shortfalls, making it appear money was missing from Post Offices across the UK. Many other sub-postmasters were made bankrupt, suffered ill health and experienced relationship breakdowns as a result of the falsely generated shortfalls and how the Post Office, a state-owned company, responded. 'Lawyers taking every opportunity to challenge' Compensation claims are processed through schemes administered by the Department of Business and Trade (DBT). Sir Alan said one scheme in particular - the group litigation order (GLO) scheme for the 555 people who successfully took legal action against the Post Office and exposed the scandal - was \"a mess\". \"Advice on how to streamline and speed up the scheme which has been offered to the DBT by ourselves, your lawyers and even the DBT Select Committee is ignored out of hand with the feeblest of excuses,\" he said. The government disputed the forecast by Sir Alan that it would take until 2027 for all claims to be settled and said it was \"settling claims at a faster rate than ever before\".  The problem was not unique to the GLO scheme, Sir Alan said, saying administration and application problems beset all four plans for victims impacted in different ways by the miscarriage of justice. The majority of applicants have had \"substantially undervalued offers\" from the government, Sir Alan said. \"The DBT lawyers appear to be taking every opportunity to challenge figures when the DBT has already paid for your lawyers to test and verify the claims before they are submitted. \"It appears that the DBT will pay out the smaller claims of about 60 to 80% of value, but the larger, which form the bulk of the outstanding claims, are continually being fought by DBT's lawyers.\" Read more:Sub-postmasters still going through hell, lead campaigner Sir Alan Bates saysSir Alan Bates tells PM 'clock is ticking' on compensation for Horizon victims More information is regularly sought from the victim, which Sir Alan said was \"obviously not available\" and delayed compensation offers. \"They also seem to be reducing offers by 50% where a spouse is involved, and it seems they will use almost any other tactic to ensure that the DBT does not have to pay out what has already been verified before the claim was submitted.\" Citing figures from the department, Sir Alan's email said 66 cases had been fully settled in the last six months, with 210 yet to be settled. While 555 people took part in the GLO, only 492 are applying to the GLO scheme as 63 had convictions overturned, making them eligible for other schemes. Of the 492 eligible applicants, latest figures from the DBT from 31 March said 282 people have already been paid \"full and final redress\". That leaves 210 people. Of that number, 90 have challenged their final offer but received 80% of it as an interim payment, and two victims have agreed to a \"full and final settlement\" having received the 80% interim payment. That means 118 people are left. An offer has been made to the majority, 37 survivors, but as of the end of the last month, they had not responded to it.\n A total of 19 claims were submitted but said to be incomplete. Eighteen had not been submitted at the time. Another 18 have challenged the offer and were waiting for the 80% interim payment. A further 14 were awaiting an offer after having made their claim.   Nine submitted claims have not yet been fully reviewed. Three people are awaiting payment, having agreed redress. The 'quickest way to fairness' Sir Alan suggested legal action was the \"quickest way to ensure fairness for all\", though he acknowledged that \"returning to the courts may seem to be a long haul\". \"There may be other options but the one which is repeatedly mentioned is a judicial review, not just for the GLO Scheme but to include all of the schemes to ensure there is parity in the way victims have, and are, being treated,\" the email said. A new legal action may be appropriate for people who have accepted offers, Sir Alan said, \"a new legal action may well be a way of having your claim reassessed once more, this time by the courts\". Victims from each scheme would need to come forward to move the campaign on, Sir Alan said, as he urged people to \"step up\". A national fundraising campaign may be needed to cover the costs of this action, the email added, which Sir Alan said he may be able to help set up. The government had said in October 2023 it was \"determined to deliver\" the GLO scheme by August 2024 and last year rejected a March 2025 deadline sought by campaigners for all payments to be finalised. \"We will be able to get substantial redress paid out to those individuals by the end of March\", Post Office minister Gareth Thomas told the Commons in December. Government 'does not accept forecast' Responding to Sir Alan's suggestion it would take until 2027 to settle all claims, a government spokesperson said, \"we do not accept this forecast\". \"The facts show we are making almost 90% of initial GLO offers within 40 working days of receiving completed claims. As of 31 March, 76% of the group had received full and final redress, or 80% of their offer.\" \"So long as claimants respond reasonably promptly, we would expect to settle all claims by the end of this year. \"We have trebled the number of payments under this government and are settling claims at a faster rate than ever before to provide full and fair redress.\" Speaking to Sky News business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, \"We'll never be able to go as fast as we would want, but we've massively increased the pace of compensation because it is so important to me personally to the department and to all of this new government... everyone in the country wants this resolved as quickly as possible and that's why we've increased the pace so much. \"But I can only go off the data, and the data tells me we've had this massive increase in compensation payments since the election, and we will not stop until we've done the right thing by everybody.\" And Sir Ed Davey, who was the postal minister in 2010, said Sir Alan and his fellow postmasters \"need to be properly compensated\". \"Frankly, that should have happened years ago after the 2019 High Court case. The Conservatives dragged their feet. Labour said they wouldn't, but they are. So I think that Sir Alan is absolutely right, I think the government should be taken to court.\""

And I think that that's why I haven't given up on any person or any group of people.\"   She also called for \"transness\" to no longer be a political topic - \"because it shouldn't be\". \"We're just humans trying our best,\" she said. \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \n                  UK-US agreement may be 'in the foothills' but to call it a 'trade deal' would be misleading\n                 \n                  Trump threatens Harvard with possibility of losing tax exempt status amid row with university\n                 On Donald Trump's first day back in office, he signed an executive order directing the US government to recognise only two, biologically distinct sexes - male and female. And he directed the state department to change its policies to only issue passports that \"accurately reflect the holder's sex\". The administration has said the policy does not constitute unlawful sex discrimination, does not prevent transgender people from travelling abroad, and is vital to addressing the concerns the order raised that indeterminate definitions of sex undermine \"longstanding, cherished legal rights and values\". Asked about Mr Trump's policies, Mulvaney said: \"It's a sad thing to see someone trying to take away the rights of humans that are just trying to live their lives. Again, we're not monsters. We're people that have woken up and stepped into our authentic selves. For me, that's a very camp, fun, feminine human being who also happens to be a woman. \"And I think what I'm now excited [for] is to step into this next chapter of my life and realise that there are so many other trans people who should be speaking on those things. And I'm finding my way in right now, which is through theatre.\" What's the background to the court case? The landmark Supreme Court case, where five judges at the UK's top court heard arguments last November, is the culmination of a challenge brought by For Women Scotland (FWS) over whether trans women can be regarded as female for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. Wednesday's ruling may have a big influence over how sex-based rights are applied through the act across Scotland, England and Wales, including implications for the running of single-sex spaces. Campaigners from FWS say sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. They are challenging the Scottish government, which says they should also include trans people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The FWS action is seeking to overturn a decision by the Scottish courts in 2023 which found treating someone with a GRC as a woman under the Equality Act was lawful. What have the two sides said? Ruth Crawford KC, for the Scottish government, told the court last November that a person with a GRC, which she said was a document legally recognising a change of sex and gender, was entitled to the \"protection\" afforded to their acquired gender as set out in the 2010 Equality Act. But Aidan O'Neill KC, representing FWS, said \"sex just means sex, as that word and the words woman and man are understood and used in ordinary, everyday language, used every day in everyday situations by ordinary people\". Mr O'Neill called for the court to take account of \"the facts of biological reality rather than the fantasies of legal fiction\". The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges brought by FWS over the definition of \"woman\" in the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, which mandates 50% female representation on public boards. Beer brand ad controversy In 2023, US sales of Bud Light fell and profits dropped following a boycott of the beer brand after it made a promotional deal with Mulvaney. Many conservatives, including former US presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, stopped buying Bud Light after Mulvaney posted an ad for the brand on her social media account and shared an image of a personalised can. Mulvaney told Barbara Serra that for \"writing my book I really wanted to make good of a really dark situation that was happening when I took an unexpected beer brand ad\". \"And I think that while that was such a dark period of time in my life, and I think a lot of trans people's lives, I really wanted to show that if you keep going, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm feeling happy and healthy in my life right now,\" she said. Mulvaney is starring in a new musical in London, called We Aren't Kids Anymore, starting later this month."

On Tuesday, the Midlands club went into the second-leg quarter-final tie as underdogs, facing an uphill battle against the French champions after losing 3-1 last week. While Unai Emery's men pushed PSG close, ultimately winning 3-2 on the night, the aggregate score finished 5-4, so it was heartbreak for the royal football fan. William had been in attendance with his 11-year-old son Prince George.  George wore his claret and blue scarf and was seen waving his arms in celebration with his father after the goals.

Heartbreak and joy for William 'Wearing my lucky clothes' Ahead of the first game in Paris last week, William spoke to TNT Sports pundits Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand. He admitted being \"pretty terrified\" and \"nervous\" but said he was \"wearing all my lucky clothes\". Asked by former England defender Ferdinand if he was on a \"lads tour\" to the match with friends, William said: \"Well, I've got my son here as well, so I'm on best behaviour as well. \"But I thought: You know what, it's been 43 years since anything like this has happened in my generation as a Villa fan, and I want George to experience a night out away from home in a big European competition. \"I hope it's not 43 years until the next one happens, but I think those memories are really important to create and bringing him along tonight is a big deal for me.\""

A Russian assault on the city killed 35 people and injured at least 119. Children were among the dead and wounded. The Ukrainian military has now said it has struck a base of \"the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers\".   In a statement on messaging app Telegram, it said the base was \"hit [and] a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded\". \"The results of the strike are being clarified,\" it added.  Volodymyr Zelenskyy previously shared videos of the aftermath of Russia's Palm Sunday attack, showing dead bodies in the middle of a street in Sumy. The Ukrainian president said \"only scoundrels can act like this\" and called for \"tough reaction from the world\" in posts on social media. Meanwhile, Ukraine's foreign ministry said one of the children injured was a baby girl born this year, adding \"even newborns are targets for Russia's crimes\". NATO on Tuesday reaffirmed its \"unwavering\" support for Ukraine as the alliance's secretary-general visited the country. As he met with Mr Zelenskyy at a hospital in Odesa, Mark Rutte said: \"I'm here today because I believe Ukraine's people deserve real peace, real safety and security in their country, in their homes.\" Mr Rutte also said he and Mr Zelenskyy had discussed the Trump administration's peace talks with both Russia and Ukraine. \"These discussions are not easy - not least in the wake of this horrific violence - but we all support President Trump's push for peace,\" he said.

Andrii Sybiha, his Ukrainian counterpart, dismissed the claim saying on Saturday that Russia launched \"almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 [exploding] drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians\" since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes."

        "Headline": "Sky News verifies video of an execution at Zamzam, and finds footage linking one of those present to the nearby RSF presence.",
        "Content": "By Sam Doak, OSINT producer   On 11 April, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its affiliates attacked Zamzam camp in North Darfur. The RSF is a paramilitary organisation comprised of militias that used to be be aligned with Sudan's government. For exactly two years it has been been locked in a civil war with the government's Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). Both sides have been accused of human rights abuses over the course of the conflict. After the capture of Zamzam, the RSF claimed in a statement released on Telegram that the camp was being used as a barracks, accusing the SAF of using civilians as \"human shields\". It further claimed, \"the Rapid Support Forces were able to secure civilians during the liberation operation and prevent them from being harmed\". Satellite imagery and footage from the ground paints a darker picture, showing the execution of an unarmed man and widespread fires within the camp at the time of its capture. Zamzam sits just to the south of Al Fashir, North Darfur's capital city, which has been a key target of the RSF in recent months. \n                  Sudan summit in London is a worthwhile endeavour but lacks ambition\n                 \n                  UK announces Â£120m aid package for Sudan - as Lammy warns 'much of the world continues to look away'\n                 \n                  UN aid chief 'demands answers' over Israeli attack that killed 15 aid workers in Gaza\n                 Filming of an execution Shortly after the RSF attack began on 11 April, a video began circulating on social media. It shows a group of gunmen standing over two unarmed men and a child. One of the men squats in front of a gunman holding an assault rifle. The gunman shoots him at close range, killing him. The child, less than a meter away, lies face down with his hands covering the back of his head. While the footage does not contain much contextual information, the person filming turns the camera to his face before showing a close-up view of the dead body behind him. Sky News has geolocated a second video showing the same man, wearing the same clothing and equipment, at another location within the camp at the time of its capture. The footage shows the fighter with a group of gunmen celebrating as they enter a compound in the south of the camp. Gunfire can be heard, and smoke rises from nearby as the group cheer. At one point, a uniformed fighter wearing an RSF patch can be seen, confirming that at least this individual is affiliated with the organisation. Both videos appear to have been filmed within a short timeframe. The fighter seen in both videos is wearing the same head covering, clothing and tactical gear. The pattern on his head covering is oriented identically in both, suggesting it has not been removed in the time between filming. Widespread fires Available footage and satellite images show the RSF's capture of Zamzam was closely followed by fires being lit across the camp. In one video, a man in an RSF uniform can be seen driving on the camp's main road while thick smoke rises from nearby fires. Data from FIRMS, a NASA project that uses satellite data to detect thermal anomalies, provides a wider view. Following the arrival of the RSF on 11 April, fires were detected across the south and east of the camp. More fires were detected in the east and south on 12 April, with areas in the north of the camp being affected on the 13 April. Satellite images form Maxar confirm buildings burned across the south of the camp on April 11, close to where fighters were seen. On Tuesday, the African Union and European government's including the UK called for an immediate cessation of the hostilities in which tens of thousands of people have been killed in the last two years.

        "Content": " Several French prisons were attacked overnight in response to government efforts to clamp down on drug trafficking in the country, senior officials said. Unknown assailants fired automatic weapons at a prison in the southern city of Toulon, while vehicles were burned outside other facilities across the country and staff were threatened. France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said on Tuesday that it had taken charge of the investigation, while the country's DGSI national security investigation will also be involved. French media reported that the prisons targeted were in or near cities including Toulon, Aix-En-Provence, Marseille, and the communes of Valence and Nimes. Prisons were also targeted in the commune of Villepinte and the suburb of Nanterre near Paris, according to reports. It is not immediately clear whether the attacks were co-ordinated, or who carried them out. France's Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, who has led efforts to toughen prison security and crack down on gangsters who run their empires from behind bars, said he would travel to Toulon. \n                  Ukrainian forces 'strike Russian brigade' behind deadly missile attack on Sumy\n                 \n                  What does Sudan execution video tell us?\n                 \n                  Russian journalists accused of working with Alexei Navalny jailed for more than five years each\n                 \"Attempts have been made to intimidate staff in several prisons, ranging from burning vehicles to firing automatic weapons,\" Mr Darmanin wrote on X. \"I am going to Toulon to support the officers concerned. The French Republic is facing up to the problem of drug trafficking and is taking measures that will massively disrupt the criminal networks.\" Meanwhile, the country's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had instructed local prefects, alongside the police and gendarmerie, to immediately step up the protection of staff and prisons. A 'white tsunami' of cocaine Years of record South American cocaine imports to Europe have supercharged local drug markets, sparking a wave of drug violence across the continent. Gangs in France have been able to expand from traditional power bases in cities like Marseille into smaller regional towns unaccustomed to drug violence. The rise in gang crime is thought to have led to increased support for the far-right National Rally party and have helped drag French politics rightward. Mr Darmanin, a former interior minister, and Mr Retailleau have prioritised tackling drug trafficking. Read more from Sky News:'Exotic cat smuggling ring' uncovered by policeTrump blames Zelenskyy for starting Ukraine warUS could deport 'homegrown criminals' to El Salvador jail In February, Mr Retailleau announced record cocaine seizures of 47 tonnes in the first 11 months of 2024 compared to 23 tonnes in all of 2023. Mr Retailleau said France had been hit by a \"white tsunami\" that had rewritten the rules of the criminal landscape. Meanwhile, Mr Darmanin has proposed a series of measures to tighten prison security, including isolating the country's top 100 kingpins. Lawmakers are also close to approving a sweeping new anti-drug trafficking law that would create a new national organised crime prosecutors' office and give greater investigative power to police investigating drug gangs. French authorities scored a win against drug crime in February, when they recaptured Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as \"The Fly.\" His escape as he was being transported from prison to a court hearing resulted in the deaths of two prison guards and was seized upon by right-wing politicians as evidence that France had lost its grip on drug crime."

        "Content": "A superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily killing four British nationals - including tech tycoon Mike Lynch - will be raised from the seabed and brought to shore next month, an inquest hearing has heard. Billionaire entrepreneur Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were among seven people who died when the Bayesian sank on 19 August last year. Simon Graves, a principal investigator for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), said it was anticipated the vessel would be lifted and brought to shore by the end of May. It is understood that the operation to retrieve the boat is due to begin on 26 April. \"It's unlikely we will be on scene when the vessel is lifted clear of the water, but we will be on scene when it's recovered to shore,\" Mr Graves told a pre-inquest review hearing in Ipswich, Suffolk, on Tuesday. He said the Bayesian was registered in the Isle of Man, so there is a British safety investigation, separate from ongoing criminal investigations. Mr Graves said he hoped the MAIB could publish its interim report online in four to six weeks, with the final report to follow in \"months, not weeks\" after the vessel has been inspected for evidence. \"We are relatively early in our investigation,\" Mr Graves said. He added that a \"significant amount of work\" had already happened, including commissioning studies looking at the \"stability and windage of the vessel\" and the weather at the scene. Suffolk's senior coroner Nigel Parsley asked if the \"vessel itself was a primary source of evidence\" and Mark Cam, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), said \"absolutely, sir\". Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his 71-year-old wife Judy Bloomer, who were all British nationals. The others who died included US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the yacht. Mr Parsley granted interested person status to the family of Mr Thomas, giving them participatory rights in proceedings. He said that if he were to receive a request for the status from the Morvillo family there was \"no reason why I wouldn't grant\" it. Mr Parsley said a date for a further pre-inquest review hearing would be set once the MAIB's interim report has been published, indicating that September and October were possible months for this hearing. Mr Parsley said it was \"in the hands of the criminal investigations\" as to when a final inquest hearing date could be set. The Italian authorities are conducting a criminal investigation and the MCA is looking at whether there were any breaches of maritime legislation. Read more from Sky News:Man admits murdering two women in Christmas Day stabbingMother who forged paternity test to trick ex-partner spared jail Mr Parsley expressed his condolences to family and friends of the deceased, some of whom listened to proceedings remotely over a link. Mr Lynch's medical cause of death was recorded as drowning when his inquest was opened and adjourned last year, with the causes of the deaths of the three other British nationals still under investigation. The Bayesian was said to be less than a nautical mile from the coast of the fishing village of Porticello at the time it sank and had 22 people on board - 12 crew and 10 guests. Mr Lynch and his daughter were said to have lived in the vicinity of London, while the Bloomers lived in Sevenoaks in Kent. Mr Lynch had founded software giant Autonomy in 1996 and was cleared in June last year of fraud over the sale of the firm to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011. The boat trip was a celebration of his acquittal in the case in the US."

Last week Donald Trump delayed imposing varying tariffs on the entire world by 90 days last week after global markets reacted with horror. But the trade war with China continues with tariffs of up to 145% on goods going from China to the US and 125% on goods flowing the other way.

        "Content": "Rat nests and dead rodents have been discovered on Gene Hackman's property, after the actor's wife Betsy Arakawa died of hantavirus - which can be caught from such animals. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found on 26 February, in separate rooms of their Sante Fe home, along with one of their dogs. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities have released a report detailing some of Arakawa's last emails and internet searches, revealing she was investigating information on flu-like symptoms before she died. A separate report by the local health department included an environmental assessment that found evidence of the presence of rats throughout many of the buildings on the late actor's estate.   Arakawa died after developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) around 11 February, a pathologist said. This is a disease that can be caught from exposure to rodents and includes flu-like symptoms, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, according to investigators. The presence of rodents was found in several outbuildings across the property and a live rodent, a dead rodent and nests were found in three other garages. Live traps were also said to have been found on the property. There has so far been no confirmation about any potential link between the rodents and the hantavirus disease that claimed Arakawa's life. Last internet searches and emails Arakawa had open bookmarks on her computer which showed she was actively researching medical conditions linked to COVID and flu-like symptoms. She also mentioned in an email to her masseuse that Hackman had woken up on 11 February with flu-like symptoms so she would reschedule her appointment for the next day \"out of an abundance of caution\". Authorities are expected to release more information soon, including redacted police body camera footage. The materials were released as the result of a recent court order after the Hackman estate and family sought to keep the records sealed, citing the family's right to privacy. Read more from Sky News:Man admits murdering women in Xmas attacksFelling of ancient oak tree reported to policeMurder arrest after house explosion Couple found dead The two-time Oscar winner was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's when he died of heart disease. It was likely he was alone for around a week with the body of his wife after she had died first. Dr Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner for New Mexico, told reporters Arakawa was believed to have died around 11 February. What is HPS? HPS, commonly known as hantavirus disease, is a respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses - which are carried by several types of rodents. It is a rare condition in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. The New Mexico Department of Health said hantaviruses are spread by the saliva, droppings and urine of infected rodents, which in North America is most likely to be the eastern deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The virus is often transmitted through the air when people sweep out sheds or clean closets where mice have been living, or by eating food contaminated with mouse droppings. It is not transmissible from person to person, Dr Jarrell said. The likelihood of death is between 38-50% and there is no cure, treatment or vaccine, but patients have a better chance of survival with an early diagnosis."

        "Content": " Social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney has told Sky News discussion about transgender rights should not be political. Mulvaney, who documented her own transition in a viral TikTok series, was speaking ahead of a Supreme Court judgment in London on Wednesday about how women are defined in law. The 28-year-old US social media personality told Sky's Barbara Serra on The World: \"I've seen my family completely accept me and love me. And I think that that's why I haven't given up on any person or any group of people.\"   She also called for \"transness\" to no longer be a political topic - \"because it shouldn't be\". \"We're just humans trying our best,\" she said. \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \n                  UK-US agreement may be 'in the foothills' but to call it a 'trade deal' would be misleading\n                 \n                  Trump threatens Harvard with possibility of losing tax exempt status amid row with university\n                 On Donald Trump's first day back in office, he signed an executive order directing the US government to recognise only two, biologically distinct sexes - male and female. And he directed the state department to change its policies to only issue passports that \"accurately reflect the holder's sex\". The administration has said the policy does not constitute unlawful sex discrimination, does not prevent transgender people from travelling abroad, and is vital to addressing the concerns the order raised that indeterminate definitions of sex undermine \"longstanding, cherished legal rights and values\". Asked about Mr Trump's policies, Mulvaney said: \"It's a sad thing to see someone trying to take away the rights of humans that are just trying to live their lives. Again, we're not monsters. We're people that have woken up and stepped into our authentic selves. For me, that's a very camp, fun, feminine human being who also happens to be a woman. \"And I think what I'm now excited [for] is to step into this next chapter of my life and realise that there are so many other trans people who should be speaking on those things. And I'm finding my way in right now, which is through theatre.\" What's the background to the court case? The landmark Supreme Court case, where five judges at the UK's top court heard arguments last November, is the culmination of a challenge brought by For Women Scotland (FWS) over whether trans women can be regarded as female for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. Wednesday's ruling may have a big influence over how sex-based rights are applied through the act across Scotland, England and Wales, including implications for the running of single-sex spaces. Campaigners from FWS say sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. They are challenging the Scottish government, which says they should also include trans people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The FWS action is seeking to overturn a decision by the Scottish courts in 2023 which found treating someone with a GRC as a woman under the Equality Act was lawful. What have the two sides said? Ruth Crawford KC, for the Scottish government, told the court last November that a person with a GRC, which she said was a document legally recognising a change of sex and gender, was entitled to the \"protection\" afforded to their acquired gender as set out in the 2010 Equality Act. But Aidan O'Neill KC, representing FWS, said \"sex just means sex, as that word and the words woman and man are understood and used in ordinary, everyday language, used every day in everyday situations by ordinary people\". Mr O'Neill called for the court to take account of \"the facts of biological reality rather than the fantasies of legal fiction\". The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges brought by FWS over the definition of \"woman\" in the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, which mandates 50% female representation on public boards. Beer brand ad controversy In 2023, US sales of Bud Light fell and profits dropped following a boycott of the beer brand after it made a promotional deal with Mulvaney. Many conservatives, including former US presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, stopped buying Bud Light after Mulvaney posted an ad for the brand on her social media account and shared an image of a personalised can. Mulvaney told Barbara Serra that for \"writing my book I really wanted to make good of a really dark situation that was happening when I took an unexpected beer brand ad\". \"And I think that while that was such a dark period of time in my life, and I think a lot of trans people's lives, I really wanted to show that if you keep going, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm feeling happy and healthy in my life right now,\" she said. Mulvaney is starring in a new musical in London, called We Aren't Kids Anymore, starting later this month."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A former executive at DAZN, the sports streaming platform, is to be appointed this week as the next chairman of Playtech, the London-listed gambling technology group. Sky News has learnt that Playtech will announce on Wednesday that John Gleasure, who was also a co-founder of the digital sports media group Perform, is to succeed Brian Mattingley in the role. In accepting the Playtech chairmanship, Mr Gleasure will inherit a position which has repeatedly been at the centre of fractious corporate governance challenges. Mr Mattingley, who has held the role since 2021, has overseen a frenetic period of corporate activity while also finding himself in the eye of a series of storms with shareholders over boardroom pay. The most recent of those came in December when close to a third of investors rebelled over a â‚¬100m bonus plan for Mor Weizer, the company's chief executive, along with other senior executives. Shareholders give Mr Mattingley credit, however, for helping to navigate the company through a challenging period in the gambling industry, in particular his role last year in securing the sale of Snaitech, its Italian consumer gambling arm, for â‚¬2.3bn. That deal, which received regulatory approval last week, represented a near-threefold return on Playtech's initial investment and will trigger a special dividend worth up to â‚¬1.8bn (Â£1.5bn), to be paid in June. \n                  Sir Alan Bates urges victims of Post Office scandal to take govt to court over compensation delays\n                 \n                  Wage growth slows in boost to hope for interest rate cut - ONS\n                 \n                  Race against time to keep Scunthorpe steel furnaces alive as raw materials to be delivered today\n                 The sale of Snaitech will transform Playtech into a pure-play business-to-business operation. Many analysts believe the remaining company will rapidly become a takeover target. A source close to Playtech pointed out that shares in the company had risen nearly 60% during Mr Mattingley's tenure. Mr Gleasure, who will succeed Mr Mattingley as chairman after Playtech's annual meeting next month, has also held roles at Sky Sports, which shares a parent company with Sky News, Hutchison 3G and Sony Pictures. He continues to sit on the board of DAZN Group and is executive chairman of The Sporting News, a digital publisher in which Playtech acquired a minority interest in 2023. Egon Zehnder International, the boardroom headhunter, has been overseeing the search for Mr Mattingley's successor. A Playtech spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday."

        "Content": "By Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporter and Adele Robinson, correspondent  Victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal have been urged to take legal action against the government over compensation delays.  In an email to victims seen by Sky News, Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates suggested it would be November 2027 before all the claims are finished based on the current rate of progress. He told them going to court was \"probably the quickest way to ensure fairness for all\". Money: The UK areas where houses take just 19 days to sell Hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully prosecuted for theft and false accounting after Fujitsu-made accounting software Horizon inaccurately generated financial shortfalls, making it appear money was missing from Post Offices across the UK. Many other sub-postmasters were made bankrupt, suffered ill health and experienced relationship breakdowns as a result of the falsely generated shortfalls and how the Post Office, a state-owned company, responded. 'Lawyers taking every opportunity to challenge' Compensation claims are processed through schemes administered by the Department of Business and Trade (DBT). Sir Alan said one scheme in particular - the group litigation order (GLO) scheme for the 555 people who successfully took legal action against the Post Office and exposed the scandal - was \"a mess\". \"Advice on how to streamline and speed up the scheme which has been offered to the DBT by ourselves, your lawyers and even the DBT Select Committee is ignored out of hand with the feeblest of excuses,\" he said. The government disputed the forecast by Sir Alan that it would take until 2027 for all claims to be settled and said it was \"settling claims at a faster rate than ever before\".  The problem was not unique to the GLO scheme, Sir Alan said, saying administration and application problems beset all four plans for victims impacted in different ways by the miscarriage of justice. The majority of applicants have had \"substantially undervalued offers\" from the government, Sir Alan said. \"The DBT lawyers appear to be taking every opportunity to challenge figures when the DBT has already paid for your lawyers to test and verify the claims before they are submitted. \"It appears that the DBT will pay out the smaller claims of about 60 to 80% of value, but the larger, which form the bulk of the outstanding claims, are continually being fought by DBT's lawyers.\" Read more:Sub-postmasters still going through hell, lead campaigner Sir Alan Bates saysSir Alan Bates tells PM 'clock is ticking' on compensation for Horizon victims More information is regularly sought from the victim, which Sir Alan said was \"obviously not available\" and delayed compensation offers. \"They also seem to be reducing offers by 50% where a spouse is involved, and it seems they will use almost any other tactic to ensure that the DBT does not have to pay out what has already been verified before the claim was submitted.\" Citing figures from the department, Sir Alan's email said 66 cases had been fully settled in the last six months, with 210 yet to be settled. While 555 people took part in the GLO, only 492 are applying to the GLO scheme as 63 had convictions overturned, making them eligible for other schemes. Of the 492 eligible applicants, latest figures from the DBT from 31 March said 282 people have already been paid \"full and final redress\". That leaves 210 people. Of that number, 90 have challenged their final offer but received 80% of it as an interim payment, and two victims have agreed to a \"full and final settlement\" having received the 80% interim payment. That means 118 people are left. An offer has been made to the majority, 37 survivors, but as of the end of the last month, they had not responded to it.\n A total of 19 claims were submitted but said to be incomplete. Eighteen had not been submitted at the time. Another 18 have challenged the offer and were waiting for the 80% interim payment. A further 14 were awaiting an offer after having made their claim.   Nine submitted claims have not yet been fully reviewed. Three people are awaiting payment, having agreed redress. The 'quickest way to fairness' Sir Alan suggested legal action was the \"quickest way to ensure fairness for all\", though he acknowledged that \"returning to the courts may seem to be a long haul\". \"There may be other options but the one which is repeatedly mentioned is a judicial review, not just for the GLO Scheme but to include all of the schemes to ensure there is parity in the way victims have, and are, being treated,\" the email said. A new legal action may be appropriate for people who have accepted offers, Sir Alan said, \"a new legal action may well be a way of having your claim reassessed once more, this time by the courts\". Victims from each scheme would need to come forward to move the campaign on, Sir Alan said, as he urged people to \"step up\". A national fundraising campaign may be needed to cover the costs of this action, the email added, which Sir Alan said he may be able to help set up. The government had said in October 2023 it was \"determined to deliver\" the GLO scheme by August 2024 and last year rejected a March 2025 deadline sought by campaigners for all payments to be finalised. \"We will be able to get substantial redress paid out to those individuals by the end of March\", Post Office minister Gareth Thomas told the Commons in December. Government 'does not accept forecast' Responding to Sir Alan's suggestion it would take until 2027 to settle all claims, a government spokesperson said, \"we do not accept this forecast\". \"The facts show we are making almost 90% of initial GLO offers within 40 working days of receiving completed claims. As of 31 March, 76% of the group had received full and final redress, or 80% of their offer.\" \"So long as claimants respond reasonably promptly, we would expect to settle all claims by the end of this year. \"We have trebled the number of payments under this government and are settling claims at a faster rate than ever before to provide full and fair redress.\" Speaking to Sky News business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, \"We'll never be able to go as fast as we would want, but we've massively increased the pace of compensation because it is so important to me personally to the department and to all of this new government... everyone in the country wants this resolved as quickly as possible and that's why we've increased the pace so much. \"But I can only go off the data, and the data tells me we've had this massive increase in compensation payments since the election, and we will not stop until we've done the right thing by everybody.\" And Sir Ed Davey, who was the postal minister in 2010, said Sir Alan and his fellow postmasters \"need to be properly compensated\". \"Frankly, that should have happened years ago after the 2019 High Court case. The Conservatives dragged their feet. Labour said they wouldn't, but they are. So I think that Sir Alan is absolutely right, I think the government should be taken to court.\""

It has printing sites in the UK, Kenya, Malta and Sri Lanka. In 2020, the Bank of England announced that it had extended De La Rue's contract from the end of 2025 until 2028. At the time, there were 4.4bn Bank of England notes in circulation with a collective value of about Â£82bn. De La Rue's directors have been exploring options in recent months to maximise value for long-suffering shareholders, including a standalone sale of the currency-printing business or other proposals to acquire the entire company. The group's balance sheet has been under strain for years, with doubts at one point about whether it could stave off insolvency. After being beset by a series of corporate mishaps, including a string of profit warnings, a public row with its auditor and challenges in its operations in countries including India and Kenya, it was forced to seek breathing space from pension trustees by deferring tens of millions of pounds of payments into its retirement scheme. Soon after that, the company parachuted in Clive Whiley, a seasoned corporate troubleshooter, as chairman, with a mandate to repair its battered finances. Since then, its stock has recovered strongly, with its shares up nearly 15% on Tuesday after confirmation of Atlas Holdings' bid. De La Rue traces its roots back to 1813, when Thomas De La Rue established a printing business. Eight years later, he began producing straw hats and then moved into printing stationery, according to an official history of the company. Its first paper money was produced for the government of Mauritius in 1860, and in 1914, it began printing 10-shilling notes for the UK government on the outbreak of the First World War."

It comes after he appeared to row back on his claim that he would not bring a Chinese company into the steel sector again after the government had to urgently step in to save the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. Mr Reynolds, speaking to reporters in the Lincolnshire town, said that nationalisation was the \"likely option at this stage\". He added: \"What we are now going to do, having secured both control of the site and the supply of raw materials, so the blast furnaces won't close in a matter of days, is work on the future. \"We've got the ownership question, which is pressing. \"I was clear when I gave the speech in parliament - we know there is a limited lifespan of the blast furnaces, and we know that what we need for the future is a private sector partner to come in and work with us on that transformation and co-fund that transformation.\" Reynolds rows back Mr Reynolds said he would look at Chinese firms \"in a different way\" following the race to save British Steel, but did not rule out their involvement completely. The comments were at odds with his previous remarks to Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, when he said he would not \"personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\" again, describing steel as a \"sensitive area\" in the UK. The government has taken over British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, after talks with its Chinese owners, Jingye, broke down. Politics latest: US 'working very hard' on negotiating 'great' UK trade deal The company recently cancelled orders for supplies of the raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running, sparking a race against time to keep it operational. Materials secured by the government arrived at the site on Tuesday, but questions remain about the long-term future of British Steel and whether it will be fully nationalised or the private sector will get involved. Earlier on Tuesday, industry minister Sarah Jones said she is \"not ruling out\" the possibility of another Chinese partner. She said having a pragmatic relationship with Beijing, the world's second-biggest economy, is still important and stringent tests would apply \"to a Chinese company as they would to any other company\".  Asked for clarity on his position during a visit to the port of Immingham, where materials from two ships are being unloaded and transported to the plant, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think we've got to recognise that steel is a sensitive sector. \"A lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from production and dumping of steel products... so I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way. \"But I'm really keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest, and we had to take the action we did.\" Explainer: Why has the government rescued British Steel? The materials that arrived on Tuesday, including coking coal and iron, are enough to keep the furnaces running for weeks, the Department for Business and Trade said. They are needed because if the furnaces cool down too much, the molten iron solidifies and blocks the furnaces, making it extremely difficult and expensive to restart them. Science correspondent There's no switch that easily turns a blast furnace on and off. Temperatures inside can approach 2,000C and to protect the structure the interior is lined with ceramic insulation. But the ceramic bricks expand and contract depending on the temperature, and any change needs to be done carefully over several weeks to stop them cracking. Molten material inside the furnace also needs to be drained by drilling a hole through the wall of the furnace. It's a dangerous and expensive process, normally only ever done when thereâ€™s a major planned refurbishment. That's why the government wants to keep the furnaces at Scunthorpe burning. The problem is, supplies for the furnaces are running low.  They need pellets of iron ore â€“ the main raw material for making steel.  And they also need a processed form of coal called coke â€“ the fuel that provides both the heat and the chemical reaction to purify the iron so itâ€™s ready to make strong steel alloy. Without a fresh supply of both the furnaces may have to be turned off in just a fortnight. And that would be a complex, costly nightmare the government wants to avoid. 'Chinese ownership truly dreadful' Opposition politicians have accused China of sabotage to increase reliance on its steel products, and want the country to be prevented from future dealings not only with steel but any UK national infrastructure. Veteran Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to define which industries are \"strategic\" - and prevent China from being allowed to invest in such sectors. Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said reverting to Chinese ownership would be like finding \"your house ransacked and then leaving your doors unlocked\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the same position, saying the thought the government \"could even contemplate another Chinese owner of British steel is truly dreadful\", and that he would not have China \"in our nuclear program, anywhere near our telecoms or anything else\". \"They are not our friends,\" he added. Number 10 said on Monday that it was not aware of any \"sabotage\" at the plant and there is no block on Chinese companies.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @WillCharley1\n Prisons across England and Wales are at their highest capacity for months, with fewer cells available than at any time this year. There are fewer than 1,000 spare prison cells across England and Wales, a record low for this year. Only 961 spaces are now available, meaning prisons are now almost 98.9% full, according to new government figures.   It means the prison estate is now under more strain than it has been for months, including when the government was forced to release around 3,000 prisoners early to avoid overcrowding in autumn last year. The Howard League, a charity calling for reform of the prison system, said it shows the system is \"failing\" and \"unsustainable\". It added it \"could not be clearer that further action is necessary\" and called on the government to send fewer people to prison. \n                  Kitchen use suspended following Manchester Arena plotter Hashem Abedi's prison attack\n                 \n                  Counter terror police investigating after brother of Manchester Arena bomber attacks prison officers\n                 \n                  Fewer criminals set to be jailed, as prisons in England and Wales struggle with overcrowding\n                 What do the new figures show? The number of free cells has not fallen below 1,000 for at least the past six months - but now it has, meaning there is only 1.1% capacity spare. There are just 551 empty places in men's prisons, and 261 in women's prisons across England and Wales, as of 14 April. Within the Youth Custody Service, there are 141 empty cells, though this area is thought less of a problem in terms of overcrowding. Ministers will be under renewed pressure to act as prisons have reached 98.9% capacity, with 88,081 men and women serving custodial sentences, according to figures from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The statistics also show more than 3,200 prisoners are already serving their sentences at home. This means they will typically be subject to strict conditions such as curfews and bans on drinking, which can be monitored by an electronic tag. Could another 'emergency decision' be on the horizon? This is a worse position than before either early release carried out last year, when some inmates were freed after serving only 40% of their sentences, rather than the usual 50%. At the time, the government called it an \"emergency decision\" and blamed the Conservatives for not creating more capacity while in power. ðŸ‘‰ Tap here to follow the Sky News Daily podcast ðŸ‘ˆ There were just 1,098 spare cells on 6 September 2024 with prisons 98.7% full, according to the MoJ. Around 1,700 people were then freed on 10 September, with the number of spare places - called the headroom - rising to 3,219 on 10 September 2024. The following month, the government found itself in a similar position. Prisons were 98.1% full, with only 1,671 spare cells, as of 21st October. The next day, around 1,100 prisoners were freed, raising the headroom to 3,141. But now the prison estate is in an even worse position, with figures showing the population steadily rising since the start of the year. There were more than 85,000 prisoners behind bars at the start of January, and this has now increased by some 2,500. The government's early release scheme also faced criticism at the time, with the Conservatives branding it a \"rookie error by an arrogant and inexperienced government\". Numerous other methods are being tried to prevent prison overcrowding, with the government revealing plans to use an emergency measure so that cells in police stations could be used to house inmates.  Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also refused to rule out shortening sentences of violent offenders - potentially including these criminals in any future early release schemes. Just last week, Sky News learned that an independent policy review will suggest restricting the use of shorter sentences to send 9,500 fewer people to prison by 2028. Prison situation 'unsustainable' Responding to the figures, Andrew Neilson, the director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"Prisons have been asked to do too much, with too little, for too long, and these prison population figures show that even the early release of thousands of people has not been able to solve this problem for good.\" He added that more than half of prisons are overcrowded and said \"the situation is unsustainable\". \"Overcrowding and lack of resourcing are contributing to a failing system where the needs of people in prison are overlooked and unmet,\" he said. \"It could not be clearer that further action is necessary. Ministers have acknowledged that they cannot build their way out of this crisis. \"We must send fewer people to prison, curb the use of recall after release, and prioritise delivering an effective and responsive probation service that works to cut crime in the community.\" An MoJ spokesperson said the government \"inherited overcrowded prisons, days from collapse\". \"We introduced emergency measures last summer but we were always clear that longer term action was required,\" they said. \"This includes delivering 14,000 new prison places by 2031, with 900 already delivered and 1,500 more opening this summer. We will also reform sentencing to ensure no government runs out of prison space again.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  It was Margaret Thatcher who famously said that in politics, the unexpected always happens. And the latest evidence for that is a series of bizarre twists in the political fallout over Scunthorpe steelworks and China. First, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has unexpectedly performed a shock U-turn on Chinese involvement in steel. And second, those sworn Brexit enemies the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have agreed on one thing: they want nothing to do with China. Politics latest: US 'working very hard' with UK on negotiating 'great' trade deal So is Mr Reynolds' U-turn the result of being nobbled by Number 10? It certainly looks like it, given what appeared to be a Downing Street slap-down on Monday. On Sunday, he told Sir Trevor Phillips on Sky News: \"I wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.\" Pressed by Sir Trevor, he said: \"I wouldn't, no. I think steel is a very sensitive area.\" He even accused David Cameron - who famously took the Chinese president for a pint in a pub - and George Osborne of being \"far too naive\" about China. And when Sir Trevor said: \"There's a high trust bar now, isn't there?\" Mr Reynolds replied: \"Yes, we've got to recognise that.\" Two days later, pressed on his Sky News interview during a visit to Immingham docks, he said: \"In this case, our difference of opinion on the future was with a specific company. \"I know there's a lot of interest in the wider UK-China relationship, understandably so. But this was about this company.\" And he added: \"I'm really keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in because it was one specific companyâ€¦\" So that's clear then? Or is it? What's changed? What changed is that on Monday, Number 10 insisted there was no block on China from essential industries, even steel. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"We already a have a rigorous regime for assessing any involvement in critical infrastructure. That includes looking at the role of China in our supply chains and investment infrastructure.\" Got that, Mr Reynolds? He has now, obviously. Nigel Farage hasn't. \"The very thought the government could even contemplate another Chinese owner of British Steel is truly dreadful,\" the Reform UK leader declared while campaigning in Durham. \"There's no such thing as a private company in China. They're all effectively under the control of the Chinese Communist Party. Clearly, the government has learned nothing if they're prepared to say this. \"I would go further. I wouldn't have China in our nuclear programme, anywhere near our telecoms or anything else. They are not our friends.\" Guess who agrees with that? \"Giving another Chinese firm ownership of British Steel would be like coming home to find your house ransacked and then leaving your doors unlocked!\" said an outraged Lib Dem MP, Calum Miller. No doubt, the Lib Dems are outraged by China's refusal to allow their MP Wera Hobhouse being denied entry into Hong Kong to visit her newborn grandson. And who can blame them? Mr Farage also spoke about visiting the Scunthorpe blast furnaces last week, claiming: \"Not, by the way, an out-of-character thing for me to do, because I worked for 22 years in the metals business before getting involved in politics.\" Read more:Why did British Steel need saving?Sunak's former aide among charged with election betting offences Really? The metals business? Well, Mr Farage certainly has some brass neck. He was, in fact, a commodities trader in the City of London. OK, so presumably those commodities did include metal. And what of the government? Despite Mr Reynolds accusing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne of naivety, Sir Keir Starmer's senior ministers have actively wooed China too. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, visited China in January to promote \"new opportunities\" for investment. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, signed up to close ties with China on energy during a visit last month and Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, has been in China this week. Yet former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has insisted ministers must ban China from critical infrastructure and claimed former Labour prime minister Clement Attlee \"would be turning in his grave\". And what of Margaret Thatcher and her famous quote? Well, it was the Iron Lady herself who privatised British Steel in the 1980s - and opened the door to Chinese involvement."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       Meta could be forced to sell Instagram and WhatsApp if it loses a landmark trial that just started in the US.Â  So, what is the social media giant accused of, and what could the court case mean for all of us? What is Meta accused of? The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is accusing Meta of buying Instagram and WhatsApp over a decade ago to neutralise its competition, in line with Mark Zuckerberg's alleged 2008 directive that \"it is better to buy than compete\". When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, emails read out in court show that Zuckerberg was worried about Facebook's performance and that he thought Instagram was growing rapidly. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought that was allowed to carry on running as a separate app - before then, it simply bought startups for their talented workers and then shut down the smaller company. Two years later, it bought WhatsApp and ran that as a separate app too. Both sales were approved by the FTC at the time. \n                  Instagram owner announces new restrictions for teenage users\n                 \n                  White House criticised for 'disgusting' Instagram Valentine's Day post\n                 \n                  Meta denies 'forcing' people to follow Donald Trump and JD Vance on social media apps\n                 Meta denies the FTC's claims and called the case a \"weak lawsuit\" that \"ignores reality\" - it says it faces plenty of competition from other social media companies. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps),\" said a statement from the company at the beginning of the trial. Zuckerberg appeared in court as the first witness and told prosecutors he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network. But the FTC's lawyer read out messages from Zuckerberg back in 2012 where he talked about the importance of \"neutralising\" Instagram.  Why does it matter? If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. This may not have an immediate effect on how we use social media, according to Dr Steven Buckley, lecturer in digital sociology at City Saint George's University, but in the long run, it could make social media easier to regulate. \"If [Meta] is split up, it'd be easier for legislators and therefore regulators to actually get a grip on some of the problems [of] the individual platforms themselves. \"Trying to get a legislative hold over those and making sure that they are serving their users correctly is going to be far easier.\" Read more from Sky News:Sue the government, Sir Alan Bates tells Post Office victimsHow did one of UK's most shocking paedophile rings get away with it?Man admits murdering two women in Christmas Day attacks Whether the platforms themselves would change would depend on who purchased it, according to Dr Buckley. An exodus like the one Elon Musk's X saw in autumn last year could boost the membership of other smaller sites like BlueSky - but that would all depend on its owner. \"If it's sold off to a polarising figure, an Elon Musk type or [tech billionaire] Marc Andreessen type, then yes, you could see people fleeing from Instagram to other potential competitors that would rise up. \"If it's sold to just some random nondescript venture capital firm and they put a random CEO that no one's ever heard of in charge of it, I don't think you're going to see anyone fleeing platforms like Instagram any time soon.\" Losing Instagram could also be catastrophic to Meta. While the company doesn't release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecasts Instagram will generate $37.13bn this year, a little over half of Meta's US ad revenue.  Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer. The trial is expected to last two months after the FTC brought the case during Donald Trump's first administration. At the time, he was cracking down on big tech but since his return to the White House, Meta has brought itself more in line with the Trump administration's wishes. As well as relaxing the rules about what can be said on the platform, it also got rid of much of its content moderation in the name of free speech."

        "Content": "Rat nests and dead rodents have been discovered on Gene Hackman's property, after the actor's wife Betsy Arakawa died of hantavirus - which can be caught from such animals. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found on 26 February, in separate rooms of their Sante Fe home, along with one of their dogs. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities have released a report detailing some of Arakawa's last emails and internet searches, revealing she was investigating information on flu-like symptoms before she died. A separate report by the local health department included an environmental assessment that found evidence of the presence of rats throughout many of the buildings on the late actor's estate.   Arakawa died after developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) around 11 February, a pathologist said. This is a disease that can be caught from exposure to rodents and includes flu-like symptoms, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, according to investigators. The presence of rodents was found in several outbuildings across the property and a live rodent, a dead rodent and nests were found in three other garages. Live traps were also said to have been found on the property. There has so far been no confirmation about any potential link between the rodents and the hantavirus disease that claimed Arakawa's life. Last internet searches and emails Arakawa had open bookmarks on her computer which showed she was actively researching medical conditions linked to COVID and flu-like symptoms. She also mentioned in an email to her masseuse that Hackman had woken up on 11 February with flu-like symptoms so she would reschedule her appointment for the next day \"out of an abundance of caution\". Authorities are expected to release more information soon, including redacted police body camera footage. The materials were released as the result of a recent court order after the Hackman estate and family sought to keep the records sealed, citing the family's right to privacy. Read more from Sky News:Man admits murdering women in Xmas attacksFelling of ancient oak tree reported to policeMurder arrest after house explosion Couple found dead The two-time Oscar winner was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's when he died of heart disease. It was likely he was alone for around a week with the body of his wife after she had died first. Dr Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner for New Mexico, told reporters Arakawa was believed to have died around 11 February. What is HPS? HPS, commonly known as hantavirus disease, is a respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses - which are carried by several types of rodents. It is a rare condition in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. The New Mexico Department of Health said hantaviruses are spread by the saliva, droppings and urine of infected rodents, which in North America is most likely to be the eastern deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The virus is often transmitted through the air when people sweep out sheds or clean closets where mice have been living, or by eating food contaminated with mouse droppings. It is not transmissible from person to person, Dr Jarrell said. The likelihood of death is between 38-50% and there is no cure, treatment or vaccine, but patients have a better chance of survival with an early diagnosis."

        "Content": " Social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney has told Sky News discussion about transgender rights should not be political. Mulvaney, who documented her own transition in a viral TikTok series, was speaking ahead of a Supreme Court judgment in London on Wednesday about how women are defined in law. The 28-year-old US social media personality told Sky's Barbara Serra on The World: \"I've seen my family completely accept me and love me. And I think that that's why I haven't given up on any person or any group of people.\"   She also called for \"transness\" to no longer be a political topic - \"because it shouldn't be\". \"We're just humans trying our best,\" she said. \n                  White House looking at trade deals from more than 15 countries \n                 \n                  UK-US agreement may be 'in the foothills' but to call it a 'trade deal' would be misleading\n                 \n                  Trump threatens Harvard with possibility of losing tax exempt status amid row with university\n                 On Donald Trump's first day back in office, he signed an executive order directing the US government to recognise only two, biologically distinct sexes - male and female. And he directed the state department to change its policies to only issue passports that \"accurately reflect the holder's sex\". The administration has said the policy does not constitute unlawful sex discrimination, does not prevent transgender people from travelling abroad, and is vital to addressing the concerns the order raised that indeterminate definitions of sex undermine \"longstanding, cherished legal rights and values\". Asked about Mr Trump's policies, Mulvaney said: \"It's a sad thing to see someone trying to take away the rights of humans that are just trying to live their lives. Again, we're not monsters. We're people that have woken up and stepped into our authentic selves. For me, that's a very camp, fun, feminine human being who also happens to be a woman. \"And I think what I'm now excited [for] is to step into this next chapter of my life and realise that there are so many other trans people who should be speaking on those things. And I'm finding my way in right now, which is through theatre.\" What's the background to the court case? The landmark Supreme Court case, where five judges at the UK's top court heard arguments last November, is the culmination of a challenge brought by For Women Scotland (FWS) over whether trans women can be regarded as female for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. Wednesday's ruling may have a big influence over how sex-based rights are applied through the act across Scotland, England and Wales, including implications for the running of single-sex spaces. Campaigners from FWS say sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. They are challenging the Scottish government, which says they should also include trans people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The FWS action is seeking to overturn a decision by the Scottish courts in 2023 which found treating someone with a GRC as a woman under the Equality Act was lawful. What have the two sides said? Ruth Crawford KC, for the Scottish government, told the court last November that a person with a GRC, which she said was a document legally recognising a change of sex and gender, was entitled to the \"protection\" afforded to their acquired gender as set out in the 2010 Equality Act. But Aidan O'Neill KC, representing FWS, said \"sex just means sex, as that word and the words woman and man are understood and used in ordinary, everyday language, used every day in everyday situations by ordinary people\". Mr O'Neill called for the court to take account of \"the facts of biological reality rather than the fantasies of legal fiction\". The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges brought by FWS over the definition of \"woman\" in the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, which mandates 50% female representation on public boards. Beer brand ad controversy In 2023, US sales of Bud Light fell and profits dropped following a boycott of the beer brand after it made a promotional deal with Mulvaney. Many conservatives, including former US presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, stopped buying Bud Light after Mulvaney posted an ad for the brand on her social media account and shared an image of a personalised can. Mulvaney told Barbara Serra that for \"writing my book I really wanted to make good of a really dark situation that was happening when I took an unexpected beer brand ad\". \"And I think that while that was such a dark period of time in my life, and I think a lot of trans people's lives, I really wanted to show that if you keep going, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm feeling happy and healthy in my life right now,\" she said. Mulvaney is starring in a new musical in London, called We Aren't Kids Anymore, starting later this month."

        "Content": " An ancient oak tree thought to be more than 400 years old has been cut down in what has been called a \"depressing\" and \"devastating\" incident in north London. The remains of the trunk, surrounded by its severed branches, were discovered by council workers on 3 April in Whitewebbs Park, Enfield. The tree was on the border of a car park for a Toby Carvery restaurant. On Tuesday, it was confirmed by the chain's parent company, Mitchells & Butlers, that specialists advised them the tree was \"a potential health and safety risk\" and had been \"cut back\". \"This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care,\" it said. \"We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met.\" Sky News understands the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of criminality and has closed its investigation. Investigators established the tree was not subject to any preservation orders before it was felled. Earlier, the local council said it held a different opinion about whether the correct permission had been sought. Ergin Erbil, leader of Enfield Council, said: \"We are treating the matter as criminal damage and have reported it to the police. \"We've now placed a legal protection (Tree Preservation Order) on the tree and are looking at ways to help it grow back.\" The tree, which had a girth of 6.1m, was thought to be in the top 100 of London's 600,000 oak trees in terms of its size. Climate reporter Its former glory is gone: chunks of branches strewn on the ground around it, its thick rings exposed like severed limbs. Although this oak has not starred in a Hollywood film, it is beloved by locals and vitally important to the ecosystem. It is at this time in its life that an oak tree becomes so important for wildlife. As it dies back and hollows out, it provides home to bats and bees that wouldnâ€™t nest in trunks rotting into the ground. \"It's really that mix of living and dead [wood] that makes it so valuable,\" Ed Alnut from Guardians of Whitewebbs told me. \"It's kind of like a beating heart of the forest, that is able to be a home to a lot of different animals and plants. \"And now unfortunately that heartbeat has stopped, and it's lying in pieces on the ground.\"  Enfield Council has now put a tree preservation order in place, in the hope that they can protect what remains of its towering torso. Ed Allnutt and other \"devastated\" locals want to root out all the extra details to try to protect fellow trees in this rich, rare and ancient forest. Ed Pyne, Woodland Trust senior conservation adviser for trees, said: \"This is the most shocking fell I think I've ever seen in more than a decade working with ancient trees. \"In my view, and the view of many others, this is ecologically much more significant than the Sycamore Gap - and certainly a more irreplaceable tree.\" The head of campaigning at The Woodland Trust is calling for Toby Carvery's partner company, Mitchells & Butlers, to provide more information on the advice it received before the tree was cut down. Adam Cormack told Sky News: \"It wasn't dead because we found buds of leaves growing on the remains of branches that have been cut off the tree. The tree was very much alive. \"There might be information that Toby Carvery has that we don't have access to but there are other alternatives to felling, like rerouting people around,\" he explained. \"That's to reduce the health and safety risk and enable important trees to live on.\"  Mr Cormack said he would like to ask the company if alternatives were considered to felling, \"and if not, why not?\". On Monday, the Tree Council and Forest Research published a report calling for a \"robust and effective system\" to protect England's most important trees following the Sycamore Gap tree felling in September 2023. The trial of the two men, charged in connection with the felling, is due to take place later this month at Newcastle Crown Court.

I am personally devastated. \"We want answers, and we want guarantees the other trees here are being protected properly.\" Oak trees are valuable for UK wildlife, supporting thousands of species as well as capturing carbon from the atmosphere."
