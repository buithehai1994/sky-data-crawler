        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  The head of the Royal Navy has warned the government to \"step up\" and fund defence or risk losing the UK's superiority in the Atlantic to Russia. Should that happen, General Sir Gwyn Jenkins said it would be the first time since the end of the Second World War that Britain's warships and submarines were not the dominant force in their most vital sea lanes alongside their allies. \"We are holding on, but not by much,\" he told a conference in London on Monday. \"There is no room for complacency. Our would-be opponents are investing billions. We have to step up, or we will lose that advantage.\" As a senior, serving military officer speaking publicly, he did not make any direct criticism of the speed of plans by Sir Keir Starmer's government to increase defence spending. But Sky News has reported that he and his fellow chiefs held a \"very difficult meeting\" last month over how to fund plans to rebuild the armed forces amid fears of further cuts.  Defence sources said there was growing concern at the very top of the armed forces about a gap between the promises being made by the prime minister to fix the UK's hollowed-out defences and the reality of the size of the defence budget, which is currently not seen as growing fast enough. That means either billions of additional pounds must be found more quickly, or ambitions to modernise and transform the armed forces might need to be curbed, despite warnings of mounting threats from Russia and China, and pressure from Donald Trump on allies to spend more on their own defences. A Sky News and Tortoise podcast series called The Wargame tracks the hollowing out of the UK's military since the end of the Cold War and the risk that has created. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 General Jenkins, the first Royal Marine to serve as First Sea Lord, used a speech at the Sea Power Conference to say that Russia is still investing billions in its naval capabilities - in particular the Northern Fleet that operates in the Atlantic - even as it wages war against Ukraine. There has been a 30% increase in Russian incursions in the North Atlantic in the past two years, he said. That included the Yantar spy ship, which last month was spotted off the coast of Scotland and even shone a laser at the pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance plane that was tracking the vessel. Yet General Jenkins said what Russia is doing beneath the surface of the waves, where the UK and its allies store vital communications cables as well as critical oil and gas pipelines, was even more concerning. \"I can also tell you today that the advantage that we have enjoyed in the Atlantic since the end of the Second World War is at risk,\" he said. Read more:UK unveils undersea techDoes Britain's threat to Russia ring hollow? Navy facing huge challenges It is a particularly tough time for the navy, which has more ships and submarines alongside and unable to operate than at sea or at least ready to sail. The service is also suffering from a shortage of sailors and in particular submariners, which again is impacting the availability of the fleet. The crisis follows decades of funding cuts since the end of the Cold War, compounded by a litany of botched procurement programmes that has all too often seen vessels coming into service years late, at an inflated price and in too few numbers. Vision of 'hybrid navy' Despite the sombre tone, the First Sea Lord set out how he wants to transform his service and make it ready to fight a war - though not until 2029, a timeline that could be too slow if some predictions about the threat posed by Russia to NATO are correct.  His vision - working with industry and other allies - is about developing a blend of manned ships and submarines as well as unmanned ones - a \"hybrid navy\". He is also stripping back what he called the navy's own bureaucracies to enable the service to move much faster - crucially at the pace of the threat and the pace of rapid and growing technological change. \"We will face headwinds, we will face rough seas, but together, we can solve these problems if we have the appetite, if we have the determination, and if we have the mindset.\""

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent   Victims of maternity failings say they're \"disappointed\" with the findings of an interim report which they fear will have \"no teeth\" to make changes.  An investigation into NHS maternity services is under way after a series of shocking scandals. The National Maternity and Neonatal Investigation (NMNI) is being led by Baroness Amos, who said \"nothing prepared her\" for the amount of \"unacceptable care\" families currently receive. A report has been released documenting her initial reflections and impressions after meeting families and visiting hospitals. She will investigate 12 NHS trusts in total, including Oxford University Hospitals (OUH), which runs the world-renowned John Radcliffe Hospital. 'I was left in my own blood' Rebecca Matthews formed a campaign for families failed by OUH after her own traumatic births. Asked to discuss the care she received, she said she \"could only describe it as callous\". \"There wasn't any kindness there. I was left in my own blood,\" she added. Ms Matthews recently took part in evidence-gathering sessions held by Baroness Amos. But when she read her interim report, she said it was \"disappointing\", as it appeared to be \"a bullet point list of failings that actually we've seen time and time again in independent reviews\". \"The reflections don't mention accountability at all,\" she said. Your stories of birth trauma  'Why are we struggling to provide?' Based on her initial inquiries, Baroness Amos found common themes, including women not being listened to and being \"disregarded\" when they raised concerns. Many weren't given the right information to make informed choices about their care. She was told of discrimination against women of colour, working-class mothers, or parents who were younger. A \"staggering\" 748 recommendations have been made about NHS maternity services in recent years, Baroness Amos revealed - and she does \"not understand why change has been so slow\". She asked: \"Why are we in England still struggling to provide safe, reliable maternity and neonatal care everywhere in the country?\" The most recent health watchdog findings paint a depressing picture of maternity services. Almost two-thirds of acute hospital maternity services were judged either inadequate or required improvement for safety. Read more from Sky News:Three women describe traumatic childbirth This investigation is long overdue and isn't due to report back fully until the spring. But some campaigners are already worried it won't bring meaningful change to maternity services. Ms Matthews said it \"seems as though it's heading the same way that other reviews have gone in the past, leading to some recommendations but no teeth\". \"We need some mechanisms that are going to hold people and systems to account,\" she said. 'More to do' OUH chief nurse Yvonne Christley said in a statement that \"feedback received from patients using our maternity service over the last year is positive overall\". \"However, we know we have more to do to improve our maternity services,\" she added. \"Our present focus is on listening to the experiences of women and families, which is helping us to identify opportunities for improvement.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "Two teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan face possible deportation after being detained for abducting and raping a 15-year-old girl. Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, led the \"highly-distressed\" victim away from friends near Leamington town centre to a secluded \"den-type\" area in parkland, where they pushed her to the ground and attacked her. Sentencing the pair at Warwick Crown Court on Monday, Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said they ignored the victim's \"vigorous protests\" and told them what they did \"changed her life forever\". \"No child should have to suffer the ordeal that she suffered. It's clear from the footage we have seen that no one can seriously entertain the thought that you believed she was consenting,\" she said. \"You both knew perfectly well that what you were doing was criminal and wrong,\" the judge added. 'Highly distressing' After lifting reporting restrictions protecting the identities of the defendants, the judge told them they had \"betrayed\" those who come to Britain seeking sanctuary and who observed the law. Both defendants were unaccompanied child asylum seekers who arrived in the UK last year, prosecutor Shawn Williams said. The incident happened in May of this year. \"Highly distressing\" phone video found by police showed the victim screamed for help, but Jahanzeb placed his hand over her mouth. CCTV footage showed that after being led away against her will, the terrified victim was \"moved to a bushy den-type area - a really secluded location\" before, according to her, she was \"pushed to her knees before being raped\". \"The prosecution case is that it was probably Jahanzeb that did that, but what is certain is that Israr Niazal was present and participating,\" Mr Williams said. The victim had made \"explicit verbal protests\" during what Mr Williams described as an abduction. What are their sentences? Jahanzeb, who has already been served with deportation notification papers, was given 10 years, eight months' youth detention. Niazal, who may also be deported, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. They will start their sentences in a young offenders' institution and move to prison at a later date, police said. Both pleaded guilty to rape at an earlier hearing.

After sentence was passed, Judge de Bertodano said the victim had been \"beyond brave\" in attending court at a previous stage, when the defendants had intended to plead not guilty. They were both ordered to register as sex offenders."

        "Content": "A \"striking\" new design for UK trains has been revealed by the transport secretary - but you may well think it looks familiar. Train services already in public ownership will begin to adopt a Union flag-inspired design from this spring, Heidi Alexander has confirmed. It's part of the government's efforts to nationalise most passenger rail services in the UK and run them under the new Great British Railways (GBR) brand - with its logo to be unveiled later today. Ms Alexander will be speaking more about GBR - which is due to be formally established in 2027 - on Mornings With Ridge And Frost from around 7.10am. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?  The branding features the familiar double arrow symbol used by British Rail when the country's trains were last state-owned. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport (DfT) said the \"iconic\" symbol has been incorporated into the new GBR logo to reflect \"Britain's proud railway heritage\". Ms Alexander has insisted it \"isn't just a paint job\", saying: \"It represents a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers.\" Special one-day public exhibition launched People in the capital will be able to see the new train livery for themselves today, with a special one-day exhibit being held at London Bridge station, where a GBR-branded Hornby model train will be on display. The government has also partnered with a gaming company to create mock-ups of the new design, and those at the station will be able to see a digital demonstration of the new artwork in Train Sim World 6. The new designs will also be beamed on to digital display boards over the coming days at Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, and Leeds City. It comes as MPs prepare to debate the government's Railways Bill in the Commons. The government has taken control of seven major operators so far, but has pledged to return all passenger services to public ownership as contracts with existing operators expire or are broken through a failure to deliver. Read more:What is Labour's rail nationalisation plan?Rail fares frozen for first time in 30 years What will nationalisation actually involve? The government has said its Railways Bill will bring 17 different organisations together and will also lead to greater accountability, better services and an easier way to buy tickets. Among the measures is the creation of a GBR app, where passengers will be able to check train times and buy tickets without booking fees, while those with disabilities will be able to also request assistance. The draft law would also beef up accountability by creating a strengthened Passenger Watchdog, while GBR would operate both services and maintain the railways themselves. Ministers have pointed to improvements to existing services since they have been nationalised, such as South Western Railway boosting capacity by almost 10% by quadrupling its number of Arterio trains in service. A new East Coast Main Line timetable will also come into effect this month, which the government says will lead to 10,000 extra LNER services every year, or roughly 60,000 extra seats a week."

        "Content": " Europe must \"ramp up\" pressure on Russia \"to bring an end to this barbaric war\", a Downing Street spokesperson said after Sir Keir Starmer chaired a meeting with the Coalition of the Willing. Earlier, the prime minister met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at Downing Street for crisis talks on the future of Ukraine. After the Downing Street meeting, a spokesperson said Sir Keir \"convened a call with other European allies alongside President Zelenskyy\". \"The leaders all agreed that now is a critical moment and that we must continue to ramp up support to Ukraine and economic pressure on Putin to bring an end to this barbaric war.\" Ukraine latest: 'Critical stage' in push for peace  During the earlier meeting, the Downing Street spokesperson said that the leaders \"discussed the importance of the US-led peace talks for European security and supported the progress made\". All four \"underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees,\" the spokesperson added. \"The leaders agreed that, while diplomatic efforts continue, Europe must stand with Ukraine, strengthening its ability to defend against relentless attacks that have left thousands without heat or light,\" they said. \"They also discussed positive progress made to use immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's reconstruction.\"  After arriving in the UK, Mr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram that \"we are joining our efforts to end this war with a decent peace for Ukraine\" and that \"security must be guaranteed\". He later said: \"We can't manage without Americans, we can't manage without Europe and that is why we need to make some important decisions.\" The discussions come as US President Donald Trump accused Mr Zelenskyy of having failed to read the latest peace plan. He said he was \"a little disappointed\" in the Ukrainian leader, while insisting Russia's Vladimir Putin was \"fine with it\". Mr Trump's eldest son had earlier told Sky's lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim in an interview that his father may walk away from the Ukraine peace process. When asked directly if he believed the US president would walk away from Ukraine, he answered: \"I think he may, what's good about my father and what's unique about my father is you don't know what he's going to do. He's unpredictable.\" Sir Keir had earlier insisted any ceasefire must be \"just\" and \"lasting\", adding: \"We are at a critical stage in the push for peace. \"The principles remain the same. We stand with Ukraine, and if there is to be a ceasefire, it needs to be a just and lasting ceasefire.\" Mr Macron had insisted Ukraine's allies have \"a lot of cards\" - but the main issue was to \"finalise these peace negotiations\" and find the \"best possible conditions for Ukraine, for the Europeans, and for collective security\".  Moments after arriving at Downing Street, Mr Merz said he was \"sceptical about some of the details in documents coming from the US\" but that was one of the reasons for Monday's talks. The four European leaders emerged from Downing Street at around 2.20pm for a group photo - but declined to answer any questions from the media. Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy then went back inside the prime minister's residence for further talks while Mr Macron and Mr Merz departed.

Over the weekend, Mr Zelenskyy said he had discussed \"next steps\" with Mr Trump's advisers and was \"determined to keep working in good faith\". According to Vatican sources, the Ukrainian president will next meet with Pope Leo at Castel Gandolfo, the papal residence outside of Rome, on Tuesday morning."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The day after Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted Angela Rayner back in the cabinet, she showed Labour MPs what they've been missing. The former deputy prime minister delighted Labour backbenchers with a powerful Commons speech defending her workers' rights legislation on Monday evening. With the House of Lords locked in a battle of parliamentary \"ping pong\" with MPs, she told ministers: \"Now is not the time to blink or buckle.\" Her very public intervention came amid claims that her next move has the Labour Party on tenterhooks and that she's the favourite to succeed Sir Keir if she wants the job. And her speech, delivered from notes and clearly meticulously prepared, appeared to send a message to Labour MPs: I'm here to make a comeback. Exclusive: Starmer would lose leadership contest The government's flagship Employment Rights Bill was championed by Ms Rayner when she was deputy PM, in the face of bitter opposition from the Conservatives. In a bid to end the deadlock with the Lords, ministers have backed down on unfair dismissal protection from day one, proposing a compromise of six months. Backing the compromise, brokered with the TUC, Ms Rayner said: \"I know ministers had faced difficult decisions and difficult discussions with the employers and worker representatives. \"But I strongly believe that the work that has been done has been necessary, and we should be able to move forward now.\"  'No excuses' Attacking the upper chamber for delaying the legislation, she said: \"There is now no more time to waste. \"Vested interests worked with the Tories and the Lib Dems and, cheered on by Reform and backed by the Greens, to resist the manifesto on which we were elected. \"And now there can be no excuses. We have a mandate for a new deal for working people, and we must, and we will deliver it. And she concluded: \"It has been a battle to pass this bill, but progress is always a struggle that we fought for. Its passage will be a historic achievement for this Labour government. \"It will benefit working people now and into the future. Now is not the time to blink or buckle. Let's not waste a minute more. It's time to deliver.\"  Could she replace her old boss? It was the sort of fighting talk and defiance of the government's opponents that will have cheered up Labour MPs and boosted her hopes of a comeback and even a leadership bid. Speculation over Sir Keir's future grows more frenzied by the day, with claims that even some of his own supporters have begun the hunt for his successor. The thinktank that ran his leadership campaign in 2020, Labour Together, is reported to be canvassing party members on candidates to replace him. There was even a claim last week that allies of Wes Streeting were sounding out Labour MPs about a pact with Ms Rayner and a joint ticket for the leadership. The health secretary dismissed that claim as a \"silly season story\", while a Rayner ally said: \"There's no vacancy and there's no pact\". They added that she will not \"be played like a pawn\". Mr Streeting did, however, start speculation himself when he said in his Labour conference speech: \"We want her back. We need her back.\" Fuelling more speculation, Sir Keir went further than he had previously on Sunday, when he was asked in an Observer interview if he missed her and replied: \"Yes, of course I do. I was really sad that we lost her.\" And asked if she would return to the cabinet, the prime minister said: \"Yes. She's hugely talented.\" Sir Keir also described Ms Rayner, who left school at 16 without any qualifications, as \"the best social mobility story this country has ever seen\". Read more from Sky News:Navy chief's chilling warningNew design for nationalised trains  But a swift return to the cabinet would be hugely controversial, because the PM's ethic adviser, Sir Laurie Magner, ruled that she breached the ministerial code by underpaying stamp duty when she bought a flat. But she has been linked to speculation about possible efforts to remove Sir Keir if - as predicted - Labour performs badly in the Scottish, Welsh and local elections next May. Her supporters also claim she will eventually be cleared by HMRC over her stamp duty breach, clearing the way for her to come back. And her latest speech - combative, defiant and yet loyal - will have boosted her hopes, and reminded Labour MPs what they've missed since she quit in September."

The 7.5-magnitude quake struck at about 11.15pm local time, around 80 kilometers off the coast of Aomori prefecture.

A tsunami of 70cm was measured just south of Aomori, in Kuji port, Iwate prefecture, while levels of up to 50cm struck elsewhere in the region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. \"I've never experienced such a big shaking,\" said Nobuo Yamada, who owns a convenience store in Hachinohe, Aomori, in an interview with public broadcaster NHK. Earlier on, the meteorological agency issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to 3m/10ft, with 90,000 residents ordered to evacuate.

While Satoshi Kato, vice principal of a public high school in the same town, encountered traffic jams and car accidents en-route to the school as panicked people tried to flee. Japan has recent experience of the perils of earthquakes - one in 2011 unleashed a tsunami that killed some 20,000 people and triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Today's quake caused about 450 litres of water to spill from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, the Nuclear Regulation Authority said. But water levels remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern, the authority added.

        "Content": " A nurse who complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor has won part of her employment tribunal against NHS Fife, although several claims were dismissed. Sandie Peggie took action against the health board after she was suspended from her job at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following a row on Christmas Eve 2023 with transgender medic Dr Beth Upton - who was born male and now identifies as a female. Ms Peggie, who has worked for the NHS for 30 years, was placed on special leave after Dr Upton made an allegation of bullying and harassment, and cited concerns about patient care. The nurse lodged a claim against NHS Fife and Dr Upton, citing the Equality Act 2010, including sexual harassment, harassment related to a protected belief, indirect discrimination, and victimisation. The employment tribunal hearings took place in Dundee before Judge Sandy Kemp earlier this year. In a written judgment on Monday, the harassment claim was upheld against NHS Fife, but allegations of discrimination, indirect discrimination and victimisation were dismissed. The claims against Dr Upton did not succeed and were dismissed. \n                  Sandie Peggie judgment piles pressure on government to issue long-delayed gender guidance\n                 \n                  Mother of student who took his own life after University of Glasgow grade error to collect his degree\n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 Ms Peggie stated: \"I am beyond relieved and delighted that the tribunal has found that my employer Fife Health Board harassed me after I complained about having to share a female-only changing room with a male colleague. \"The last two years have been agonising for me and my family. \"I will have much more to say in the coming days once I've been able to properly consider the lengthy judgment and discuss it with my legal team. \"For now, I am looking forward to spending a quiet few days with my family.\" Ms Peggie paid tribute to her \"incredible\" legal team, which included lead counsel Naomi Cunningham, junior counsel Dr Charlotte Elves, and solicitor Margaret Gribbon. She added: \"There are many others I would like to thank and will do so in the coming days.\" Ms Gribbon also said: \"The tribunal's findings that Fife Health Board harassed Sandie Peggie is a huge win for a tenacious and courageous woman standing up for her sex-based rights. \"This has been an extraordinarily lengthy and complex legal case.\" The solicitor said the team would not be in a position to make substantive comments on the ruling until later this week. But added that \"our preliminary thoughts are that aspects of the judgment are hugely problematic for women, leaving the onus on them to object when their privacy, dignity and safety are violated when men are given access to single-sex spaces\".

Political correspondent The Sandie Peggie case has been such a high-profile story because it gets to the heart of the debate about trans rights versus women's rights, which has been so fraught in recent years - especially in Scotland. While the Supreme Court ruled in April that the Equality Act referred to a person's biological sex - with major ramifications over who can use female-protected spaces - we are still waiting for long-delayed government guidance on how this should be applied. We are told it's due \"as soon as possible\". Government minister Dame Diana Johnson brightly told Darren McCaffrey on Sky's Politics Hub on Monday that organisations \"just need to get on with it - the law is clear\". But with so many organisations waiting for government guidance before changing policy - that's clearly not the case. Read more here It also found the board had harassed Ms Peggie by taking an unreasonable length of time to investigate the allegations against her; by making reference to patient care allegations against her on 28 March 2024; and giving an instruction to her not to discuss the case, until a further message a little over two weeks later which confirmed that applied only to the investigation. A separate hearing on remedy - which could see Ms Peggie receive financial compensation - will take place at a later date. NHS Fife said it had been a \"complex and lengthy process\". The health board added: \"The employment tribunal unanimously dismissed all of the claimant's allegations against Dr Upton and all of the allegations against the board apart from four specific aspects of the harassment complaint. \"We will now take time to work through the detail of the judgment alongside our legal team to understand fully what it means for the organisation. \"We want to recognise how difficult this tribunal has been for everyone directly and indirectly involved. \"Our focus now is to ensure that NHS Fife remains a supportive and inclusive environment for all employees and our patients and to deliver health and care to the population of Fife.\""

The 33-year-old forward told journalists after Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at Leeds - his third game not starting for Liverpool this season - that he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club, and his relationship with head coach Slot had broken down. Since then, Salah has been left out of the Champions League squad to face Inter Milan on Tuesday. He will not face any disciplinary action over his comments. When asked at a press conference on Monday whether Salah has played his last game for the club, Slot said: \"I have no clue. I cannot answer that question at this moment in time.\" Slot did add that \"I'm a firm believer there's always a possibility to return for a player\", but told reporters: \"It was a surprise to me when I heard he gave the comments he gave.\"  The Liverpool boss was asked whether Salah could come back into contention for Saturday's Premier League game with Brighton at Anfield and the Dutchman says that is a decision which would be taken after the Inter game on Tuesday night.

He does, but then it is up to us to react on it.\" Slot became the club's head coach last year and won the Premier League title in his first season in charge, while Salah joined Liverpool in June 2017 and has been one of the Premier League's best players.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  The head of the Royal Navy has warned the government to \"step up\" and fund defence or risk losing the UK's superiority in the Atlantic to Russia. Should that happen, General Sir Gwyn Jenkins said it would be the first time since the end of the Second World War that Britain's warships and submarines were not the dominant force in their most vital sea lanes alongside their allies. \"We are holding on, but not by much,\" he told a conference in London on Monday. \"There is no room for complacency. Our would-be opponents are investing billions. We have to step up, or we will lose that advantage.\" As a senior, serving military officer speaking publicly, he did not make any direct criticism of the speed of plans by Sir Keir Starmer's government to increase defence spending. But Sky News has reported that he and his fellow chiefs held a \"very difficult meeting\" last month over how to fund plans to rebuild the armed forces amid fears of further cuts.  Defence sources said there was growing concern at the very top of the armed forces about a gap between the promises being made by the prime minister to fix the UK's hollowed-out defences and the reality of the size of the defence budget, which is currently not seen as growing fast enough. That means either billions of additional pounds must be found more quickly, or ambitions to modernise and transform the armed forces might need to be curbed, despite warnings of mounting threats from Russia and China, and pressure from Donald Trump on allies to spend more on their own defences. A Sky News and Tortoise podcast series called The Wargame tracks the hollowing out of the UK's military since the end of the Cold War and the risk that has created. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 General Jenkins, the first Royal Marine to serve as First Sea Lord, used a speech at the Sea Power Conference to say that Russia is still investing billions in its naval capabilities - in particular the Northern Fleet that operates in the Atlantic - even as it wages war against Ukraine. There has been a 30% increase in Russian incursions in the North Atlantic in the past two years, he said. That included the Yantar spy ship, which last month was spotted off the coast of Scotland and even shone a laser at the pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance plane that was tracking the vessel. Yet General Jenkins said what Russia is doing beneath the surface of the waves, where the UK and its allies store vital communications cables as well as critical oil and gas pipelines, was even more concerning. \"I can also tell you today that the advantage that we have enjoyed in the Atlantic since the end of the Second World War is at risk,\" he said. Read more:UK unveils undersea techDoes Britain's threat to Russia ring hollow? Navy facing huge challenges It is a particularly tough time for the navy, which has more ships and submarines alongside and unable to operate than at sea or at least ready to sail. The service is also suffering from a shortage of sailors and in particular submariners, which again is impacting the availability of the fleet. The crisis follows decades of funding cuts since the end of the Cold War, compounded by a litany of botched procurement programmes that has all too often seen vessels coming into service years late, at an inflated price and in too few numbers. Vision of 'hybrid navy' Despite the sombre tone, the First Sea Lord set out how he wants to transform his service and make it ready to fight a war - though not until 2029, a timeline that could be too slow if some predictions about the threat posed by Russia to NATO are correct.  His vision - working with industry and other allies - is about developing a blend of manned ships and submarines as well as unmanned ones - a \"hybrid navy\". He is also stripping back what he called the navy's own bureaucracies to enable the service to move much faster - crucially at the pace of the threat and the pace of rapid and growing technological change. \"We will face headwinds, we will face rough seas, but together, we can solve these problems if we have the appetite, if we have the determination, and if we have the mindset.\""

        "Content": "Two teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan face possible deportation after being detained for abducting and raping a 15-year-old girl. Jan Jahanzeb and Israr Niazal, both 17, led the \"highly-distressed\" victim away from friends near Leamington town centre to a secluded \"den-type\" area in parkland, where they pushed her to the ground and attacked her. Sentencing the pair at Warwick Crown Court on Monday, Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said they ignored the victim's \"vigorous protests\" and told them what they did \"changed her life forever\". \"No child should have to suffer the ordeal that she suffered. It's clear from the footage we have seen that no one can seriously entertain the thought that you believed she was consenting,\" she said. \"You both knew perfectly well that what you were doing was criminal and wrong,\" the judge added. 'Highly distressing' After lifting reporting restrictions protecting the identities of the defendants, the judge told them they had \"betrayed\" those who come to Britain seeking sanctuary and who observed the law. Both defendants were unaccompanied child asylum seekers who arrived in the UK last year, prosecutor Shawn Williams said. The incident happened in May of this year. \"Highly distressing\" phone video found by police showed the victim screamed for help, but Jahanzeb placed his hand over her mouth. CCTV footage showed that after being led away against her will, the terrified victim was \"moved to a bushy den-type area - a really secluded location\" before, according to her, she was \"pushed to her knees before being raped\". \"The prosecution case is that it was probably Jahanzeb that did that, but what is certain is that Israr Niazal was present and participating,\" Mr Williams said. The victim had made \"explicit verbal protests\" during what Mr Williams described as an abduction. What are their sentences? Jahanzeb, who has already been served with deportation notification papers, was given 10 years, eight months' youth detention. Niazal, who may also be deported, was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. They will start their sentences in a young offenders' institution and move to prison at a later date, police said. Both pleaded guilty to rape at an earlier hearing.

After sentence was passed, Judge de Bertodano said the victim had been \"beyond brave\" in attending court at a previous stage, when the defendants had intended to plead not guilty. They were both ordered to register as sex offenders."

Train services already in public ownership will begin to adopt a Union flag-inspired design from this spring, Heidi Alexander has confirmed. It's part of the government's efforts to nationalise most passenger rail services in the UK and run them under the new Great British Railways (GBR) brand - with its logo to be unveiled later today. Ms Alexander will be speaking more about GBR - which is due to be formally established in 2027 - on Mornings With Ridge And Frost from around 7.10am. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?  The branding features the familiar double arrow symbol used by British Rail when the country's trains were last state-owned. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport (DfT) said the \"iconic\" symbol has been incorporated into the new GBR logo to reflect \"Britain's proud railway heritage\". Ms Alexander has insisted it \"isn't just a paint job\", saying: \"It represents a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers.\" Special one-day public exhibition launched People in the capital will be able to see the new train livery for themselves today, with a special one-day exhibit being held at London Bridge station, where a GBR-branded Hornby model train will be on display. The government has also partnered with a gaming company to create mock-ups of the new design, and those at the station will be able to see a digital demonstration of the new artwork in Train Sim World 6. The new designs will also be beamed on to digital display boards over the coming days at Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, and Leeds City. It comes as MPs prepare to debate the government's Railways Bill in the Commons. The government has taken control of seven major operators so far, but has pledged to return all passenger services to public ownership as contracts with existing operators expire or are broken through a failure to deliver. Read more:What is Labour's rail nationalisation plan?Rail fares frozen for first time in 30 years What will nationalisation actually involve? The government has said its Railways Bill will bring 17 different organisations together and will also lead to greater accountability, better services and an easier way to buy tickets. Among the measures is the creation of a GBR app, where passengers will be able to check train times and buy tickets without booking fees, while those with disabilities will be able to also request assistance. The draft law would also beef up accountability by creating a strengthened Passenger Watchdog, while GBR would operate both services and maintain the railways themselves. Ministers have pointed to improvements to existing services since they have been nationalised, such as South Western Railway boosting capacity by almost 10% by quadrupling its number of Arterio trains in service. A new East Coast Main Line timetable will also come into effect this month, which the government says will lead to 10,000 extra LNER services every year, or roughly 60,000 extra seats a week."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The day after Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted Angela Rayner back in the cabinet, she showed Labour MPs what they've been missing. The former deputy prime minister delighted Labour backbenchers with a powerful Commons speech defending her workers' rights legislation on Monday evening. With the House of Lords locked in a battle of parliamentary \"ping pong\" with MPs, she told ministers: \"Now is not the time to blink or buckle.\" Her very public intervention came amid claims that her next move has the Labour Party on tenterhooks and that she's the favourite to succeed Sir Keir if she wants the job. And her speech, delivered from notes and clearly meticulously prepared, appeared to send a message to Labour MPs: I'm here to make a comeback. Exclusive: Starmer would lose leadership contest The government's flagship Employment Rights Bill was championed by Ms Rayner when she was deputy PM, in the face of bitter opposition from the Conservatives. In a bid to end the deadlock with the Lords, ministers have backed down on unfair dismissal protection from day one, proposing a compromise of six months. Backing the compromise, brokered with the TUC, Ms Rayner said: \"I know ministers had faced difficult decisions and difficult discussions with the employers and worker representatives. \"But I strongly believe that the work that has been done has been necessary, and we should be able to move forward now.\"  'No excuses' Attacking the upper chamber for delaying the legislation, she said: \"There is now no more time to waste. \"Vested interests worked with the Tories and the Lib Dems and, cheered on by Reform and backed by the Greens, to resist the manifesto on which we were elected. \"And now there can be no excuses. We have a mandate for a new deal for working people, and we must, and we will deliver it. And she concluded: \"It has been a battle to pass this bill, but progress is always a struggle that we fought for. Its passage will be a historic achievement for this Labour government. \"It will benefit working people now and into the future. Now is not the time to blink or buckle. Let's not waste a minute more. It's time to deliver.\"  Could she replace her old boss? It was the sort of fighting talk and defiance of the government's opponents that will have cheered up Labour MPs and boosted her hopes of a comeback and even a leadership bid. Speculation over Sir Keir's future grows more frenzied by the day, with claims that even some of his own supporters have begun the hunt for his successor. The thinktank that ran his leadership campaign in 2020, Labour Together, is reported to be canvassing party members on candidates to replace him. There was even a claim last week that allies of Wes Streeting were sounding out Labour MPs about a pact with Ms Rayner and a joint ticket for the leadership. The health secretary dismissed that claim as a \"silly season story\", while a Rayner ally said: \"There's no vacancy and there's no pact\". They added that she will not \"be played like a pawn\". Mr Streeting did, however, start speculation himself when he said in his Labour conference speech: \"We want her back. We need her back.\" Fuelling more speculation, Sir Keir went further than he had previously on Sunday, when he was asked in an Observer interview if he missed her and replied: \"Yes, of course I do. I was really sad that we lost her.\" And asked if she would return to the cabinet, the prime minister said: \"Yes. She's hugely talented.\" Sir Keir also described Ms Rayner, who left school at 16 without any qualifications, as \"the best social mobility story this country has ever seen\". Read more from Sky News:Navy chief's chilling warningNew design for nationalised trains  But a swift return to the cabinet would be hugely controversial, because the PM's ethic adviser, Sir Laurie Magner, ruled that she breached the ministerial code by underpaying stamp duty when she bought a flat. But she has been linked to speculation about possible efforts to remove Sir Keir if - as predicted - Labour performs badly in the Scottish, Welsh and local elections next May. Her supporters also claim she will eventually be cleared by HMRC over her stamp duty breach, clearing the way for her to come back. And her latest speech - combative, defiant and yet loyal - will have boosted her hopes, and reminded Labour MPs what they've missed since she quit in September."

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent   Victims of maternity failings say they're \"disappointed\" with the findings of an interim report which they fear will have \"no teeth\" to make changes.  An investigation into NHS maternity services is under way after a series of shocking scandals. The National Maternity and Neonatal Investigation (NMNI) is being led by Baroness Amos, who said \"nothing prepared her\" for the amount of \"unacceptable care\" families currently receive. A report has been released documenting her initial reflections and impressions after meeting families and visiting hospitals. She will investigate 12 NHS trusts in total, including Oxford University Hospitals (OUH), which runs the world-renowned John Radcliffe Hospital. 'I was left in my own blood' Rebecca Matthews formed a campaign for families failed by OUH after her own traumatic births. Asked to discuss the care she received, she said she \"could only describe it as callous\". \"There wasn't any kindness there. I was left in my own blood,\" she added. Ms Matthews recently took part in evidence-gathering sessions held by Baroness Amos. But when she read her interim report, she said it was \"disappointing\", as it appeared to be \"a bullet point list of failings that actually we've seen time and time again in independent reviews\". \"The reflections don't mention accountability at all,\" she said. Your stories of birth trauma  'Why are we struggling to provide?' Based on her initial inquiries, Baroness Amos found common themes, including women not being listened to and being \"disregarded\" when they raised concerns. Many weren't given the right information to make informed choices about their care. She was told of discrimination against women of colour, working-class mothers, or parents who were younger. A \"staggering\" 748 recommendations have been made about NHS maternity services in recent years, Baroness Amos revealed - and she does \"not understand why change has been so slow\". She asked: \"Why are we in England still struggling to provide safe, reliable maternity and neonatal care everywhere in the country?\" The most recent health watchdog findings paint a depressing picture of maternity services. Almost two-thirds of acute hospital maternity services were judged either inadequate or required improvement for safety. Read more from Sky News:Three women describe traumatic childbirth This investigation is long overdue and isn't due to report back fully until the spring. But some campaigners are already worried it won't bring meaningful change to maternity services. Ms Matthews said it \"seems as though it's heading the same way that other reviews have gone in the past, leading to some recommendations but no teeth\". \"We need some mechanisms that are going to hold people and systems to account,\" she said. 'More to do' OUH chief nurse Yvonne Christley said in a statement that \"feedback received from patients using our maternity service over the last year is positive overall\". \"However, we know we have more to do to improve our maternity services,\" she added. \"Our present focus is on listening to the experiences of women and families, which is helping us to identify opportunities for improvement.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": " Europe must \"ramp up\" pressure on Russia \"to bring an end to this barbaric war\", a Downing Street spokesperson said after Sir Keir Starmer chaired a meeting with the Coalition of the Willing. Earlier, the prime minister met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at Downing Street for crisis talks on the future of Ukraine. After the Downing Street meeting, a spokesperson said Sir Keir \"convened a call with other European allies alongside President Zelenskyy\". \"The leaders all agreed that now is a critical moment and that we must continue to ramp up support to Ukraine and economic pressure on Putin to bring an end to this barbaric war.\" Ukraine latest: 'Critical stage' in push for peace  During the earlier meeting, the Downing Street spokesperson said that the leaders \"discussed the importance of the US-led peace talks for European security and supported the progress made\". All four \"underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees,\" the spokesperson added. \"The leaders agreed that, while diplomatic efforts continue, Europe must stand with Ukraine, strengthening its ability to defend against relentless attacks that have left thousands without heat or light,\" they said. \"They also discussed positive progress made to use immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's reconstruction.\"  After arriving in the UK, Mr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram that \"we are joining our efforts to end this war with a decent peace for Ukraine\" and that \"security must be guaranteed\". He later said: \"We can't manage without Americans, we can't manage without Europe and that is why we need to make some important decisions.\" The discussions come as US President Donald Trump accused Mr Zelenskyy of having failed to read the latest peace plan. He said he was \"a little disappointed\" in the Ukrainian leader, while insisting Russia's Vladimir Putin was \"fine with it\". Mr Trump's eldest son had earlier told Sky's lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim in an interview that his father may walk away from the Ukraine peace process. When asked directly if he believed the US president would walk away from Ukraine, he answered: \"I think he may, what's good about my father and what's unique about my father is you don't know what he's going to do. He's unpredictable.\" Sir Keir had earlier insisted any ceasefire must be \"just\" and \"lasting\", adding: \"We are at a critical stage in the push for peace. \"The principles remain the same. We stand with Ukraine, and if there is to be a ceasefire, it needs to be a just and lasting ceasefire.\" Mr Macron had insisted Ukraine's allies have \"a lot of cards\" - but the main issue was to \"finalise these peace negotiations\" and find the \"best possible conditions for Ukraine, for the Europeans, and for collective security\".  Moments after arriving at Downing Street, Mr Merz said he was \"sceptical about some of the details in documents coming from the US\" but that was one of the reasons for Monday's talks. The four European leaders emerged from Downing Street at around 2.20pm for a group photo - but declined to answer any questions from the media. Sir Keir and Mr Zelenskyy then went back inside the prime minister's residence for further talks while Mr Macron and Mr Merz departed.

According to Vatican sources, the Ukrainian president will next meet with Pope Leo at Castel Gandolfo, the papal residence outside of Rome, on Tuesday morning."

        "Content": " Arne Slot has said he has \"no clue\" whether Mohamed Salah has played his last game for Liverpool. The 33-year-old forward told journalists after Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at Leeds - his third game not starting for Liverpool this season - that he has been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club, and his relationship with head coach Slot had broken down. Since then, Salah has been left out of the Champions League squad to face Inter Milan on Tuesday. He will not face any disciplinary action over his comments. When asked at a press conference on Monday whether Salah has played his last game for the club, Slot said: \"I have no clue. I cannot answer that question at this moment in time.\" Slot did add that \"I'm a firm believer there's always a possibility to return for a player\", but told reporters: \"It was a surprise to me when I heard he gave the comments he gave.\"  The Liverpool boss was asked whether Salah could come back into contention for Saturday's Premier League game with Brighton at Anfield and the Dutchman says that is a decision which would be taken after the Inter game on Tuesday night.

He does, but then it is up to us to react on it.\" Slot became the club's head coach last year and won the Premier League title in his first season in charge, while Salah joined Liverpool in June 2017 and has been one of the Premier League's best players. The forward is due to travel to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with Egypt on 15 December and has been linked with a January move to the Saudi Pro League."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Patients with a previously untreatable form of blood cancer are now living disease-free after a world-first gene therapy. Alyssa Tapley, 16, became the first patient with an aggressive form of leukaemia to have the experimental treatment in 2022. She was considering options for palliative care, but is now healthy. New results have been published of a clinical trial on a further eight children and two adults at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and King's College Hospital in London. Two-thirds have been disease-free for up to three years. Dr Deborah Yallop, consultant haematologist at King's, said: \"We've seen impressive responses in clearing leukaemia that seemed incurable - it's a very powerful approach.\" The patients in the study had T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of blood cancer that results from T-cells in the immune system growing out of control. They had all failed to respond to existing treatment. So the medical team tried an experimental technique to turn T-cells taken from a donor into fighting machines that beat the cancer. The technique, called BE-CAR7, is a highly precise tool for changing individual letters in the genetic code, the instruction manual for all cells in the body. Changing just one letter - what scientists call DNA \"bases\" - can alter the function of a gene in much the same way as substituting a single key letter in a text message can change its meaning. The scientists made three individual \"base-edits\" to the donor T-cells. The DNA tweaks made the cells an \"off-the-shelf\" treatment that didn't need to be matched to patients like other transplants. And they also instructed the donor T-cells to destroy every one of a patient's own T-cells - whether they were cancerous or not. If all the T-cells were eradicated within four weeks of treatment, patients were able to go on and have a bone-marrow transplant to rebuild a healthy immune system. Alyssa 'doing really well' According to results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 82% of the patients in the trial were in \"very deep remission\" after treatment and were able to have a transplant. And 64% remain disease-free. Alyssa said she was now \"doing really well\". \"I've gone sailing, spent time away from home doing my Duke of Edinburgh Award but even just going to school is something I dreamed of when I was ill,\" she said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. \"Next on my list is learning to drive, but my ultimate goal is to become a research scientist and be part of the next big discovery that can help people like me.\" Hospital charity agrees to support treatment of 10 more patients The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity has now agreed to support treatment for another 10 patients. Dr Rob Chiesa, study investigator and bone marrow transplant consultant at GOSH, said: \"Although most children with T-cell leukaemia will respond well to standard treatments, around 20% may not. \"It's these patients who desperately need better options and this research provides hope for a better prognosis for everyone diagnosed with this rare but aggressive form of blood cancer.\" Results 'bring hope' UK stem cell charity Anthony Nolan worked with the research team to provide T-cell donors. Dr Tania Dexter, senior medical officer at the charity, said: \"Considering these patients had a low chance of survival before the trial, these results bring hope that treatments like this will continue to advance and become available to more patients. \"As with any novel cellular therapy, this phase 1 trial is just an initial indication of the effectiveness and safety of the treatment, and more work must be done to determine its wider clinical application. \"Yet the results are encouraging and demonstrate the recent leaps in technology that are allowing us to take on even greater challenges in the treatment of blood cancers and blood disorders.\""

        "Content": " A nurse who complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor has won part of her employment tribunal against NHS Fife, although several claims were dismissed. Sandie Peggie took action against the health board after she was suspended from her job at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following a row on Christmas Eve 2023 with transgender medic Dr Beth Upton - who was born male and now identifies as a female. Ms Peggie, who has worked for the NHS for 30 years, was placed on special leave after Dr Upton made an allegation of bullying and harassment, and cited concerns about patient care. The nurse lodged a claim against NHS Fife and Dr Upton, citing the Equality Act 2010, including sexual harassment, harassment related to a protected belief, indirect discrimination, and victimisation. The employment tribunal hearings took place in Dundee before Judge Sandy Kemp earlier this year. In a written judgment on Monday, the harassment claim was upheld against NHS Fife, but allegations of discrimination, indirect discrimination and victimisation were dismissed. The claims against Dr Upton did not succeed and were dismissed. \n                  Sandie Peggie judgment piles pressure on government to issue long-delayed gender guidance\n                 \n                  Mother of student who took his own life after University of Glasgow grade error to collect his degree\n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 Ms Peggie stated: \"I am beyond relieved and delighted that the tribunal has found that my employer Fife Health Board harassed me after I complained about having to share a female-only changing room with a male colleague. \"The last two years have been agonising for me and my family. \"I will have much more to say in the coming days once I've been able to properly consider the lengthy judgment and discuss it with my legal team. \"For now, I am looking forward to spending a quiet few days with my family.\" Ms Peggie paid tribute to her \"incredible\" legal team, which included lead counsel Naomi Cunningham, junior counsel Dr Charlotte Elves, and solicitor Margaret Gribbon. She added: \"There are many others I would like to thank and will do so in the coming days.\" Ms Gribbon also said: \"The tribunal's findings that Fife Health Board harassed Sandie Peggie is a huge win for a tenacious and courageous woman standing up for her sex-based rights. \"This has been an extraordinarily lengthy and complex legal case.\" The solicitor said the team would not be in a position to make substantive comments on the ruling until later this week. But added that \"our preliminary thoughts are that aspects of the judgment are hugely problematic for women, leaving the onus on them to object when their privacy, dignity and safety are violated when men are given access to single-sex spaces\". Read more:NHS Fife chief announces early retirement ahead of ruling The tribunal found that NHS Fife had harassed Ms Peggie by failing to revoke the grant of permission to Dr Upton on an interim basis after the nurse complained, for the period until different work rotas took effect so that they would not work together and said that, as a result, Dr Upton was in the changing room when the claimant was present on two occasions. Political correspondent The Sandie Peggie case has been such a high-profile story because it gets to the heart of the debate about trans rights versus women's rights, which has been so fraught in recent years - especially in Scotland. While the Supreme Court ruled in April that the Equality Act referred to a person's biological sex - with major ramifications over who can use female-protected spaces - we are still waiting for long-delayed government guidance on how this should be applied. We are told it's due \"as soon as possible\". Government minister Dame Diana Johnson brightly told Darren McCaffrey on Sky's Politics Hub on Monday that organisations \"just need to get on with it - the law is clear\". But with so many organisations waiting for government guidance before changing policy - that's clearly not the case. Read more here It also found the board had harassed Ms Peggie by taking an unreasonable length of time to investigate the allegations against her; by making reference to patient care allegations against her on 28 March 2024; and giving an instruction to her not to discuss the case, until a further message a little over two weeks later which confirmed that applied only to the investigation. A separate hearing on remedy - which could see Ms Peggie receive financial compensation - will take place at a later date. NHS Fife said it had been a \"complex and lengthy process\". The health board added: \"The employment tribunal unanimously dismissed all of the claimant's allegations against Dr Upton and all of the allegations against the board apart from four specific aspects of the harassment complaint. \"We will now take time to work through the detail of the judgment alongside our legal team to understand fully what it means for the organisation. \"We want to recognise how difficult this tribunal has been for everyone directly and indirectly involved. \"Our focus now is to ensure that NHS Fife remains a supportive and inclusive environment for all employees and our patients and to deliver health and care to the population of Fife.\""

A tsunami of 70cm was measured just south of Aomori, in Kuji port, Iwate prefecture, while levels of up to 50cm struck elsewhere in the region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. \"I've never experienced such a big shaking,\" said Nobuo Yamada, who owns a convenience store in Hachinohe, Aomori, in an interview with public broadcaster NHK.

Since its staff were told to leave, there have been attempts to break into the compound, which has been secured by a team of guards employed by the UN. Sky News has been told that, when the Israeli officials arrived on Monday morning, the security guards were detained in a room within the compound. \"We didn't let them in when they first came to the compound, but they cut the chains and the locks and took control,\" said George, the head of security, who was standing outside the front gate when we arrived. \"They told my guards to stay in one room, took their phones from them, and told them they couldn't leave.\" 'The false accusations led to this' UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, said the raid was \"a blatant disregard of Israel's obligation as a United Nations Member State to protect and respect the inviolability of UN premises\". He said that failing to cooperate with UN agencies \"represent a new challenge to international law, one that creates a dangerous precedent anywhere else the UN is present across the world\". His anger was not isolated. Outside the gates of the UNRWA compound, we met Hakam Shahwam, who used to work here as UNRWA's chief of staff. It was, he said, \"a very sad day\". Shahwam says the claims that UNRWA was a breeding ground for Hamas had led to the raid. He told me: \"The false accusations led to this. This is a shameful day, not only for the United Nations but also for the government of Israel. \"There must be a strong protest, and a response from the international community. This is unacceptable.\" Read more from Adam Parsons:Gaza longs for normality, but quasi-anarchy reignsIsraeli forces kill two Palestinians after apparent surrender 'It is time for UNRWA to be dismantled' The Israeli government remains adamant that its criticism of UNRWA is justified.

It is not part of the solution for Gaza, it is part of the problem.\" She did not comment on the legality of the raid, or on Israel's ongoing commitment to the UN Charter."

        "Content": "Greek farmers angered by delayed subsidy payments have shut down the international airport on Crete and clashed with riot police. Images from local media showed dozens of farmers standing on the apron at Nikos Kazantzakis International Airport in Heraklion, the largest city on Crete. The airport was forced to suspend all flights, while fights between protesters and riot police broke out in Chania, the Greek island's second-largest city, where two people were reportedly injured. Officers used tear gas to disperse protesting farmers who pelted them with rocks and overturned a police patrol car, according to local media. The protests were sparked after delays in the payment of European Union-backed agricultural subsidies, which followed a scandal over fraudulent subsidy claims. Authorities are reviewing all requests for EU farm subsidies, which protesters argue amount to collective punishment and leave farmers in debt and unable to plant their fields for next season.

Elsewhere, police have been enforcing traffic diversions in several parts of northern and central Greece, while farmer roadblocks at the country's northern borders with Bulgaria, Turkey and North Macedonia have hampered truck traffic.

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n Those lucky enough to have been there at the dawn of Syria's new future will never forget it. After more than half a century of repression, an entire nation erupted in deafening celebration. Guns blazed upwards into the skies over Damascus, tens of thousands came out to sing, dance and do whatever else had been banned for decades. The hated, wicked Bashar al Assad and his murderous clan had been routed, sent packing to Moscow and Syrians took to the streets and romped through his forbidden palaces to savour their freedom. But a year on, the country faces enormous challenges. The good news first. Syria has not descended into chaos and bedlam as have other revolutions. There is an order and stability of sorts, with some regrettable and bloody exceptions. Ahmed al Sharaa, the Al Qaeda jihadi turned revolutionary leader, has achieved the most on the world stage. In a startling diplomatic tour de force, he has charmed his way from Riyadh to Washington. The first Syrian leader ever to visit the White House, he was feted by US President Donald Trump, who even sprayed him with aftershave. Al Sharaa's wooing of the American president, with the help of Middle Eastern allies, has been as successful as it was unexpected.  US sanctions are being lifted, promising the economic relief his country so desperately needs. Foreign investment is beginning to pour in from Turkey and the Gulf. Some neighbours have been less helpful. Israel has chosen a path of suspicious cynicism. Having opposed the Assads for decades, it has appeared unwilling to give the benefit of the doubt to the forces that removed it. Read more:Syria jubilantly marks a year since Assad's fallFrom enemy to ally: Why Sharaa's Trump meeting matters Israeli airstrikes have destroyed much of the military hardware the new government could have used to maintain control and order. Israeli forces have seized a chunk of southern Syria and continue to violate the sovereignty of its neighbour with operations deep inside its territory. Ahmed al Sharaa has been successful in removing the repressive apparatus of the Assad regime, emptying its hated prisons and disbanding its secret police. Fears of a Taliban-style Syrian state have proven so far unfounded. Alcohol is tolerated, and women are encouraged to play a role in the state. But there are reasons to be worried. The new government's security forces have been blamed for the slaughter of Alawite and Druze minorities, whose welfare Israel claims to be protecting in its interventions. Al Sharaa's efforts to forge a new political settlement, including all Syria's many communities, are looking opaque and slow. He will need to do a lot more if he wants to build the foundations of a stable and modern state. Mr Trump says Al Sharaa and his country deserve a chance. Syria's new leader must not squander it. There was enormous hope and promise on the streets of Damascus in the days after Assad's spectacular fall. As with every revolution, there is both opportunity and huge jeopardy, and the window for progress narrows as those memories fade."

The attacks on 4 December began with repeated strikes on the kindergarten in South Kordofan state. It continued even as parents and caretakers rushed to the wounded in a nearby hospital, WHO added. It comes as Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said today it had taken control of the strategic Heglig oilfield in the South Kordofan province, two and a half years into the country's civil war. WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X: \"Repeated strikes in Sudan's South Kordofan state hit a kindergarten and, at least three times, the nearby Kalogi Rural Hospital, killing 114 people, including 63 children, and injuring 35 people, according to WHO's Attacks on Health Care monitoring system. \"Survivors from the 4 December attacks have been moved to Abu Jebaiha, in South Kordofan, for treatment, and urgent calls are being made for blood donations and other medical support. \"Disturbingly, paramedics and responders came under attack as they tried to move the injured from the kindergarten to the hospital.\"  Heglig, lying along Sudan's south border, houses the main processing facility for South Sudanese oil, which makes up much of the revenue for South Sudan's government. Government forces and workers at the oil field withdrew from the area on Sunday to avoid clashes that could have damaged oil facilities, government sources told the news agency Reuters.

The WHO added that a massacre also occurred in October in the city of al-Fashir. Sudan's Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, which it says were carried out by the Rapid Support Forces using drones. The WHO said a total of 114 people, including 63 children, were killed in the attacks, with heavy weapons used. 35 were also wounded. The toll combines casualties from the kindergarten strikes, the transfer of patients to the adjacent rural hospital and attacks at the facility itself. The RSF did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

        "Content": " Thailand has launched airstrikes along its border with Cambodia as both sides accused the other of attacking first. One Thai soldier was killed, and eight others wounded, according to Thai army spokesperson Major General Winthai Suvaree, who also said Cambodian troops fired first into Thai territory. Thailand used aircraft \"to strike military targets in several areas to suppress Cambodian supporting fire attacks,\" he added. At least four Cambodian civilians have been killed and nine injured, Cambodia's information minister Neth Pheaktra said. Cambodian officials said the Thai military attacked their troops first in Preah Vihear province. \"Cambodia urges that Thailand immediately stop all hostile activities that threaten peace and stability in the region,\" said Cambodian defence ministry spokesperson Maly Socheata. Tensions have simmered since the neighbouring countries signed a US-brokered ceasefire agreement in October, put forward by President Donald Trump. Their territorial disputes led to five days of combat in July that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that military operations would be carried out as necessary to defend the country and protect public safety. \"Thailand has never wished for violence. I'd like to reiterate that Thailand has never initiated a fight or an invasion, but will never tolerate a violation of its sovereignty,\" he said. In Thailand, more than 385,000 civilians across several border districts are being evacuated, with over 35,000 already housed in temporary shelters, military officials said. Meanwhile, the Cambodian Education Ministry said several schools along the border had been shut. Footage posted online showed what appeared to be students hurriedly leaving classes to meet their parents. Asia correspondent This escalation between Cambodia and Thailand marks the most serious confrontation between the two southeastern neighbours since they agreed to a ceasefire just two months ago. The truce, brokered by Donald Trump, who declared he'd ended their conflict, now hangs in the balance. Each side is accusing the other of firing first- just as they did back in July this year when deadly skirmishes left 48 people dead and around 300,000 displaced. Once again huge number of civilians are evacuating border areas. Cambodia's influential former leader, Hun Sen, father of the current premier, has urged restraint against Thai \"aggressors\". Meanwhile, Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has said they're ready to \"conduct all military operations to preserve territorial integrity.\" The two nations' border disagreements are more than a century old and they remain unresolved. Neither side can afford all-out war right now and today, it seems highly unlikely. But if civilian targets are hit, tensions could very quickly intensify. Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim urged Thailand and Cambodia to \"exercise maximum restraint\". In a post on social media, he added: \"Our region cannot afford to see long-standing disputes slip into cycles of confrontation.\" Si Sa Ket, Surin and Ubon Ratchathani provinces in Thailand, and Cambodia's Preah Vihear and Oddar Meanchey provinces were among the areas said to be caught up in the latest clashes. On Sunday, both nations accused each other of opening fire along the border in what the Thai army said was an incident that lasted around 20 minutes and resulted in the injury of two of its soldiers. But Cambodia said that the Thai side fired first and that Cambodian troops did not retaliate.

        "Content": "An American student has been found guilty of murdering a Chinese woman after she accused him of passing on a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Appearing at the Old Bailey, Joshua Michals, 26, was found to have fatally stabbed Zhe Wang, 31, at her flat in Manor Park, Lewisham, south-east London, on 20 March last year. The two were both students at Goldsmiths University, where Michals was pursuing a master's degree and Ms Wang studied creative writing, and had begun a casual relationship in 2023. Michals told jurors that Ms Wang was \"germophobic\" and became \"stressed\" after she incorrectly thought she had contracted an STD after they had sex. Prosecutor Henrietta Paget KC added that the 26-year-old, originally from Chicago, Illinois, had \"flown into a rage\" and killed Ms Wang after meeting her at her flat. A post-mortem examination found Ms Wang died from stab wounds to the head and compression to the neck. During the trial, jurors heard that Ms Wang found a \"red dot\" on her skin, prompting her to demand Michals get an STD test and vow to find him on campus and \"drag\" him to see a GP. \n                  Heathrow Airport live: Woman targeted in suitcase robbery before 'pepper spray' incident, police say\n                 \n                  Crumble and custard thrown at State Crown display case in Tower of London\n                 \n                  Nursery worker, 45, pleads guilty to 26 sexual offences against children\n                 Michals told the court he went to Ms Wang's on the day of the incident to bring some \"normalcy\" to the \"bizarre situation,\" and claimed that on arrival, he found her \"cold\" and monosyllabic. He claimed Ms Wang attacked him with a knife as he came out of the bathroom, that he did not intend to strike her with the knife, and that he pressed his forearm to her neck to restrain her. Earlier in the trial, Brian St Louis KC, defending, told the court Ms Wang messaged Michals \"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you\" the day before the incident, and that \"he had split seconds to do whatever he could to make sure that he was not stabbed\". Victim's phone thrown away The court later heard that after the incident, Michals called his father and got the details for a solicitor before returning to his own apartment in Deals Gateway, Deptford, and calling 999. Ms Wang was then found dead at the scene by emergency services. The court previously heard that Michals took Ms Wang's phone from her kitchen and put it in a bin outside on the night of the incident. It was recovered days later at a refuse area in Newham, east London. Jurors returned a guilty verdict after 16-and-a-half hours of deliberations. Michals will be sentenced at a later date.

She was deeply loved by her peers, who continue to speak of her gentleness, her humour and her thoughtful presence.

The US president acknowledged in remarks to reporters there \"could be a problem\", acknowledging concerns over the streaming giant's market dominance. Crucially, he did not say where he stood on the issue. Money latest: The cheapest days to travel by plane It was revealed on Friday that Netflix, already the world's biggest streaming service by market share, had agreed to buy Warner Bros Discovery's TV, film studios and HBO Max streaming division. The deal aims to complete late next year after the Discovery element of the business, mainly legacy TV channels showing cartoons, news and sport, has been spun off. But the deal has attracted cross-party criticism on competition grounds, and there is also opposition in Hollywood.  The Writers Guild of America said: \"The world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent. \"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.\" Republican Senator, Roger Marshall, said in a statement: \"Netflix's attempt to buy Warner Bros would be the largest media takeover in history - and it raises serious red flags for consumers, creators, movie theaters, and local businesses alike. \"One company should not have full vertical control of the content and the distribution pipeline that delivers it. And combining two of the largest streaming platforms is a textbook horizontal Antitrust problem. \"Prices, choice, and creative freedom are at stake. Regulators need to take a hard look at this deal, and realize how harmful it would be for consumers and Western society.\" Paramount Skydance and Comcast, the parent company of Sky News, were two other bidders in the auction process that preceded the announcement. The Reuters news agency, citing information from sources, said their bids were rejected in favour of Netflix for different reasons.

        "Content": "Paramount has launched a $108.4bn (£81bn) hostile bid for Warner Bros, challenging Netflix, which had reached a $72bn (£54bn) takeover deal with the company. Paramount said on Monday that it was going straight to Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) shareholders with its cash offer for the entirety of the company, including its Global Networks segment, asking them to reject the deal with Netflix. On Friday Netflix struck a deal to buy WBD, the Hollywood giant behind \"Harry Potter\" and HBO Max The cash and stock deal is valued at $27.75 (£20.80) per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7bn (£62bn), including debt. But Paramount says its deal will pay $30 (£22.50) cash per share, representing $18bn (£13.5bn) more in cash than its rivals are offering. In a statement, Paramount said it was making a \"strategically and financially compelling offer to WBD shareholders\" and a \"superior alternative to the Netflix transaction\". David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said: \"WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company. \n                  Dharmendra dies: Modi pays tribute to 'iconic' film star and Bollywood legend\n                 \n                  Ariana Grande rushed by red carpet intruder at premiere of Wicked: For Good\n                 \n                  Cinema giant Vue picks finance chief ahead of potential float\n                 \"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. \"We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. \"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Under the Netflix deal, WBD will continue with previously-announced plans to split its studio and streaming operations from its global networks division, with the latter becoming a separate company, Discovery Global. The Netflix deal will not be finalised until the split is complete, and Discovery Global, including channels like CNN, will not form part of the merger. But Paramount said its deal would be for the entire company. Paramount said it had submitted six proposals to WBD in the course of 12 weeks, but that they were never \"meaningfully\" engaged with. It's not the first difficulty the proposed Netflix deal has run into, with Donald Trump raising the spectre of government intervention on Sunday. The US president said the combined market share of the resulting company \"could be a problem\" and that he would be involved in the decision about whether to approve the deal. Read more:Analysis: Netflix could yet get its way in Trump's AmericaAnalysis: Why Sussexes' new Netflix deal might not be a demotion The deal has to \"go through a process and we'll see what happens,\" Trump said. But a Paramount-WBD deal is likely to face scrutiny too, given the resulting company's dominant position within the film studio business, and the potential for job losses as the industry consolidates. Nonetheless, experts have noted the ties between the Trump administration and the Paramount bid. Both Mr Ellison and his father, Larry Ellison, the multibillionaire founder of the Oracle Corporation, have ties to the president. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, told Sky News: \"Donald Trump is very friendly with David Ellison, who is the son of Larry Ellison, who owns Oracle, and he and Donald Trump are good buddies. \"And also Donald Trump's son in law, Jared Kushner, is on board with this particular rival, hostile takeover bid. \"So it is assumed that because of those relationships, Donald Trump would look an awful lot more favourably on this deal.\" Announcing the Netflix deal last week, David Zaslav, president and CEO of WBD, said it combined \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most\".

Sky News understands that International Connections Group (ICG), which provides advertisers with targeted print and digital solutions in sectors such as luxury hotels and funeral homes, is drawing up plans for a listing which could be launched in the new year. The company has hired Panmure Liberum, the investment bank, to work on the initial public offering. ICG partners with 'hosts' such as Aston Martin and McLaren dealerships, Mandarin Oriental hotels and Circle Health Group, providing its products free in return for advertising sales opportunities. It had 2,300 such hosts at the end of 2024, with that figure rising to about 2,500 this year. The company is chaired by Alan Aubrey, a former boss of the London-listed scientific ventures backer IP Group, while Ray Ingleby, ICG's chief executive, has previously taken three other businesses public. Its likely valuation was unclear on Monday, although one investor speculated that it could be in the region of £50m prior to any primary capital being raised. \n                  This is the reality of Trump's trade war\n                 \n                  Paramount launches hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros\n                 \n                  Mortgage rates hit lowest level since 2022 - and HSBC says more good news is on way | Money blog\n                 ICG's plans for a London float come in the wake of a string of larger company flotations in recent months, including the food producer Princes and banking group Shawbrook.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Shares in The Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC) have fallen slightly on debut after the completion of its spin-off from Unilever amid a continuing civil war with one of its best-known brands. Shares in the Netherlands-based company are trading for the first time following the demerger. It creates the world's biggest ice cream company, controlling around one fifth of the global market. Primary Magnum shares, in Amsterdam, opened at €12.20 - down on the €12.80 reference price set by the EuroNext exchange, though they later settled just above that level, implying a market value of €7.9bn - just below £7bn. The company is also listed in London and New York. Money latest: The cheapest days to travel by plane Unilever stock was down 3.1% on the FTSE 100 in the wake of the spin off. \n                  This is the reality of Trump's trade war\n                 \n                  Paramount launches hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros\n                 \n                  Blackpool-based advertising firm ICG plots City float\n                 The demerger allows London-headquartered Unilever to concentrate on its wider stable of consumer brands, including Marmite, Dove soap and Domestos. The decision to hive off the ice cream division, made in early 2024, gives a greater focus on a market that is tipped to grow by up to 4% each year until 2029. But it has been dogged by a long-running spat with the co-founders of Ben & Jerry's, which now falls under the TMICC umbrella and accounts for 14% of group revenue. Unilever bought the US brand in 2000, but the relationship has been sour since, despite the creation of an independent board at that time aimed at protecting the brand's social mission. The most high-profile spat came in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's took the decision not to sell ice cream in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories on the grounds that sales would be \"inconsistent\" with its values. Unilever responded by selling the business to its licensee in Israel. A series of rows have followed akin to a tug of war, with Magnum refusing repeated demands by the co-founders of Ben & Jerry's to sell the brand back.  Magnum and Unilever argue its mission has strayed beyond what was acceptable back in 2000, with the brand evolving into one-sided advocacy on polarising topics that risk reputational and business damage. TMICC is currently trying to remove the chair of Ben & Jerry's independent board. It said last month that Anuradha Mittal \"no longer meets the criteria\" to serve after internal investigations. An audit of the separate Ben & Jerry's Foundation, where she is also a trustee, found deficiencies in financial controls and governance. Magnum said the charitable arm risked having funding removed unless the alleged problems were addressed. The Reuters news agency has since reported that Ms Mittal has no plans to quit her roles, and accused Magnum of attempts to \"discredit\" her and undermine the authority of the independent board. Magnum boss Peter ter Kulve said on Monday: \"Today is a proud milestone for everyone associated with TMICC. We became the global leader in ice cream as part of the Unilever family. Now, as an independent listed company, we will be more agile, more focused, and more ambitious than ever.\" Commenting on the demerger, Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Aarin Chiekrie said: \"TMICC is already free cash flow positive, and profitable in its own right. The balance sheet is in decent shape, but dividends are off the cards until 2027 as the group finds its footing as a standalone business.  \"That could cause some downward pressure on the share price in the near term, as dividend-focussed investment funds that hold Unilever will be handed TMICC shares, the latter of which they may be forced to sell to abide by their investment mandate.\""

        "Content": "If you've ever spent your morning commute daydreaming about starting afresh with your career, this feature is for you. Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week we chat to international flight attendant Grace Hampson... Our salary is organised into three parts... so it's hard to give a typical salary. We're paid a basic salary, flight pay and also per diems depending on where we are travelling to. [The Money team had a look at the average basic salary, and the National Careers Service says it starts at around £19,000 and goes up to £28,000 a year.] We don't have set working hours in a week... Flight time limitations are set by the Civil Aviation Authority. They allow us to fly 900 hours in a rolling year and no more than 100 hours in a rolling 28 days. We get 28 days of holiday a year. The training is different for every airline... If you don't already have one, you will need to obtain an attestation, which is a professional safety qualification all flight attendants need. That course can be done in a week. After that, you will need to be type-rated to a certain aircraft to learn the specifics on things like safety equipment and emergency drills. That's where the training lengths can differ. Find tips and deals in the Money blog The chance to explore is our greatest perk... Meeting diverse people and learning about different cultures is incredible. And I also love the flexible schedule that comes with long-haul flying. One thing I wish passengers would stop doing is... asking if they can move seats as they are boarding. We are happy to accommodate and make passengers as comfortable as we possibly can during the flight, but we need all passengers to take their allocated seat for take-off. The weight and balance of the aircraft gets calculated, and that includes passengers as well as cargo and other factors. Correct weight distribution is essential for the aircraft to maintain stability and control. In short, the decision is out of the flight attendants' hands! A lot of people call us \"waitresses in the sky\"... and although part of our job is to provide excellent service, the most important thing is that we keep our passengers safe. We can deal with a large number of emergencies that have the possibility of emerging in the air, with fewer resources than you would have on the ground. It's a great responsibility, which each flight attendant has worked hard at during their career. Every airline probably has their own version of a secret language... However, the most common secret language we use is signalling to each other throughout the cabin when we need a top-up of tea, or another serving of chicken. In my eyes, the best time to travel is... first thing in the morning. The travel to the airport is usually easier, and early flights tend to be less expensive. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are normally the best days for cheaper flights. My favourite airport is... Los Angeles International Airport. This may be an unpopular opinion as it holds a reputation for being crowded. Not only does it have a great shopping and dining experience, but it also has the most flights to and from other airports, meaning you can connect to some amazing places. We follow a very strict policy when it comes to the service of alcohol on board... especially flying such a long distance. We always monitor to make sure people aren't overdoing it. We also make sure that we are looking out for people's well-being at the boarding door when it comes to alcohol consumption. An ongoing issue with aviation is always environmental pressures... and keeping carbon footprint low where possible. Modernising fleets and using aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner can contribute to an improvement as they are known for their fuel efficiency and lower emissions in comparison to older aircraft. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel is going to make a great difference when it is made commercially viable to use.

We are making sure passengers are continuing to wear their seatbelts and of course checking in on their general wellbeing. We move through the cabin calmly and unpanicked, which I think helps passengers to see. We are also happy to explain turbulence to our passengers and why it happens. I recently started a series of FAQs for pilots on my TikTok channel, which features my dad, a retired pilot. We talk about turbulence among other topics and followers have said it has really helped them. I try to play it cool when passengers clap as the plane lands, but... but deep down, I love it.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The day after Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted Angela Rayner back in the cabinet, she showed Labour MPs what they've been missing. The former deputy prime minister delighted Labour backbenchers with a powerful Commons speech defending her workers' rights legislation on Monday evening. With the House of Lords locked in a battle of parliamentary \"ping pong\" with MPs, she told ministers: \"Now is not the time to blink or buckle.\" Her very public intervention came amid claims that her next move has the Labour Party on tenterhooks and that she's the favourite to succeed Sir Keir if she wants the job. And her speech, delivered from notes and clearly meticulously prepared, appeared to send a message to Labour MPs: I'm here to make a comeback. Exclusive: Starmer would lose leadership contest The government's flagship Employment Rights Bill was championed by Ms Rayner when she was deputy PM, in the face of bitter opposition from the Conservatives. In a bid to end the deadlock with the Lords, ministers have backed down on unfair dismissal protection from day one, proposing a compromise of six months. Backing the compromise, brokered with the TUC, Ms Rayner said: \"I know ministers had faced difficult decisions and difficult discussions with the employers and worker representatives. \"But I strongly believe that the work that has been done has been necessary, and we should be able to move forward now.\"  'No excuses' Attacking the upper chamber for delaying the legislation, she said: \"There is now no more time to waste. \"Vested interests worked with the Tories and the Lib Dems and, cheered on by Reform and backed by the Greens, to resist the manifesto on which we were elected. \"And now there can be no excuses. We have a mandate for a new deal for working people, and we must, and we will deliver it. And she concluded: \"It has been a battle to pass this bill, but progress is always a struggle that we fought for. Its passage will be a historic achievement for this Labour government. \"It will benefit working people now and into the future. Now is not the time to blink or buckle. Let's not waste a minute more. It's time to deliver.\"  Could she replace her old boss? It was the sort of fighting talk and defiance of the government's opponents that will have cheered up Labour MPs and boosted her hopes of a comeback and even a leadership bid. Speculation over Sir Keir's future grows more frenzied by the day, with claims that even some of his own supporters have begun the hunt for his successor. The thinktank that ran his leadership campaign in 2020, Labour Together, is reported to be canvassing party members on candidates to replace him. There was even a claim last week that allies of Wes Streeting were sounding out Labour MPs about a pact with Ms Rayner and a joint ticket for the leadership. The health secretary dismissed that claim as a \"silly season story\", while a Rayner ally said: \"There's no vacancy and there's no pact\". They added that she will not \"be played like a pawn\". Mr Streeting did, however, start speculation himself when he said in his Labour conference speech: \"We want her back. We need her back.\" Fuelling more speculation, Sir Keir went further than he had previously on Sunday, when he was asked in an Observer interview if he missed her and replied: \"Yes, of course I do. I was really sad that we lost her.\" And asked if she would return to the cabinet, the prime minister said: \"Yes. She's hugely talented.\" Sir Keir also described Ms Rayner, who left school at 16 without any qualifications, as \"the best social mobility story this country has ever seen\". Read more from Sky News:Navy chief's chilling warningNew design for nationalised trains  But a swift return to the cabinet would be hugely controversial, because the PM's ethic adviser, Sir Laurie Magner, ruled that she breached the ministerial code by underpaying stamp duty when she bought a flat. But she has been linked to speculation about possible efforts to remove Sir Keir if - as predicted - Labour performs badly in the Scottish, Welsh and local elections next May. Her supporters also claim she will eventually be cleared by HMRC over her stamp duty breach, clearing the way for her to come back. And her latest speech - combative, defiant and yet loyal - will have boosted her hopes, and reminded Labour MPs what they've missed since she quit in September."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n  The Sandie Peggie case has been such a high-profile story because it gets to the heart of the debate about trans rights versus women's rights, which has been so fraught in recent years - especially in Scotland. While the Supreme Court ruled in April that the Equality Act referred to a person's biological sex - with major ramifications over who can use female-protected spaces - we are still waiting for long-delayed government guidance on how this should be applied. We are told it's due \"as soon as possible\". Government minister Dame Diana Johnson brightly told Darren McCaffrey on Sky's Politics Hub on Monday that organisations \"just need to get on with it - the law is clear\". But with so many organisations waiting for government guidance before changing policy - that's clearly not the case. Tap here for the latest political news Campaigners have criticised the Peggie tribunal for not following the Supreme Court's lead more directly. The tribunal didn't find that it was wrong to let Dr Upton use the female changing rooms - just that action should have been taken after Ms Peggie complained. Her lawyers say that is hugely problematic, as it puts the onus on a woman to complain. \n                  Nurse Sandie Peggie who complained about sharing changing room with transgender doctor wins part of employment tribunal\n                 \n                  Mother of student who took his own life after University of Glasgow grade error to collect his degree\n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 The political reaction has been swift. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has long been outspoken on this issue, and she has posted a typically punchy statement in response to the case. \"It's ridiculous it took two years to reach a verdict that was so obvious from the start,\" she wrote on X. \"This entire episode is indicative of a system wasting time and taxpayers' money to please a small cabal of activists.\" But it's not just the Tories. Scottish Labour MP Joani Reid described Ms Peggie's treatment as \"a disgrace...enabled by a warped NHS culture and fostered by a Scottish government that refused to listen to women's concerns\". Of course, the SNP have always been hugely supportive of trans rights, attempting to pass gender recognition laws which would have made it much easier for people to self-ID. That legislation was blocked by the UK Supreme Court. John Swinney gave a carefully worded response when asked about the issue on Monday, saying \"it's important to take time to consider the judgment\" with no further comment on the questions raised by the case. Sir Keir Starmer, too, has long been dogged by criticism over the lack of clarity in some of his answers to the question \"what is a woman\", although he has sought to be more definite in recent years. Anna Turley, the chair of the Labour Party, said on Monday that it's more important to get the Supreme Court guidance right than to get it out quickly. But Monday's judgment shows the urgent importance of both."

        "Content": "A \"striking\" new design for UK trains has been revealed by the transport secretary - but you may well think it looks familiar. Train services already in public ownership will begin to adopt a Union flag-inspired design from this spring, Heidi Alexander has confirmed. It's part of the government's efforts to nationalise most passenger rail services in the UK and run them under the new Great British Railways (GBR) brand - with its logo to be unveiled later today. Ms Alexander will be speaking more about GBR - which is due to be formally established in 2027 - on Mornings With Ridge And Frost from around 7.10am. Haven't I seen this somewhere before?  The branding features the familiar double arrow symbol used by British Rail when the country's trains were last state-owned. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport (DfT) said the \"iconic\" symbol has been incorporated into the new GBR logo to reflect \"Britain's proud railway heritage\". Ms Alexander has insisted it \"isn't just a paint job\", saying: \"It represents a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers.\" Special one-day public exhibition launched People in the capital will be able to see the new train livery for themselves today, with a special one-day exhibit being held at London Bridge station, where a GBR-branded Hornby model train will be on display. The government has also partnered with a gaming company to create mock-ups of the new design, and those at the station will be able to see a digital demonstration of the new artwork in Train Sim World 6. The new designs will also be beamed on to digital display boards over the coming days at Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, and Leeds City. It comes as MPs prepare to debate the government's Railways Bill in the Commons. The government has taken control of seven major operators so far, but has pledged to return all passenger services to public ownership as contracts with existing operators expire or are broken through a failure to deliver. Read more:What is Labour's rail nationalisation plan?Rail fares frozen for first time in 30 years What will nationalisation actually involve? The government has said its Railways Bill will bring 17 different organisations together and will also lead to greater accountability, better services and an easier way to buy tickets. Among the measures is the creation of a GBR app, where passengers will be able to check train times and buy tickets without booking fees, while those with disabilities will be able to also request assistance. The draft law would also beef up accountability by creating a strengthened Passenger Watchdog, while GBR would operate both services and maintain the railways themselves. Ministers have pointed to improvements to existing services since they have been nationalised, such as South Western Railway boosting capacity by almost 10% by quadrupling its number of Arterio trains in service. A new East Coast Main Line timetable will also come into effect this month, which the government says will lead to 10,000 extra LNER services every year, or roughly 60,000 extra seats a week."

        "Content": "A UN committee has called on the government not to ratify its treaty on the future of the Chagos Islands - warning it will \"perpetuate longstanding violations of the Chagossian people's rights\". The last-minute intervention further increases the pressure on ministers to scrap the deal, which has faced fierce criticism from the Conservatives. The landmark bilateral agreement was signed in May this year and would see the UK hand over control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. It would mean Britain formally gives up sovereignty of the Indian Ocean territory. Politics latest - follow latest But the government would continue to hold on to the vital UK-US military base on the island of Diego Garcia, by leasing it from Mauritius for 99 years, with the possibility of a 40-year extension. The agreement would also see the UK pay billions of pounds to Mauritius to do so. However, the UN has strongly criticised the deal for not allowing the Chagossian people to return to their ancestral homelands on Diego Garcia. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has expressed \"deep concern\" at the terms of the deal, and has warned it will harm Chagossians. \n                  Politics latest: 'It's time to deliver': Rayner returns to push for passage of Employment Rights Bill\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner just showed Labour MPs what they're missing\n                 \n                  Sandie Peggie judgment piles pressure on government to issue long-delayed gender guidance\n                 Why does the UK currently control the Chagos Islands? The Chagos Islands became legally separated from Mauritius in 1965 as the UK decolonised, and Mauritius became an independent nation three years later. But the UK continued to hold on to the Chagos Archipelago and those that lived there - mostly people of African and South Asian descent - were forcibly removed to make way for the military base on Diego Garcia. It is these people that the UN committee is concerned about. In 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Britain's continued separation of the Chagos Islands from Mauritius violated the Chagossian people's right to self-determination and called for the UK to end control over the territory. The UN General Assembly subsequently called for the complete decolonisation of the islands.  Why is the UN against the deal? In a report published on Monday, the UN committee concluded that the terms of the new deal \"explicitly prevents the return of the Chagossian people to their ancestral lands in Diego Garcia Island\". This is despite the agreement being presented by the UK government as a way to implement the ICJ's ruling, the report states. It said this means the agreement is \"inconsistent with the UN General Assembly resolution\". The committee has also concluded that the deal prevents Chagossian people from \"exercising their cultural rights and preserving their cultural heritage\", which it says is another violation of the UN resolution. The group also criticised the UK government for a lack of consultation with Chagossians, which it said means the agreement is \"restricting the exercise of their right to self-determination\". It further criticised the deal for not providing full reparations or providing any acknowledgement of \"past injustices\". The UN committee has now called on the UK and Mauritius to suspend ratification of the treaty and to resume negotiations with the Chagossian people, and to guarantee full reparations.  Tories accuse Sir Keir of trying to 'bulldoze' the deal through The Tories have seized on the UN's criticism and said the UN has \"called [Sir Keir] out\". The party oppose the deal, not because they believe Chagossians should have more say over their future, but because they argue that the UK should not cede control of the islands at all.  Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"Keir Starmer is desperate to kowtow to China at every opportunity - so much so he is handing over British sovereign territory and £35bn of taxpayers' cash to a Beijing ally. \"In forcing through this Chagos surrender, he has ignored the Chagossians. And now the UN has called him out for it. \"Starmer prides himself on international law and human rights, so will he now halt ratification of the deal as the UN calls for? Or will he try to bulldoze through all opposition and trample on Chagossians once again to win favour from [Chinese President] Xi Jinping?\" Responding to the warning from the UN, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \"We recognise the importance of the islands to Chagossians. \"Under the treaty, Mauritius will be able to develop a programme of resettlement to islands other than Diego Garcia, and the UK has separately committed to support heritage visits to the archipelago, including Diego Garcia.\" It is understood that the government prioritised ensuring access to the UK-US military base, though it insists it did engage regularly with Chagossians."

        "Content": " A nationwide grooming gangs inquiry must \"leave no stone unturned\", Kemi Badenoch has said as the Conservatives urged the government to ensure ethnicity and religious background are taken into account. Ms Badenoch and shadow home secretary Chris Philp, appearing alongside a survivor and two parents of survivors/victims, called on the government to adopt draft terms of reference for the inquiry drawn up by the Conservatives with help from some grooming gangs victims and survivors. The Tory leader said her party is willing to work alongside the government, and an inquiry needs to be undertaken on a cross-party basis as it is ultimately about the survivors, victims and their families.  Politics latest: Starmer becoming 'second Thatcher', Scottish first minister says The Conservatives' terms of reference include ensuring the inquiry examines the ethnicity and religious background of offenders, a two-year time limit and a focus on extra-familial abuse. They also want it to forward evidence to police and prosecutors where criminality is indicated. In June, the government announced it would be launching a national inquiry into grooming gangs, representing a U-turn after previously accusing Reform and the Conservatives of jumping on a far-right bandwagon when they called for one earlier in the year after Labour announced five local inquiries. \n                  Politics latest: 'It's time to deliver': Rayner returns to push for passage of Employment Rights Bill\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner just showed Labour MPs what they're missing\n                 \n                  Sandie Peggie judgment piles pressure on government to issue long-delayed gender guidance\n                  But a national inquiry has been delayed by rows about its scope, while both shortlisted chair candidates withdrew their candidacy following criticism by survivors of their careers as a police chief and a social worker. A group of women also quit the inquiry's victim liaison panel - one who was present with the Tories on Monday - as they accused the government of attempting to widen the inquiry's remit to consider other forms of child sexual abuse. Ms Badenoch said: \"I want to be clear that a national inquiry must leave no stone unturned. \"It must investigate councils, the police and even the government if necessary. \"It must be time-limited, and it must consider the role of ethnicity, religion and other cultural factors. \"Baroness (Louise) Casey's own report admitted that many of these cases are committed by people of Asian and Pakistani ethnicities. \"Her own report said that those who downplay the ethnicity of perpetrators are continuing to let down society, local communities and the victims. We agree. \"As I said, I have spoken to many survivors. We are speaking on their behalf. \"Their lives and their families' lives have been turned upside down, so separate to this inquiry, the government must act now to ensure that they and their families are supported so they can heal.\" Home editor Fiona Goddard was close to tears when she told me on Monday that pulling out of the grooming gang inquiry panel was \"the most difficult decision of my life\". The survivor of child sexual abuse in Oldham has spent years campaigning for a national inquiry – but sacrificed her chance to play a part in it because she felt it was moving in the wrong direction and broadening its scope. The government insists that its scope has not changed, but time has marched on since two candidates to chair the inquiry pulled out in October, and the opposition has stepped into the void – offering their own version of what the inquiry should look like. \n However, Kemi Badenoch's call that \"no stone should be left unturned\" was reminiscent of her own party's pledge in December 2018 when then Home Secretary Sajid Javid promised to investigate the ethnicity of grooming gangs with exactly the same words. The subsequent review published in 2020 found that most group-based child abusers were white but also revealed the lack of data being collected on ethnicity, which the Conservatives promised to improve. Five years on, Louise Casey criticised the lack of data in her rapid review published earlier this year.  Asked if her own government had done enough, the leader of the opposition pointed to initiatives but added, \"We didn’t know everything we know now\". The truth is, no political party owns the high ground on this matter – just as Fiona Goddard is first to say that no one survivor can speak for everyone. There is division about how this inquiry moves forward, and there's no evidence of political parties working together to bring unity. \n What it needs more than anything is an independent chair who can pull it out of the hands of politicians. Baroness Casey, known as a Whitehall troubleshooter, having worked on social issues for successive prime ministers since Tony Blair, is assisting with setting up the inquiry, but acknowledged it could now be \"months\" before a chair was appointed. Fiona Goddard, one of the survivors who left the inquiries' liaison panel, backed the Conservatives' proposals as she said she had \"lost faith in the ability of the government to make more meaningful progress\". Read more:Grooming gang survivors on the role drugs played in their abuseWhy are abuse survivors losing faith in the grooming gang inquiry? Mr Philp said a two-year time limit on the inquiry is essential as he said: \"It can't drag on for years and years.\" He said the Tories were being \"constructive\" and that dual nationals found to have been involved in grooming should have their British citizenship removed and be deported \"with no exceptions\". A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The Conservatives' record on this issue is clear: they had years to take action on this appalling scandal, yet time and time again they failed to do so. \"This Labour government accepted all the recommendations from Baroness Casey's report and we are committed to a full, statutory, national inquiry to uncover the truth. \"It will be robust, rigorous and laser-focused on grooming gangs, and its scope will not change. \"The inquiry will direct and oversee local investigations, with the power to compel witnesses and summon evidence. And it will explicitly examine the background, ethnicity and culture of offenders.\""

However, the SNP leader was unable to clearly answer how his party would deliver independence if the UK government continues to refuse requests for a second referendum. Mr Swinney once again made the case for Scotland leaving the UK, and taking full control over its natural resources, at an SNP campaign event in Glasgow on Monday. Inspired by his party's old \"it's Scotland's oil\" political slogan, the first minister stated: \"It's Scotland's energy.\" He added: \"We know from analysis produced for Ofgem that a different policy approach would enable Scotland to have the lowest wholesale electricity prices in Western Europe. \"As we set out in the paper published today, by selling that low-cost electricity into other markets at a profit; by increasing storage capacity, including pumped hydro storage; to end the folly of generators being paid not to produce electricity; and by removing unnecessary costs like the UK's nuclear levy, we can deliver big benefits here in Scotland. \"That includes being able to lower household electricity bills by over one-third. A big saving for families across Scotland, offering the real hope that cost of living pressures will finally begin to ease.\" \n                  British Gas parent company boss 'happy to pay more' tax for bills to go down\n                 \n                  Will the government be lowering energy bills in the budget - and will taxes have to rise?\n                 \n                  Energy minister says 'there's no shortcut' to bringing down bills - as price cap rise announced\n                 Mr Swinney said lower energy bills would benefit schools and the NHS. He added: \"Think what that will mean for our National Health Service. \"Less money spent on energy bills means more money to spend on doctors and nurses, on more operations and appointments.\" When questioned on how he intends to deliver Scottish independence if the UK government refuses a second referendum, Mr Swinney said: \"We've got to demonstrate emphatic support for the proposition of independence, and we do so by electing a majority of SNP MSPs at the election in May.\" Read more from Sky News:Millionaire former Tory donor defects to ReformUK 'would benefit' from rejoining an EU customs union Mr Swinney said he met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Friday, and warned the Labour leader he is at risk of becoming the new Margaret Thatcher. The first minister said: \"I left the prime minister in no doubt that unless he changes course, what we face is a second wave of 80s-style deindustrialisation, 80s-style economic devastation. \"Today, Sir Keir Starmer is an even less popular prime minister than Liz Truss - and that takes some doing. \"But if he does not change course on the energy profits levy, he will enter our national story as a second Thatcher, a second destroyer of industry, a second destroyer of communities. \"And Scotland will not forget.\"  The event was held in a city which has been described as the \"asylum capital of the UK\". When questioned on the SNP's \"welcoming\" position towards refugees amid growing numbers of protests about the issue, the first minister described the demonstrations outside asylum hotels as \"appalling\". He added: \"There's language on these banners that I just find absolutely wholly and totally contemptible and hostile.\" Mr Swinney acknowledged the growing popularity of Reform UK, but said he would \"challenge\" the party. The first minister added: \"I will go up against Reform in what they say. \"I will stand firm in exercising that political leadership, and I'm quite sure I speak for the majority of people in Scotland in the process.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Patients with a previously untreatable form of blood cancer are now living disease-free after a world-first gene therapy. Alyssa Tapley, 16, became the first patient with an aggressive form of leukaemia to have the experimental treatment in 2022. She was considering options for palliative care, but is now healthy. New results have been published of a clinical trial on a further eight children and two adults at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and King's College Hospital in London. Two-thirds have been disease-free for up to three years. Dr Deborah Yallop, consultant haematologist at King's, said: \"We've seen impressive responses in clearing leukaemia that seemed incurable - it's a very powerful approach.\" The patients in the study had T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of blood cancer that results from T-cells in the immune system growing out of control. They had all failed to respond to existing treatment. So the medical team tried an experimental technique to turn T-cells taken from a donor into fighting machines that beat the cancer. The technique, called BE-CAR7, is a highly precise tool for changing individual letters in the genetic code, the instruction manual for all cells in the body. Changing just one letter - what scientists call DNA \"bases\" - can alter the function of a gene in much the same way as substituting a single key letter in a text message can change its meaning. The scientists made three individual \"base-edits\" to the donor T-cells. The DNA tweaks made the cells an \"off-the-shelf\" treatment that didn't need to be matched to patients like other transplants. And they also instructed the donor T-cells to destroy every one of a patient's own T-cells - whether they were cancerous or not. If all the T-cells were eradicated within four weeks of treatment, patients were able to go on and have a bone-marrow transplant to rebuild a healthy immune system. Alyssa 'doing really well' According to results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 82% of the patients in the trial were in \"very deep remission\" after treatment and were able to have a transplant. And 64% remain disease-free. Alyssa said she was now \"doing really well\". \"I've gone sailing, spent time away from home doing my Duke of Edinburgh Award but even just going to school is something I dreamed of when I was ill,\" she said. \"I'm not taking anything for granted. \"Next on my list is learning to drive, but my ultimate goal is to become a research scientist and be part of the next big discovery that can help people like me.\" Hospital charity agrees to support treatment of 10 more patients The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity has now agreed to support treatment for another 10 patients. Dr Rob Chiesa, study investigator and bone marrow transplant consultant at GOSH, said: \"Although most children with T-cell leukaemia will respond well to standard treatments, around 20% may not. \"It's these patients who desperately need better options and this research provides hope for a better prognosis for everyone diagnosed with this rare but aggressive form of blood cancer.\" Results 'bring hope' UK stem cell charity Anthony Nolan worked with the research team to provide T-cell donors. Dr Tania Dexter, senior medical officer at the charity, said: \"Considering these patients had a low chance of survival before the trial, these results bring hope that treatments like this will continue to advance and become available to more patients. \"As with any novel cellular therapy, this phase 1 trial is just an initial indication of the effectiveness and safety of the treatment, and more work must be done to determine its wider clinical application. \"Yet the results are encouraging and demonstrate the recent leaps in technology that are allowing us to take on even greater challenges in the treatment of blood cancers and blood disorders.\""

        "Content": "A new strain of mpox has been discovered by scientists in England. The new strain was found in a person who had recently travelled to Asia, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Officials said they had identified a \"new recombinant mpox virus\" - meaning it has genetic material from different viral strains. The UKHSA said genomic sequencing showed the mpox genome contained elements of clade Ib and IIb mpox. Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA, said: \"It's normal for viruses to evolve, and further analysis will help us understand more about how mpox is changing. \"Although mpox infection is mild for many, it can be severe. \"Getting vaccinated is a proven effective way to protect yourself against severe disease, so please make sure to get the jab if you are eligible.\" The NHS offers the mpox vaccine to those considered at higher risk of catching the virus, such as men who have sex with other men and have multiple partners. The UKHSA said it will \"continue to assess the significance of the strain\". Read more:Vaccine reminder as mpox strain spreads in Europe Dr Boghuma Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University in Georgia in the US, said the identification of the new recombinant strain \"is precisely what experts in the field feared would happen if the virus continued to spread globally without a decisive response to stop it\". She added: \"The key concern now is whether events like this will alter the virus's transmissibility or virulence.\" What are the symptoms of mpox and how can it spread? Symptoms include a skin rash with blisters, spots, or ulcers that can appear anywhere on the body, as well as fever, headache, backache, and muscle aches. A rash usually appears one to five days after a fever, headache and other symptoms. The virus spreads between people through direct contact with rashes, skin lesions or scabs caused by the virus, including during sexual contact, kissing, cuddling or other skin-to-skin contact. There is also a risk from contact with bodily fluids such as saliva or snot, as well as contact with bedding, towels or clothing. There is a possibility of spread through close and prolonged face-to-face contact, such as talking, breathing, coughing or sneezing."

        "Content": " Rapper Ghetts has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in a hit-and-run crash. The 41-year-old also pleaded guilty to driving dangerously in areas of London before the fatal collision, which happened in Ilford, north-east London, shortly after 11.30pm on 18 October. Yubin Tamang, 20, a student from Nepal, died two days after being hit by the rapper's BMW M5 in Redbridge Lane. Police said Ghetts was driving in excess of 60mph in a 30mph zone, and hit Mr Tamang as he was crossing the road. He then failed to stop at the scene. On Monday, the grime artist, whose real name is Justin Clarke-Samuel, appeared for a hearing at the Old Bailey via videolink from Pentonville prison, wearing a green polo shirt. He pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and to driving dangerously in Tavistock Place, in the Bloomsbury area of central London, and on other roads in Camden, Islington and Hackney before the crash. Mr Tamang's family, who had travelled to the UK, watched in court as the pleas were made. He was an only child who had been sent to complete his studies, the court heard. Clarke-Samuel, a two-time Mercury Prize nominee and MOBO winner, has been in custody since a preliminary appearance at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on 27 October. He will be sentenced in February. Judge Mark Lucraft KC told him the sentence would be custodial, but the length of his jail term is yet to be determined. He was disqualified from driving with immediate effect - with the length of the ban also still to be set. Speaking after the hearing on Monday, Detective Inspector Mark Braithwaite, of the Met's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said that while nothing could undo the loss felt by Mr Tamang's family, the guilty pleas marked \"a step towards justice\". He added: \"Split-second decisions behind the wheel can have devastating, life-changing consequences.\" The Met Police said Clarke-Samuel's BMW was found by officers in the early hours of the day following the collision, parked near his home in Woodford. The car \"displayed significant damage, including a smashed windscreen, extensive marks on the bonnet, damage to the front bumper and a missing wing mirror cover\", the force said. On Thursday 4 December, Clarke-Samuel was further charged with causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit. He did not enter a plea to this charge, nor a second count of dangerous driving following the incident, the force said. The rapper was first nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2021, for his third album, Conflict Of Interest. His second nomination came for his fourth album, On Purpose, With Purpose, in 2024. He was named best male artist at the MOBOs in 2021, and received the pioneer award for his contribution to British black culture in 2024. Earlier this year, he was nominated for two Ivor Novello awards - for best album and best contemporary song. He also had a role in the Netflix drama Supacell."

        "Content": "Paramount has launched a $108.4bn (£81bn) hostile bid for Warner Bros, challenging Netflix, which had reached a $72bn (£54bn) takeover deal with the company. Paramount said on Monday that it was going straight to Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) shareholders with its cash offer for the entirety of the company, including its Global Networks segment, asking them to reject the deal with Netflix. On Friday Netflix struck a deal to buy WBD, the Hollywood giant behind \"Harry Potter\" and HBO Max The cash and stock deal is valued at $27.75 (£20.80) per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7bn (£62bn), including debt. But Paramount says its deal will pay $30 (£22.50) cash per share, representing $18bn (£13.5bn) more in cash than its rivals are offering. In a statement, Paramount said it was making a \"strategically and financially compelling offer to WBD shareholders\" and a \"superior alternative to the Netflix transaction\". David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said: \"WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company. \n                  Dharmendra dies: Modi pays tribute to 'iconic' film star and Bollywood legend\n                 \n                  Ariana Grande rushed by red carpet intruder at premiere of Wicked: For Good\n                 \n                  Cinema giant Vue picks finance chief ahead of potential float\n                 \"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. \"We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. \"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Under the Netflix deal, WBD will continue with previously-announced plans to split its studio and streaming operations from its global networks division, with the latter becoming a separate company, Discovery Global. The Netflix deal will not be finalised until the split is complete, and Discovery Global, including channels like CNN, will not form part of the merger. But Paramount said its deal would be for the entire company. Paramount said it had submitted six proposals to WBD in the course of 12 weeks, but that they were never \"meaningfully\" engaged with. It's not the first difficulty the proposed Netflix deal has run into, with Donald Trump raising the spectre of government intervention on Sunday. The US president said the combined market share of the resulting company \"could be a problem\" and that he would be involved in the decision about whether to approve the deal. Read more:Analysis: Netflix could yet get its way in Trump's AmericaAnalysis: Why Sussexes' new Netflix deal might not be a demotion The deal has to \"go through a process and we'll see what happens,\" Trump said. But a Paramount-WBD deal is likely to face scrutiny too, given the resulting company's dominant position within the film studio business, and the potential for job losses as the industry consolidates. Nonetheless, experts have noted the ties between the Trump administration and the Paramount bid. Both Mr Ellison and his father, Larry Ellison, the multibillionaire founder of the Oracle Corporation, have ties to the president. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, told Sky News: \"Donald Trump is very friendly with David Ellison, who is the son of Larry Ellison, who owns Oracle, and he and Donald Trump are good buddies. \"And also Donald Trump's son in law, Jared Kushner, is on board with this particular rival, hostile takeover bid. \"So it is assumed that because of those relationships, Donald Trump would look an awful lot more favourably on this deal.\" Announcing the Netflix deal last week, David Zaslav, president and CEO of WBD, said it combined \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most\". He continued: \"For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture. \"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  British drama Adolescence has seen its lead stars all nominated for Golden Globe awards. The drama, starring Stephen Graham, depicts the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, as a 13-year-old boy from her school is arrested for her murder. It was one of the most talked-about shows of the year. Graham, along with Owen Cooper, Ashley Walters and Erin Doherty are all up for gongs. It follows a host of wins at the Emmys in September. Receiving five nominations in total, the Netflix limited series was only beaten by White Lotus, which got six nods, coming top in the TV category. Cynthia Erivo was nominated for her role in the Wicked sequel, Wicked For Good, while British stars Gary Oldman, Helen Mirren and Aimee Lou Wood and Jason Isaacs also got recognition for their roles in Slow Horses, Mobland and The White Lotus, respectively. Mirren will also be awarded one of the Globe's two lifetime achievement awards, the Cecil B DeMille Award, announced a few days before the ceremony in the New Year. Emily Blunt picked up a surprise nomination for her role in The Smashing Machine, opposite Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson - who also got a nod for the sports biopic, which was not well received by critics. Jacob Elordi got two nods, one for Guillermo del Toro movie Frankenstein and one for the Australian miniseries The Narrow Road To The Deep South. Tessa Thompson was recognised for her role in Hedda, a modern re-telling of Henrik Ibsen's classic play, Jude Law for crime thriller Black Rabbit and Bella Ramsay for post-apocalyptic hit The Last Of Us. Irish stars Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley were both nominated for Hamnet, the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's book about William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes. The movie isn't out in the UK until January. Surprises and snubs Unlike other awards, the Golden Globes cover both TV and film and are split by genre, falling into either the drama or comedy and musical category - meaning a wealth of nominees are in the running. This year, there are 28 categories. In the film category, One Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, led the nominations with nine, followed by Norwegian comedy-drama Sentimental Value with eight, and vampire horror Sinners with seven. While Wicked saw its sequel score five nominations, including best actress and best supporting actress for its two female leads Erivo and Ariana Grande, it failed to get a nod in best musical or comedy film, which many will see as a snub for the box office hit. One surprise nod went to Sorry, Baby star Eva Victor, nominated for best actress in a drama, for the black comedy they wrote, directed and starred in. KPop Demon Hunters, the most-watched film on Netflix ever, received three nominations - best animated film, cinematic and box office achievement and original song - making an Oscar nod further down the line look more and more likely. New to this year's nominations is a category for podcasts. Selected from a long list of the 25 most-listened to shows, Good Hang With Amy Poehler, Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard and Call Her Daddy were among the casts that made the cut. Sarah Jessica Parker will be honoured with the Carol Burnett Award. Now in comeback mode, the Globes had previously faced criticism over a lack of diversity in the organisation, which led to the event being held behind closed doors in 2022. The 83rd Golden Globes ceremony will take place in LA on 11 January, and will be hosted by US comedian Nikki Glaser for the second year running."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Donald Trump has said he will be \"involved\" in the decision on whether Netflix should be allowed to buy Warner Bros, as the $72bn (£54bn) deal attracts a media industry backlash. The US president acknowledged in remarks to reporters there \"could be a problem\", acknowledging concerns over the streaming giant's market dominance. Crucially, he did not say where he stood on the issue. Money latest: The cheapest days to travel by plane It was revealed on Friday that Netflix, already the world's biggest streaming service by market share, had agreed to buy Warner Bros Discovery's TV, film studios and HBO Max streaming division. The deal aims to complete late next year after the Discovery element of the business, mainly legacy TV channels showing cartoons, news and sport, has been spun off. But the deal has attracted cross-party criticism on competition grounds, and there is also opposition in Hollywood.  The Writers Guild of America said: \"The world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent. \"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.\" Republican Senator, Roger Marshall, said in a statement: \"Netflix's attempt to buy Warner Bros would be the largest media takeover in history - and it raises serious red flags for consumers, creators, movie theaters, and local businesses alike. \"One company should not have full vertical control of the content and the distribution pipeline that delivers it. And combining two of the largest streaming platforms is a textbook horizontal Antitrust problem. \"Prices, choice, and creative freedom are at stake. Regulators need to take a hard look at this deal, and realize how harmful it would be for consumers and Western society.\" Paramount Skydance and Comcast, the parent company of Sky News, were two other bidders in the auction process that preceded the announcement. The Reuters news agency, citing information from sources, said their bids were rejected in favour of Netflix for different reasons. Paramount's was seen as having funding concerns, they said, while Comcast's was deemed not to offer so many earlier benefits.

The president said of the Netflix deal's path to regulatory clearance: \"I'll be involved in that decision\". On the likely opposition to the deal. he added: \"That's going to be for some economists to tell. But it is a big market share. There's no question it could be a problem.\""
