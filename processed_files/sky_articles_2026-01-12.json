        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n In a large warehouse on the outskirts of Tehran, the floor is covered in dozens - or possibly hundreds - of black plastic body bags.   Warning: This article contains descriptions some readers may find distressing. Men and women pass amongst the rows of corpses, searching for a sign - or a distinguishing feature - of someone they love. A woman kneels before a bloodied body, her face contorted with grief. Her search is over. Her worst fears have been realised. Outside the warehouse, which is part of a government forensic centre in Kahrizak, body bags are unloaded from pick-ups and larger vehicles. These scenes are highly likely to have been replicated nationwide. It is clear the protests in Iran have been met with a ruthless, state-backed crackdown. Human rights officials have attempted to count the number of fatalities, with one group putting the figure at around 650. But the regime is working hard to cut all sources of information. The internet has been blocked and it is now impossible make domestic and international phone calls. The authorities have even managed to disable 'Starlink' internet receivers which connect to the web through the satellite network run by Elon Musk. The only source of information comes from state television, which preoccupies itself with pro-government rallies. The state cannot conceal everything Relatives of a boy called Amir Ali Haydari, have told Sky News how the 17-year-old was shot and beaten to death in the city of Kermanshah. His cousin, Diako Haydari, who lives in Cardiff, told us that the teenager attended protests last Thursday with his classmates. \"I got the latest information from our family today. He was shot in the heart, and as he was taking his last breath, they hit him in the head with the butt of a gun so many times that his brain was scattered on the ground.\" \"Then, at the mortuary where all the bodies are, they issued a death certificate saying that he fell from a big height.\" In footage filmed in Kermanshah last Thursday, we see plain clothes policemen intimidating protesters and firing pistols at them on the streets. Later that day, demonstrations formed in the centre of the city. We have obtained images of a protest in the area where Haydari was killed. Family members say many of the teenager's friends were caught up in the violence. \"Two of Amir friends are in a coma, and they killed many of his friends. Just like him. They shot them. Many of Amir Ali's friends are dead,\" says Mr Haydari. \"They are savagely attacking people because they want to silence the voice of the people.\" Read more:How Iran enforced internet blackoutMore than 500 killed in Iran, rights group says According to the family, there were so many dead bodies from this protest that the authorities requisitioned two city buses to transport them to the morgue at Taleghani Hospital. He added that: \"When (the family) collected the body, Amir-Ali's uncle told me that there were around 500 corpses at the hospital. He had to identify (Amir Ali's) body from amongst all the bodies.\" For Mr Haydari in Cardiff, it has all come as a terrible shock. \"I did not sleep last night, me and my wife did not sleep. There's nothing we can do,\" he told Sky News. Officially at least, the regime is trying to project an air of normality as its security forces deploy brute force against their own people. But it serves as a reminder that the clerics who run this country will do anything to stay in power."

The prime minister told his MPs the actions of Grok and X are \"absolutely disgusting and shameful\". \"If X cannot control Grok, we will - and we'll do it fast because if you profit from harm and abuse, you lose the right to self regulate,\" he told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Images are being generated by Grok, X's AI tool, that sexualise women and children, manipulating photos of people to remove their clothes or make them pose in suggestive ways. Grok's image creation function has been switched off for all but paying subscribers after a global outcry, but some non-paying users have reported still being able to generate sexualised images of women and children. Sir Keir added on Monday evening: \"Protecting their abusive users, rather than the women and children who are being abused shows a total distortion of priorities. \"So let me be crystal clear, we won't stand for it, because no matter how unstable or complex the world becomes, this government will be guided by its values.

Over the weekend, Mr Musk said the UK government \"wants any excuse for censorship\" after Sir Keir said X needed \"to get a grip\" of Grok and Downing Street described the limitation to paid users as \"insulting\". Just hours before Sir Keir's latest threat, technology secretary Liz Kendall announced she was speeding up laws to make creating non-consensual intimate images with AI a criminal offence.

She also announced that the Crime and Policing Bill, which is going through parliament, will make it a criminal offence for companies to supply tools designed to create non-consensual internet images. On Monday morning, media watchdog Ofcom launched a formal investigation into Grok, which will look into whether X has \"failed to comply with its legal obligations under the Online Safety Act\". The regulator said: \"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people - which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography - and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK has no plan to defend the nation in the event of war, including how to mobilise the National Health Service to deal with mass casualties, the head of the military has revealed. The admission by Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton - confirming a report by Sky News from almost two years ago - came despite mounting warnings about the threat of conflict with Russia and as Donald Trump makes hostile noises about seizing Greenland. Answering wide-ranging questions from MPs on Monday, the chief of the defence staff also confirmed that the Ministry of Defence lacks funding to cover its equipment programme as well as additional ambitions set out in a sweeping review of defence published in June. He refused to say whether he was facing a budget shortfall and steered away from using the word \"cuts\", but said that reducing or slowing military programmes were among the options being considered. Air Chief Marshal Knighton, at times sounding frustrated, told members of the defence select committee not to \"put words in my mouth\" as he was pressed on reports that he had warned the prime minister before Christmas that defence has a £28bn hole in its budget over the next four years and would be required to make significant cuts without more money. He said: \"If we wanted to do everything that's currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [Strategic Defence Review], could we do that with the budget that we've got? The answer is no.\" No modern-day War Book The most stunning revelation during a two-hour grilling was his confirmation that the UK has yet to revive a modern version of the Government War Book. Drawn up during the First World War and maintained until the turn of the century, this was a comprehensive set of plans for the whole country - from the armed forces, hospitals and the police to industry schools and even art galleries - to transition from peace to war. It was shelved after the Soviet Union collapsed - as discussed in The Wargame podcast. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 But, despite the return of conflict to Europe following Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and then its full-scale attack in 2022, the UK has yet to draw up a new defence plan - something all NATO member states are required to maintain. The transatlantic alliance is the cornerstone of UK defence and security policy - with allies willing to mobilise in the defence of each other. But each nation is also meant to be able to defend itself in the first instance. \"We don't have a complete national defence plan yet,\" Air Chief Marshal Knighton said. Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat member of the defence select committee, asked him if we should have one. He responded: \"Yeah, absolutely. And the government is committed to doing that.\" Why does the UK not have a plan? Pushed on why the UK does not have one, the defence chief said: \"I think that it is a manifestation of the peace dividend. \"One of the most obvious is that since the end of the Cold War, we have not prioritised those matters. And so as a consequence, the government, for many years, of many hues, has not focused its efforts on developing that kind of plan. \"I'm pleased to say that partly as a consequence of what's in the Strategic Defence Review, that is changing.\" As for when such a national defence plan would be ready, Air Chief Marshal Knighton said this was a job that was being overseen by the Cabinet Office because it involves the whole of government. However, he said that the military component - which the Ministry of Defence is responsible for - would be finalised this year.

        "Content": "Hundreds more federal officers are set to be deployed to Minnesota amid protests across the US after a woman was killed during an ICE operation in Minneapolis. Renee Good, 37, was shot dead in her car in the city last Wednesday by an officer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration said the shooting was an act of self-defence by the agent, suggesting the mother-of-three used her vehicle as a weapon to attack him. This characterisation has been rejected by state and local officials and protesters, who say a bystander video showed Ms Good steered away from the officer. It comes as the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul are suing the federal government in an attempt to stop an enforcement surge by ICE after Ms Good's death. \"We're sending more officers today and tomorrow, they'll arrive,\" Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News. \"There will be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely.\" \n                  Thousands march against Renee Good's killing in Minneapolis as hundreds of protests planned across US\n                 \n                  New footage shows Minneapolis shooting, filmed by ICE agent who fired gun\n                 \n                  Wife of woman shot dead by ICE officer says 'we had whistles, they had guns' as she pays tribute\n                 She said the officers deployed to Minneapolis would not just focus on finding immigration law breaches, but also on tackling people protesting against ICE. \"We're going to continue to if they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,\" Ms Noem added. The deployment comes in addition to the agents who arrived in Minneapolis last week in what Homeland Security has called its largest operation ever. About 2,000 ICE officers - more than three times the number of officers in the Minneapolis Police Department - have already been sent to the area. \"We're seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighbourhoods. They've definitely been out here,\" said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city council member. Minnesota sues Trump administration Meanwhile, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul filed a lawsuit against the federal government on Monday to stop the ICE operation or limit it. The lawsuit states that the enforcement surge in Minnesota violates federal law, alleging the state was being targeted over politics, which it says constitutes a violation of the First Amendment. It also claims the ICE operation is arbitrary and capricious due to other states not seeing similar crackdowns. The Trump administration says the crackdown is about fighting fraud, but the lawsuit says immigration enforcement officers have no expertise in fighting fraud in government programmes.

It comes two days after thousands of people took to the streets of Minneapolis to demand an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents after last week's fatal shooting. Hundreds of similar protests happened in towns and cities across the US over the weekend. Migrant deaths in custody It comes as government press releases showed that four migrants have died in the first 10 days of 2026 while in the custody of US immigration authorities. US Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the rate of deaths had remained in step ​withhistorical norms as the detention population has climbed. At least 30 people died in ICE custody in 2025, the highest level in ‌two decades, agency figures showed. Those numbers were branded as \"truly staggering\" by Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention WatchNetwork, who called for ‌the administration to close down detention centres."

        "Content": "A record number of illegal worker arrests and raids have been carried out by the Home Office in the past 18 months. The number of raids has increased by 77% since July 2024, when Labour came to power, which has led to an 83% rise in arrests, according to government figures. More than 17,400 raids were carried out by the Home Office's immigration enforcement teams on businesses such as nail bars, car washes, barbers and takeaway shops. This led to more than 12,300 arrests of those attempting to undercut workers and \"hide in plain sight\", the government said. The Home Office said it was the highest number of arrests and raids of illegal workers and those enabling illegal working since records began in 2019. Ministers believe the crackdown will help reduce the pull factors encouraging people to enter the UK illegally and trying to claim asylum. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"There is no place for illegal working in our communities. \n                  Asylum hotel migrant evictions set to begin in the spring\n                 \n                  Migrant small boat Channel crossings in 2025 are second highest ever\n                 \n                  Hundreds of foreign prison staff 'offered emergency extension to visa' to stop the prison system collapsing\n                 \"That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide. \"I will stop at nothing to restore order and control to our borders.\" London, the West Midlands and the South West have seen the highest number of illegal working arrests. More than 2,100 arrests were made in London last year, a 47% rise compared with 2024. The West Midlands and the South West both had more than 1,100 arrests - a 76% and a 91% rise respectively. Of the total arrests, 1,726 people have been returned to the countries they came from, up 35% on the 1,283 removed from visits in the previous 18-month period. Read more:Ex-Tory chancellor Nadhim Zahawi latest to join ReformUK has no defence plan despite threat from Putin's Russia The raids have included officers arresting 13 people at a warehouse in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, on 25 November, which led to 11 Brazilian and Romanian nationals being detained for removal from the UK. On 16 December, 30 Indian and Albanian men were arrested at a construction site in Swindon, Wiltshire. Nearly all them were detained for removal. The record-breaking enforcement action comes just over two months after Ms Mahmood said her department was \"not yet fit for purpose\". She said a crackdown on tackling migrants working illegally in the UK was \"starting to work\" but criticised enforcement of illegal working rules under the previous Conservative government. Immigration enforcement was given £5m to arrest, detain and remove migrants working illegally, and officers have been wearing body-worn cameras since September to help publicise arrests and prosecutions. Tighter right-to-work checks have also been introduced so casual, temporary or subcontracted workers are forced to prove their status."

        "Content": "Former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has become the latest - and most senior - Tory to defect to Reform UK. The ex-MP and vaccines minister during the COVID pandemic said the UK was \"drinking at the last chance saloon\" and \"really does need Nigel Farage as prime minister\". Having served under the four latest Conservative prime ministers, including as chancellor for two months under Boris Johnson, he is the most senior former Tory MP to join Reform. He is also the 20th ex-Conservative MP to defect since March 2024. Politics latest: Ofcom launches investigation into X's Grok Announcing his move at a news conference on Monday, alongside Reform leader Mr Farage, the Iraqi refugee said he switched because the Conservative Party is a \"defunct brand\" that could no longer form the next government. A Conservative source told Sky News that Mr Zahawi, who stood down as an MP in 2024, had asked the Tories for a peerage several times, including in the last few months ahead of the most recent political peerages list. \n                  Politics latest: Non-consensual intimate images law to come into force this week amid row over Elon Musk's Grok\n                 \n                  Sky News questions Nadhim Zahawi on his defection to Reform UK\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 However, he was told this was \"never going to happen\" as he was sacked as Tory party chairman by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak in 2023 for failing to declare he was being investigated by HMRC over his tax affairs. Mr Zahawi told Sky News that was \"not true\" and he has a message \"from the top\" about wanting to give him a peerage and that Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and her team would contact him in 2026. He said Ms Badenoch and her team \"came for help and advice\" and asked him to meet her husband, Hamish Badenoch, twice because he said he is \"taking charge at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters)\". The businessman insisted he had been given \"no promises at all\" about what role he would have in Reform - but did not rule out becoming a Reform MP or peer. Read more:Who is Nadhim Zahawi? Former child refugee to top Tory to Reform defector Mr Farage said Mr Zahawi's move helped to dispel suggestions that Reform UK is a \"one-man band\". Asked about the HMRC investigation, which ended with Mr Zahawi paying a nearly £5m penalty, Mr Farage said: \"There's nobody with a complex business empire that does not have to have negotiations at some point with HMRC. \"That is how the world works, and I'd much rather have Nadhim who has been through that experience and come out the other end. \"He could have just gone abroad. He could have just disappeared for a few years, not paid any tax, which by the way, increasingly is what people are doing.\" Anti-Farage tweets Mr Zahawi's defection may come as a surprise to some, given his previous comments about Reform and Mr Farage. He previously ruled out joining Reform, saying: \"No chance. Been a Conservative all my life and will die a Conservative.\" The businessman, in a tweet deleted on Monday, also called comments by Mr Farage in 2015 \"offensive and racist\" and said he would be \"frightened\" to live in a country run by him after the then-UKIP leader said it was \"ludicrous\" that employers could not choose British workers over Polish ones. In 2022, Mr Farage said Mr Zahawi's promotion to chancellor showed \"all he's interested in is climbing that greasy pole\". Mr Zahawi denied his move was about his career or that he thought Mr Farage was racist. \"If I thought this man sitting next to me in any way had an issue with people of my colour or my background who have come to this country, who have integrated, assimilated, are proud of this country, worked hard in this country, paid millions of pounds in taxes in this country, invested in the country, I wouldn't be sitting next to him,\" he said, with Mr Farage beside him. Anti-vaccine questions The former COVID vaccines minister also batted away questions about Aseem Malhotra, an adviser to US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who linked COVID vaccines to cancer in the Royal Family during Reform's conference last year. Mr Farage brushed it off as providing a platform for free speech. Mr Malhotra's claims were condemned by leading viral immunologist Professor Brian Ferguson, from Cambridge University, who said: \"There is no credible evidence that these vaccines disrupt tumour suppressors or drive any kind of process that results in cancer.\" The Conservatives said Mr Zahawi's move is the latest in a number of \"has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\". Other parties hit out A Conservative spokesman added: \"Their latest recruit used to say he'd be 'frightened to live in a country' run by Nigel Farage, which shows the level of loyalty for sale. \"Reform want higher welfare spending and higher taxes. They are a one-man band with no plan for our country.\" The Liberal Democrat MP for Mr Zahawi's old seat of Stratford-upon-Avon, Manuela Perteghella, said: \"Reform is becoming a retirement home for disgraced former Conservative ministers.\" Before Monday, sitting MP Danny Kruger, who was a Tory shadow cabinet member at the time, was the most senior Tory to have defected to Reform. Labour Party chair Anna Turley said Reform has \"no shame\" as Mr Zahawi is a \"discredited and disgraced politician who will be forever tied to the Tories' shameful record of failure in government\"."

East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust has also declared a critical incident due to \"sustained pressures\" at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate. It said its hospitals were experiencing \"exceptionally high demand, driven by a continued high admission rate and a large number of patients with winter illnesses and respiratory viruses\".

It said it was the result of a surge in complex attendances to A&E departments and ongoing challenges in discharging patients who are well enough to leave hospital. Other critical incidents have also been declared in recent days in Birmingham, Staffordshire and two areas of Wales. On Saturday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in south east Wales said it was suffering \"sustained pressure\" and on Monday confirmed it was seeing \"a significant increase of norovirus cases across Gwent\". Meanwhile, on Thursday, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust in Staffordshire, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in North Wales all reported exceptionally high demand. Flu linked to festive events Christmas and new year gatherings may have caused a \"bounce back\" in winter viruses, according to NHS England. On Thursday, NHS England revealed the number of people in hospital beds with flu averaged 2,924 each day during the week ending 4 January, up 9% from 2,676 the previous week. The figure had previously been on a downward trend after reaching 3,140 in the week ending 14 December. Figures also showed a sharp rise in the proportion of patients waiting at least 30 minutes in ambulances outside hospitals.

A critical incident is defined as any local incident where the pressure or disruption is so severe that the NHS can no longer provide essential services safely or effectively. Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust operates Royal Surrey County Hospital, Haslemere Hospital, Milford Hospital, Cranleigh village Hospital, Royal Surrey Cancer Centre, Royal Surrey Cancer Centre at East Surrey, Royal Surrey Cancer Centre at Ashford and St Peter's, and Royal Surrey Cancer Centre at Frimley.

        "Content": "Tens of thousands of people across South East England are without water, as Kent County Council (KCC) declared a major incident. South East Water (SEW) blamed the outages on Storm Goretti and cold weather causing burst pipes and power cuts. Linden Kemkaran, leader of KCC, declared a major incident across the county on Monday morning, saying more households have been impacted in the previous 24 hours. The issue forced a number of schools in Kent and Sussex to close on the first day of the week. It comes after 24,000 properties in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, spent days without any running water, and almost two weeks without drinkable water last month. Several thousand homes and businesses in Tunbridge Wells have been told their supply may not return to normal until the middle of the week. Here is what you need to know. Where is affected? Around 30,000 properties across the two counties have been impacted, South East Water said in a statement to Sky News. \"This includes 16,500 properties in East Grinstead and the surrounding areas in Sussex, with parts of Tunbridge Wells also affected, along with some localised issues in other parts of Kent,\" the company said. The affected areas include: • Maidstone• West Sussex and surrounding areas• Tunbridge Wells• Canterbury• Whitstable SEW said supplies to East Grinstead, West Sussex, and Blean, Maidstone, were not expected to return until Tuesday. Southern Water said on 11 January that households in Thanet, Sittingbourne, Medway and surrounding areas are currently not experiencing a loss of water supply, but some drinking water storage reservoirs are at low levels due to Storm Goretti. The company said this could mean there is a \"higher risk of supply issues in the coming days\" but it is \"taking action now to do all we can to prevent that\". What caused the problem? SEW said Storm Goretti, which hit the UK last week, affected its ability to \"treat the raw water at the normal rate at our main Sussex water treatment works\". It said this, coupled with the outbreak of burst water mains due to freezing conditions across Sussex, means its drinking water storage levels are running low. SEW incident manager Matthew Dean said: \"We're very sorry to our customers across Kent and Sussex who continue to experience issues with their drinking water supply, including no water, intermittent supply interruptions or low pressure.\" \"We are using 21 tankers to pump water directly into our network to increase the amount of water available in the affected areas and our leak repair teams are working around the clock to fix the leaks and bursts across Kent and Sussex, with extra resources available to help carry out repairs,\" he added. He said SEW's customer care team was \"delivering bottled water to the customers on our Priority Services Register who are most in need\". \"We are also supporting hospitals with tankers and providing bottled water for care homes, schools, medical care providers and to support livestock,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Victims of Bolton crash namedOfcom investigating X 'Extremely frustrating' Dave and Valerie Matson have lived in and around Tunbridge Wells for 55 years. They told Sky News that the current water outages are \"extremely frustrating\". \"I know it's jolly cold, but this should not happen,\" Mrs Matson said. Mr Matson, a former director of a company, said it has only been a short while since residents in Tunbridge Wells were last affected by water outages. \"It destroyed Tunbridge Wells in the run-up to Christmas,\" he said. \"Literally all the shops were shut... and the restaurants, normally they are rammed in December, but they have lost thousands and thousands. I think it is absolutely appalling.\" Mr Matson put the problems down to \"greed and incompetence\" of water companies, adding: \"They have got a duty to their customers, they have got to talk to their shareholders and say 'we have got to spend money, we have got to do what we should have done over the years'.\" He added: \"We can cope with it, but I feel so sorry for the vulnerable people and businesses. It is hard enough for shops in this county and across the UK.\" 'The impact has been massive' No running water means cancelled clients for Hannah Sykes, who runs Rush hair salon in East Grinstead, in West Sussex, where 16,500 households and businesses started the working week without water. \"The impact has been massive,\" she said, having had no supply all weekend, her busiest time. \"This would be when the people from the end of November, beginning of December, would be returning to us. So it's a big weekend for us to have to close and still have no date of when we're reopening,\" she told Sky News. \"Also, it means we don't have toilets. And we can't offer drinks to clients.\" \"This is the second time this has happened to us now. Last time it was three to four days we were without water and had to close.\" She said she had not received compensation. Hannah says she's had \"minimal\" contact from South East Water, who she feels aren't taking responsibility. Her last update came just after 4.30pm offering \"no further updates\". Where are bottled water stations located? Multiple bottled water stations have been set up in the area to distribute water to local residents until supplies are fully restored. SEW said its customer care team is also delivering bottled water to the customers on our Priority Services Register who are most in need and we have carried out 5,700 deliveries of bottled water over the weekend. The company said the following stations are open until 10pm: • Kings Centre - Moat Rd, East Grinstead RH19 3LN • East Grinstead Sports Club - Saint Hill Rd, East Grinstead RH19 4JU • East Court, College Lane, East Grinstead, West Sussex RH19 3LT • Tunbridge St Marks Recreation Ground, Tunbridge Wells TN2 5LS Recurring problems at South East Water In 2023, SEW was found to be the worst company for supply interruptions in the UK. Since then there have been multiple high-profile outages. The last was in December 2025, when 24,000 people suffered days without water in Tunbridge Wells after a \"water quality issue\" at the Pembury Water Treatment Works. Earlier this month, chief executive of SEW David Hinton was criticised by MPs for a \"fundamentally lacking\" human response to the crisis during an Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee hearing. One committee member said they were \"quite shocked\" at the \"lack of accountability\" the chief executive was taking for the incident, although he did begin his questioning with an apology to customers. He blamed a lack of infrastructure in the South East for the failures and said that the risks are \"inevitable\" without investment."

        "Content": "A troop of monkeys have spent days running wild in a US city and artificial intelligence is complicating efforts to catch them.  The vervet monkeys were still at large in St Louis in Missouri on Monday, after first being spotted on Thursday. It remains unclear who owns the monkeys, how they escaped or even exactly how many there are. Residents have reported capturing the primates, with some posting fake AI-generated images to bolster their claims, local officials said. But the monkeys had in reality remained on the loose. Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer said the monkeys' escape had sparked \"rumour after rumour\". \"It's been a lot in regard to AI and what's genuine and what's not,\" Mr Springer said. \"People are just having fun.

Residents have been urged to stay away from the monkeys and call for assistance if they see them. The species is described as intelligent and social, but may be unpredictable or aggressive under stress. Sky's US partner network NBC News reported that animal control officers had been walking the streets of St Louis with catch poles ready to seizure any primates they spotted. \"This is the first time we have had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St Louis,\" St Louis's Department of Health environmental health bureau chief Justen Hauser told the network."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK has no plan to defend the nation in the event of war, including how to mobilise the National Health Service to deal with mass casualties, the head of the military has revealed. The admission by Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton - confirming a report by Sky News from almost two years ago - came despite mounting warnings about the threat of conflict with Russia and as Donald Trump makes hostile noises about seizing Greenland. Answering wide-ranging questions from MPs on Monday, the chief of the defence staff also confirmed that the Ministry of Defence lacks funding to cover its equipment programme as well as additional ambitions set out in a sweeping review of defence published in June. He refused to say whether he was facing a budget shortfall and steered away from using the word \"cuts\", but said that reducing or slowing military programmes were among the options being considered. Air Chief Marshal Knighton, at times sounding frustrated, told members of the defence select committee not to \"put words in my mouth\" as he was pressed on reports that he had warned the prime minister before Christmas that defence has a £28bn hole in its budget over the next four years and would be required to make significant cuts without more money. He said: \"If we wanted to do everything that's currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [Strategic Defence Review], could we do that with the budget that we've got? The answer is no.\" No modern-day War Book The most stunning revelation during a two-hour grilling was his confirmation that the UK has yet to revive a modern version of the Government War Book. Drawn up during the First World War and maintained until the turn of the century, this was a comprehensive set of plans for the whole country - from the armed forces, hospitals and the police to industry schools and even art galleries - to transition from peace to war. It was shelved after the Soviet Union collapsed - as discussed in The Wargame podcast. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 But, despite the return of conflict to Europe following Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and then its full-scale attack in 2022, the UK has yet to draw up a new defence plan - something all NATO member states are required to maintain. The transatlantic alliance is the cornerstone of UK defence and security policy - with allies willing to mobilise in the defence of each other. But each nation is also meant to be able to defend itself in the first instance. \"We don't have a complete national defence plan yet,\" Air Chief Marshal Knighton said. Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat member of the defence select committee, asked him if we should have one. He responded: \"Yeah, absolutely. And the government is committed to doing that.\" Why does the UK not have a plan? Pushed on why the UK does not have one, the defence chief said: \"I think that it is a manifestation of the peace dividend. \"One of the most obvious is that since the end of the Cold War, we have not prioritised those matters. And so as a consequence, the government, for many years, of many hues, has not focused its efforts on developing that kind of plan. \"I'm pleased to say that partly as a consequence of what's in the Strategic Defence Review, that is changing.\" As for when such a national defence plan would be ready, Air Chief Marshal Knighton said this was a job that was being overseen by the Cabinet Office because it involves the whole of government. However, he said that the military component - which the Ministry of Defence is responsible for - would be finalised this year. Read more:UK's 'sons and daughters' need to be ready to fightEveryone in UK 'must step up' to deter Russian threat He also said that there is no plan to mobilise civilian doctors and nurses as well as hospitals to treat wounded troops and civilians in the event of a war in the UK or anywhere in Europe - a crisis that would put a huge strain on an already creaking health service. \"We don't have a holistic, national plan for how we would mobilise the National Health Service in times of all-out war in Europe,\" he said. \"Again, this was a piece of work being developed by the Cabinet Office, and there should be more details evolving in the next 12 to 18 months.\""

More than 2,100 arrests were made in London last year, a 47% rise compared with 2024. The West Midlands and the South West both had more than 1,100 arrests - a 76% and a 91% rise respectively. Of the total arrests, 1,726 people have been returned to the countries they came from, up 35% on the 1,283 removed from visits in the previous 18-month period.

On 16 December, 30 Indian and Albanian men were arrested at a construction site in Swindon, Wiltshire. Nearly all them were detained for removal. The record-breaking enforcement action comes just over two months after Ms Mahmood said her department was \"not yet fit for purpose\". She said a crackdown on tackling migrants working illegally in the UK was \"starting to work\" but criticised enforcement of illegal working rules under the previous Conservative government. Immigration enforcement was given £5m to arrest, detain and remove migrants working illegally, and officers have been wearing body-worn cameras since September to help publicise arrests and prosecutions. Tighter right-to-work checks have also been introduced so casual, temporary or subcontracted workers are forced to prove their status."

        "Content": "Tens of thousands of people across South East England are without water, as Kent County Council (KCC) declared a major incident. South East Water (SEW) blamed the outages on Storm Goretti and cold weather causing burst pipes and power cuts. Linden Kemkaran, leader of KCC, declared a major incident across the county on Monday morning, saying more households have been impacted in the previous 24 hours. The issue forced a number of schools in Kent and Sussex to close on the first day of the week. It comes after 24,000 properties in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, spent days without any running water, and almost two weeks without drinkable water last month. Several thousand homes and businesses in Tunbridge Wells have been told their supply may not return to normal until the middle of the week. Here is what you need to know. Where is affected? Around 30,000 properties across the two counties have been impacted, South East Water said in a statement to Sky News. \"This includes 16,500 properties in East Grinstead and the surrounding areas in Sussex, with parts of Tunbridge Wells also affected, along with some localised issues in other parts of Kent,\" the company said. The affected areas include: • Maidstone• West Sussex and surrounding areas• Tunbridge Wells• Canterbury• Whitstable SEW said supplies to East Grinstead, West Sussex, and Blean, Maidstone, were not expected to return until Tuesday. Southern Water said on 11 January that households in Thanet, Sittingbourne, Medway and surrounding areas are currently not experiencing a loss of water supply, but some drinking water storage reservoirs are at low levels due to Storm Goretti. The company said this could mean there is a \"higher risk of supply issues in the coming days\" but it is \"taking action now to do all we can to prevent that\". What caused the problem? SEW said Storm Goretti, which hit the UK last week, affected its ability to \"treat the raw water at the normal rate at our main Sussex water treatment works\". It said this, coupled with the outbreak of burst water mains due to freezing conditions across Sussex, means its drinking water storage levels are running low. SEW incident manager Matthew Dean said: \"We're very sorry to our customers across Kent and Sussex who continue to experience issues with their drinking water supply, including no water, intermittent supply interruptions or low pressure.\" \"We are using 21 tankers to pump water directly into our network to increase the amount of water available in the affected areas and our leak repair teams are working around the clock to fix the leaks and bursts across Kent and Sussex, with extra resources available to help carry out repairs,\" he added. He said SEW's customer care team was \"delivering bottled water to the customers on our Priority Services Register who are most in need\". \"We are also supporting hospitals with tankers and providing bottled water for care homes, schools, medical care providers and to support livestock,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Victims of Bolton crash namedOfcom investigating X 'Extremely frustrating' Dave and Valerie Matson have lived in and around Tunbridge Wells for 55 years. They told Sky News that the current water outages are \"extremely frustrating\". \"I know it's jolly cold, but this should not happen,\" Mrs Matson said. Mr Matson, a former director of a company, said it has only been a short while since residents in Tunbridge Wells were last affected by water outages. \"It destroyed Tunbridge Wells in the run-up to Christmas,\" he said. \"Literally all the shops were shut... and the restaurants, normally they are rammed in December, but they have lost thousands and thousands. I think it is absolutely appalling.\" Mr Matson put the problems down to \"greed and incompetence\" of water companies, adding: \"They have got a duty to their customers, they have got to talk to their shareholders and say 'we have got to spend money, we have got to do what we should have done over the years'.\" He added: \"We can cope with it, but I feel so sorry for the vulnerable people and businesses. It is hard enough for shops in this county and across the UK.\" 'The impact has been massive' No running water means cancelled clients for Hannah Sykes, who runs Rush hair salon in East Grinstead, in West Sussex, where 16,500 households and businesses started the working week without water. \"The impact has been massive,\" she said, having had no supply all weekend, her busiest time. \"This would be when the people from the end of November, beginning of December, would be returning to us. So it's a big weekend for us to have to close and still have no date of when we're reopening,\" she told Sky News. \"Also, it means we don't have toilets. And we can't offer drinks to clients.\" \"This is the second time this has happened to us now. Last time it was three to four days we were without water and had to close.\" She said she had not received compensation. Hannah says she's had \"minimal\" contact from South East Water, who she feels aren't taking responsibility. Her last update came just after 4.30pm offering \"no further updates\". Where are bottled water stations located? Multiple bottled water stations have been set up in the area to distribute water to local residents until supplies are fully restored. SEW said its customer care team is also delivering bottled water to the customers on our Priority Services Register who are most in need and we have carried out 5,700 deliveries of bottled water over the weekend. The company said the following stations are open until 10pm: • Kings Centre - Moat Rd, East Grinstead RH19 3LN • East Grinstead Sports Club - Saint Hill Rd, East Grinstead RH19 4JU • East Court, College Lane, East Grinstead, West Sussex RH19 3LT • Tunbridge St Marks Recreation Ground, Tunbridge Wells TN2 5LS Recurring problems at South East Water In 2023, SEW was found to be the worst company for supply interruptions in the UK. Since then there have been multiple high-profile outages. The last was in December 2025, when 24,000 people suffered days without water in Tunbridge Wells after a \"water quality issue\" at the Pembury Water Treatment Works. Earlier this month, chief executive of SEW David Hinton was criticised by MPs for a \"fundamentally lacking\" human response to the crisis during an Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee hearing. One committee member said they were \"quite shocked\" at the \"lack of accountability\" the chief executive was taking for the incident, although he did begin his questioning with an apology to customers. He blamed a lack of infrastructure in the South East for the failures and said that the risks are \"inevitable\" without investment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n \"He's a serious f****r\", was the unvarnished view of one Reform figure about the party's latest high-profile recruit. Most definitely meant as a compliment, the theory here is that Nadhim Zahawi will bring competence and credibility and strengthen the appeal of the fledgling political outfit with donors. He certainly offers experience, as well as a backstory more engaging than most in the Reform flock. Politics latest - watch live The Iraqi refugee who arrived in the UK unable to speak English and rose to become a multimillionaire businessman and eventually chancellor. But perhaps Mr Zahawi's proudest political period was as vaccines minister, overseeing the wildly successful rollout of COVID jabs during the pandemic. So his is now an odd choice of party, perhaps, given dalliances Reform has had with vaccine scepticism as well as outright vaccine conspiracy theories. \n                  Former chancellor Zahawi joins diagnostics group Ador\n                 \n                  Zahawi approaches former Tory treasurer Mansour to fund Telegraph bid\n                 \n                  Former PM Johnson sounded out about Telegraph role\n                 Repeated questions about this apparent mismatch at his inaugural press conference were met with frosty replies - with Mr Zahawi berating journalists for asking \"really stupid\" questions. That's not to say he has a spotless track-record, though. In 2013, he was forced to apologise for claiming taxpayer expenses to supply electricity to his stables. Five years later, he was reprimanded for attending the controversial men-only 'President's Club' gala. He was elevated to chancellor in 2022, but days after walking through the Treasury door, appeared to turn on then prime minister Boris Johnson by telling him to resign. Then the final nail in his frontline political career - his sacking as Tory chairman over unpaid tax. So given all that, why would an anti-establishment party like Reform embrace someone who - all the evidence suggests - is a fully signed up member of said establishment? Part of the answer to that is the connections and experience. But another is the potential for the party's image to be softened in the eyes of more centrist voters who worry about some of Reform's harder edges. Yes, there is a risk of looking like a 'home for retired Tories' as faces of yesteryear continue to sign up en masse. But as one Reform figure points out, \"the Tory party of ten, fifteen years ago is a damn sight better than the Tory party of now\". So if that's the appeal for Reform, what's in it for their latest signing? The co-founder of the polling giant YouGov, Nadhim Zahawi is a rich man in his own right with business interests and connections around the world. Aged 58, why not just go quietly into the sunset? According to those who know him, that's just not Nadhim Zahawi. They paint a picture of a man driven by a desire for attention, yes, but also by a hunger to be accepted into the upper echelons of the country he has made his home. \"He can't exist without the attention and without wanting to be taken seriously,\" one person said. It's that desire that's got this former minister into hot water in the past. But it's clear it wasn't something he could switch off - or wanted to switch off - when he departed the Commons. So with Reform leading in the polls, and the Conservatives still flagging, this ever-ambitious politician believes he's spied one more route back to the top."

        "Content": "A van driver in a police pursuit ploughed into a mother-of-three who was looking for her golf ball and then stepped over her body as he fled, a court has heard. John McDonald, 52, damaged vehicles, drove on the wrong side of the road, mounted pavements and rammed a police car following him at least eight times, during a 12-minute pursuit through the streets of Birmingham at speeds of up to 70mph. McDonald then entered Aston Wood Golf Club in Shenstone, Staffordshire, where Suzanne Cherry, 62, and her husband Clint Harrison were playing golf on 11 April last year. She was struck by McDonald as she searched for her ball near a stream on the course, Worcester Crown Court was told. The victim suffered multiple catastrophic injuries and died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham four days later. McDonald, of Bloxwich, admitted causing the death of Ms Cherry by dangerous driving on the day his trial was due to start on Monday. He and his co-defendants Johnny McDonald, 23, of Dudley, and Brett Delaney, 35, of Darlaston, pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations that roofing work was needed when it was not, between 17 February and 12 April last year. \n                  Radar 'technical issue' halts flights to Birmingham Airport\n                 \n                  Watchdog to examine West Midlands Police role in Maccabi Tel Aviv fans ban\n                 \n                  Agency staff covering for striking bin workers vote to go on strike\n                 All three had previously denied charges of manslaughter. After Ms Cherry's death, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation into the circumstances leading up to the fatal collision and the involvement of West Midlands Police officers. The IOPC said two patrol cars had started following a van in Kingstanding, Birmingham, after receiving reports of suspicious activity. Police officers stopped following the van when it came off the road and went up an embankment at the Aston Wood Golf Club, where it hit Ms Cherry, who was from Aldridge.

        "Content": "A football fan who left one of his players with a serious injury and permanent facial disfigurement after throwing part of a seat on to the pitch has been jailed for 18 months. David Gowans, 32, hurled the object following a league match between Aberdeen and Dundee United at Tannadice on 17 May 2025. It struck then Aberdeen player Jack MacKenzie in the face, leaving him with a \"deep 2in laceration\" to his left eyebrow and a \"5cm abrasion\" below his left eye. The incident occurred as fans invaded the pitch following Dundee United's 2-1 win - which secured them fourth spot in the Scottish Premiership and a place in Europe. Father-of-one Gowans, who was said to have been working as an offshore operator at the time, had been a member of the Aberdeen ultras supporters' group. Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him: \"Your actions were selfish, stupid, dangerous and utterly irresponsible. \"You must have known that by throwing this item it could hit somebody.

Sheriff Carmichael was shown CCTV footage of the incident, which showed MacKenzie, 25, lying on the pitch receiving medical attention. He was later taken off the pitch in a wheelchair. Lifetime ban by Aberdeen FC Gowans pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct at Dundee Sheriff Court in October. He was sentenced on Monday. As well as the jail term, Gowans was also banned from attending football matches for 10 years. He has already been handed a lifetime ban by Aberdeen FC. Sheriff Carmichael said: \"There is no reasonable alternative to a custodial sentence. \"This is needed because of the gravity of this crime, and it is needed in order to adequately punish you and adequately express the public disapproval of this behaviour, and discourage others from behaving in a similar fashion.\" 'Disastrous mistake' Prosecutor Lee Corr previously told the court that on the day of the incident Gowans sent text messages to Lynn Fiske, Aberdeen FC's supporter liaison officer, in which he initially denied but later admitted throwing the seat. In one message, the father-of-one said he \"wasn't aiming at anything or anyone\" and that the section of seat had just been \"there right next to me\". He described it as \"a disastrous mistake\". Ms Fiske advised him to turn himself into the police, but Gowans did not and was arrested and charged a couple of days later. 'He let himself and his club down' During a police interview, Gowans admitted drinking a half litre of vodka prior to leaving home for the match. Defence lawyer Larry Flynn told the court his client had been inebriated at the time he threw the chair, and that he was so drunk he missed the supporters' bus home to Aberdeen and had to get a taxi instead. He added that Gowans was \"extremely embarrassed\" by the incident, and that he accepts \"he let himself down and let his football club down\". Helen Nisbet, procurator fiscal for Tayside, Central and Fife, said: \"This was disgraceful conduct which could have resulted in far greater consequences. \"David Gowans' crass behaviour could also have jeopardised the safety of other supporters. \"As prosecutors, we will not hesitate to deal with this type of offending which puts people at serious risk of harm.\""

Mehmet Ogur, 27, was found guilty during a trial last summer after denying any wrongdoing, despite sending her messages apologising for what he had done. Stafford Crown Court heard the trained veterinary technician, who was living at the Holiday Inn Express in Tamworth, met the 18-year-old woman in January 2025. The jury was told the attack happened at a park near the town centre, days after they made contact on Snapchat. Ogur is understood to have arrived in Britain on a small boat weeks before the attack. He showed no apparent emotion in the dock as he was jailed on Monday. Passing sentence, Judge John Edwards said the rape had caused \"immense harm\" to the victim. He told Ogur, who was assisted in court by a Turkish interpreter: \"Your continued stay in the United Kingdom will be for others to determine, not for me.\" \n                  Woman arrested on suspicion of murder after death of two children in Stafford\n                 \n                  Asylum seekers come face-to-face with migrant hotel critics\n                 \n                  Human skeletal remains found near retail park in Stoke-on-Trent, police say\n                 The judge accepted that Ogur was \"plainly a man of intelligence\" who had witnessed extreme violence before being \"grabbed from the middle of the sea\" and arriving in Britain. 'He completely changed me' Before sentencing, the victim said in an impact statement to the court: \"I'm a survivor of rape by Mehmet Ogur. \"No words can explain what he put me through. He completely changed me as a person. The truth is, I don't think I'll ever get through it. He completely destroyed me. \"It's been nearly a year since you raped me, but it still feels like yesterday. Why me? Why did you choose me to completely destroy when all I did was show kindness and empathy towards you?\" During Ogur's trial, the court heard he attacked the woman after consensual cuddling and kissing in a secluded area of a park. The jury was told the victim screamed for him to stop as she tried to struggle free. Messages sent to woman Ogur said he had only engaged in consensual activity and that messages he sent to the woman were not admissions of guilt. The court heard one note read: \"I am really sorry, I didn't actually want to do this but I couldn't stop myself\" while another stated \"I am sorry for trying to force you to have sex\". Ogur claimed Google Translate had altered the meaning of the messages, but the prosecution argued they represented a \"full and complete admission\".

The Holiday Inn Express in Tamworth was set on fire and damaged by rioters in August 2024, days after the Southport dance class stabbings. Several people were later jailed for their part in the disorder."

Men and women pass amongst the rows of corpses, searching for a sign - or a distinguishing feature - of someone they love. A woman kneels before a bloodied body, her face contorted with grief. Her search is over. Her worst fears have been realised. Outside the warehouse, which is part of a government forensic centre in Kahrizak, body bags are unloaded from pick-ups and larger vehicles. These scenes are highly likely to have been replicated nationwide. It is clear the protests in Iran have been met with a ruthless, state-backed crackdown. Human rights officials have attempted to count the number of fatalities, with one group putting the figure at around 650. But the regime is working hard to cut all sources of information. The internet has been blocked and it is now impossible make domestic and international phone calls. The authorities have even managed to disable 'Starlink' internet receivers which connect to the web through the satellite network run by Elon Musk. The only source of information comes from state television, which preoccupies itself with pro-government rallies. The state cannot conceal everything Relatives of a boy called Amir Ali Haydari, have told Sky News how the 17-year-old was shot and beaten to death in the city of Kermanshah. His cousin, Diako Haydari, who lives in Cardiff, told us that the teenager attended protests last Thursday with his classmates. \"I got the latest information from our family today. He was shot in the heart, and as he was taking his last breath, they hit him in the head with the butt of a gun so many times that his brain was scattered on the ground.\" \"Then, at the mortuary where all the bodies are, they issued a death certificate saying that he fell from a big height.\" In footage filmed in Kermanshah last Thursday, we see plain clothes policemen intimidating protesters and firing pistols at them on the streets. Later that day, demonstrations formed in the centre of the city. We have obtained images of a protest in the area where Haydari was killed. Family members say many of the teenager's friends were caught up in the violence. \"Two of Amir friends are in a coma, and they killed many of his friends. Just like him. They shot them. Many of Amir Ali's friends are dead,\" says Mr Haydari. \"They are savagely attacking people because they want to silence the voice of the people.\" Read more:How Iran enforced internet blackoutMore than 500 killed in Iran, rights group says According to the family, there were so many dead bodies from this protest that the authorities requisitioned two city buses to transport them to the morgue at Taleghani Hospital. He added that: \"When (the family) collected the body, Amir-Ali's uncle told me that there were around 500 corpses at the hospital. He had to identify (Amir Ali's) body from amongst all the bodies.\" For Mr Haydari in Cardiff, it has all come as a terrible shock. \"I did not sleep last night, me and my wife did not sleep. There's nothing we can do,\" he told Sky News. Officially at least, the regime is trying to project an air of normality as its security forces deploy brute force against their own people. But it serves as a reminder that the clerics who run this country will do anything to stay in power."

Independent news agencies say ship tracking data shows no Chinese or Russian presence near the territory, although experts say that Russian submarines are likely to be operating in the area. The US president acknowledged a Greenland takeover by the US would compromise the NATO alliance but insisted the possible acquisition of the island would serve US interests. \"If it affects NATO, it affects NATO. But they need us much more than we need them. I will tell you that right now,\" Mr Trump said. Read more from Sky News:Woman shot dead in head in IranDissent in China rising dramatically NATO member countries are discussing the next steps on how to collectively keep the Arctic safe, alliance chief Mark Rutte said on Monday. \"We are working ‌on the next ‍steps to make sure that indeed, we collectively protect what is at stake here,\" Mr Rutte ⁠said while visiting Zagreb, Croatia. \"All allies agree on the importance of ​the Arctic and Arctic security,\" he added. \"With sea lanes opening up, there is a risk ‍that the Russians and the Chinese will be more active.\" He said talks on Arctic security started last year and member countries were now looking at \"how ‌to make sure that we give practical follow up on those discussions\". The UK is reportedly in discussions with other NATO countries to send British troops to Greenland to deter \"Russian aggression\". On Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer told Mr Trump in a call that \"more could be done to protect\" the Arctic region and agreed with the president on the \"need to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia in the High North\". Asked on the Trevor Phillips On Sunday show yesterday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander did not rule out that UK forces could be stationed in the territory. She said: \"You would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle. And whilst it hasn't had the devastating consequences that we have seen in Ukraine, they are becoming increasingly active in the region, Russia. \"That's why we signed the defence agreement with Norway in December, which is going to lead to us jointly operating a fleet of Type 26 anti-submarine warfare frigates there, to hunt down Russian submarines, and to make sure that we can protect our critical infrastructure under the sea. \"It's why we have agreed to do more joint training at the Royal Marines with Norway and why we have agreed to, pre-deploy, some of our equipment to Norway, so that we can act quickly if necessary. And of course... we're a leading member in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which is a coalition of ten likeminded nations who see defence and deterrence in the Arctic Circle.\" Germany has also confirmed talks are under way in NATO to bolster security in the Arctic. Responding to Mr Trump's claims that the US needed to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future, Beijing said the United States should not use other countries as an excuse to advance its own strategic interests. China in 2018 declared itself a \"near-Arctic state\" in a bid to acquire more influence in the region. Beijing has also said it wants to develop a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"The Arctic ‌concerns the overall interests of the international ​community,\" adding that China's activities in the Arctic aim to promote stability and ⁠sustainable development in the ‌region. Ms Mao also said that all countries' rights and freedoms to operate lawfully in the Arctic should be respected. US secretary of state Marco Rubio will hold talks with Denmark about the Greenland issue next week. White House officials have floated the idea of purchasing the territory instead of taking it by force, and Reuters reported on Thursday that they are exploring the possibility of offering payments directly to Greenlanders to encourage them to break away from Denmark and possibly align with the United States. Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, is defended by Denmark. Denmark's military, however, is significantly smaller than that of the United States."

Mr Huckabee told me that Hamas, in his opinion, bears the entire responsibility for turning Gaza into \"the most miserable place on earth\". He said that talks were still ongoing about who would serve on the \"Board of Peace\" outlined in the Gaza ceasefire agreement. He told me: \"I think we all thought it might have already been announced, but one of the things that I appreciate about the process is it could have been done quickly, but there's a greater desire to do it right than to do it fast. \"There will be a Palestinian technocratic government but it's yet to be named and determined.

It has to be a better outcome for the people that won't be subject to the horrific kind of administration that Hamas has imposed on since they took control in 2007.\" It is only a matter of months since Britain, France and a group of other countries recognised the state of Palestine. The United States did not, and the ambassador told me he remained angry and disappointed about the decision. I asked him why he was so sure that he was right, and that the likes of Britain were wrong. \"It wasn't just me, my government, the United States has been vehemently opposed to this unilateral recognition,\" said Mr Huckabee, claiming it contravened the terms of the Oslo Accords. \"It was, to us, not only ill-timed, it was very damaging and hurtful to the process in Gaza. It was damaging to what we were trying to do and alleviating some of the financial crisis between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. \"I'm not sure to this day what was accomplished by, other than to really mess some things up that didn't need to be messed up, and for some grandstanding to go on between some European leaders that thought that somehow they were going to bring some great resolve, which they did not do.\""

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n The big question as we watch the unrest continue in Iran: will it be enough to bring down the government? We have seen protests there before. They were eventually crushed. On the surface, this uprising looks similar to the \"women, life, freedom\" unrest of three years ago, which authorities used ruthless violence to snuff out. But there are some big differences. Iran latest: Tehran 'ready for war but also dialogue' Most of all, the economy. The plunging Iranian currency is causing the country a world of pain. The protests began in the market areas of the capital, Tehran, last month after the Iranian rial fell to a record low, pushing up the prices of food and other essentials. Iran's important merchant class is turning against the government, posing a new threat to the foundations of its power. Increasingly desperate, the poor are joining in too, adding to what is becoming a perfect storm of grievances against the leadership. Most worryingly for the government, there are no signs these economic challenges will ease, and there is little in the way of relief it can offer for them. But it's the timing of this unrest that makes it different too, coming after the biggest and most humiliating attack on Iran in its revolutionary history. Iran failed in protecting its people An attack that shattered the contract between Iran's government and its citizens The 12-day war with Israel saw the Iranian leadership fail in one of its most sacred duties, protecting the people. The ayatollahs have always promised to defend Iranians against the great satan, America, and the little satan, Israel. They've sent billions abroad to proxies to form an outer ring of defence. But Israel has demolished much of it and was able to send its warplanes to fly at will in the skies over Iran, before America joined in too. Scores of Iranian commanders were killed, and the US destroyed its nuclear programme. Iranians ask where all that money to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthi rebels went and why. Read more:Why are people protesting in Iran?Iranian protests: Gunfire, raids and growing ange Another revolution? When you visit Iran, there's a sense that its revolution has had its day, its rulers have lost their legitimacy. Young people tell you they want the old men of that revolution out of their lives. Conventional wisdom had it that Iran's government was more likely to change and reform within itself than be overthrown, evolution more than revolution. But there is no sign of that happening. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is well aware that reform has accelerated the fall of other regimes, not saved them. The unravelling of the Soviet empire after Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms is a case in point. But he has offered no other solution instead, and his government is now more exposed than ever before. Iranians are risking their lives and liberty, taking to the streets in their hundreds of thousands, demanding change. If enough do so for long enough, they may eventually get their way."

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n In an industrial corner of the city of Shenzhen, there was a sense the system was bracing. As they gathered, we watched them from afar. Hundreds of factory workers, clad in matching blue overall uniforms, out together on strike. It's immediately obvious that a scene like this is sensitive in China. Dozens of police and other security workers encircled the protesters. There is a nervous atmosphere, and anyone close was told not to film. It felt like a standoff of sorts, between those who want to be heard and those who want to silence. The type of standoff that, despite China's efforts to keep them under wraps, are actually dramatically on the rise. Workers at Yi Li Sheng's Shenzhen factory manufacture audio equipment such as headphones. The day we were there was the fourth day of their strike. \n                  Bosses courted to join PM's China trip as embassy verdict looms\n                 \n                  What the capture of Maduro means for China\n                 \n                  China fires rockets into waters off Taiwan in second day of military drills\n                 They claim that large portions of the factory's capacity have been shifted abroad, leaving them with a reduction in their hours, and take-home pay that no longer covers their basic costs in an expensive city like Shenzhen. \"Last month my wages were only 1900RMB (£200),\" one woman told us, wiping tears from her eyes. \"It's impossible! How can you survive in Shenzhen on that wage! \"The factory's exploitation is unbearable. It's very difficult.\" We put these claims to Yi Li Sheng but we did not get a response. Capturing scenes like this is rare in China. Protest is often swiftly shut down, local media will rarely report it and evidence will be scrubbed from social media by an army of censors. Expressing dissent is sensitive and risky, doing so is usually a sign of how desperate people see their situation to be. Indeed, that was the sense from the workers in Shenzhen and it was clear they did want to be heard. When we got close to their group and they realised we were foreign media, they started cheering, chanting and pumping their fists. But the reaction from authorities came swiftly. Hands immediately blocked our lenses, men pulled members of our team to the side, our camera was seized and we were forced into cars and driven away. We were physically unharmed but, in the moment, the treatment was frightening. A sign, it seems, of just how much this country does not want its dissent to be seen. Just because protest is hard to document in China, it does not mean it's uncommon. In fact, according to data collected and analysed by research group China Dissent Monitor (CDM), quite the opposite is true. The group, which is an arm of US-based NGO Freedom House, documented over 5,000 cases in 2025 and says that incidents have dramatically increased. Indeed, exclusive analysis for Sky News shows that the numbers for the first 11 months of last year were up by 48% on the same period in 2024. CDM, which was initially funded by the US government but is now funded by private investors, gathers most of its data by constantly trawling Chinese social media, and it says there are likely many more cases that it doesn't see in time or that are never uploaded. \"Real-world protests are much higher than what we capture,\" explains Kevin Slaten, the research lead for CDM. \"We don't know exactly how many times higher.\" The reasons behind these protests are varied - from unpaid wages to rural land forcibly taken for construction, from perceived unfairness in the school system to homeowners who poured life savings into properties that were never delivered. But in total 85% of the incidents CDM has charted since June 2022 have been about economic grievances. Preserving the evidence of such protest and ensuring people see it is a difficult task, and one undertaken by a few committed individuals working from abroad. One of them is a man who gives his name only as Li. He runs an account on X called \"Teacher Li is Not Your Teacher\" where he reposts videos of protests in China to Western-based sites that the censors can't control. He has some 2.1 million followers, but what he does is so contentious that he has to live essentially in hiding and he says that his family back in China have been threatened. \"The reasons [for a rise in protests] are interrelated,\" he says. \"The economic downturn has led to social instability, which has led to the government's desire to impose more control over society, which then has led to more discontent in the population. \"Self-expression is a very rebellious thing in traditional Chinese culture, and on top of this, expressing dissatisfaction openly is a thing hidden under a kind of 'red terror'. \"Our observation is that most people don't dare to talk about their situation or their thoughts.\" Who or what Chinese people blame when they are unhappy is a much more complicated question to untangle. Indeed, overtly political protest is much more unusual. There have been some notable recent examples, the most famous being the huge swathe of discontent known as the \"White Paper Protests\" that erupted in 2022 in reaction to extreme COVID-19 restrictions. A smaller handful of lone protesters have even used banners and projectors to call for the downfall of China's Communist Party. But in a country that prizes \"social stability\" above almost all else and where a comprehensive system has been built up over many years to sustain it, any gathering is seen as having the potential to spiral and is thus treated as a threat. \"The Chinese people are very, very knowledgeable about their own country and how it works when it comes to politics. \"They know that the Communist Party has complete control,\" explains Slaten, who says that 32% of all the protest CDM has charted targets local or central government, public schools or universities. \"People are careful in what they say publicly, to not link this to the central government in many cases. But that doesn't mean that that's the same as trusting the central government.\" A perfect example of this was seen in the southwestern city of Jiangyou this summer. What started as a peaceful protest about a school bullying incident spiralled into anger at the authorities as people felt their concerns were not being listened to. Hundreds of people took to the streets, some chanting \"huan wo minzhu\" [give me back democracy], and the incident culminated in violent clashes with police. Indeed, some observers point to the fact that many NGOs and advocacy groups in China that used to act as conduits for people's grievances have been forced to close in recent years. They say people now feel they have fewer options for recompense. There are, of course, millions of Chinese people who don't recognise this. They are happy and prosperous and see no need to protest. A Chinese government official told us that dissidents are not representative of the mainstream of Chinese society. Freedom House is a sanctioned organisation in China, which says protest is legal and respected. But it is clear China would prefer its dissent not to be seen, despite the fact it is increasingly there."

        "Content": "Myanmar stands accused of committing genocide against members of the Rohingya ethnic minority in a case opening at a United Nations court this week. The long-awaited International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearings in The Hague concern charges the southeast Asian nation committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim minority in Rakhine State in the west of country, and began on Monday. The case was first filed by the Gambia in 2019, which has argued that Myanmar's military engaged in a \"clearance operation\" in 2017 that violated the 1948 Genocide Convention. It has accused security forces of mass rapes, killings and torching thousands of homes, which resulted in more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh. Myanmar, which launched the campaign in 2017 after an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group, has denied the allegations. The Gambia's justice minister Dawda Jallow said his country had brought the case out of \"a sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government. \"We must use our moral voice in condemnation of oppression, of crimes against individuals, and of groups, wherever and whenever they occur,\" he said. \n                  At least 15 dead and 150 missing after boat capsizes near Mauritania, UN organisation says\n                 \n                  Cough syrup deaths: WHO urges 'immediate action' after 300 child deaths last year\n                 \n                  Investigation into cough syrup after 66 children die in The Gambia \n                 The trial is the first genocide case the ICJ has taken up in full in more than a decade, and its outcome could have repercussions for how future allegations are assessed, including South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Several members of the Rohingya made the trip to the Netherlands to attend the hearings, which are expected to last three weeks. Today, an estimated 1.2 million members of the persecuted minority are living overcrowded camps in Bangladesh. Sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed last year by US President Donald Trump closed thousands of the camps' schools and have caused children to starve to death. \"We don't have anything that human beings should have,\" Yousuf Ali, who travelled from a refugee camp in Bangladesh to the Netherlands for the proceedings, told The Associated Press. Read more:Myanmar holds election - but critics call it a 'sham' vote Myanmar was initially represented at the court by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who denied her country's armed forces committed genocide, telling the ICJ in 2019 that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she led was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents. The pro-democracy icon is now in prison after being convicted of what her supporters call trumped-up charges after a military takeover of power. Myanmar contested the court's jurisdiction, saying Gambia was not directly involved in the conflict and therefore could not initiate a case. But in 2022, judges rejected the argument, allowing the case to move forward. A finding of genocide may also have an impact on the ongoing investigation at another court based in The Hague, the International Criminal Court. In 2024, the court's chief prosecutor asked judges to issue an arrest warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, for crimes against the Rohingya. The request for the warrant is still pending."

        "Content": "Five human heads were found hanging from ropes at a beach in Ecuador as the country suffers a wave of violence related to drug trafficking. The heads were located on a picturesque beach in Puerto Lopez, in the southwest of the country, with police attributing the incidents to a conflict between criminal groups. Drug-trafficking networks with links to transnational cartels are active in the area and have used fishermen and their small boats for their illicit activities, according to authorities. Images published by Ecuadorian media outlets showed a warning sign next to the heads directed at alleged extortionists of fishermen in the small fishing port of Puerto Lopez. The ropes were fixed to wooden poles on the beach. Fighting over territory and control of drug-trafficking routes has triggered violent episodes across the Manabi province, where Puerto Lopez is located. Police said that they had carried out control and surveillance operations in Puerto Lopez amid an ongoing state of emergency enforced in nine of the country's 24 provinces, including Manabi. \n                  Ecuador: Soldiers jailed for 34 years over disappearance of four murdered boys\n                 \n                  Wilmer Chavarria: Ecuadorian drug lord who faked his own death and ordered assassinations is captured, says president\n                 \n                  Trump's declared war on drug cartels.

But one way or the other, we're gonna have Greenland.\" The president said that \"Greenland does not want to see Russia or China take over,\" adding that the territory would benefit from closer ties with the US, particularly when it comes to defence. \"Greenland, basically, their defence is two dogsleds,\" he said. \"In the meantime, you have Russian destroyers and submarines, and China destroyers and submarines all over the place.

Independent news agencies say ship tracking data shows no Chinese or Russian presence near the territory, although experts say that Russian submarines are likely to be operating in the area. The US president acknowledged a Greenland takeover by the US would compromise the NATO alliance but insisted the possible acquisition of the island would serve US interests. \"If it affects NATO, it affects NATO. But they need us much more than we need them. I will tell you that right now,\" Mr Trump said. Read more from Sky News:Woman shot dead in head in IranDissent in China rising dramatically NATO member countries are discussing the next steps on how to collectively keep the Arctic safe, alliance chief Mark Rutte said on Monday. \"We are working ‌on the next ‍steps to make sure that indeed, we collectively protect what is at stake here,\" Mr Rutte ⁠said while visiting Zagreb, Croatia. \"All allies agree on the importance of ​the Arctic and Arctic security,\" he added. \"With sea lanes opening up, there is a risk ‍that the Russians and the Chinese will be more active.\" He said talks on Arctic security started last year and member countries were now looking at \"how ‌to make sure that we give practical follow up on those discussions\". The UK is reportedly in discussions with other NATO countries to send British troops to Greenland to deter \"Russian aggression\". On Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer told Mr Trump in a call that \"more could be done to protect\" the Arctic region and agreed with the president on the \"need to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia in the High North\". Asked on the Trevor Phillips On Sunday show yesterday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander did not rule out that UK forces could be stationed in the territory. She said: \"You would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle. And whilst it hasn't had the devastating consequences that we have seen in Ukraine, they are becoming increasingly active in the region, Russia. \"That's why we signed the defence agreement with Norway in December, which is going to lead to us jointly operating a fleet of Type 26 anti-submarine warfare frigates there, to hunt down Russian submarines, and to make sure that we can protect our critical infrastructure under the sea. \"It's why we have agreed to do more joint training at the Royal Marines with Norway and why we have agreed to, pre-deploy, some of our equipment to Norway, so that we can act quickly if necessary. And of course... we're a leading member in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which is a coalition of ten likeminded nations who see defence and deterrence in the Arctic Circle.\" Germany has also confirmed talks are under way in NATO to bolster security in the Arctic. Responding to Mr Trump's claims that the US needed to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future, Beijing said the United States should not use other countries as an excuse to advance its own strategic interests. China in 2018 declared itself a \"near-Arctic state\" in a bid to acquire more influence in the region. Beijing has also said it wants to develop a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"The Arctic ‌concerns the overall interests of the international ​community,\" adding that China's activities in the Arctic aim to promote stability and ⁠sustainable development in the ‌region. Ms Mao also said that all countries' rights and freedoms to operate lawfully in the Arctic should be respected. US secretary of state Marco Rubio will hold talks with Denmark about the Greenland issue next week. White House officials have floated the idea of purchasing the territory instead of taking it by force, and Reuters reported on Thursday that they are exploring the possibility of offering payments directly to Greenlanders to encourage them to break away from Denmark and possibly align with the United States. Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, is defended by Denmark. Denmark's military, however, is significantly smaller than that of the United States."

        "Content": "Hundreds more federal officers are set to be deployed to Minnesota amid protests across the US after a woman was killed during an ICE operation in Minneapolis. Renee Good, 37, was shot dead in her car in the city last Wednesday by an officer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration said the shooting was an act of self-defence by the agent, suggesting the mother-of-three used her vehicle as a weapon to attack him. This characterisation has been rejected by state and local officials and protesters, who say a bystander video showed Ms Good steered away from the officer.

The deployment comes in addition to the agents who arrived in Minneapolis last week in what Homeland Security has called its largest operation ever. About 2,000 ICE officers - more than three times the number of officers in the Minneapolis Police Department - have already been sent to the area. \"We're seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighbourhoods. They've definitely been out here,\" said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city council member. Minnesota sues Trump administration Meanwhile, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul filed a lawsuit against the federal government on Monday to stop the ICE operation or limit it. The lawsuit states that the enforcement surge in Minnesota violates federal law, alleging the state was being targeted over politics, which it says constitutes a violation of the First Amendment. It also claims the ICE operation is arbitrary and capricious due to other states not seeing similar crackdowns. The Trump administration says the crackdown is about fighting fraud, but the lawsuit says immigration enforcement officers have no expertise in fighting fraud in government programmes.

Like I don't think anyone means harm.\" Mr Springer said the largest sighting of monkeys reported was four. \n                  Trump wants a deal but insists US will acquire Greenland 'one way or the other'\n                 \n                  Hundreds more officers heading to Minnesota amid nationwide protests over ICE killing of mother-of-three Renee Good\n                 \n                  Truck drives into crowd at Iran protest in LA\n                 Animal control is working with primate experts from St Louis Zoo to recapture the monkeys. Vervet monkeys are native to sub-Saharan Africa, where they are widespread. The variety typically weighs 7 to 17 pounds (3.18 to 7.71 kg), and they are sometimes called green monkeys because of the tint of their fur.

Residents have been urged to stay away from the monkeys and call for assistance if they see them. The species is described as intelligent and social, but may be unpredictable or aggressive under stress. Sky's US partner network NBC News reported that animal control officers had been walking the streets of St Louis with catch poles ready to seizure any primates they spotted. \"This is the first time we have had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St Louis,\" St Louis's Department of Health environmental health bureau chief Justen Hauser told the network."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Financial markets have taken fright amid a resumption of the row over US central bank independence between its chair and the Trump administration. It emerged overnight that the White House was threatening to indict Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress in relation to renovation cost over-runs at the Federal Reserve buildings in Washington DC. Mr Powell, who has been locked in a feud with Mr Trump over the pace of interest rate cuts since his second term as president began, responded by describing the action as a \"pretext\" to gain more influence over US monetary policy. Money latest: Hidden parking fine loopholes revealed He revealed the threats of criminal charges on Sunday night and described them as a consequence of not following the \"preferences of the president\". The dollar fell widely, and was down a quarter of a cent against the pound, while futures indicated that US stock markets would open sharply lower as investors pondered the implications. The price of safe haven gold also hit a new record high. While US markets fell on the open, the major US stock indexes rose as the trading day wore on. \n                  Paramount Skydance steps up hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery with law suit\n                 \n                  Supermarket launches tiny steak in response to weight loss drugs | Money blog\n                 \n                  Six Nations backer courts investors as it kicks off €2.7bn debt deal\n                 Mr Powell is due to stand down at the end of his second term in May and be replaced by a successor nominated by Mr Trump. However, a Republican on the Senate banking committee that vets nominees, suggested strong opposition to any Department of Justice (DoJ) investigation into Mr Powell, declaring there would be no progress on selecting a new Fed chair until the conclusion of any legal proceedings. Mr Powell said he had been served a subpoena relating to his testimony before the committee in June where he spoke about the Fed's $2.5bn (£1.86bn) renovation of two office buildings - a project that Trump criticised as excessive just weeks ago. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Mr Powell said. He then went further, saying this was about whether monetary policy would be set using \"evidence and economic conditions\" or if it \"will be directed by political pressure or intimidation\". Powell, who was first appointed to the role by Mr Trump and has served under four administrations, said that public service sometimes \"requires standing firm in the face of threats\". Mr Trump has long been seeking cheaper borrowing costs in the US economy through lower central bank interest rates. The pace of Fed rate cuts has been slowed through its worries about trade war-linked inflation but it did impose three cuts last year as the labour market suffered. The DoJ and the White House were yet to comment on Mr Powell's remarks. The action against Mr Powell emerged about two weeks before Mr Trump's effort to fire another Fed official, governor Lisa Cook, will be argued before the Supreme Court. Financial analysts said the Trump-Powell row was adding to wider nerves over the potential for US intervention in Iran in the wake of the operation that led to the capture of Venezuela's president. Some money was taken off the table as futures data showed the tech heavy Nasdaq set to plunge by around 1% at the open. So-called safe haven gold was trading above $4,600 an ounce. US government borrowing costs also rose. Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto, said of the row: \"Tonight's revelations mark a dramatic escalation in the administration's ​effort to kick the legs out from under the Fed, and could unleash a series of unintended consequences that go directly against President Trump's stated aims\". Neil Wilson, investor strategist at Saxo UK, commented: \"This is truly unprecedented. You could call it vindictive by Trump, seeing as Powell is leaving in May anyway. But really this is about Trump making it clear to who comes next as Fed chair and to existing policymakers on the FOMC that the White House will set interest rates. \" It's clear there is a large camp within the administration pushing to end Fed independence.\""

Mike Huckabee told me that Hamas carried full responsibility for the suffering of the people of Gaza and severely criticised nations, including Britain, that had recognised the state of Palestine, saying the decision had been \"very damaging\" and was simply \"grandstanding\".

I hope they do now.\" He said that the fall of the Iranian regime would be celebrated as the end of the \"very harsh rule of the ayatollahs - when they came in, they pretty much destroyed everything. And it's been a hellhole since\", but said that Iran \"was once a magnificent and modern Persian culture\". \"The people are protesting because they can't feed their families.

Inflation is so high that what was once enough to purchase a car can barely buy a loaf of bread.\" Read more from Sky News:Why US attack on Iran could be riskyExplainer: Who is Iran's exiled crown prince?Palestinian embassy in London opens Mr Huckabee said he hoped the fall of the Iranian regime, were it to happen, would also mean the end of Iranian funding for proxy groups in the region, notably Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Mr Huckabee told me that Hamas, in his opinion, bears the entire responsibility for turning Gaza into \"the most miserable place on earth\". He said that talks were still ongoing about who would serve on the \"Board of Peace\" outlined in the Gaza ceasefire agreement. He told me: \"I think we all thought it might have already been announced, but one of the things that I appreciate about the process is it could have been done quickly, but there's a greater desire to do it right than to do it fast. \"There will be a Palestinian technocratic government but it's yet to be named and determined. And that process I know is intense, and it's going on every single day. \"It has to be better than what's been there. It has to be a better outcome for the people that won't be subject to the horrific kind of administration that Hamas has imposed on since they took control in 2007.\" It is only a matter of months since Britain, France and a group of other countries recognised the state of Palestine. The United States did not, and the ambassador told me he remained angry and disappointed about the decision. I asked him why he was so sure that he was right, and that the likes of Britain were wrong. \"It wasn't just me, my government, the United States has been vehemently opposed to this unilateral recognition,\" said Mr Huckabee, claiming it contravened the terms of the Oslo Accords. \"It was, to us, not only ill-timed, it was very damaging and hurtful to the process in Gaza. It was damaging to what we were trying to do and alleviating some of the financial crisis between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. \"I'm not sure to this day what was accomplished by, other than to really mess some things up that didn't need to be messed up, and for some grandstanding to go on between some European leaders that thought that somehow they were going to bring some great resolve, which they did not do.\""

Appearing on Mornings With Ridge And Frost on Sky News, the mayor of London also took the opportunity to swipe at US President Donald Trump, calling him a \"bully\" as a long-running spat between the pair rumbled on. Mr Trump used his address to the UN General Assembly in September to criticise the UK, and London specifically, saying the capital was being run by a \"terrible mayor\" who had \"changed\" the city. But on Monday Sir Sadiq said London was \"more than two-and-a-half times safer than New York, five times safer than LA, 12 times safer than Chicago\".

Sir Sadiq told Sky News: \"He's going to do a great job, I think, in the second-greatest city in the world, and try to make the progress we've made in London.\" Mr Mamdani officially began as mayor shortly after midnight on New Year's Day, and has faced harsh criticism from Mr Trump, who called him a \"communist\" - though a meeting after the mayor's election was unexpectedly friendly. Asked if he has any tips for Mr Mamdani on how to handle the US president, the mayor of London replied: \"He doesn't need advice from me. He's going to be great mayor. \"I've got on really well with all the mayors of New York. It's our nearest competitor and a friend and colleague, as a city.\" But in a clear rebuke to Mr Trump, Sir Sadiq added: \"What I would say to anybody is, whether you're nine years old, whether you're 14 years old, whether you're older. Don't let bullies win.\" A lengthy rivalry There is no love lost between the two men, who have been hurling insults across the Atlantic for the past eight years. It appears Mr Trump took a dislike to the mayor of London after he gave permission for protesters to fly a giant blimp of the president styled as a baby, during his first state visit to the UK. Since then, the pair have traded derogatory remarks, with the president calling Sir Sadiq a \"horrible, vicious, disgusting mayor\" as well as \"incompetent\" and a \"disaster\" in an interview with Politico last month. But the mayor responded by branding Mr Trump as \"racist, sexist, misogynistic\" and \"Islamophobic\", adding that he was \"living rent-free\" in the president's head. During Monday's interview, Sir Sadiq also refused to rule out running to be mayor of London for a fourth term, saying: \"My last election was nearer than my next one, so ask me again in a year's time.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n A hostile takeover bid for media giant Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) has ratcheted up with entertainment conglomerate Paramount taking legal action to force the release of financial data.  Paramount Skydance, which owns film production company Paramount Pictures and TV network CBS, has filed a law suit seeking to compel WBD to disclose to shareholders how it values the bid and a competing offer from Netflix. It has also threatened to nominate directors at WBD's annual meeting in an effort to get board approval for its takeover. Paramount's bid was hostile as it involved a direct approach to WBD's shareholders. The board had already agreed a $82.7bn (£61.4bn) deal with Netflix in early December to sell its TV studios and rights to top franchises, including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. Warner Bros Discovery's board had unanimously recommended shareholders accept Netflix's proposal to buy the streaming portion of WBD's business and reject Paramount Skydance's offer. David Ellison, Paramount Skydance's chairman, chief executive and the son of multibillionaire Larry Ellison, said his company was seeking the release of information on how WBD valued multiple elements of streaming behemoth Netflix's rival takeover attempt, Paramount Skydance's own offer and part of WBD's own valuation. It's customary for such disclosures to be made when a board makes an investment recommendation, an open letter to WBD shareholders read. \n                  Timothee Chalamet and Jessie Buckley big winners at Critics Choice Awards\n                 \n                  The most anticipated films coming to cinemas in 2026\n                 \n                  Obamas planned to see Reiners the night they were killed, says ex-US first lady\n                 The streaming wing of WBD's business was already being spun off into a separate company consisting of entities such as the TV network HBO and its streaming service HBO Max, along with Warner Bros' TV and film production units and comic book filmmakers DC Studios. But Mr Ellison said Paramount Skydance would propose a change to WBD bylaws, necessitating shareholder approval before spinning off the streaming portion, potentially placing hurdles on the sell-off process. Other parts of WBD include the news channel CNN and sports network TNT. What does Paramount Skydance want? The hostile bidder is seeking engagement with the WBD board on its offer, which it believes would be a \"win for both companies\". The Paramount Skydance offer, Mr Ellison said in the letter, is \"simply more\" than Netflix's. \"Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,\" he said. \"We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our 4 December offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.\" The offer has been rejected by Paramount as it said it involved an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" that represented a risk to any deal closing. Why does it matter?  Any merger of WBD and Paramount Skydance or Netflix would be one of the biggest media deals in history, with significant impacts on TV, filmmaking and the possible future of the cinema. Netflix has expressed scepticism over the future of cinema theatres, with the films it produces having short spells in theatres and some being released directly to streaming. The streaming giant owning film production companies could mean fewer or shorter duration theatre runs for films If Paramount Skydance is successful in its takeover attempt, it would own CNN, as well as CBS News, sparking concern about concentrating news services within a small number of companies. WBD's shares have fallen by roughly 2% while Paramount Skydance's rose 0.5%. What does WBD say? Responding to the letter, WBD said, \"Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer. \"Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value,\" a spokesperson added."

Mr Powell, who has been locked in a feud with Mr Trump over the pace of interest rate cuts since his second term as president began, responded by describing the action as a \"pretext\" to gain more influence over US monetary policy. Money latest: Hidden parking fine loopholes revealed He revealed the threats of criminal charges on Sunday night and described them as a consequence of not following the \"preferences of the president\". The dollar fell widely, and was down a quarter of a cent against the pound, while futures indicated that US stock markets would open sharply lower as investors pondered the implications. The price of safe haven gold also hit a new record high. While US markets fell on the open, the major US stock indexes rose as the trading day wore on. \n                  Paramount Skydance steps up hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery with law suit\n                 \n                  Supermarket launches tiny steak in response to weight loss drugs | Money blog\n                 \n                  Six Nations backer courts investors as it kicks off €2.7bn debt deal\n                 Mr Powell is due to stand down at the end of his second term in May and be replaced by a successor nominated by Mr Trump. However, a Republican on the Senate banking committee that vets nominees, suggested strong opposition to any Department of Justice (DoJ) investigation into Mr Powell, declaring there would be no progress on selecting a new Fed chair until the conclusion of any legal proceedings. Mr Powell said he had been served a subpoena relating to his testimony before the committee in June where he spoke about the Fed's $2.5bn (£1.86bn) renovation of two office buildings - a project that Trump criticised as excessive just weeks ago. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Mr Powell said. He then went further, saying this was about whether monetary policy would be set using \"evidence and economic conditions\" or if it \"will be directed by political pressure or intimidation\". Powell, who was first appointed to the role by Mr Trump and has served under four administrations, said that public service sometimes \"requires standing firm in the face of threats\". Mr Trump has long been seeking cheaper borrowing costs in the US economy through lower central bank interest rates. The pace of Fed rate cuts has been slowed through its worries about trade war-linked inflation but it did impose three cuts last year as the labour market suffered. The DoJ and the White House were yet to comment on Mr Powell's remarks. The action against Mr Powell emerged about two weeks before Mr Trump's effort to fire another Fed official, governor Lisa Cook, will be argued before the Supreme Court. Financial analysts said the Trump-Powell row was adding to wider nerves over the potential for US intervention in Iran in the wake of the operation that led to the capture of Venezuela's president. Some money was taken off the table as futures data showed the tech heavy Nasdaq set to plunge by around 1% at the open. So-called safe haven gold was trading above $4,600 an ounce. US government borrowing costs also rose. Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto, said of the row: \"Tonight's revelations mark a dramatic escalation in the administration's ​effort to kick the legs out from under the Fed, and could unleash a series of unintended consequences that go directly against President Trump's stated aims\". Neil Wilson, investor strategist at Saxo UK, commented: \"This is truly unprecedented. You could call it vindictive by Trump, seeing as Powell is leaving in May anyway. But really this is about Trump making it clear to who comes next as Fed chair and to existing policymakers on the FOMC that the White House will set interest rates. \" It's clear there is a large camp within the administration pushing to end Fed independence.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The investment vehicle set up to house a string of prominent sports assets is launching a €2.7bn (£2.3bn) debt-raising process aimed at funding its ambitions to become a global powerhouse. Sky News has learnt that Global Sport Group (GSG), which is owned by CVC Capital Partners and counts a stake in Six Nations Rugby among its holdings, kicked off formal talks with investors on Monday. The debt deal would provide significant firepower for CVC to acquire other sports properties around the world as it seeks to assemble the globe's most compelling portfolio of sports-related assets. Money latest: Hidden parking fine loopholes revealed Sources said the debt-raising process, which is being overseen by Goldman Sachs, was being run in parallel with a wider set of discussions involving potential providers of equity capital to GSG. These latter conversations include blue-chip investors such as Ares Management and Bain Capital, according to sources. Among the debt funders with which CVC is engaged are HPS, the global private credit giant which is a subsidiary of Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager. \n                  Paramount Skydance steps up hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery with law suit\n                 \n                  Trump administration threatens criminal charges against Fed chair\n                 \n                  Supermarket launches tiny steak in response to weight loss drugs | Money blog\n                 GSG also owns interests in the women's professional tennis tour, Premiership Rugby, the top flights of French and Spanish football, and international volleyball. Its new war chest is aimed at acquiring a series of other assets in sports with substantial commercial growth prospects. GSG is chaired by Marc Allera, the former BT Group consumer boss. The only one of CVC's sports assets which does not sit inside GSG is a stake in an Indian Premier League cricket franchise. Alongside Goldman, PJT Partners and Raine Group are advising on the GSG refinancing. Once completed, the deal is will enable CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in GSG or a future initial public offering on a major international exchange. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. In rugby union, its acquisition of a stake in Premiership Rugby's commercial rights was hit by the pandemic and the subsequent financial pressures on clubs which saw a number of the league's teams forced into insolvency. CVC, which bought into Premiership Rugby in 2019, owns a 27% stake in the league. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the GSG approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC being linked to a bid for one of the new European NBA basketball franchises which will be sold in the coming months. Formal talks between the NBA and investors will get under way in the coming days. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. CVC declined to comment."

Sky News has learnt that Mr Dimon has agreed to introduce the chancellor at a roundtable gathering in Davos, Switzerland, next Thursday, which will be attended by the bosses of some of the world's biggest multinational companies.

The admission by Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton - confirming a report by Sky News from almost two years ago - came despite mounting warnings about the threat of conflict with Russia and as Donald Trump makes hostile noises about seizing Greenland. Answering wide-ranging questions from MPs on Monday, the chief of the defence staff also confirmed that the Ministry of Defence lacks funding to cover its equipment programme as well as additional ambitions set out in a sweeping review of defence published in June. He refused to say whether he was facing a budget shortfall and steered away from using the word \"cuts\", but said that reducing or slowing military programmes were among the options being considered. Air Chief Marshal Knighton, at times sounding frustrated, told members of the defence select committee not to \"put words in my mouth\" as he was pressed on reports that he had warned the prime minister before Christmas that defence has a £28bn hole in its budget over the next four years and would be required to make significant cuts without more money. He said: \"If we wanted to do everything that's currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [Strategic Defence Review], could we do that with the budget that we've got? The answer is no.\" No modern-day War Book The most stunning revelation during a two-hour grilling was his confirmation that the UK has yet to revive a modern version of the Government War Book. Drawn up during the First World War and maintained until the turn of the century, this was a comprehensive set of plans for the whole country - from the armed forces, hospitals and the police to industry schools and even art galleries - to transition from peace to war. It was shelved after the Soviet Union collapsed - as discussed in The Wargame podcast. 👉Search for The Wargame on your podcast app👈 But, despite the return of conflict to Europe following Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and then its full-scale attack in 2022, the UK has yet to draw up a new defence plan - something all NATO member states are required to maintain. The transatlantic alliance is the cornerstone of UK defence and security policy - with allies willing to mobilise in the defence of each other. But each nation is also meant to be able to defend itself in the first instance. \"We don't have a complete national defence plan yet,\" Air Chief Marshal Knighton said. Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat member of the defence select committee, asked him if we should have one. He responded: \"Yeah, absolutely. And the government is committed to doing that.\" Why does the UK not have a plan? Pushed on why the UK does not have one, the defence chief said: \"I think that it is a manifestation of the peace dividend. \"One of the most obvious is that since the end of the Cold War, we have not prioritised those matters. And so as a consequence, the government, for many years, of many hues, has not focused its efforts on developing that kind of plan. \"I'm pleased to say that partly as a consequence of what's in the Strategic Defence Review, that is changing.\" As for when such a national defence plan would be ready, Air Chief Marshal Knighton said this was a job that was being overseen by the Cabinet Office because it involves the whole of government. However, he said that the military component - which the Ministry of Defence is responsible for - would be finalised this year.

        "Content": "A record number of illegal worker arrests and raids have been carried out by the Home Office in the past 18 months. The number of raids has increased by 77% since July 2024, when Labour came to power, which has led to an 83% rise in arrests, according to government figures. More than 17,400 raids were carried out by the Home Office's immigration enforcement teams on businesses such as nail bars, car washes, barbers and takeaway shops. This led to more than 12,300 arrests of those attempting to undercut workers and \"hide in plain sight\", the government said. The Home Office said it was the highest number of arrests and raids of illegal workers and those enabling illegal working since records began in 2019. Ministers believe the crackdown will help reduce the pull factors encouraging people to enter the UK illegally and trying to claim asylum. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"There is no place for illegal working in our communities. \n                  Asylum hotel migrant evictions set to begin in the spring\n                 \n                  Migrant small boat Channel crossings in 2025 are second highest ever\n                 \n                  Hundreds of foreign prison staff 'offered emergency extension to visa' to stop the prison system collapsing\n                 \"That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide. \"I will stop at nothing to restore order and control to our borders.\" London, the West Midlands and the South West have seen the highest number of illegal working arrests. More than 2,100 arrests were made in London last year, a 47% rise compared with 2024. The West Midlands and the South West both had more than 1,100 arrests - a 76% and a 91% rise respectively. Of the total arrests, 1,726 people have been returned to the countries they came from, up 35% on the 1,283 removed from visits in the previous 18-month period.

On 16 December, 30 Indian and Albanian men were arrested at a construction site in Swindon, Wiltshire. Nearly all them were detained for removal. The record-breaking enforcement action comes just over two months after Ms Mahmood said her department was \"not yet fit for purpose\". She said a crackdown on tackling migrants working illegally in the UK was \"starting to work\" but criticised enforcement of illegal working rules under the previous Conservative government. Immigration enforcement was given £5m to arrest, detain and remove migrants working illegally, and officers have been wearing body-worn cameras since September to help publicise arrests and prosecutions. Tighter right-to-work checks have also been introduced so casual, temporary or subcontracted workers are forced to prove their status."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Your Party has been hit by a new split as Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana fight for control of its executive committee.  At the founding conference in November, members voted for a collective leadership model, meaning the party will be controlled by a Central Executive Committee (CEC) rather than a single MP. Politics Live: Former Tory chancellor Nadhim Zahawi defects to Reform UK This avoided a potentially bruising battle for the top job between Mr Corbyn and Ms Sultana, who co-founded the new left-wing party in July but have since had several public disagreements. However, the two figureheads are now backing a different set of candidates to fill the CEC, which will have 24 positions, in what insiders are describing as a \"proxy war\". Sources with knowledge of the lists describe it as a clash of both personalities and vision for what the newborn party should look like. Many involved in Your Party believe it should be more radical than Corbynism so it has a distinctive offer from the Greens - but others fear voters will be put off by a party perceived as the \"hard left\" and a broad appeal is needed. \n                  Your Party: Old infighting habits die hard at new left-wing party's acrimonious Liverpool conference\n                 \n                  Your Party founder Zarah Sultana hits out at party 'witch hunts' and 'bullying'\n                 \n                  Jeremy Corbyn declines to call Zarah Sultana a friend as Your Party holds first conference\n                 The list endorsed by Ms Sultana has called itself the \"Grassroots Left\" slate and includes both her and Mr Corbyn. However, the former Labour leader is understood to be upset about this as he had asked for his name to be taken off this slate. He feels the inclusion of his name gives the impression that this is a unity list that he was involved with and endorses. Instead he is planning to set out his own vision for Your Party in the coming days, sources close to him told Sky News. This will include backing a different candidate list made up of himself, community organisers, trade unionists and anti-racist activists to \"reflect a broad left politics\", according to those with knowledge of the list. A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said: \"Jeremy will be laying out his vision for Your Party in the coming days, including his ambition to help build a diverse and broad-based movement for the change this country needs.\" Economic divide  A big dividing point is on the economy. Mr Corbyn's longstanding economic position has been to nationalise public utilities and reverse cuts to public services. The Grassroots Left slate goes further in calling for the end of private ownership of all means of production - so that workers \"own the economy democratically, not the state\", a source involved in the slate said. Those endorsing this position feel Your Party needs to distance itself from the Greens and provide a \"meaningful opposition to capitalist parties\" - which they feel Mr Corbyn didn't achieve as Labour leader as the party was \"too focused\" on elections and polling. They characterised this position as being \"to the left of the left\" as opposed to the \"hard left\". Some members have accused the Grassroots Left group of using Mr Corbyn's name to boost support for their vision, which they fear will not have the broad appeal required to achieve Your Party's aims of a mass socialist movement. However the Grassroots Left source said they endorsed Mr Corbyn as \"recognition of his years of work for the British left\". \"The last thing we want is to divide the party, we want to create something that can bring us together instead of tearing us apart,\" they said. 'A left alternative to Labour' At least two other candidates endorsed by the group haven't officially signed up to its programme - as permission is not required to back someone for the leadership. This includes independent Lancashire councillor Michael Lavealette, who said he was throwing his hat in the ring but was not formally part of any slate. He told Sky News there is a \"very large\" group people who are looking for a left alternative to Labour and while they have \"all manner of views\" what unites them is investment in welfare, an end to the cost of living crisis and inequality and \"peace and against war\". He said these should be the \"starting points to build a broad left that unites people and challenges Labour\". Other figures on the Grassroots Left slate include Max Shanly, who was Deputy Director of Operations for Corbyn's leadership campaign in 2016. The slate says it is being backed by a \"broad coalition of socialist groups, grassroots organisations and prominent left-wing figures\", and that its aim is to \"shift power away from MPs and party insiders and put it back in the hands of members\". This follows criticism that \"faceless bureaucrats\" close to Mr Corbyn from his time as Labour leader had too much control over the setting up of Your Party. Ms Sultana said: \"Members didn't join to be spectators while decisions are stitched up at the top. This slate is about taking back control and building a party that fights for working people.\" There have been long-lasting tensions within Your Party after Ms Sultana launched an unauthorised membership portal in September. On Friday she called for unity, after The Information Commissioner's Office said that it was not taking further action. Any Your Party member can nominate themselves for the CEC, not just those who end up on the slates. The nominations deadline is this Friday, followed by an endorsement period, with a final vote happening at the end of February. It will ultimately be up to the party's 50,000 members to decide - and it could be that no overall vision wins, with a mix of candidates ending up on the CEC. Once the CEC is formed, members will decide internally who should have the senior leadership positions - which will not be open to members of parliament."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n \"He's a serious f****r\", was the unvarnished view of one Reform figure about the party's latest high-profile recruit. Most definitely meant as a compliment, the theory here is that Nadhim Zahawi will bring competence and credibility and strengthen the appeal of the fledgling political outfit with donors. He certainly offers experience, as well as a backstory more engaging than most in the Reform flock. Politics latest - watch live The Iraqi refugee who arrived in the UK unable to speak English and rose to become a multimillionaire businessman and eventually chancellor. But perhaps Mr Zahawi's proudest political period was as vaccines minister, overseeing the wildly successful rollout of COVID jabs during the pandemic. So his is now an odd choice of party, perhaps, given dalliances Reform has had with vaccine scepticism as well as outright vaccine conspiracy theories. \n                  Former chancellor Zahawi joins diagnostics group Ador\n                 \n                  Zahawi approaches former Tory treasurer Mansour to fund Telegraph bid\n                 \n                  Former PM Johnson sounded out about Telegraph role\n                 Repeated questions about this apparent mismatch at his inaugural press conference were met with frosty replies - with Mr Zahawi berating journalists for asking \"really stupid\" questions. That's not to say he has a spotless track-record, though. In 2013, he was forced to apologise for claiming taxpayer expenses to supply electricity to his stables. Five years later, he was reprimanded for attending the controversial men-only 'President's Club' gala. He was elevated to chancellor in 2022, but days after walking through the Treasury door, appeared to turn on then prime minister Boris Johnson by telling him to resign. Then the final nail in his frontline political career - his sacking as Tory chairman over unpaid tax. So given all that, why would an anti-establishment party like Reform embrace someone who - all the evidence suggests - is a fully signed up member of said establishment? Part of the answer to that is the connections and experience. But another is the potential for the party's image to be softened in the eyes of more centrist voters who worry about some of Reform's harder edges. Yes, there is a risk of looking like a 'home for retired Tories' as faces of yesteryear continue to sign up en masse. But as one Reform figure points out, \"the Tory party of ten, fifteen years ago is a damn sight better than the Tory party of now\". So if that's the appeal for Reform, what's in it for their latest signing? The co-founder of the polling giant YouGov, Nadhim Zahawi is a rich man in his own right with business interests and connections around the world. Aged 58, why not just go quietly into the sunset? According to those who know him, that's just not Nadhim Zahawi. They paint a picture of a man driven by a desire for attention, yes, but also by a hunger to be accepted into the upper echelons of the country he has made his home. \"He can't exist without the attention and without wanting to be taken seriously,\" one person said. It's that desire that's got this former minister into hot water in the past. But it's clear it wasn't something he could switch off - or wanted to switch off - when he departed the Commons. So with Reform leading in the polls, and the Conservatives still flagging, this ever-ambitious politician believes he's spied one more route back to the top."

The prime minister told his MPs the actions of Grok and X are \"absolutely disgusting and shameful\". \"If X cannot control Grok, we will - and we'll do it fast because if you profit from harm and abuse, you lose the right to self regulate,\" he told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Images are being generated by Grok, X's AI tool, that sexualise women and children, manipulating photos of people to remove their clothes or make them pose in suggestive ways. Grok's image creation function has been switched off for all but paying subscribers after a global outcry, but some non-paying users have reported still being able to generate sexualised images of women and children. Sir Keir added on Monday evening: \"Protecting their abusive users, rather than the women and children who are being abused shows a total distortion of priorities. \"So let me be crystal clear, we won't stand for it, because no matter how unstable or complex the world becomes, this government will be guided by its values.

Over the weekend, Mr Musk said the UK government \"wants any excuse for censorship\" after Sir Keir said X needed \"to get a grip\" of Grok and Downing Street described the limitation to paid users as \"insulting\". Just hours before Sir Keir's latest threat, technology secretary Liz Kendall announced she was speeding up laws to make creating non-consensual intimate images with AI a criminal offence.

She also announced that the Crime and Policing Bill, which is going through parliament, will make it a criminal offence for companies to supply tools designed to create non-consensual internet images. On Monday morning, media watchdog Ofcom launched a formal investigation into Grok, which will look into whether X has \"failed to comply with its legal obligations under the Online Safety Act\". The regulator said: \"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people - which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography - and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material.\""

Appearing on Mornings With Ridge And Frost on Sky News, the mayor of London also took the opportunity to swipe at US President Donald Trump, calling him a \"bully\" as a long-running spat between the pair rumbled on. Mr Trump used his address to the UN General Assembly in September to criticise the UK, and London specifically, saying the capital was being run by a \"terrible mayor\" who had \"changed\" the city. But on Monday Sir Sadiq said London was \"more than two-and-a-half times safer than New York, five times safer than LA, 12 times safer than Chicago\".

Sir Sadiq told Sky News: \"He's going to do a great job, I think, in the second-greatest city in the world, and try to make the progress we've made in London.\" Mr Mamdani officially began as mayor shortly after midnight on New Year's Day, and has faced harsh criticism from Mr Trump, who called him a \"communist\" - though a meeting after the mayor's election was unexpectedly friendly. Asked if he has any tips for Mr Mamdani on how to handle the US president, the mayor of London replied: \"He doesn't need advice from me. He's going to be great mayor. \"I've got on really well with all the mayors of New York. It's our nearest competitor and a friend and colleague, as a city.\" But in a clear rebuke to Mr Trump, Sir Sadiq added: \"What I would say to anybody is, whether you're nine years old, whether you're 14 years old, whether you're older. Don't let bullies win.\" A lengthy rivalry There is no love lost between the two men, who have been hurling insults across the Atlantic for the past eight years. It appears Mr Trump took a dislike to the mayor of London after he gave permission for protesters to fly a giant blimp of the president styled as a baby, during his first state visit to the UK. Since then, the pair have traded derogatory remarks, with the president calling Sir Sadiq a \"horrible, vicious, disgusting mayor\" as well as \"incompetent\" and a \"disaster\" in an interview with Politico last month. But the mayor responded by branding Mr Trump as \"racist, sexist, misogynistic\" and \"Islamophobic\", adding that he was \"living rent-free\" in the president's head. During Monday's interview, Sir Sadiq also refused to rule out running to be mayor of London for a fourth term, saying: \"My last election was nearer than my next one, so ask me again in a year's time.\""

        "Content": "Former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has become the latest - and most senior - Tory to defect to Reform UK. The ex-MP and vaccines minister during the COVID pandemic said the UK was \"drinking at the last chance saloon\" and \"really does need Nigel Farage as prime minister\". Having served under the four latest Conservative prime ministers, including as chancellor for two months under Boris Johnson, he is the most senior former Tory MP to join Reform. He is also the 20th ex-Conservative MP to defect since March 2024. Politics latest: Ofcom launches investigation into X's Grok Announcing his move at a news conference on Monday, alongside Reform leader Mr Farage, the Iraqi refugee said he switched because the Conservative Party is a \"defunct brand\" that could no longer form the next government. A Conservative source told Sky News that Mr Zahawi, who stood down as an MP in 2024, had asked the Tories for a peerage several times, including in the last few months ahead of the most recent political peerages list. \n                  Politics latest: Non-consensual intimate images law to come into force this week amid row over Elon Musk's Grok\n                 \n                  Sky News questions Nadhim Zahawi on his defection to Reform UK\n                 \n                  UK has no plan for defending nation in event of war, military chief reveals\n                 However, he was told this was \"never going to happen\" as he was sacked as Tory party chairman by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak in 2023 for failing to declare he was being investigated by HMRC over his tax affairs. Mr Zahawi told Sky News that was \"not true\" and he has a message \"from the top\" about wanting to give him a peerage and that Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and her team would contact him in 2026. He said Ms Badenoch and her team \"came for help and advice\" and asked him to meet her husband, Hamish Badenoch, twice because he said he is \"taking charge at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters)\". The businessman insisted he had been given \"no promises at all\" about what role he would have in Reform - but did not rule out becoming a Reform MP or peer. Read more:Who is Nadhim Zahawi? Former child refugee to top Tory to Reform defector Mr Farage said Mr Zahawi's move helped to dispel suggestions that Reform UK is a \"one-man band\". Asked about the HMRC investigation, which ended with Mr Zahawi paying a nearly £5m penalty, Mr Farage said: \"There's nobody with a complex business empire that does not have to have negotiations at some point with HMRC. \"That is how the world works, and I'd much rather have Nadhim who has been through that experience and come out the other end. \"He could have just gone abroad. He could have just disappeared for a few years, not paid any tax, which by the way, increasingly is what people are doing.\" Anti-Farage tweets Mr Zahawi's defection may come as a surprise to some, given his previous comments about Reform and Mr Farage. He previously ruled out joining Reform, saying: \"No chance. Been a Conservative all my life and will die a Conservative.\" The businessman, in a tweet deleted on Monday, also called comments by Mr Farage in 2015 \"offensive and racist\" and said he would be \"frightened\" to live in a country run by him after the then-UKIP leader said it was \"ludicrous\" that employers could not choose British workers over Polish ones. In 2022, Mr Farage said Mr Zahawi's promotion to chancellor showed \"all he's interested in is climbing that greasy pole\". Mr Zahawi denied his move was about his career or that he thought Mr Farage was racist. \"If I thought this man sitting next to me in any way had an issue with people of my colour or my background who have come to this country, who have integrated, assimilated, are proud of this country, worked hard in this country, paid millions of pounds in taxes in this country, invested in the country, I wouldn't be sitting next to him,\" he said, with Mr Farage beside him. Anti-vaccine questions The former COVID vaccines minister also batted away questions about Aseem Malhotra, an adviser to US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who linked COVID vaccines to cancer in the Royal Family during Reform's conference last year. Mr Farage brushed it off as providing a platform for free speech. Mr Malhotra's claims were condemned by leading viral immunologist Professor Brian Ferguson, from Cambridge University, who said: \"There is no credible evidence that these vaccines disrupt tumour suppressors or drive any kind of process that results in cancer.\" The Conservatives said Mr Zahawi's move is the latest in a number of \"has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\". Other parties hit out A Conservative spokesman added: \"Their latest recruit used to say he'd be 'frightened to live in a country' run by Nigel Farage, which shows the level of loyalty for sale. \"Reform want higher welfare spending and higher taxes. They are a one-man band with no plan for our country.\" The Liberal Democrat MP for Mr Zahawi's old seat of Stratford-upon-Avon, Manuela Perteghella, said: \"Reform is becoming a retirement home for disgraced former Conservative ministers.\" Before Monday, sitting MP Danny Kruger, who was a Tory shadow cabinet member at the time, was the most senior Tory to have defected to Reform. Labour Party chair Anna Turley said Reform has \"no shame\" as Mr Zahawi is a \"discredited and disgraced politician who will be forever tied to the Tories' shameful record of failure in government\"."

Independent news agencies say ship tracking data shows no Chinese or Russian presence near the territory, although experts say that Russian submarines are likely to be operating in the area. The US president acknowledged a Greenland takeover by the US would compromise the NATO alliance but insisted the possible acquisition of the island would serve US interests. \"If it affects NATO, it affects NATO. But they need us much more than we need them. I will tell you that right now,\" Mr Trump said. Read more from Sky News:Woman shot dead in head in IranDissent in China rising dramatically NATO member countries are discussing the next steps on how to collectively keep the Arctic safe, alliance chief Mark Rutte said on Monday. \"We are working ‌on the next ‍steps to make sure that indeed, we collectively protect what is at stake here,\" Mr Rutte ⁠said while visiting Zagreb, Croatia. \"All allies agree on the importance of ​the Arctic and Arctic security,\" he added. \"With sea lanes opening up, there is a risk ‍that the Russians and the Chinese will be more active.\" He said talks on Arctic security started last year and member countries were now looking at \"how ‌to make sure that we give practical follow up on those discussions\". The UK is reportedly in discussions with other NATO countries to send British troops to Greenland to deter \"Russian aggression\". On Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer told Mr Trump in a call that \"more could be done to protect\" the Arctic region and agreed with the president on the \"need to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia in the High North\". Asked on the Trevor Phillips On Sunday show yesterday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander did not rule out that UK forces could be stationed in the territory. She said: \"You would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle. And whilst it hasn't had the devastating consequences that we have seen in Ukraine, they are becoming increasingly active in the region, Russia. \"That's why we signed the defence agreement with Norway in December, which is going to lead to us jointly operating a fleet of Type 26 anti-submarine warfare frigates there, to hunt down Russian submarines, and to make sure that we can protect our critical infrastructure under the sea. \"It's why we have agreed to do more joint training at the Royal Marines with Norway and why we have agreed to, pre-deploy, some of our equipment to Norway, so that we can act quickly if necessary. And of course... we're a leading member in the Joint Expeditionary Force, which is a coalition of ten likeminded nations who see defence and deterrence in the Arctic Circle.\" Germany has also confirmed talks are under way in NATO to bolster security in the Arctic. Responding to Mr Trump's claims that the US needed to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future, Beijing said the United States should not use other countries as an excuse to advance its own strategic interests. China in 2018 declared itself a \"near-Arctic state\" in a bid to acquire more influence in the region. Beijing has also said it wants to develop a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"The Arctic ‌concerns the overall interests of the international ​community,\" adding that China's activities in the Arctic aim to promote stability and ⁠sustainable development in the ‌region. Ms Mao also said that all countries' rights and freedoms to operate lawfully in the Arctic should be respected. US secretary of state Marco Rubio will hold talks with Denmark about the Greenland issue next week. White House officials have floated the idea of purchasing the territory instead of taking it by force, and Reuters reported on Thursday that they are exploring the possibility of offering payments directly to Greenlanders to encourage them to break away from Denmark and possibly align with the United States. Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, is defended by Denmark. Denmark's military, however, is significantly smaller than that of the United States."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has threatened to \"control\" X's AI chatbot Grok if Elon Musk's social media platform continues to create sexual images of women and children. The prime minister told his MPs the actions of Grok and X are \"absolutely disgusting and shameful\". \"If X cannot control Grok, we will - and we'll do it fast because if you profit from harm and abuse, you lose the right to self regulate,\" he told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Images are being generated by Grok, X's AI tool, that sexualise women and children, manipulating photos of people to remove their clothes or make them pose in suggestive ways. Grok's image creation function has been switched off for all but paying subscribers after a global outcry, but some non-paying users have reported still being able to generate sexualised images of women and children. Sir Keir added on Monday evening: \"Protecting their abusive users, rather than the women and children who are being abused shows a total distortion of priorities. \"So let me be crystal clear, we won't stand for it, because no matter how unstable or complex the world becomes, this government will be guided by its values.

Over the weekend, Mr Musk said the UK government \"wants any excuse for censorship\" after Sir Keir said X needed \"to get a grip\" of Grok and Downing Street described the limitation to paid users as \"insulting\". Just hours before Sir Keir's latest threat, technology secretary Liz Kendall announced she was speeding up laws to make creating non-consensual intimate images with AI a criminal offence. Requesting the creation of the images will also be illegal from this week, she said.

She also announced that the Crime and Policing Bill, which is going through parliament, will make it a criminal offence for companies to supply tools designed to create non-consensual internet images. On Monday morning, media watchdog Ofcom launched a formal investigation into Grok, which will look into whether X has \"failed to comply with its legal obligations under the Online Safety Act\". The regulator said: \"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people - which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography - and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n A hostile takeover bid for media giant Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) has ratcheted up with entertainment conglomerate Paramount taking legal action to force the release of financial data.  Paramount Skydance, which owns film production company Paramount Pictures and TV network CBS, has filed a law suit seeking to compel WBD to disclose to shareholders how it values the bid and a competing offer from Netflix. It has also threatened to nominate directors at WBD's annual meeting in an effort to get board approval for its takeover. Paramount's bid was hostile as it involved a direct approach to WBD's shareholders. The board had already agreed a $82.7bn (£61.4bn) deal with Netflix in early December to sell its TV studios and rights to top franchises, including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. Warner Bros Discovery's board had unanimously recommended shareholders accept Netflix's proposal to buy the streaming portion of WBD's business and reject Paramount Skydance's offer. David Ellison, Paramount Skydance's chairman, chief executive and the son of multibillionaire Larry Ellison, said his company was seeking the release of information on how WBD valued multiple elements of streaming behemoth Netflix's rival takeover attempt, Paramount Skydance's own offer and part of WBD's own valuation. It's customary for such disclosures to be made when a board makes an investment recommendation, an open letter to WBD shareholders read. \n                  Timothee Chalamet and Jessie Buckley big winners at Critics Choice Awards\n                 \n                  The most anticipated films coming to cinemas in 2026\n                 \n                  Obamas planned to see Reiners the night they were killed, says ex-US first lady\n                 The streaming wing of WBD's business was already being spun off into a separate company consisting of entities such as the TV network HBO and its streaming service HBO Max, along with Warner Bros' TV and film production units and comic book filmmakers DC Studios. But Mr Ellison said Paramount Skydance would propose a change to WBD bylaws, necessitating shareholder approval before spinning off the streaming portion, potentially placing hurdles on the sell-off process. Other parts of WBD include the news channel CNN and sports network TNT. What does Paramount Skydance want? The hostile bidder is seeking engagement with the WBD board on its offer, which it believes would be a \"win for both companies\". The Paramount Skydance offer, Mr Ellison said in the letter, is \"simply more\" than Netflix's. \"Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,\" he said. \"We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our 4 December offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.\" The offer has been rejected by Paramount as it said it involved an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" that represented a risk to any deal closing. Why does it matter?  Any merger of WBD and Paramount Skydance or Netflix would be one of the biggest media deals in history, with significant impacts on TV, filmmaking and the possible future of the cinema. Netflix has expressed scepticism over the future of cinema theatres, with the films it produces having short spells in theatres and some being released directly to streaming. The streaming giant owning film production companies could mean fewer or shorter duration theatre runs for films If Paramount Skydance is successful in its takeover attempt, it would own CNN, as well as CBS News, sparking concern about concentrating news services within a small number of companies. WBD's shares have fallen by roughly 2% while Paramount Skydance's rose 0.5%. What does WBD say? Responding to the letter, WBD said, \"Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer. \"Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value,\" a spokesperson added."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n One Battle After Another and Hamnet have proved the two big movie winners at this year's Golden Globes, with the dark comedy and historical fiction claiming the ceremony's top two film awards. One Battle After Another, about a group of washed-up revolutionaries, took four gongs - including best motion picture comedy/musical, best director for Paul Thomas Anderson and best supporting actress for Teyana Taylor. However, its lead star, Leonardo DiCaprio failed to bag best actor - one of the most competitive categories of the night - with the prize instead going to Timothee Chalamet. Along with the top prize for dramatic film, Hamnet saw Irish star Jessie Buckley take best actress in a motion picture/drama.  Her powerful performance as Shakespeare's wife was at the heart of the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's book about the death of Shakespeare's son, which historians believe inspired the playwright to write Hamlet. Accepting her prize, Buckley praised the international nature of the movie, directed by Oscar-winner Chloe Zhao, saying: \"This was such an extraordinary set to be part of, telling the story of probably the most famous Brit ‍who ever lived and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish and a mostly Polish crew.\" \n                  Golden Globes 2026: The full list of winners\n                 \n                  Golden Globes fashion: Stars shun colour on the red carpet\n                 \n                  Golden Globes latest: One Battle After Another and Adolescence are the big winners - with acting prizes for Timothee Chalamet and Jessie Buckley\n                 Meanwhile, in the TV categories, Adolescence cleaned up winning in all four of its categories. The drama, starring Stephen Graham, depicts the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, as a 13-year-old boy from her school is arrested for her murder. It was one of the most talked-about shows of last year. In addition to winning the best limited series, anthology series, or television motion picture, three of its stars also took home an award. Stephen Graham was named best actor in a TV miniseries, 16-year-old Owen Cooper was named best supporting actor and Erin Doherty was named best supporting actress. Only Ashley Walters missed out, to co-star Cooper, with the pair going head-to-head in the same supporting category. Speaking on stage, co-creator Jack Thorne told the audience: \"Removing hate is our generation's responsibility. \"It requires thought from the top down. The possibility seems remote now, but hope is a beautiful thing.\" Insisting the show was not about \"being frightened of young people\", he said it instead offered a positive message, saying the drama's young cast were \"proof the world can be better\". In her speech, Doherty who played a therapist in the show, dedicated her award to those pursuing the challenging career, saying: \"Life can be tough, mental health is everything.\" Making history as the category's youngest winner, Cooper admitted he \"took a risk\" being the only boy in his drama classes, adding: \"it was embarrassing, but I got through it.\" He concluded his acceptance speech with incredulity at his win, looking to the audience and saying: \"It's mad, what is going on!\" Graham, who appeared to read his notes from his hand, thanked his family and friends, and was briefly distracted by rapper Queen Latifah in the audience. Other actors who saw big wins included Chalamet, who won his first Golden Globe. The 30-year-old touched on the fact he had left the Globes in previous years without a win, saying: \"I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments made this moment that ‍much sweeter.\" He also thanked his parents and his girlfriend of three years, Kylie Jenner, saying: \"I love you, thank you so much.\" Rose Byrne was named best actress in a musical/comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. Accompanied to the awards by her brother, she told the audience her husband, actor Bobby Canavale had not come with her as he was out buying a bearded dragon. In one of the most unexpected wins of the night, Narcos star Wagner Moura won the award for best actor in a drama for The Secret Agent. The film was also named best non-English language film. Collecting the prize, the Brazilian star said: \"The Secret Agent is a film about memory, or the lack of memory and generational trauma. I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. \"So, this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.\" Stellan Skarsgard earned a Globe for his supporting role in Norwegian family drama Sentimental Value, admitting as he took his gong: \"I was not prepared for this because, of course, I thought I was too old.\" The Swedish star is 74. Vampire horror Sinners, directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B Jordan, took best cinematic and box office achievement, a rare film that earned both critical and commercial success. It also took best original score. Thanking the audience \"for showing up\", Coogler said parts of making the movie were \"a grind\", calling for them to wear \"performance fishing gear in the swamps\". He added: \"We didn't know people would show up, so we just want to say thank you.\" Potential snubs on the night included Guillermo del Toro's gothic horror Frankenstein, the second installment of the Wizard Of Oz prequel Wicked: For Good and Yorgos Lanthimos's Bugonia starring Emma Stone. All went home empty handed. KPop Demon Hunters - Netflix's most-watched film ever - was named best animated film, while the movie's signature track Golden won the best original song prize. Accepting the award, Korean-American singer Ejae said: \"It's never too late to shine like you were born to.\" Hosted by US comedian Nikki Glaser for a second-year running, celebrities largely steered ​clear of political topics, with a few wearing \"Be Good\" badges on their black-tie attire to honour Renee Good, the woman fatally shot by an immigration officer last week in Minneapolis. Glaser took a few light-hearted jabs, joking that the ceremony was \"without a doubt the most important thing that's happening in the world right now\". She also took the odd pot shot at some of the stars in the room, including DiCaprio for his dating of younger women, before apologising, for the \"cheap\" remark, and adding: \"We don't know anything else about you, man.\" A gentle nod back to the days of Gervais eviscerating attendees in the Globes heyday, with Gervais now coming full circle and winning best TV stand-up comedy performance for his special Morality. Gervais did not attend the event, with Wanda Sykes instead accepting his award for him and thanking \"God and the trans community\". Gervais, a self-confessed atheist, has defended remarks he made in a previous show about transgender people in his comedy. Presenting best motion picture musical or comedy, which was one of the final awards of the night, after failing to win in her own category, Julia Roberts received a huge standing ovation, thanking the audience and telling them: \"I'm gonna be impossible for at least a week.\" Taking to the stage a few moments later to award best motion picture - drama, Roberts's friend and many-time co-star George Clooney pretended to be irked that there was no standing ovation for him. With the Globes kicking off awards season proper, Oscar nomination voting kicks off today, ahead of the ceremony in March. The next big awards show to look forward to is the BAFTA film awards on 22 February."

With both film and television stars recognised, it's a starry night on the Globes red carpet, with fashion at the fore. In a year when the majority of the stars shunned colour, gold, metallics and muted tones were in vogue - with black proving the point that it never goes out of fashion. Here's a look at some of the best looks of the night. Metallics and sheer From cheeky cutaway and sheer gowns, to gold and silver tassels and a giant golden shawl, old Hollywood glamour was plentiful on the red carpet. Black and white Monochrome was flavour of the month, with the majority opting for sombre black in satin or velvet. Just a touch of colour Keeping it pale, interesting and classy - some stars opted for gentle pastel hues. Risk takers While muted tones might have been the theme of the night, the few who opted for bright and unconventional outfits won a place in our hearts. Sartorial bravery we salute you!"
