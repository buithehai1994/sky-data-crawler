        "Content": " US officials have confirmed the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been arrested and identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Utah governor Spencer Cox started a news conference with the phrase \"we got him\", adding that a member of Robinson's family alerted authorities. It has been widely reported that Robinson's father had turned him in. The details broadly match information released by US President Donald Trump earlier on Fox News. Explainer: All we know about the suspect  Mr Kirk, 31, a Trump supporter and right-wing influencer, was fatally shot in the neck on Wednesday afternoon while speaking to university students at an event in Utah. Two people were previously arrested and then released, with officials saying they were only persons of interest. \n                  Tyler Robinson: All we know about suspect in Charlie Kirk's shooting - and how he was caught\n                 \n                  What we know about how Charlie Kirk was killed\n                 \n                  Who was Charlie Kirk? The young MAGA influencer 'admired' by Trump\n                 FBI director Kash Patel, who also spoke at the news conference, confirmed the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday at 10pm local time (5am UK time). He praised Mr Cox and Mr Trump for their support and finished with a message for Charlie Kirk: \"To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now, brother. We have the watch and I'll see you in Valhalla.\"  Robinson believed Kirk was 'full of hate' Mr Cox described how messages between Tyler Robinson and his roommate revealed information about the alleged plot including details about a rifle, matching the description of the weapon recovered after the shooting. Bullets with messages inscribed on the casings were also discovered with the rifle, including \"Hey fascist! Catch!\" and \"If you read this, you are gay, LMAO\". Explainer: How Charlie Kirk was killed Mr Cox said a family member told officials that Robinson \"had become more political in recent years\" and had criticised Charlie Kirk, adding that Robinson said Mr Kirk was \"full of hate and spreading hate\". Robinson 'confessed' to killing Utah's governor said a family member reached out to a friend, who contacted authorities on Thursday with information that Robinson had confessed or implied that he carried out the shooting. Sky's US partner network NBC News reports the family member was Robinson's father, who went to a church minister, who then contacted a local sheriff. Mr Cox said he thought Robinson acted alone and there was no evidence anyone else was involved, but did not speculate on a potential motive. He added that Robinson had been living for a long time with his family in Washington County, in southwest Utah. US correspondent We were told that Tyler Robinson, over time, had grown more politically engaged and had a dislike of Charlie Kirk. Words inscribed on ammunition found discarded included: \"Hey fascist, catch!\" There were also the words to the song \"Bella ciao,\" an anthem for the Partisans who fought for the Italian Resistance against the Nazis. The sentiments would appear to confirm early suggestions of a political motivation - they will feed into the political fallout\n If it was inevitable that the assassin would be found eventually, the broader uncertainty is how this episode ends for the United States. The Utah governor acknowledged dangers when he told the news conference: \"This is our moment, do we escalate or do we find an off-ramp? History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country.\" His theme was unity and it's a message America needs to hear. The danger, laid bare in the aftermath of the shooting, is that it's drowned out by recrimination. Reaction to the assassination suggests there's every chance. Neighbour: He was 'smart' and 'quiet' Kristin Schwiermann, a neighbour of the suspect's family, said he was \"smart\", \"quiet\" and \"never caused any problems\". \"I am shocked, very shocked,\" she said. \"I feel for his mom. She's a great mom, and he has a great dad.\" At the time of the shooting, Robinson was a third-year student on the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in Utah. He previously earned a four-year scholarship to Utah State University, but left after one semester in 2021. Robinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records. He was a registered voter but wasnot affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.  Mr Kirk was the president and co-founder of Turning Point USA, a prominent organisation that engages conservative youth on school campuses. Read more: Who was Charlie Kirk? The father of two, who had millions of followers across social media, appeared at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as part of a planned tour of US college campuses.  Vigil for Kirk held in London A vigil for Mr Kirk was held at the Montgomery Statue in Whitehall, in central London, on Friday night. The sombre event was organised by Turning Point UK, the British branch of Kirk's right-wing youth political organisation. \"Charlie Kirk laid his life down for young people,\" said Maisey. While Jade, wearing a Make America Great Again hat with \"RIP Charlie Kirk\" written on it, said: \"I was very, very sad when I heard the news. I didn't agree with everything he said but that's OK! I'm just sad I never got to meet him.\" Turning Point UK's chief executive Jack Ross told the crowd: \"Charlie Kirk has a fantastic legacy and he did so much to shape politics in the West. He stood up for free speech, he stood up for what's right and we demand justice. \"Charlie was not killed because he talked. He was killed because people listened.\" Charges expected next week Robinson is due to make an initial court appearance next Tuesday, when he is also expected to be charged, the Utah County attorney's office said. He is being held without bail after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm and obstruction of justice charges, according to a court affidavit. 'Big breakthrough', says Vance Mr Kirk's body was flown back from Salt Lake City to his home state of Arizona on Air Force Two on Thursday, with the US vice president and close friend JD Vance on board. On Friday, Mr Vance posted on X that the arrest was a \"big breakthrough\". He added: \"We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family.\" Mr Trump said he plans to attend Mr Kirk's funeral, although no date has yet been set."

        "Content": "The suspect in the shooting ofÂ Charlie Kirk is in police custody after a two-day manhunt. The right-wing influencer, 31, was fatally shot on Wednesday afternoon while speaking at an event on Utah Valley University campus in Orem. The suspect has been named as Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old man from Utah, and the governor's office has released a photo of him in custody. Here's what we know about him so far: How was the suspect caught? Utah Governor Spencer Cox said a member of Robinson's family reached out to a friend, who then contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson \"had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident\". NBC News reports that the family member is his father - and that the father then went to a church minister he knew, who contacted a local sheriff. Donald Trump told Fox News \"the father convinced the son,\" to hand himself in, adding that they then \"drove into the police headquarters, and he's there now\". The father realised his son may have been involved after seeing images released by the FBI.  Mr Cox said the family member told the FBI that Robinson \"had become more political in recent years\" and that, at a dinner prior to the shooting, he had mentioned Mr Kirk's upcoming visit to Utah Valley University. Utah's governor said they had \"talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had\" and that \"the family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate\". He went on to say that messages from Tyler Robinson seen by his roommate revealed details about the alleged plot. \"The content of these messages included messages affiliated with the contact 'Tyler' stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,\" he said. Latest updates as suspect named Mr Cox added that there was no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved, but that the investigation was ongoing. He said the suspect was taken into custody in Washington County, in southern Utah, around a three to four hour drive from Orem, where his family lived. What else do we know about Robinson? Sky News have now verified what appear to be school records posted in 2020 by his mother which show a 4.0 average - a very high score, akin to straight As in the UK. \"This boy is a genius,\" she added. NBC reports that he is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St George, Utah. A spokesperson for Utah Valley University said he attended the university for one semester in 2021. A family neighbour, Kristin Schwiermann, describes Robinson as \"smart,\" \"quiet,\" and said he \"never caused any problems.\" What weapon did the gunman use? Bullet casing found by investigators were engraved with messages. One read \"Hey fascist! Catch!\", another said \"oh bella ciao ciao bella ciao ciao ciao\" (which is thought to refer to an antifascist song). The gun was found after the shooting in a wooded area where the gunman had fled, according to FBI agent Robert Bohls. It is described as a high-powered bolt action rifle. Investigators collected a footwear impression, a palm print, and forearm imprints for analysis. Firearms consultant David Dyson told Sky News that, based on the range from where they are believed to have fired, the gunman would likely need to be a somewhat skilled target shooter. But he suggested that while the shot may be difficult for anyone without experience, it's \"not a great range\" for someone with practice. Read more:What we know about the killing - through maps and videosWho was Charlie Kirk? The MAGA influencer 'admired' by Trump Pictures and footage released by the FBI Mr Cox also said that the suspect changed clothes on campus. He said footage \"first spotted\" him with one outfit on, which he allegedly changed while on the roof of a building. Mr Cox said he then \"changed back into that clothing at some point\" - meaning the first outfit.  All this meant, the governor said, that when he was arrested, the suspect was wearing the same clothes he had on before the shooting. Before news of his capture came in, the FBI had released images of a \"person of interest\" in the shooting, later revealed to be Robinson, showing him wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a backpack. They also released video footage of him fleeing after the incident, where he could be seen walking on the roof of the building from where the fatal shot was fired.  He was then seen climbing down and heading toward a wooded area, where police say he abandoned his rifle. The first description of the suspect came from a police officer on her radio shortly after the shooting, who said he was \"wearing jeans, black shirt, black mask, long rifle\". Beau Mason, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, later said he \"appears to be of college age\" and that he \"blended in well with a college institution\". Robinson expected to be charged with aggravated murder The suspect is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit. The offences are all state charges. Mr Cox said that under Utah law, they have three days to file charging documents, and that it should come \"early next week.\" Utah officials previously said they were going to seek the death penalty for Charlie Kirk's suspected gunman."

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n A senior Labour MP has written to the foreign secretary demanding answers about the vetting process for UK diplomats in the wake of Peter Mandelson's sacking as US ambassador. Emily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has outlined a series of questions in a letter to Yvette Cooper about the appointment of Lord Mandelson and his subsequent removal over his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She also urges Ms Cooper to \"look again at pre-appointment scrutiny so that it might prevent such embarrassing diplomatic incidents as this from occurring again\".   Ms Thornberry writes: \"It has been suggested by a number of media outlets that security concerns were overlooked during the appointments process, and that such decisions may have been taken by actors outside of the Foreign Office, perhaps senior people in No 10. \"These allegations are potentially very serious, with implications far beyond newspaper gossip. \"As chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, it is my responsibility to ensure that the House of Commons receives a thorough response to a number of important unanswered questions.\" The Labour MP goes on to list eight questions for Ms Cooper. These include: â¢ What security concerns were raised by the agencies undertaking security clearance ahead of Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ What was the response of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to any such concerns? â¢ Was it the assessment of the FCDO that any such concerns represented a potential barrier to Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ Was there a decision made to dismiss security concerns? Was such a decision taken by the FCDO or by No 10? If so, by whom? â¢ Did the usual vetting process for diplomatic appointments commence in relation to Lord Mandelson before his appointment was made public?  The prime minister, who selected Lord Mandelson for the role, made the decision to sack the US ambassador after new emails revealed the Labour peer sent messages of support to Epstein even as he faced jail for sex offences in 2008. In one particular message, Lord Mandelson had suggested that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs.  The Foreign Office said the emails showed \"the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment\". Following his sacking, Lord Mandelson said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and that he continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Pressure has been mounting on Sir Keir after Sky News revealed Number 10 appointed Lord Mandelson to the Washington role despite the security services' reservations about the move. Sir Keir's decision to defend Lord Mandelson on Wednesday - only to sack him a day later - has caused unease and unrest in the Labour Party. ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð Even before his sacking, Sky News reported that MPs had demanded that Lord Mandelson appear on British soil to give evidence on his relationship with Epstein. Downing Street has said the prime minister still has confidence both Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, and the vetting system despite the row. Speaking to journalists on Friday afternoon, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We always keep national security vetting and other procedures under constant review to make sure they retain their position as world-leading. \"The prime minister has confidence in the vetting process. But, yes, of course, we always keep these things under constant review.\" Read more:Serious questions remain about Starmer's political judgementMandelson's exit leaves Donald Trump's state visit in the lurch Asked about whether Sir Keir retains confidence in Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, the spokesperson said: \"Of course the prime minister has confidence in his top team. \"They are getting on with the important work of this government, which has seen us deliver more than five million extra NHS appointments, new NHS league tables to drive up standards for patients, the new defence industrial strategy, which has included things like the Â£10bn frigate deal with Norway.\"  On Thursday, Sky News reported that the lead civil servant in the Foreign Office, Ollie Robbins, had written to Lord Mandelson to ask a series of questions. These questions included: When did you last meet Jeffrey Epstein before he took his own life? When did you last accept hospitality? What were your last business dealings with? Sky News has contacted the foreign secretary for comment."

        "Content": "Three men who drugged and raped a 12-year-old girl in Kent have been jailed for more than 50 years in total.  Kevin Horvath, 26, and Ivan Turtak, 38, first saw the victim in a supermarket car park in Dover on 11 August, 2024, and encouraged her to get into their vehicle. They then plied her with drugs including crystal methamphetamine and amphetamine before she was raped and subjected to sexual acts by them and a third man, Ernest Gunar, 27. The girl's ordeal ended when she managed to escape from her captors after waking up before them two days later, on 13 August 2024. The three men were jailed for the rape of a 12-year-old girl along with a string of other sexual offences at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday. The judge told the court the victim still has nightmares, does not have any friends and cannot feel comfortable around large groups of people. Relaying her words, Judge Sarah Counsell said: \"I don't feel like the same girl anymore, I just want to be her again and I hope that I will be her again.\" \n                  Woman dies after small boat rescue operation in English Channel\n                 \n                  Man seriously injured after tractor falls off bridge on to M20\n                 \n                  Ricky Jones: Suspended Labour councillor who called for protesters' throats to be cut at rally not guilty of encouraging violent disorder\n                 Horvath and Turtak were each jailed for 17 years while Gunar was jailed for 19 years. All three will also serve three years of an extended licence period and received concurrent sentences for other counts of rape, sexual assault and indecent images. The judge said that while the initial meeting with the girl appeared random, the three men's actions quickly became organised as they moved between addresses, including Gunar's caravan in nearby Folkestone. The men have shown little or no remorse and were assessed by the judge as dangerous enough to warrant extended sentences. During their trial, they tried to claim the girl had told them she was 19 or 20 and one of the defendants described the young victim as \"sexually promiscuous\". \"She does not look anywhere near 19 or 20,\" Judge Counsell said. More from Sky News:Migrant hotel critics meet asylum seekersMotel manager beheaded in washing machine row The men were found guilty of rape and other sexual offences at the court in June. Gunar was convicted of two counts of rape against a child under 13; Turtak was convicted of one count; and Horvath was convicted of sexual assault. Horvath had already admitted three counts of rape against a child under 13, and one charge of assault by penetration of a child under 13. Gunar, who is thought to be his cousin, had also admitted one charge of rape. Turtak initially denied rape but did admit taking indecent photos of a child."

        "Content": "NATO is to bolster Europe's eastern flank, including the use of UK military resources, after Russia's \"reckless and unacceptable\" violation of Polish airspace. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced operation 'Eastern Sentry' on Friday, involving the deployment of equipment on the border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine to deter potential Russian aggression. Poland shot down Russian drones which flew over the country on Wednesday, something the military alliance has portrayed as an attempt by Moscow to test NATO's military response. It underlines long-held concerns about the potential expansion of Russia's three-year war in Ukraine.   Russia said its drones went astray because they were jammed, but European leaders believe the incursions were a deliberate provocation by Russia. \"It's reckless and unacceptable. We can't have Russian drones entering allied airspace,\" Mr Rutte told a news conference. He added that allies, including the UK, France, Germany and Denmark, have so far committed to the mission with others set to join. In a statement, the UK's Ministry of Defence said: \"The UK is fully committed to playing our part in NATO's Eastern Sentry following the reckless and dangerous airspace violations by Russia\". It added that the details of the UK's contribution would be announced soon. Yvette Cooper visited Ukraine on Friday, her first visit to the country since becoming foreign secretary after a cabinet shake-up by Sir Keir Starmer. Ms Cooper described her trip, which included a meeting with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as a demonstration of solidarity with Ukraine. \"The UK will not stand idly by as Putin continues his barbaric invasion of Ukraine,\" Ms Cooper said, noting what she said was the Russian president's \"complete disregard for sovereignty\" by sending drones into NATO airspace. Prince Harry also made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday, where he met with wounded service members. NATO already has substantial forces in eastern Europe, including thousands of troops, but the alliance did not explain how many additional forces would be involved in the new operation.  Speaking at the alliance's Brussels headquarters, US General Alexus Grynkewich told reporters the additional resources will enable the alliance to \"plug gaps in the line\" and concentrate forces wherever they're needed while improving communications across NATO's entire eastern flank. NATO detailed a modest number of additional military assets - including two F-16 fighter jets and a frigate from Denmark, three Rafale fighter jets from France and four Eurofighter jets from Germany. The announcement also coincided with a joint military exercise involving thousands of Russian and Belarusian troops, which began on Friday. ðListen to The World With Richard Engel And Yalda Hakim on your podcast appð Meanwhile, new measures were announced by the UK against Russia on Friday. They included bans on 70 vessels the UK says are part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" that transports Russian oil in defiance of sanctions.

A sheriff on Friday issued a warrant for the removal of the so-called Kingdom of Kubala, which has been camped near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders for the past few weeks. The three members of the self-proclaimed kingdom have said they're reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago.

        "Content": "By Oliver Whitfield-Miocic, Sky correspondent   The number of roadworks in Britain has more than doubled in the past two years - and frustrated drivers are more likely than ever to get stuck behind temporary traffic lights. Exclusive data obtained by Sky News reveals there were 425,524 miles of roadworks across the UK last year. That's enough to stretch around the world a whopping 17 times. It marks a 110% increase compared to 2023, when there were 203,000 miles of lane closures. Part of the reason for the surge is the 2019 pledge by then prime minister Boris Johnson to roll out full fibre broadband to every corner of the nation as part of his \"levelling up\" agenda. Causeway Technologies infrastructure director Nick Smee told Sky News: \"It's absolutely true that the rollout of super-fast fibre has caused a huge spike because we all want those facilities. \"The problem is you can't do it without digging up the roads.\" The original deadline for Johnson's 'Project Gigabit' was this year, but this has been delayed to 2032, meaning drivers could face at least another six years of disruptions. \n                  Father and son drowned during test drive after Mercedes plunged into canal, inquest told\n                 \n                  Boy, 11, becomes second child to die three weeks after minibus motorway crash near Wokingham\n                 \n                  Government claims car interventions will save Â£500 a year - but only if you hit a pothole\n                 Meanwhile, the government is hoping another 100,000 public electric vehicle charging points will be installed by the end of the decade, which will inevitably lead to more asphalt being ripped up for the cables to be laid. Roadworks are now a regular occurrence in large parts of the country, with emergency repairs often needed for leaking Victorian water pipes and other utilities. In some cases, the same streets are repeatedly dug up in quick succession, leading to misery for motorists and an increased risk of potholes. Drivers in London trundled through 490,893 roadworks in 2024, the highest number nationwide, averaging more than 1,300 sites across the capital every day. Kent recorded 134,430 projects, and Surrey had 132,291. Essex and Hampshire complete the list of the top five roadwork hotspots. In January 2024, the then Conservative government said it would crack down on disruptive street works. The Labour government stood by the pledge and said it would start charging firms that unnecessarily leave roads closed over weekends, which hadn't previously been possible.

However, the Department for Transport has now told Sky News that won't happen until next year at the earliest \"due to other high priority legislative work pushing it back\". Clive Bairsto, chief executive of the trade association Street Works UK, said: \"If you overfine people, the industry will be forced to use firms of less integrity and you'll end up with the poor performers being used to do jobs rather than the good performers, which is what we want to encourage.\""

The most recent incident occurred on Thursday and saw a boat with nearly 500 passengers catch fire and capsize on the Congo River, in the Equateur Province's Lukolela territory, authorities said. Some 107 people were killed and a further 146 are missing, the Congolese humanitarian affairs ministry said. It came a day after at least 86 people were killed in a separate boat accident in the Basankusu territory, in the same province. Most of those victims were said to have been students. Images appearing to be from the scene showed villagers gathered around bodies. It is not immediately clear what caused either accident, but state media attributed the first to \"improper loading and night navigation\". A local civil society group has blamed the government and claimed the number of dead is higher.

        "Content": "A man allegedly beheaded a motel manager following a row over a broken washing machine. Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, 37, is accused of using a machete to kill Chandra Nagamallaiah, 50, on Wednesday. Mr Nagamallaiah, identified as the manager of Downtown Suites in Dallas, had asked Cobos-Martinez not to use a broken washing machine, according to court records seen by Sky News' US partner network NBC News. Cobos-Martinez, who was cleaning a room with a woman at the time, became upset because Mr Nagamallaiah didn't speak to him directly and relied on the woman for translation, the documents said. It is then alleged video captured Cobos-Martinez leaving the room and producing a machete before cutting and stabbing the victim. Mr Nagamallaiah fled the scene screaming but Cobos-Martinez is said to have followed him to the motel's front office. The victim's wife and son tried to stop Cobos-Martinez but he pushed them away. Cobos-Martinez removed a key card and mobile phone from the victim's pockets and continued the attack \"until his head was removed from his body\", the court papers said. He then dumped the victim's head in a bin, the documents added. Cobos-Martinez was arrested by police as he fled the scene. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Cobos-Martinez is a Cuban national with a final order of removal from the United States. It said he was most recently in an ICE custody detention centre west of Dallas. He had been released on an order of supervision in January because Cuba \"would not accept him because of his criminal history\", the statement added. Jail records show he is being held without bond in Dallas County Jail on an immigration detainer. The records identify him as an undocumented immigrant."

Officers were called just before 8.30am on Tuesday after a Sikh woman in her 20s reported being attacked by two white men in the area around Tame Road in Oldbury.

The second man was reportedly wearing a grey top with a silver zip. West Midland Police said it is being treated as a \"racially aggravated attack\" and has appealed for anyone in the area who may have seen the men to contact the force. Chief Superintendent Kim Madill said: \"We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other enquiries well under way. \"We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused, and I am speaking to people in the community today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to identify and arrest those responsible. \"Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols in the area.\" Dabinderjit Singh, the lead executive for political engagement at the Sikh Federation (UK), said: \"The current racist political environment is driven by popularism and created by politicians playing the anti-immigration card who are unashamedly exploiting those with right-wing and racist views. \"More than 48 hours later we await the public condemnation by politicians on all sides of this brutal racist and sexual attack where a young Sikh woman has been viciously beaten and raped.\" Gurinder Singh Josan, Labour MP for Smethwick, wrote on X: \"This is a truly horrific attack and my thoughts are with the victim.\" He added: \"The incidence is being treated as a hate crime. \"The police are working extremely sympathetically with the victim at her pace who has been traumatised by the attack. \"We are grateful for all the CCTV and information that has already been forthcoming from the community.\" "

When Alban refused, Aston carried out the attack, the majority of which happened while the victim lay on the floor, the court heard.  On Friday at Southwark Crown Court, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

But the phone was abruptly cut off and Alban's partner made repeated attempts to call back, but was unsuccessful. By 2pm neighbours heard sounds of a disturbance coming from the flat and phoned the police. When medics and officers arrived just after 3.15pm they found Alban lying lifeless in his flat. A dumbbell was found by the side of his head. Aston claimed he had acted in self defence after Alban had assaulted him, but this was disproved by CCTV.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n A senior Labour MP has written to the foreign secretary demanding answers about the vetting process for UK diplomats in the wake of Peter Mandelson's sacking as US ambassador. Emily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has outlined a series of questions in a letter to Yvette Cooper about the appointment of Lord Mandelson and his subsequent removal over his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She also urges Ms Cooper to \"look again at pre-appointment scrutiny so that it might prevent such embarrassing diplomatic incidents as this from occurring again\".   Ms Thornberry writes: \"It has been suggested by a number of media outlets that security concerns were overlooked during the appointments process, and that such decisions may have been taken by actors outside of the Foreign Office, perhaps senior people in No 10. \"These allegations are potentially very serious, with implications far beyond newspaper gossip. \"As chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, it is my responsibility to ensure that the House of Commons receives a thorough response to a number of important unanswered questions.\" The Labour MP goes on to list eight questions for Ms Cooper. These include: â¢ What security concerns were raised by the agencies undertaking security clearance ahead of Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ What was the response of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to any such concerns? â¢ Was it the assessment of the FCDO that any such concerns represented a potential barrier to Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ Was there a decision made to dismiss security concerns? Was such a decision taken by the FCDO or by No 10? If so, by whom? â¢ Did the usual vetting process for diplomatic appointments commence in relation to Lord Mandelson before his appointment was made public?  The prime minister, who selected Lord Mandelson for the role, made the decision to sack the US ambassador after new emails revealed the Labour peer sent messages of support to Epstein even as he faced jail for sex offences in 2008. In one particular message, Lord Mandelson had suggested that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs.  The Foreign Office said the emails showed \"the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment\". Following his sacking, Lord Mandelson said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and that he continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Pressure has been mounting on Sir Keir after Sky News revealed Number 10 appointed Lord Mandelson to the Washington role despite the security services' reservations about the move. Sir Keir's decision to defend Lord Mandelson on Wednesday - only to sack him a day later - has caused unease and unrest in the Labour Party. ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð Even before his sacking, Sky News reported that MPs had demanded that Lord Mandelson appear on British soil to give evidence on his relationship with Epstein. Downing Street has said the prime minister still has confidence both Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, and the vetting system despite the row. Speaking to journalists on Friday afternoon, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We always keep national security vetting and other procedures under constant review to make sure they retain their position as world-leading. \"The prime minister has confidence in the vetting process. But, yes, of course, we always keep these things under constant review.\" Read more:Serious questions remain about Starmer's political judgementMandelson's exit leaves Donald Trump's state visit in the lurch Asked about whether Sir Keir retains confidence in Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, the spokesperson said: \"Of course the prime minister has confidence in his top team. \"They are getting on with the important work of this government, which has seen us deliver more than five million extra NHS appointments, new NHS league tables to drive up standards for patients, the new defence industrial strategy, which has included things like the Â£10bn frigate deal with Norway.\"  On Thursday, Sky News reported that the lead civil servant in the Foreign Office, Ollie Robbins, had written to Lord Mandelson to ask a series of questions. These questions included: When did you last meet Jeffrey Epstein before he took his own life? When did you last accept hospitality? What were your last business dealings with?

Exclusive data obtained by Sky News reveals there were 425,524 miles of roadworks across the UK last year. That's enough to stretch around the world a whopping 17 times. It marks a 110% increase compared to 2023, when there were 203,000 miles of lane closures.

Causeway Technologies infrastructure director Nick Smee told Sky News: \"It's absolutely true that the rollout of super-fast fibre has caused a huge spike because we all want those facilities. \"The problem is you can't do it without digging up the roads.\" The original deadline for Johnson's 'Project Gigabit' was this year, but this has been delayed to 2032, meaning drivers could face at least another six years of disruptions. \n                  Father and son drowned during test drive after Mercedes plunged into canal, inquest told\n                 \n                  Boy, 11, becomes second child to die three weeks after minibus motorway crash near Wokingham\n                 \n                  Government claims car interventions will save Â£500 a year - but only if you hit a pothole\n                 Meanwhile, the government is hoping another 100,000 public electric vehicle charging points will be installed by the end of the decade, which will inevitably lead to more asphalt being ripped up for the cables to be laid. Roadworks are now a regular occurrence in large parts of the country, with emergency repairs often needed for leaking Victorian water pipes and other utilities. In some cases, the same streets are repeatedly dug up in quick succession, leading to misery for motorists and an increased risk of potholes. Drivers in London trundled through 490,893 roadworks in 2024, the highest number nationwide, averaging more than 1,300 sites across the capital every day. Kent recorded 134,430 projects, and Surrey had 132,291. Essex and Hampshire complete the list of the top five roadwork hotspots. In January 2024, the then Conservative government said it would crack down on disruptive street works. The Labour government stood by the pledge and said it would start charging firms that unnecessarily leave roads closed over weekends, which hadn't previously been possible.

However, the Department for Transport has now told Sky News that won't happen until next year at the earliest \"due to other high priority legislative work pushing it back\". Clive Bairsto, chief executive of the trade association Street Works UK, said: \"If you overfine people, the industry will be forced to use firms of less integrity and you'll end up with the poor performers being used to do jobs rather than the good performers, which is what we want to encourage.\""

A sheriff on Friday issued a warrant for the removal of the so-called Kingdom of Kubala, which has been camped near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders for the past few weeks. The three members of the self-proclaimed kingdom have said they're reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago. Kofi Offeh, 36, is the leader of the group and the self-proclaimed King Atehene. The other two members are his wife Jean Gasho, 43, who calls herself Queen Nandi, and \"handmaiden\" Kaura Taylor, who calls herself Asnat. After the warrant was issued on Friday, they showed no inclination to leave.

None of the members of the so-called kingdom were in court and they did not have legal representation.

        "Content": " A man has been sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years for his role in a gangland shooting that left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet lodged in her brain. Javon Riley, 33, helped the motorbike-riding gunman escape from the scene after he fired six times at the Evin Restaurant in Dalston, east London, on 29 May last year. He was found guilty of the attempted murder of the men, Mustafa Kiziltan, 35, Kenan Aydogdu, 45, and Nasser Ali, 44, and causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to the girl. Read more: The Turkish gang war behind the shooting Prosecutors said the Tottenham Turks gang had ordered the planned assassination of members of the rival Hackney Turks, who were sitting at a table outside the restaurant. The first bullet missed, hitting the child in the head while she was inside eating ice cream with her family. It was a \"miracle\" she survived, police said, adding they were \"millimetres\" away from launching a murder investigation. The girl, who cannot be identified, had her skull rebuilt with titanium and spent more than three months in hospital. She has made a good recovery, but the bullet is still lodged in her brain and she is expected to have physical and cognitive difficulties for the rest of her life. Footage of the attack caught on the helmet of an off-duty policeman shows the gunman, who was riding a powerful Ducati Monster motorbike, shoot six bullets in two seconds. The targeted men scrambled to get inside but Ali suffered a wound to his backbone, Aydogdu was shot in the leg and Mustafa Kiziltan was hit in the thigh. Riley, who is from the Tottenham area, claimed he had been contacted by a \"third party\" and offered around Â£40,000 to be involved in a \"smash and grab\" robbery of 60kg of drugs. He was found guilty of three charges of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to the girl after a trial at the Old Bailey earlier this month. Judge Mark Lucraft KC said there had been a number of \"tit for tat\" murders and attempted murders in London involving the gang over the past 10 years. The gunman is currently at large. But prosecutors said Riley had played a \"key role\" before, during and after the shooting. He had carried out reconnaissance of the restaurant before the attack, scouted for potential targets and drove the gunman away in a stolen car, which was later burnt out. The three victims suffered gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and thigh. A reward of up to Â£15,000 had been offered for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person who fired the bullets. Riley was asked who had recruited him for around Â£40,000 but he refused, saying he feared for his life and his family. He admitted conducting a reconnaissance, spotting targets and picking up the gunman. The person who used the gun, Riley admitted, said to him: \"Shots have been fired. I need to get out of here.\" Jamaican-born Riley had a string of convictions dating back to 2008, the court heard, including possession of cannabis and cocaine, driving offences and having an offensive weapon and blade in his car. Riley's links to the Tottenham Turks were revealed in police recordings. This included talks about Izzet Eren, who was shot in Moldova on 10 July last year, understood to be a revenge attack."

        "Content": " US officials have confirmed the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been arrested and identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Utah governor Spencer Cox started a news conference with the phrase \"we got him\", adding that a member of Robinson's family alerted authorities. It has been widely reported that Robinson's father had turned him in. The details broadly match information released by US President Donald Trump earlier on Fox News. Explainer: All we know about the suspect  Mr Kirk, 31, a Trump supporter and right-wing influencer, was fatally shot in the neck on Wednesday afternoon while speaking to university students at an event in Utah. Two people were previously arrested and then released, with officials saying they were only persons of interest. \n                  Tyler Robinson: All we know about suspect in Charlie Kirk's shooting - and how he was caught\n                 \n                  What we know about how Charlie Kirk was killed\n                 \n                  Who was Charlie Kirk? The young MAGA influencer 'admired' by Trump\n                 FBI director Kash Patel, who also spoke at the news conference, confirmed the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday at 10pm local time (5am UK time). He praised Mr Cox and Mr Trump for their support and finished with a message for Charlie Kirk: \"To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now, brother. We have the watch and I'll see you in Valhalla.\"  Robinson believed Kirk was 'full of hate' Mr Cox described how messages between Tyler Robinson and his roommate revealed information about the alleged plot including details about a rifle, matching the description of the weapon recovered after the shooting. Bullets with messages inscribed on the casings were also discovered with the rifle, including \"Hey fascist! Catch!\" and \"If you read this, you are gay, LMAO\". Explainer: How Charlie Kirk was killed Mr Cox said a family member told officials that Robinson \"had become more political in recent years\" and had criticised Charlie Kirk, adding that Robinson said Mr Kirk was \"full of hate and spreading hate\". Robinson 'confessed' to killing Utah's governor said a family member reached out to a friend, who contacted authorities on Thursday with information that Robinson had confessed or implied that he carried out the shooting. Sky's US partner network NBC News reports the family member was Robinson's father, who went to a church minister, who then contacted a local sheriff. Mr Cox said he thought Robinson acted alone and there was no evidence anyone else was involved, but did not speculate on a potential motive. He added that Robinson had been living for a long time with his family in Washington County, in southwest Utah. US correspondent We were told that Tyler Robinson, over time, had grown more politically engaged and had a dislike of Charlie Kirk. Words inscribed on ammunition found discarded included: \"Hey fascist, catch!\" There were also the words to the song \"Bella ciao,\" an anthem for the Partisans who fought for the Italian Resistance against the Nazis. The sentiments would appear to confirm early suggestions of a political motivation - they will feed into the political fallout\n If it was inevitable that the assassin would be found eventually, the broader uncertainty is how this episode ends for the United States. The Utah governor acknowledged dangers when he told the news conference: \"This is our moment, do we escalate or do we find an off-ramp? History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country.\" His theme was unity and it's a message America needs to hear. The danger, laid bare in the aftermath of the shooting, is that it's drowned out by recrimination. Reaction to the assassination suggests there's every chance. Neighbour: He was 'smart' and 'quiet' Kristin Schwiermann, a neighbour of the suspect's family, said he was \"smart\", \"quiet\" and \"never caused any problems\". \"I am shocked, very shocked,\" she said. \"I feel for his mom. She's a great mom, and he has a great dad.\" At the time of the shooting, Robinson was a third-year student on the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in Utah. He previously earned a four-year scholarship to Utah State University, but left after one semester in 2021. Robinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records. He was a registered voter but wasnot affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.  Mr Kirk was the president and co-founder of Turning Point USA, a prominent organisation that engages conservative youth on school campuses. Read more: Who was Charlie Kirk? The father of two, who had millions of followers across social media, appeared at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as part of a planned tour of US college campuses.  Vigil for Kirk held in London A vigil for Mr Kirk was held at the Montgomery Statue in Whitehall, in central London, on Friday night. The sombre event was organised by Turning Point UK, the British branch of Kirk's right-wing youth political organisation. \"Charlie Kirk laid his life down for young people,\" said Maisey. While Jade, wearing a Make America Great Again hat with \"RIP Charlie Kirk\" written on it, said: \"I was very, very sad when I heard the news. I didn't agree with everything he said but that's OK! I'm just sad I never got to meet him.\" Turning Point UK's chief executive Jack Ross told the crowd: \"Charlie Kirk has a fantastic legacy and he did so much to shape politics in the West. He stood up for free speech, he stood up for what's right and we demand justice. \"Charlie was not killed because he talked. He was killed because people listened.\" Charges expected next week Robinson is due to make an initial court appearance next Tuesday, when he is also expected to be charged, the Utah County attorney's office said. He is being held without bail after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm and obstruction of justice charges, according to a court affidavit. 'Big breakthrough', says Vance Mr Kirk's body was flown back from Salt Lake City to his home state of Arizona on Air Force Two on Thursday, with the US vice president and close friend JD Vance on board. On Friday, Mr Vance posted on X that the arrest was a \"big breakthrough\". He added: \"We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family.\" Mr Trump said he plans to attend Mr Kirk's funeral, although no date has yet been set."

        "Content": "NATO is to bolster Europe's eastern flank, including the use of UK military resources, after Russia's \"reckless and unacceptable\" violation of Polish airspace. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced operation 'Eastern Sentry' on Friday, involving the deployment of equipment on the border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine to deter potential Russian aggression. Poland shot down Russian drones which flew over the country on Wednesday, something the military alliance has portrayed as an attempt by Moscow to test NATO's military response. It underlines long-held concerns about the potential expansion of Russia's three-year war in Ukraine.   Russia said its drones went astray because they were jammed, but European leaders believe the incursions were a deliberate provocation by Russia. \"It's reckless and unacceptable. We can't have Russian drones entering allied airspace,\" Mr Rutte told a news conference. He added that allies, including the UK, France, Germany and Denmark, have so far committed to the mission with others set to join. In a statement, the UK's Ministry of Defence said: \"The UK is fully committed to playing our part in NATO's Eastern Sentry following the reckless and dangerous airspace violations by Russia\". It added that the details of the UK's contribution would be announced soon. Yvette Cooper visited Ukraine on Friday, her first visit to the country since becoming foreign secretary after a cabinet shake-up by Sir Keir Starmer. Ms Cooper described her trip, which included a meeting with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as a demonstration of solidarity with Ukraine. \"The UK will not stand idly by as Putin continues his barbaric invasion of Ukraine,\" Ms Cooper said, noting what she said was the Russian president's \"complete disregard for sovereignty\" by sending drones into NATO airspace. Prince Harry also made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday, where he met with wounded service members. NATO already has substantial forces in eastern Europe, including thousands of troops, but the alliance did not explain how many additional forces would be involved in the new operation.  Speaking at the alliance's Brussels headquarters, US General Alexus Grynkewich told reporters the additional resources will enable the alliance to \"plug gaps in the line\" and concentrate forces wherever they're needed while improving communications across NATO's entire eastern flank. NATO detailed a modest number of additional military assets - including two F-16 fighter jets and a frigate from Denmark, three Rafale fighter jets from France and four Eurofighter jets from Germany. The announcement also coincided with a joint military exercise involving thousands of Russian and Belarusian troops, which began on Friday. ðListen to The World With Richard Engel And Yalda Hakim on your podcast appð Meanwhile, new measures were announced by the UK against Russia on Friday.

Slovenia and Iceland are among other nations which have said their participation is dependant on whether or not Israel is allowed to compete. AvroTros said the death of journalists in Gaza was also behind its decision to withdraw from the contest, set to be held in Vienna, Austria, next May.

Israel has denied accusations it is committing genocide and have claimed their actions have been in self-defence against Hamas.

        "Content": " Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, a spokesperson for the royal has said.\n Harry, who served 10 years in the British Army, visited the city at the invitation of the Ukrainian government. The Duke of Sussex travelled to the capital to help with the recovery of military personnel seriously injured in the three-year war with Russia. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also travelled to Kyiv on Friday in her first international trip since being appointed to the job last week. Her visit coincides with the UK launching a new package of Russia-related sanctions targeting ships carrying Russian oil as well as companies and individuals supplying electronics, chemicals and explosives used to make Russian weapons. It comes as Russia and Belarus began a major joint military exercise on NATO's doorstep on Friday, just two days after Poland, with support from its NATO allies, shot down suspected Russian drones over its airspace.  The Zapad-2025 exercise - a show of force by Russia and its close ally - will involve drills in both countries and in the Baltic and Barents seas, the Russian defence ministry said. \n                  Meeting between Duke of Sussex and the King feels like a positive step - even if full reconciliation is likely to take time\n                 \n                  Prince Harry says King is 'great' after they have private tea in first meeting for 19 months\n                 \n                  William and Harry show separate commitment to shared causes - it shows what a powerful team they could be\n                 Meanwhile on the frontline, Russian defence systems intercepted and destroyed 221 Ukrainian drones overnight,including nine over the Moscow region, the ministry said on Friday. Royal correspondent Prince Harry's arrival in Ukraine was unexpected but not entirely surprising. As he stepped off the train, he was warmly welcomed with a hug from the woman who'd encouraged him to go to the capital. For the Duke of Sussex, this was a meaningful mission. He knows his presence in Ukraine means a lot â to the country's people and its politicians. The Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun told me Prince Harry's visit \"brings a new visibility to the war\".  This is Harry's second time in Ukraine this year. In April, he went to a rehabilitation centre in Lviv to meet military personnel wounded in the war. His Invictus Games Foundation is working to help them and will continue to do so. We're told he wants to do everything he can to support those injured in the conflict. This short but significant trip marks another milestone at the end of an important week for the prince. It's felt like a reset. Harry has been visibly happy to be home. After the previous negative narrative, there is a renewed positivity. He wants to come to the UK more often, and that now seems far more likely. The duke told the Guardian while on an overnight train to Kyiv: \"We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process. \"We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through. \"We have to keep it in the forefront of people's minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it's easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.\" Read more from Sky News:Brazil's ex-president jailed for 27 yearsMigrant hotel critics meet asylum seekers Harry, who served two tours in Afghanistan, previously travelled to Ukraine in April, when he visited war victims as part of his work with wounded veterans. The prince visited the Superhumans Center, an orthopaedic clinic in Lviv that treats and rehabilitates wounded military personnel and civilians. Earlier this week, Harry said the King is \"great\" after he reunited with him at Clarence House for a private tea. It was their first meeting in 19 months and lasted just 54 minutes. The last time the father and son saw each other was in February 2024 when the prince flew to the UK after the monarch announced his cancer diagnosis. Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have lived in California since they quit roles as senior working royals in March 2020."

        "Content": "After a lifetime of spurning would-be business suitors, the late Italian designer Giorgio Armani instructed his family to gradually sell off his vast fashion empire. Armani, who died last week at the age of 91, had built the world's most valuable private luxury brand.  His will, which was published by Italian media on Friday, divides the Armani Group between his close family and the Armani Foundation, which was established in 2016 to preserve the designer's legacy. The will also specifies that 15% of the company must be sold within 18 months of the designer's death, with preference given to French conglomerate LVMH, cosmetics brand L'Oreal and eyewear giant Essilor-Luxottica. A further 30% to 54.9% should be sold to the same buyer within five years, the document states. The decision marks a sharp break from Armani's attitude during his 50 years as head of the fashion label. He had long resisted giving any control to outside investors, remaining the sole shareholder of the Armani Group until his death.  If a deal with one of the named companies, or another of \"equal standing\", is not possible, the will calls for public stock market listing as an alternative. \n                  Charlie Kirk suspect arrested after tip-off from father\n                 \n                  UK joins NATO operation to bolster Europe's eastern flank after Russian drone incursions into Poland\n                 \n                  Russia-Belarus drills begin as tensions high after drone incursion in Poland\n                 Although the Armani Group has reported stagnating revenues in recent years amid a wider slowdown in the luxury market, the prospect of a sale is expected to generate significant interest given the brand's enduring reputation. Italian eyewear company Essilor-Luxottica said in a statement that it would consider a possible deal. \"We're proud of the consideration our group and its management received from Mr Armani,\" a spokesperson said. The largest share of the company, 30%, is being given to Armani's longtime partner and collaborator Pantaleo Dell'Orco, who will also control 40% of the voting rights and chair the Armani Foundation. Armani's sister Rosanna, her son Andrea, and the two daughters of his late brother, Silvana and Roberta, are being granted 15% each, though Rosanna and Roberta will not receive voting rights. Armani had no children. The Armani Foundation will get only 10% of shares, but will control 30% of the voting rights. In the will, Armani specified that the Dell'Orco's shares should be sold twice as quickly as other family members, while the Armani Foundation should retain control over its stake."

The most recent incident occurred on Thursday and saw a boat with nearly 500 passengers catch fire and capsize on the Congo River, in the Equateur Province's Lukolela territory, authorities said. Some 107 people were killed and a further 146 are missing, the Congolese humanitarian affairs ministry said. It came a day after at least 86 people were killed in a separate boat accident in the Basankusu territory, in the same province. Most of those victims were said to have been students. Images appearing to be from the scene showed villagers gathered around bodies. It is not immediately clear what caused either accident, but state media attributed the first to \"improper loading and night navigation\".

The victims include 21 protesters, nine prisoners, three police personnel and 18 others, police spokesperson Binod Ghimire added. The demonstrations, which left more than 1,300 people injured, were fuelled by a young generation that believes the Himalyan country's leadership is corrupt, self-serving and nepotistic. The protests, which began on Monday, were also against a ban on social media, with large crowds chanting: \"Stop the ban on social media, stop corruption not social media.\" The leadership lifted the restrictions on social media - allowing people to use apps like X, YouTube and Instagram once again - on Tuesday. Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned later that day after violent protests the day before left 19 people dead.

The streets of Kathmandu were quiet on Wednesday as the military imposed a curfew on the city. The protests and disorder have been attributed to \"Gen Z\" - broadly referring to anyone born between 1995 and 2010. Meanwhile, Nepal's former chief justice, Sushila Karki, is likely to be appointed as interim prime minister on Friday, a constitutional expert consulted by President Ramchandra Paudel and army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel told Reuters. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, added that Ms Karki is favoured by Gen Z in the country. The 73-year-old is Nepal's first and only female chief justice and is known for her honesty, integrity, and stand against corruption. Her appointment is likely to be formally made after a meeting at the president's residence, rescheduled to Friday afternoon from an initial time in the morning, a separate source told Reuters. Nepal's post-monarchy problems Wedged between India and China, Nepal has grappled with political and economic instability since the abolition of its monarchy in 2008, while a lack of jobs drives millions to seek work in other countries and send money home. Shops began reopening on Friday, among signs that normalcy was returning in the capital of Kathmandu, with cars in the streets and police personnel taking up batons instead of the guns they carried earlier in the week. Some roads remained blocked, though streets were patrolled by fewer soldiers than before.

She added: \"We were told he was brought dead to the hospital.\" Another protester who died, Ashab Alam Thakurai, 24, got married only a month earlier, his relatives said. \"The last we spoke to him ... he said he was stuck with the protest.

The plane, carrying more than 300 South Koreans, landed at Incheon airport on Friday, where they were met by a crowd of journalists and TV cameras. It followed a week of intense negotiations by Seoul to win their release. The raid, which saw 475 people detained, was met with horror in South Korea, a key US ally, after they were taken into custody in handcuffs and shackles. It took place at a Hyundai battery factory in Georgia last week, before they were held for a week by US Immigration and Customs. They were then released and flown home from Atlanta.

That has led to some workers relying on grey areas in US visa enforcement.

Utah governor Spencer Cox started a news conference with the phrase \"we got him\", adding that a member of Robinson's family alerted authorities. It has been widely reported that Robinson's father had turned him in. The details broadly match information released by US President Donald Trump earlier on Fox News. Explainer: All we know about the suspect  Mr Kirk, 31, a Trump supporter and right-wing influencer, was fatally shot in the neck on Wednesday afternoon while speaking to university students at an event in Utah.

The young MAGA influencer 'admired' by Trump\n                 FBI director Kash Patel, who also spoke at the news conference, confirmed the suspect was taken into custody on Thursday at 10pm local time (5am UK time). He praised Mr Cox and Mr Trump for their support and finished with a message for Charlie Kirk: \"To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now, brother. We have the watch and I'll see you in Valhalla.\"  Robinson believed Kirk was 'full of hate' Mr Cox described how messages between Tyler Robinson and his roommate revealed information about the alleged plot including details about a rifle, matching the description of the weapon recovered after the shooting. Bullets with messages inscribed on the casings were also discovered with the rifle, including \"Hey fascist! Catch!\" and \"If you read this, you are gay, LMAO\". Explainer: How Charlie Kirk was killed Mr Cox said a family member told officials that Robinson \"had become more political in recent years\" and had criticised Charlie Kirk, adding that Robinson said Mr Kirk was \"full of hate and spreading hate\". Robinson 'confessed' to killing Utah's governor said a family member reached out to a friend, who contacted authorities on Thursday with information that Robinson had confessed or implied that he carried out the shooting. Sky's US partner network NBC News reports the family member was Robinson's father, who went to a church minister, who then contacted a local sheriff. Mr Cox said he thought Robinson acted alone and there was no evidence anyone else was involved, but did not speculate on a potential motive. He added that Robinson had been living for a long time with his family in Washington County, in southwest Utah. US correspondent We were told that Tyler Robinson, over time, had grown more politically engaged and had a dislike of Charlie Kirk. Words inscribed on ammunition found discarded included: \"Hey fascist, catch!\" There were also the words to the song \"Bella ciao,\" an anthem for the Partisans who fought for the Italian Resistance against the Nazis. The sentiments would appear to confirm early suggestions of a political motivation - they will feed into the political fallout\n If it was inevitable that the assassin would be found eventually, the broader uncertainty is how this episode ends for the United States. The Utah governor acknowledged dangers when he told the news conference: \"This is our moment, do we escalate or do we find an off-ramp? History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country.\" His theme was unity and it's a message America needs to hear. The danger, laid bare in the aftermath of the shooting, is that it's drowned out by recrimination. Reaction to the assassination suggests there's every chance. Neighbour: He was 'smart' and 'quiet' Kristin Schwiermann, a neighbour of the suspect's family, said he was \"smart\", \"quiet\" and \"never caused any problems\". \"I am shocked, very shocked,\" she said. \"I feel for his mom. She's a great mom, and he has a great dad.\" At the time of the shooting, Robinson was a third-year student on the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in Utah. He previously earned a four-year scholarship to Utah State University, but left after one semester in 2021. Robinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records. He was a registered voter but wasnot affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.  Mr Kirk was the president and co-founder of Turning Point USA, a prominent organisation that engages conservative youth on school campuses. Read more: Who was Charlie Kirk? The father of two, who had millions of followers across social media, appeared at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as part of a planned tour of US college campuses.  Vigil for Kirk held in London A vigil for Mr Kirk was held at the Montgomery Statue in Whitehall, in central London, on Friday night. The sombre event was organised by Turning Point UK, the British branch of Kirk's right-wing youth political organisation. \"Charlie Kirk laid his life down for young people,\" said Maisey. While Jade, wearing a Make America Great Again hat with \"RIP Charlie Kirk\" written on it, said: \"I was very, very sad when I heard the news. I didn't agree with everything he said but that's OK! I'm just sad I never got to meet him.\" Turning Point UK's chief executive Jack Ross told the crowd: \"Charlie Kirk has a fantastic legacy and he did so much to shape politics in the West. He stood up for free speech, he stood up for what's right and we demand justice. \"Charlie was not killed because he talked. He was killed because people listened.\" Charges expected next week Robinson is due to make an initial court appearance next Tuesday, when he is also expected to be charged, the Utah County attorney's office said. He is being held without bail after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm and obstruction of justice charges, according to a court affidavit. 'Big breakthrough', says Vance Mr Kirk's body was flown back from Salt Lake City to his home state of Arizona on Air Force Two on Thursday, with the US vice president and close friend JD Vance on board. On Friday, Mr Vance posted on X that the arrest was a \"big breakthrough\". He added: \"We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family.\" Mr Trump said he plans to attend Mr Kirk's funeral, although no date has yet been set."

The father realised his son may have been involved after seeing images released by the FBI.  Mr Cox said the family member told the FBI that Robinson \"had become more political in recent years\" and that, at a dinner prior to the shooting, he had mentioned Mr Kirk's upcoming visit to Utah Valley University. Utah's governor said they had \"talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had\" and that \"the family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate\". He went on to say that messages from Tyler Robinson seen by his roommate revealed details about the alleged plot. \"The content of these messages included messages affiliated with the contact 'Tyler' stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,\" he said. Latest updates as suspect named Mr Cox added that there was no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved, but that the investigation was ongoing. He said the suspect was taken into custody in Washington County, in southern Utah, around a three to four hour drive from Orem, where his family lived. What else do we know about Robinson? Sky News have now verified what appear to be school records posted in 2020 by his mother which show a 4.0 average - a very high score, akin to straight As in the UK. \"This boy is a genius,\" she added. NBC reports that he is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St George, Utah. A spokesperson for Utah Valley University said he attended the university for one semester in 2021. A family neighbour, Kristin Schwiermann, describes Robinson as \"smart,\" \"quiet,\" and said he \"never caused any problems.\" What weapon did the gunman use? Bullet casing found by investigators were engraved with messages. One read \"Hey fascist! Catch!\", another said \"oh bella ciao ciao bella ciao ciao ciao\" (which is thought to refer to an antifascist song). The gun was found after the shooting in a wooded area where the gunman had fled, according to FBI agent Robert Bohls. It is described as a high-powered bolt action rifle. Investigators collected a footwear impression, a palm print, and forearm imprints for analysis. Firearms consultant David Dyson told Sky News that, based on the range from where they are believed to have fired, the gunman would likely need to be a somewhat skilled target shooter. But he suggested that while the shot may be difficult for anyone without experience, it's \"not a great range\" for someone with practice.

The MAGA influencer 'admired' by Trump Pictures and footage released by the FBI Mr Cox also said that the suspect changed clothes on campus. He said footage \"first spotted\" him with one outfit on, which he allegedly changed while on the roof of a building. Mr Cox said he then \"changed back into that clothing at some point\" - meaning the first outfit.  All this meant, the governor said, that when he was arrested, the suspect was wearing the same clothes he had on before the shooting. Before news of his capture came in, the FBI had released images of a \"person of interest\" in the shooting, later revealed to be Robinson, showing him wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a backpack. They also released video footage of him fleeing after the incident, where he could be seen walking on the roof of the building from where the fatal shot was fired.  He was then seen climbing down and heading toward a wooded area, where police say he abandoned his rifle. The first description of the suspect came from a police officer on her radio shortly after the shooting, who said he was \"wearing jeans, black shirt, black mask, long rifle\". Beau Mason, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, later said he \"appears to be of college age\" and that he \"blended in well with a college institution\". Robinson expected to be charged with aggravated murder The suspect is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit. The offences are all state charges. Mr Cox said that under Utah law, they have three days to file charging documents, and that it should come \"early next week.\" Utah officials previously said they were going to seek the death penalty for Charlie Kirk's suspected gunman."

Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, 37, is accused of using a machete to kill Chandra Nagamallaiah, 50, on Wednesday. Mr Nagamallaiah, identified as the manager of Downtown Suites in Dallas, had asked Cobos-Martinez not to use a broken washing machine, according to court records seen by Sky News' US partner network NBC News. Cobos-Martinez, who was cleaning a room with a woman at the time, became upset because Mr Nagamallaiah didn't speak to him directly and relied on the woman for translation, the documents said. It is then alleged video captured Cobos-Martinez leaving the room and producing a machete before cutting and stabbing the victim. Mr Nagamallaiah fled the scene screaming but Cobos-Martinez is said to have followed him to the motel's front office. The victim's wife and son tried to stop Cobos-Martinez but he pushed them away. Cobos-Martinez removed a key card and mobile phone from the victim's pockets and continued the attack \"until his head was removed from his body\", the court papers said. He then dumped the victim's head in a bin, the documents added. Cobos-Martinez was arrested by police as he fled the scene. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Cobos-Martinez is a Cuban national with a final order of removal from the United States. It said he was most recently in an ICE custody detention centre west of Dallas. He had been released on an order of supervision in January because Cuba \"would not accept him because of his criminal history\", the statement added. Jail records show he is being held without bond in Dallas County Jail on an immigration detainer. The records identify him as an undocumented immigrant."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The UK economy \"continued to slow\" and recorded zero growth in July, according to official figures showing a big drag from manufacturers. The data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) followed a figure of 0.4% growth the previous month and negative growth of 0.1% in May. Output of 0.3% was achieved over the April-June quarter as a whole, slowing from the 0.7% recorded over the first three months of 2025. Money latest: Reaction as economy slows The latest figures signal concern for the months ahead as the labour market slows and the effects of elevated inflation and the US trade war dampen demand. Commenting on July's activity, ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said that declines in production offset meagre growth in services and construction. \"Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months\", she said. \n                  Money blog: The way we travel will soon start changing - here's what you need to know\n                 \n                  Giorgio Armani's will sets path for sale of fashion empire\n                 \n                  Supermarket spreadable matches Lurpak in taste test | Sign up to Money newsletter\n                 \"While services growth held up, production fell back further. \"Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad based weakness across manufacturing industries.\"  The Labour government made growing the economy its priority when taking office last summer but the chancellor admitted this week that it had become \"stuck\". The US trade war has proved a drag on activity globally this year but Rachel Reeves has also been accused of applying the brakes herself by plundering the private sector for cash since taking office, harming investment and employment in the process. Employers reacted to a Â£40bn budget tax raid by cutting jobs and passing on rising costs to customers.  Inflation is currently running at almost double the Bank of England's 2% target, harming the prospects for future interest rate cuts. Bank data out last week suggested employers were cutting jobs at the fastest pace since 2021. Attention is turning swiftly to the next budget, due on 26 November, and nerves over what measures are to come are hampering sentiment. Ms Reeves is under pressure to raise more taxes to fill a black hole in the public finances estimated to be between Â£30-Â£40bn.  The chancellor has again ruled out raising income tax, employee national insurance contributions and VAT, which, she has always stated, would cause direct harm to \"working people\". Possible targets include the wealthy. Banks also fear a raid on their profits. But the chief executive of the CBI business lobby group told The Guardian newspaper earlier this week that Ms Reeves should now break her promise not to target workers.  Rain Newton-Smith argued that new tax rises on businesses would amount to a further choke on growth and employment, harming working people indirectly in the process. The CBI wants to see reforms to business rates and cuts to VAT thresholds, among other things, as the private sector shoulders its larger tax burden. \"The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,\" Ms Newton-Smith added. The chancellor has responded with plans to ease some barriers to business as part of efforts to improve growth. The Treasury is considering an overhaul of small business rates relief rules to end a so-called \"cliff edge\" penalty facing firms opening a second premises. The British Retail Consortium warned separately on Friday that 400 of the country's largest stores could close if such premises fall into a proposed higher business rates band. It argued that they were already under significant pressure from soaring employment and tax costs, which had accounted for the closure of 1,000 such spaces over the past five years. Commenting on the ONS data, a spokesperson for the Treasury said: \"We know there's more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn't broken, it does feel stuck. \"That's the result of years of underinvestment, which we're determined to reverse through our Plan for Change. \"We're making progress: growth this year was the fastest in the G7; since the election, interest rates have been cut five times, and real wages have risen faster than they did under the last government. \"There's more to do to build an economy that works for, and rewards, working people. That's why we are cutting unnecessary red tape, transforming the planning system to get Britain building, and investing billions of pounds into affordable homes, Sizewell C, and local transport across the country.\" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride responded: \"While the government lurch from one scandal to another, borrowing costs recently hit a 27-year high - a damning vote of no confidence in Labour that makes painful tax rises all but certain. \"It is little wonder that Starmer has stripped Reeves of control over the budget. But sidelining her is not enough - he must also reject her failed economic approach that has left Britain poorer.\""

Armani, who died last week at the age of 91, had built the world's most valuable private luxury brand.  His will, which was published by Italian media on Friday, divides the Armani Group between his close family and the Armani Foundation, which was established in 2016 to preserve the designer's legacy. The will also specifies that 15% of the company must be sold within 18 months of the designer's death, with preference given to French conglomerate LVMH, cosmetics brand L'Oreal and eyewear giant Essilor-Luxottica. A further 30% to 54.9% should be sold to the same buyer within five years, the document states. The decision marks a sharp break from Armani's attitude during his 50 years as head of the fashion label. He had long resisted giving any control to outside investors, remaining the sole shareholder of the Armani Group until his death.

Italian eyewear company Essilor-Luxottica said in a statement that it would consider a possible deal. \"We're proud of the consideration our group and its management received from Mr Armani,\" a spokesperson said. The largest share of the company, 30%, is being given to Armani's longtime partner and collaborator Pantaleo Dell'Orco, who will also control 40% of the voting rights and chair the Armani Foundation. Armani's sister Rosanna, her son Andrea, and the two daughters of his late brother, Silvana and Roberta, are being granted 15% each, though Rosanna and Roberta will not receive voting rights. Armani had no children. The Armani Foundation will get only 10% of shares, but will control 30% of the voting rights. In the will, Armani specified that the Dell'Orco's shares should be sold twice as quickly as other family members, while the Armani Foundation should retain control over its stake."

Sky News has learnt that The Diamond Store, which is owned by its founding family, is working with advisers on a process to bring in new backers amid growing appetite among consumers for lab-grown diamonds. Sources close to the process said talks were already active with a substantial number of prospective investors. Cavendish, the investment bank, is overseeing the discussions with potential backers.  Money latest: How the way we travel will soon start changing The Diamond Store sells jewellery incorporating both natural and lab-grown diamonds, with a report by the consulting firm Bain & Company saying that sales of the latter grew by approximately 40% in 2022, as a result of increasing consumer demand, better production efficiencies and wider retail adoption. \n                  Zero growth in July as economy 'continued to slow', official figures show\n                 \n                  Money blog: The way we travel will soon start changing - here's what you need to know\n                 \n                  Giorgio Armani's will sets path for sale of fashion empire\n                 The identities of the interested parties were unclear. \"We're seeing a vast and growing appetite for lab-grown diamonds across Europe, particularly in markets where awareness is rising but choice remains limited,\" said Jeremy Kanzen, The Diamond Store chief executive. \"We are actively exploring strategic partnerships to help accelerate our international expansion and meet this demand. \"Selective physical presence, both in the UK and key European cities, through premium concessions and pop-ups, will play a vital role in strengthening brand visibility, building trust and driving high-value conversions.\" \"Global sales of lab-grown diamonds now account for nearly 20% of the global diamond market, with that figure expected to rise significantly over the next five years,\" Mr Kanzen added. \"Consumers, especially younger audiences, are rapidly moving away from legacy retail models in favour of brands that offer ethical innovation, transparency, and seamless online experiences.\" The company employs about 70 people and is based in London, having been founded in Hatton Garden, the heartland of the capital's jewellery industry. The Diamond Store's revenues are growing at a double-digit rate, with the potential for its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to double in the next three years with a new partner, Mr Kanzen said. Its talks with investors come two years after Vashi, a diamond jewellery retailer founded by Vashi Dominguez, collapsed into liquidation, leaving a trail of backers with multimillion pound losses. Mr Dominguez has faced allegations from his backers that the business operated fraudulently, with the founder alleged to have asked staff to pose as customers."

        "Content": " The Conservatives have urged Sir Keir Starmer to publish all concerns raised by the security services about the appointment of sacked US ambassador Peter Mandelson. Shadow cabinet office minister Alex Burghart said his party would push for a vote in parliament demanding the government reveal what issues the security services had in relation to Lord Mandelson's relationship with the disgraced sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. Politics latest: Minister defends Starmer's pledge to tackle sleaze It comes after Sky News' deputy political editor Sam Coates revealed that Number 10 appointed Lord Mandelson to the Washington role despite the security services' reservations about the move. Mr Burghart said material from the security services is not usually made public, but that a substantial amount of information was already in the public domain. He told Sky News Breakfast: \"What we're going to do is we're going to try and bring a vote in parliament to say that the government has to publish this information. \"It will then be up to Labour MPs to decide whether they want to vote to protect Peter Mandelson and the prime minister or make the information available.\" Mr Burghart said he had spoken to Labour MPs who were \"incredibly unhappy about the prime minister's handling of this\", and that it would be \"very interesting to see whether they want to be on the side of transparency\". Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said she believed Lord Mandelson's appointment revealed that the prime minister \"has very bad judgment\". \"It looks like he went against advice, security advice and made this appointment...and what we're asking for is transparency.\" The Liberal Democrats have also called for parliament to be given a role in vetting the next US ambassador. \"I think it will be right for experts in foreign affairs on the relevant select committee to quiz any proposal that comes from 10 Downing Street, and so we can have that extra bit of scrutiny,\" the party's leader Ed Davey told broadcasters. The former UK ambassador to France, Lord Ricketts, said the government should not be \"rushing into an appointment\" to replace Lord Mandelson.\"I would urge the government to take their time, and I would also make a strong case to the government to go for a career diplomat to steady the ship after this very disruptive process,\" he said. Labour MP Chris Hinchcliff posted on X that the former US ambassador should also be removed from the House of Lords. Nigel Farage said Sir Keir's decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US was a \"serious misjudgement\" by the PM. \"We don't yet know what the intelligence briefings would have said, but it looks as though Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister's right-hand man, and the prime minister, ignored the warnings, carried on,\" he said. \"He was then reluctant to get rid of Mandelson, and he's now left himself in a very vulnerable position with the rest of the parliamentary Labour Party. \"It is about the prime minister's judgement, but it is also about the role that Morgan McSweeney plays in this government.\"  The timing of the sacking comes ahead of Donald Trump's state visit next week, with the US president facing questions over his own ties with Epstein. The prime minister sacked Lord Mandelson on Thursday after new emails revealed the Labour grandee sent messages of support to Epstein even as he faced jail for sex offences in 2008. In one particular message, Lord Mandelson had suggested that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs. The Foreign Office said the emails showed \"the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment\".  Downing Street has defended the extensive vetting process which senior civil servants go through in order to get jobs, which has raised questions about whether or not they missed something or Number 10 ignored their advice. The prime minister's official spokesman also said yesterday that Number 10 \"was not involved in the security vetting process\". \"This is managed at departmental level by the agency responsible, and any suggestion that Number 10 was involved is untrue,\" he told reporters. Asked repeatedly if any concerns were flagged to Downing Street by the agencies that conducted the vetting of Lord Mandelson, he did not dismiss the assertion, repeating that Number 10 did not conduct the vetting. Read more:Serious questions remain about Starmer's political judgementMandelson's exit leaves Donald Trump's state visit in the lurch Speaking to Sky News this morning, Scotland Secretary Douglas Alexander said his reaction to the publication of the emails was one of \"incredulity and revulsion\".

The cabinet minister said Lord Mandelson was appointed on \"judgement - a judgement that, given the depth of his experience as a former trade commissioner for the European Union, his long experience in politics and his policy and doing politics at the highest international levels, he could do a job for the United Kingdom\". \"We knew this was an unconventional presidential administration and that was the basis on which there was a judgement that we needed an unconventional ambassador,\" he said. Mr Alexander added: \"If what has emerged now had been known at the time, there is no doubt he would not have been appointed.\""

Emily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has outlined a series of questions in a letter to Yvette Cooper about the appointment of Lord Mandelson and his subsequent removal over his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She also urges Ms Cooper to \"look again at pre-appointment scrutiny so that it might prevent such embarrassing diplomatic incidents as this from occurring again\".   Ms Thornberry writes: \"It has been suggested by a number of media outlets that security concerns were overlooked during the appointments process, and that such decisions may have been taken by actors outside of the Foreign Office, perhaps senior people in No 10. \"These allegations are potentially very serious, with implications far beyond newspaper gossip. \"As chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, it is my responsibility to ensure that the House of Commons receives a thorough response to a number of important unanswered questions.\" The Labour MP goes on to list eight questions for Ms Cooper. These include: â¢ What security concerns were raised by the agencies undertaking security clearance ahead of Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ What was the response of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to any such concerns? â¢ Was it the assessment of the FCDO that any such concerns represented a potential barrier to Lord Mandelson's appointment? â¢ Was there a decision made to dismiss security concerns? Was such a decision taken by the FCDO or by No 10?

Following his sacking, Lord Mandelson said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and that he continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Pressure has been mounting on Sir Keir after Sky News revealed Number 10 appointed Lord Mandelson to the Washington role despite the security services' reservations about the move. Sir Keir's decision to defend Lord Mandelson on Wednesday - only to sack him a day later - has caused unease and unrest in the Labour Party. ð Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ð Even before his sacking, Sky News reported that MPs had demanded that Lord Mandelson appear on British soil to give evidence on his relationship with Epstein. Downing Street has said the prime minister still has confidence both Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, and the vetting system despite the row. Speaking to journalists on Friday afternoon, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We always keep national security vetting and other procedures under constant review to make sure they retain their position as world-leading. \"The prime minister has confidence in the vetting process.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n The question being asked everywhere today is \"how did it happen\"? Because the vibe out of Downing Street this morning seems to be that nobody anywhere did anything wrong, processes were followed, and everything went by the book.Â  But can they really, honestly, believe that? To recap, the reason that everyone is asking is to try and discern whether the failings are a consequence of a fundamental, unfixable flaw at the heart of Keir Starmer's operation. Politics latest: Starmer 'very vulnerable' following Mandelson revelations Yesterday, we told you that the security services had raised red flags about the appointment of Peter Mandelson, yet Number 10 went ahead. The story was nuanced. We did not say that Peter Mandelson had failed a deep vetting, just that concerns were relayed and the appointment went ahead. We put the story to Downing Street, and - being candid - I did not understand what their official response meant, beyond it quite obviously not being a denial. \n                  Senior Labour MP demands answers from foreign secretary over Mandelson vetting\n                 \n                  No 10 appointed Mandelson despite security concerns, Sky News understands\n                 \n                  Without Angela Rayner 'there will be no holding back' Labour's left wing\n                 As a response, Number 10 said to us that the security vetting process is all done at a department level - with no Number 10 involvement. To a wider group of political journalists, an hour and a half after we aired the story, Number 10 said they were \"not involved in the security vetting process. This is managed at the departmental level\". Today, the line from Downing Street seems to be that there was no official level block on the appointment, so it went ahead. Although The Times has reports from allies of Lord Mandelson claiming he disclosed everything, the exact chain of events remains opaque.  But for those who want to understand the inner workings of government, here is more detail about the two types of check that would have gone on, and what this tells us. Firstly, by the security services. The Cabinet Office led both on vetting and separately on propriety and ethics (a form of government HR) but in effect, it's multi-agency and multi-department. In this instance, potentially multiple agencies would likely feed into the Foreign Office, or FCDO. FCDO then act as a liaison for vetting - what I'm told is known as a \"front face\" - and an FCDO official takes a note to tie everything together. We are being told that this amounts to a binary decision. So, potentially, an FCDO official ties up the findings from both agencies and departments in one place and that's given to the Permanent Under Secretary at the department (Philip Barton, later Olly Robbins) and Number 10.  So the recommendations can both be \"by a Foreign Office official\" and from security services at the same time. That potentially explains some reporting this morning. I believe, ultimately, I was told about the security service red flags because they do not want to share the blame for a catastrophic intelligence miss that has harmed this government severely. And is a situation like this ever binary? If there are matters of judgement for the PM to weigh up, are we honestly saying they are kept from him? Sources tell me there are always conversations around the side of these processes: it would be recklessly incurious of Number 10 if this had not been the case for someone who already resigned twice and whose association with Jeffrey Epstein was in the public domain. Read more:Serious questions remain about Starmer's political judgementMandelson's exit leaves Donald Trump's state visit in the lurch But then there is a second, Cabinet Office-led process which is arguably more important. There will have been checks on Lord Mandelson by examining what's in the public domain. It is, quite simply as one person said to me, a \"Google check\". This, too, must have flagged stories about Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein post-conviction, and gone to Number 10. At this point, the question is why No 10 did not see the sheer enormity of the risk this posed and pressed ahead anyway. Who thought this was okay, and why? There is a witch-hunt vibe to the Parliamentary Labour Party right now. Now - and forever - there will be footage of Sir Keir Starmer in the Commons chamber defending keeping an ally in place who admitted a close relationship with a known paedophile after conviction and a jail sentence, before sacking him the next day. The previous week, he was defending another ally who had avoided tax, before sacking her two days later. The damage is likely to be immense."

        "Content": "By Oliver Whitfield-Miocic, Sky correspondent   The number of roadworks in Britain has more than doubled in the past two years - and frustrated drivers are more likely than ever to get stuck behind temporary traffic lights. Exclusive data obtained by Sky News reveals there were 425,524 miles of roadworks across the UK last year. That's enough to stretch around the world a whopping 17 times. It marks a 110% increase compared to 2023, when there were 203,000 miles of lane closures. Part of the reason for the surge is the 2019 pledge by then prime minister Boris Johnson to roll out full fibre broadband to every corner of the nation as part of his \"levelling up\" agenda. Causeway Technologies infrastructure director Nick Smee told Sky News: \"It's absolutely true that the rollout of super-fast fibre has caused a huge spike because we all want those facilities. \"The problem is you can't do it without digging up the roads.\" The original deadline for Johnson's 'Project Gigabit' was this year, but this has been delayed to 2032, meaning drivers could face at least another six years of disruptions. \n                  Father and son drowned during test drive after Mercedes plunged into canal, inquest told\n                 \n                  Boy, 11, becomes second child to die three weeks after minibus motorway crash near Wokingham\n                 \n                  Government claims car interventions will save Â£500 a year - but only if you hit a pothole\n                 Meanwhile, the government is hoping another 100,000 public electric vehicle charging points will be installed by the end of the decade, which will inevitably lead to more asphalt being ripped up for the cables to be laid. Roadworks are now a regular occurrence in large parts of the country, with emergency repairs often needed for leaking Victorian water pipes and other utilities. In some cases, the same streets are repeatedly dug up in quick succession, leading to misery for motorists and an increased risk of potholes. Drivers in London trundled through 490,893 roadworks in 2024, the highest number nationwide, averaging more than 1,300 sites across the capital every day. Kent recorded 134,430 projects, and Surrey had 132,291. Essex and Hampshire complete the list of the top five roadwork hotspots. In January 2024, the then Conservative government said it would crack down on disruptive street works. The Labour government stood by the pledge and said it would start charging firms that unnecessarily leave roads closed over weekends, which hadn't previously been possible. Read more from Sky News:Migrant hotel critics meet asylum seekersCalls for PM to publish security warnings about Mandelson Officials also planned to double fines for delayed roadworks by this summer. However, the Department for Transport has now told Sky News that won't happen until next year at the earliest \"due to other high priority legislative work pushing it back\". Clive Bairsto, chief executive of the trade association Street Works UK, said: \"If you overfine people, the industry will be forced to use firms of less integrity and you'll end up with the poor performers being used to do jobs rather than the good performers, which is what we want to encourage.\""

        "Content": " Nigel Farage has said he \"paid a lot of money to make sure we have done everything right\" regarding the purchase of a home in his Clacton constituency. The Reform UK leader told broadcasters he had a \"very expensive week\" seeking advice from tax experts as he faced questions over the Clacton property. The Clacton MP said he had consulted a KC to ensure \"the right amount of council tax has been paid\". Politics latest: PM 'very vulnerable' following Mandelson revelations \"I have done everything I can to prove everything I have done has been legal and correct,\" he said. Mr Farage's lawyers, Grosvenor Law, said in a statement they had received written advice from a KC that \"concludes that there is no underpayment of SDLT (stamp duty land tax), that SDLT paid was properly calculated and that there is no basis to suggest there has been any improper avoidance or evasion of tax in respect of the purchase\". Reform UK's leader has been under scrutiny after he criticised former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner for failing to pay enough stamp duty on her home in Hove, East Sussex. \n                  Is Labour too London? \n                 \n                  Nigel Farage admits he made a mistake over house ownership after a week that proves how much details matter\n                 \n                  Farage confirms he wants to deport women asylum seekers back to Taliban in Afghanistan\n                 Last November, Mr Farage told Sky News he \"just exchanged contracts on the house. I've bought a house in Clacton\". The Daily Mirror later reported that it was his partner who bought the house, and in doing so, only paid standard stamp duty as it is her main home. Had Mr Farage bought the house, he would have been liable for an additional Â£44,000 in tax as a second home purchase. However, it would not be illegal for Mr Farage to gift or transfer money to his partner for her to buy a property in her own name and pay the lower rate of stamp duty. Mr Farage denies doing this, saying instead that his partner Laure Ferrari was able to purchase the property herself using family wealth. Pressed on whether any of his own money was used to buy the house, the Reform leader said: \"No, no, no, no. Listen, can I be clear about this? The money was legally hers. \"The estate agent and everyone did the 'know your customer rule checks' it was her legal money. She bought the house. The deeds are in her name. Council taxes in her name. I don't have any financial stake in it whatsoever other than she lets me stay there. But then, given that I'm a partner, that's not really that unusual.\" He added: \"I have given every answer to this I want to give. I've even been this week to a King's Council tax expert, and paid a lot of money to make sure that everything we've done is legal and right, and, crucially, that the right amount of council tax has been paid.\"  Asked why he sought legal advice if he had no part in buying the house, he said: \"Because I was really concerned about what was being said by some elements of the press.\" Ms Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary last week after admitting she did not pay enough tax on her second home. She also quit as deputy leader of the Labour Party, an elected post. Read more:Serious questions remain about Starmer's political judgementMandelson's exit leaves Donald Trump's state visit in the lurch Ms Rayner admitted to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast on Wednesday that she should have paid the higher rate of stamp duty on a home she bought in Hove, East Sussex, as it was her second property. After referring herself to Sir Laurie Magnus, the prime minister's independent ethics adviser, she resigned after he found she had breached the ministerial code. Following her resignation, Mr Farage said her not paying enough stamp duty \"screams to entitlement\". \"It screams to a government that, despite all the promises that this would be a new, different kind of politics is as bad, if not worse, than the one that went before,\" he added. A race to replace Ms Rayner as Labour's deputy leader is now under way. The two candidates who face a vote of the membership are Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell."

The debate centres on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted dying under specific circumstances. The legislation will be examined during a two-day debate starting today. The proposed law would apply across England and Wales and be limited to adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and a life expectancy of less than six months. Supporters of the bill have welcomed further scrutiny, while opponents argue it must be firmly resisted. A second reading is scheduled for 19 September, when additional peers will speak and the bill could potentially be put to a vote. Although the House of Lords is primarily viewed as a revising chamber that reviews legislation in detail after it passes the Commons, peers can ask MPs to reconsider parts of a bill when they believe it's necessary.

If that happens, the bill would be rejected, and any attempt to legalise assisted dying would have to restart the parliamentary process. Supporters warn that if the bill is blocked, it could be another decade before parliament has another opportunity to change the law. However, Conservative MP James Cleverly said during a Commons debate earlier this year that it shouldn't be seen as a \"now or never\" moment.

Former lord chancellor and justice secretary Lord Charlie Falconer, who is sponsoring the bill in the Lords, told Sky News he believes the bill will be passed \"by Easter, which I think is at the beginning of April this year\". He added that the proposed law will \"benefit from the experience and expertise of the Lords\". Dame Esther, who has branded the current law \"cruel and messy\", said: \"If the Lords can show the same care and compassion (as the Commons), it's a unique opportunity for them to support and protect the most vulnerable.\" Among those opposing assisted dying is Church of England bishop Dame Sarah Mullally, who has previously stated that the current version of the bill should be rejected. Ahead of today's debate, she said she intends to repeat her \"deep concerns\" and \"grave fears\" regarding the bill's \"potential to disproportionately impact the most vulnerable in our society\". Supporters of the bill have called it one of the safest in the world, as it requires approval for assisted death from two doctors and an expert panel."

AvroTros said the death of journalists in Gaza was also behind its decision to withdraw from the contest, set to be held in Vienna, Austria, next May.

Israel has denied accusations it is committing genocide and have claimed their actions have been in self-defence against Hamas. More than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military action."
