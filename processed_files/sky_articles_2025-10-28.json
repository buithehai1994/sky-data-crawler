        "Content": " Up to 8,000 holidaying British citizens are in Jamaica as it is battered by one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes in history. People have been ordered to stay indoors as Hurricane Melissa sweeps over the Caribbean island, which is also home to 50,000 dual nationals. And tourists are locked down in hotels as Jamaica is hit by 185 mph winds. Follow latest updates on Hurricane Melissa Andrew Tracey had been due to fly home to the UK on Monday, but his flight was cancelled. Mr Tracey told Sky News that food packages were being delivered to guests at his hotel. Deck chairs have been removed from the beach, and the swimming pools have been drained, at the Negril hotel where he is staying. \"The balcony and walls do feel as though they are vibrating just due to the strength of the wind,\" said Mr Tracey. \n                  Budget 2025: Reeves vows to 'defy' gloomy forecasts - but faces income tax warning\n                 \n                  Rats, flies and maggots: A community plagued by 25,000 tonnes of illegal waste\n                 \n                  Child dies after 'hazardous materials incident' in London\n                 \"I'm very nervous, it's hard to comprehend what we are likely to expect.\" The US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said that Melissa was \"one of the most powerful hurricane landfalls on record in the Atlantic basin\" as it hit southwestern Jamaica near New Hope. In a social media post, the centre warned that it is an \"extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation\" - and told those in the area not to leave their shelter as the eye of the storm passes over. 'It is a bit scary, but we've got each other' A British-Jamaican couple who are sheltering inside as the storm passes over the island spoke to Sky News about their ordeal. Shantell Nova Rochester and her Jamaican fiance Denva Wray are due to get married on the island next month.  They spoke of broken windows and water coming in where they are staying, but the couple believe they are \"as safe as they can possibly be\" in St Elizabeth. Mr Wray said: \"Where we are is quite strong, sturdy, but you can hear a lot of wind. It is a bit scary, but we've got each other, so we are strong.\" Asked about the wedding, Ms Rochester said: \"We're just worried about getting through tomorrow, but that's a worry in the back of our heads. \"Where we're plan to get married is flooded at this time.\" Government action 'too late' - British tourist One British man who paid £3,500 for last-minute flights so he and his family could return home before the hurricane hit the island said that he felt \"completely let down\" by the government's response. David Rowe and his family, from Hertfordshire, had spent 10 days in Jamaica before deciding to fly back to the UK on Saturday. Mr Rowe, 47, was critical of the response of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Speaking to the PA news agency, IT manager Mr Rowe said: \"It's all too late, their reaction and their response to the storm has been too late - after the fact. \"The advice should have been last week, like on the Saturday - don't travel - because a lot of the travel companies use the FCDO guidance on travel (for) all their planning and what decisions they make as an organisation. \"There should have been something done much sooner than this. A lot of the UK nationals, and people on holiday there, they are stranded. \"This could have been prevented with with better action from the UK government.\" Read more:Hurricane Melissa: What we know'Storm of century' makes landfall Mr Rowe added that he and his wife had felt \"very anxious\" before they flew home - and \"very sad\" for those left in the country. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We understand how worrying developments in Jamaica are for British nationals and their families. \"Our travel advice includes information about hurricane season, which runs from June to November. Last Thursday we updated our travel advice for Jamaica to include a warning about Tropical Storm Melissa and that it was expected to intensify over the coming days. \"The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority, and that is why we are urging any British nationals in Jamaica to follow the guidance of the local authorities and register their presence with us to receive updates.\""

        "Headline": "There is still plenty of tension, even anger, bubbling not far under the surface of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. But it does still hold - and there are three decisive factors currently ensuring that it does.",
        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  It has been tested and challenged, but this fragile ceasefire remains in place. And for that, at least, the Middle East is presently breathing a sign of relief. There are probably three factors at play here. Firstly, Israel, and particularly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, felt it had to respond to a series of provocations. Foremost among them today was an attack against one of its soldiers, who was in Israeli-controlled territory when targeted. A week ago, Israel responded to the killing of two of its soldiers with devastating air strikes on the Gaza Strip, so a pattern was established: \"If you attack our people, we will target you, but with greater ferocity.\" But there is also the video, filmed by an Israeli military drone, that seems to show Hamas operatives pretending to discover human remains that they had, in fact, just taken from a building and buried. Israel says this is, at best, a grotesque display of bad taste and, at worst, demonstrable evidence that Hamas is lying about not knowing where to find the deceased hostages. In the video, we see the remains, wrapped in a shroud, handed over to members of the Red Cross, who are unaware of the deceit, sparking a rare outburst of anger from the charity. \"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged when so much depends on this agreement being upheld, and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones,\" said its statement. Fury in Israel If the Red Cross are angry, a lot of Israelis are furious. The forum representing the families of hostages is calling for more military action, and the far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet are itching for the offensive to recommence. But the signs are that, for the moment at least, the reprisals have ceased. So Israel's response was inevitable. But Hamas's position is less predictable. How will Hamas respond? For a start, they are distancing themselves from the attack on the Israeli soldiers, suggesting that the people involved were not following orders from Hamas, and might not even be part of Hamas at all. For another, Hamas tried to calm the anger around the bulldozer video by rapidly claiming to have found the body of another hostage, and offering to return it within hours. That deal was rescinded after Israel launched its attacks, but, assuming this video is accurate, Hamas will know it undermines the organisation's credibility. It will be keen to make amends, to soothe doubts and to try to stay on a path that, long term, allows Hamas to still have a part to play in Gaza's future. America's role But the third factor is perhaps the most decisive. The US, in the shape of Vice President JD Vance, responded quickly and calmly, saying the ceasefire in Gaza was holding, describing the violence as \"little skirmishes here and there\". He went on: \"We know that Israel will respond, but the president's peace is going to hold.\" And that may yet be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Israel, after all, told America of its reprisal plans before a bomb had been dropped or a bullet fired. Netanyahu is well aware that the support of Donald Trump lays behind everything he does, and aspires to do. And he's also aware that Trump will not want the ceasefire, which has the word Trump right at the top, to be a failure. Read more:Netanyahu accuses Hamas of 'clear violation' So, for the moment at least, the ceasefire holds, even if the firing hasn't really ceased and the first condition, about the return of all hostages, living and dead, has not been fulfilled. But it holds because, for all the anger, mistrust, and the sense of being wronged, nobody wants to be seen to break it."

        "Content": " A university academic who is receiving \"substantial damages\" for how he was portrayed in a film has told Sky News he hasn't received an apology from star Steve Coogan - nor the two companies involved in its production. Richard Taylor said he was \"shell-shocked\" after seeing The Lost King for the first time, a film about how Richard III's skeleton was discovered below a car park in Leicester. He told The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee: \"I wasn't consulted or even knew I was in the film. The first I hear is I get a phone call while I'm on holiday - and eventually, after press previews, I persuade the producers to let me see a preview.\" Last year, a judge ruled that Mr Taylor was depicted as \"smug, unruly dismissive and patronising\" - with the plot suggesting he \"knowingly\" misled the public. \"I'm portrayed by someone on screen who looks like me, who sounds like me, who dresses like me - but behaves in a way that falls so far short of the standards I set for myself and what others might reasonably expect of me,\" the academic explained. Mr Taylor revealed he received emails at work telling him to \"rot in hell\", while others described him as a \"disgrace\". He added: \"Something that was a collaborative effort that showcased the best of British universities in my view was turned into this farce - where I was the villain and portrayed in a way that was completely inconsistent with the reality and the truth.\" Now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, Mr Taylor said \"none of the facts\" in the 2022 film were ever checked - and the Alan Partridge star, his company Baby Cow and Pathe Productions did not reach out to him before its release. \"The producers just went ahead, filmed it, produced it, stuck it out there and left me to deal with all the flack and all the fallout from it. Grossly unfair and I feel vindicated from the result we've achieved,\" he told Sky News. 'The film's going to look pretty silly' As part of the settlement, an on-screen clarification will now be added to the start of the film, but no scenes will be removed. When asked whether he was satisfied with this outcome, Mr Taylor replied: \"I'd have liked them to re-edit the film, but one's got to be realistic about what one can achieve. \"The insertion of the card will say that the person on screen is a fictitious portrayal - and the real Richard Taylor didn't behave like that … so the film's going to look pretty silly.\" Read more UK news:Community plagued by 25,000 tonnes of illegal wasteWhat tax rises could be announced in the budget? The case was due to proceed to trial, but a High Court hearing on Monday heard that the parties had settled the claim. In a statement afterwards, Coogan had said: \"If it wasn't for Philippa Langley, Richard III would still be lying under a car park in Leicester. It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity.\" He went on to add: \"That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.\" Reacting to the statement, Mr Taylor argued \"it's a pretty strange definition of happy when you've had to settle a defamation claim for seven figures in costs\". He said: \"Steve is never anything other than certain in himself and of his own position, but I think he's got it wrong - basic facts were not checked.\""

        "Headline": "A damning report finds foreign aid spending on migrant hotels is not effective, and pulling development aid will lead to \"devastating consequences\".",
        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government's decision to slash foreign aid will lead to unrest, further crises and threaten UK security, a group of cross-party MPs has warned. A report by the International Development Committee found the decision in February to reduce aid to 0.3% of gross national income (GNI) by 2027/28 - coupled with the US cutting its aid budget - is having a severe impact. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates The foreign aid budget was cut to invest in defence from 0.5% of GNI, which was meant to be an interim reduction from 0.7% to cope with economic challenges caused by the pandemic. Total aid spending is set to reduce from £14.1bn in 2024 to £9.4bn by 2028/29. The committee, chaired by Labour MP Sarah Champion, said spending is being prioritised on humanitarian aid over development, which \"builds long-term resilience and should lead to reducing the need for humanitarian aid\". They said the international development minister, Baroness Chapman, has made it clear \"the UK will remain a leading humanitarian actor\".  But the committee said while they are glad those in \"desperate need of aid will be prioritised, particularly in the regions of Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan\", they are concerned about the long-term effect of pulling development aid. \"We are concerned that slashing development aid will continue to lead to unrest and further crises in the future, presenting a threat to UK security,\" the MPs said. Risk to UK's national security They said a reduction in foreign aid will have \"devastating consequences across the world\". The committee said it recognises an increase in defence spending is needed, but \"to do this at the expense of the world's most vulnerable undermines not only the UK's soft power, but also its national security\". They said the government must make \"every effort\" to return to spending 0.5% of GNI on foreign aid \"at a minimum, as soon as possible\". The committee also found long-term funding for development is \"essential\" to ensure value for money is achieved. However, they accused the government of seeing value for money only in terms of the taxpayer, saying that downplays \"equity and the importance of poverty reduction\" and causes tension. They agreed accountability to the taxpayer is \"key to reducing poverty globally, and maximising the impact of each pound to do so, must remain the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's central tenet for official development assistance spending\". Spending on migrant hotels Spending on migrant hotels in the UK was also criticised by the MPs, who said while international aid rules mean they can cover refugee hosting for the first 12 months in the UK, given the recent cuts, that is \"incompatible with the spirit\" of the UN's OECD Development Assistance Committee rules. \"Excessive spend on hotel costs is not an effective use of development budget,\" they said. The committee recommended costs of housing refugees should be capped \"at a fixed percentage\" of total foreign aid spending \"to protect a rapidly diminishing envelope of funding\". Read more: Govt struggles to slash aid spent on asylum hotels  'Short-sighted' Reacting to the report, Timothy Ingram, head of UK advocacy at WaterAid, said: \"The UK government's decision to cut the aid budget was one that defied both logic and humanity. Aid when delivered effectively in partnership with local communities is not charity - it's an investment in a safer and more prosperous world. \"Undermining it, especially vital finance for water, weakens the world's resilience to climate shocks, pandemics, and conflict - impacting the one in 10 people without access to clean water, and ultimately making us all less safe. \"This is a short-sighted political decision with long-term consequences for the UK's stability, economy and global standing. We join with MPs in urging the government, once again, to urgently reconsider.\" Lack of transparency over private contractors' spending In the report, MPs said it is worried the Foreign Office has not reviewed aid spending on multilateral organisations, which allows the UK less direct influence over spending, such as the World Bank or vaccine organisation Gavi since 2016, despite spending nearly £3bn on them in 2024. They said the use of private contractors does not offer inherently poor value for money, but a lack of transparency and data can mean under-delivering and a loss of \"in-house\" expertise. 'Tragic error' Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee, said: \"Ensuring aid delivers genuine value for money has never been more important. As major donors tighten their belts, we have to ensure that every penny we spend goes to the people most in need. \"The former Department for International Development was rightly seen as a world leader in value for money; the FCDO is broadly hanging on to that reputation. But it must make some urgent improvements. \"Reducing poverty must be the central aim of the development budget. While accountability to the taxpayer is an important consideration, the FCDO's current definition of value for money risks diverting focus away from improving the lives of the most vulnerable - the very reason the aid budget exists at all. \"The savage aid cuts announced this year are already proving to be a tragic error that will cost lives and livelihoods, undermine our international standing and ultimately threaten our national security. They must be reversed. \"Value for money is critical to making the most of a shrinking aid budget. While this report finds some positives, the government must take urgent action to wipe out waste and ensure the money we are still spending makes a genuine difference.\""

Officers targeted alleged drug kingpins in the Comando Vermelho gang and their money-laundering operations on Tuesday, leading to clashes so severe that health services, schools and transport were disrupted. They arrested 81 people and issued 250 warrants during the operation involving 2,500 security personnel across the Alemao and Penha favela, or slums, near the city's international airport. The number of dead, including four police officers, was confirmed by the city's governor, Claudio Castro, and is more than twice Rio's previous most deadly police operation. Governor Castro said on social media: \"We stand firm confronting narcoterrorism.\" Bursts of gunfire could be heard across the area from early in the day and smoke appeared above the city as gang members burned cars to slow the progress of armoured police vehicles.

Dozens of schools, medical facilities and bus services were impacted as traffic became clogged across several neighborhoods. However, some civil society groups criticised the heavy casualties in a military-style operation, including Carolina Ricardo, executive director of the security think tank Sou da Paz, who called it a tragedy. \"This is a completely failed approach, because it does not actually target the links in the drug production chain,\" she said.

The government will launch a six-week consultation over plans to expand right-to-work checks to include more employers - including in the so-called gig economy. Politics latest: Sky News challenges Peter Mandelson over Jeffrey Epstein links Under existing laws, right-to-work checks to verify someone is eligible to work in the UK are needed only for companies with traditional employer to employee contracts. However, ministers want to close this loophole so that the same checks apply to casual, temporary or subcontracted workers. Under the new plans, employers who fail to carry out such checks could face up to five years in prison or fines of £60,000 for each illegal worker they have employed.

Home Office sources confirmed that more than 36,816 people - the total for 2024 - have now crossed the Channel so far in 2025. Under Operation Sterling, the government has invested £5m into immigration enforcement in an acknowledgment that the relaxed UK labour market can act as a pull factor for those making the dangerous journey.  The issue came to a head earlier this year when shadow home secretary Chris Philp made an unannounced visit to an asylum hotel where he said he found \"clear evidence of illegal working for Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats\".

Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat have previously told Sky News they are continuing to strengthen the technology they use to remove anyone working illegally.  In July, the Home Office struck an agreement with the firms to equip them with tools to identify patterns of misuse and riders who are not allowed to work in the UK. As part of the deal, the government will share the locations of asylum hotels. Home Secretary Shabana Mamhood said: \"Illegal working creates an incentive for people attempting to arrive in this country illegally. No more. \"Those found to be illegally working in beauty salons, car washes and as delivery drivers will be arrested, detained and removed from this country. \"I will do whatever it takes to secure Britain's borders.\""

        "Content": "Blasts have been reported in Gaza after Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his military to carry out \"powerful\" air strikes. Witnesses said they saw explosions and heard tank fire in Gaza City and Deir al Balah. An Associated Press reporter in Deir al Balah heard tanks firing from an area controlled by the Israeli army, and, in Gaza City, two health officials reported strikes, including near the Shifa hospital. At least two people were killed, and four others wounded, by a strike on a neighbourhood south of Gaza City, according to Gaza's Civil Defence. The announcement of strikes came shortly after Israel said that Hamas had opened fire on its forces in southern Gaza on Tuesday. Hamas has denied involvement in the attack in the city of Rafah. The militant Palestinian group also said in a statement that it remained committed to the US-backed ceasefire deal. Mr Netanyahu had also accused Hamas of violating the three-week-old ceasefire in the territory by handing over remains that were of an Israeli hostage who was already recovered. A statement from the prime minister's office said: \"Following the security consultations, Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed the military echelon to carry out powerful strikes in the Gaza Strip immediately.\" US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire, which began on 10 October, was holding, telling reporters: \"That doesn't mean there aren't going to be little skirmishes here and there. \"We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an (Israeli military) soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president's peace is going to hold despite that.\" Hamas on Tuesday said that it would postpone the planned handover of a body of a hostage it had recovered, claiming violations of the ceasefire by Israel. In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in Rafah, and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official.  An Israeli military official told Sky's Middle East correspondent Adam Parsons that Hamas have \"shown their true face\". The official told him: \"Hamas violated the ceasefire once again, carrying out an attack against IDF forces east to the yellow line, an area under Israeli control. \"This is yet another blatant violation of the ceasefire. This comes after Hamas has also shown their true face and the fact that are pretending to not know where the remaining hostages are.\" Hamas said on the Telegram messaging app that any Israeli escalation of attacks in Gaza would hinder search and recovery operations, and delay the return of the bodies of Israeli soldiers. There are thought to be 13 bodies of hostages still in Gaza. Read more:Red Cross and Egyptian teams allowed into GazaIsrael backing armed groups despite Gaza ceasefire Speaking to Sky News, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said: \"The first line of this agreement is that all of our hostages should have been returned on the first day of this agreement. \"They were supposed to give back all of our hostages, and there was supposed to be a ceasefire. There are still 13 of our murdered hostages (in Gaza). \"And secondly, Hamas are firing on our troops. That is not a ceasefire.\" 'This is not about ceasing fire' Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on Palestine, claimed on Sky News that there is an \"ongoing genocide\" in Gaza, an assertion Israel has always strongly denied, when asked about today's events. Ms Albanese said: \"There is a genocide ongoing. You want me to comment on the fact there is a ceasefire. \"I'm even uncomfortable with the term 'ceasefire', because the people in Gaza have been starved, been bombed, been left without homes. This is not about ceasing fire, it's about ceasing genocide. Israel has no right to be in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. \"If Israel comes to your studio and tells you 'they have attacked a soldier in Gaza'. What was the Israeli soldier doing in Gaza in the first place?\" After the ceasefire took effect, all 20 living hostages were freed in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, but the remains of the dead have been slow to be repatriated. Hamas has said there are problems finding them due to a lack of equipment to sift through the devastation and rubble in Gaza. The search for hostage bodies had been stepped up over the past few days after the arrival of heavy machinery from Egypt. Bulldozers were working in Khan Younis, and further north in Nuseirat, with Hamas fighters deployed around them. Some bodies are believed to be in Hamas' network of tunnels below Gaza."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government's decision to slash foreign aid will lead to unrest, further crises and threaten UK security, a group of cross-party MPs has warned. A report by the International Development Committee found the decision in February to reduce aid to 0.3% of gross national income (GNI) by 2027/28 - coupled with the US cutting its aid budget - is having a severe impact. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates The foreign aid budget was cut to invest in defence from 0.5% of GNI, which was meant to be an interim reduction from 0.7% to cope with economic challenges caused by the pandemic. Total aid spending is set to reduce from £14.1bn in 2024 to £9.4bn by 2028/29. The committee, chaired by Labour MP Sarah Champion, said spending is being prioritised on humanitarian aid over development, which \"builds long-term resilience and should lead to reducing the need for humanitarian aid\". They said the international development minister, Baroness Chapman, has made it clear \"the UK will remain a leading humanitarian actor\".  But the committee said while they are glad those in \"desperate need of aid will be prioritised, particularly in the regions of Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan\", they are concerned about the long-term effect of pulling development aid. \"We are concerned that slashing development aid will continue to lead to unrest and further crises in the future, presenting a threat to UK security,\" the MPs said. Risk to UK's national security They said a reduction in foreign aid will have \"devastating consequences across the world\". The committee said it recognises an increase in defence spending is needed, but \"to do this at the expense of the world's most vulnerable undermines not only the UK's soft power, but also its national security\". They said the government must make \"every effort\" to return to spending 0.5% of GNI on foreign aid \"at a minimum, as soon as possible\". The committee also found long-term funding for development is \"essential\" to ensure value for money is achieved. However, they accused the government of seeing value for money only in terms of the taxpayer, saying that downplays \"equity and the importance of poverty reduction\" and causes tension. They agreed accountability to the taxpayer is \"key to reducing poverty globally, and maximising the impact of each pound to do so, must remain the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's central tenet for official development assistance spending\". Spending on migrant hotels Spending on migrant hotels in the UK was also criticised by the MPs, who said while international aid rules mean they can cover refugee hosting for the first 12 months in the UK, given the recent cuts, that is \"incompatible with the spirit\" of the UN's OECD Development Assistance Committee rules. \"Excessive spend on hotel costs is not an effective use of development budget,\" they said. The committee recommended costs of housing refugees should be capped \"at a fixed percentage\" of total foreign aid spending \"to protect a rapidly diminishing envelope of funding\". Read more: Govt struggles to slash aid spent on asylum hotels  'Short-sighted' Reacting to the report, Timothy Ingram, head of UK advocacy at WaterAid, said: \"The UK government's decision to cut the aid budget was one that defied both logic and humanity. Aid when delivered effectively in partnership with local communities is not charity - it's an investment in a safer and more prosperous world. \"Undermining it, especially vital finance for water, weakens the world's resilience to climate shocks, pandemics, and conflict - impacting the one in 10 people without access to clean water, and ultimately making us all less safe. \"This is a short-sighted political decision with long-term consequences for the UK's stability, economy and global standing. We join with MPs in urging the government, once again, to urgently reconsider.\" Lack of transparency over private contractors' spending In the report, MPs said it is worried the Foreign Office has not reviewed aid spending on multilateral organisations, which allows the UK less direct influence over spending, such as the World Bank or vaccine organisation Gavi since 2016, despite spending nearly £3bn on them in 2024. They said the use of private contractors does not offer inherently poor value for money, but a lack of transparency and data can mean under-delivering and a loss of \"in-house\" expertise. 'Tragic error' Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee, said: \"Ensuring aid delivers genuine value for money has never been more important. As major donors tighten their belts, we have to ensure that every penny we spend goes to the people most in need. \"The former Department for International Development was rightly seen as a world leader in value for money; the FCDO is broadly hanging on to that reputation. But it must make some urgent improvements. \"Reducing poverty must be the central aim of the development budget. While accountability to the taxpayer is an important consideration, the FCDO's current definition of value for money risks diverting focus away from improving the lives of the most vulnerable - the very reason the aid budget exists at all. \"The savage aid cuts announced this year are already proving to be a tragic error that will cost lives and livelihoods, undermine our international standing and ultimately threaten our national security. They must be reversed. \"Value for money is critical to making the most of a shrinking aid budget. While this report finds some positives, the government must take urgent action to wipe out waste and ensure the money we are still spending makes a genuine difference.\""

        "Content": " A university academic who is receiving \"substantial damages\" for how he was portrayed in a film has told Sky News he hasn't received an apology from star Steve Coogan - nor the two companies involved in its production. Richard Taylor said he was \"shell-shocked\" after seeing The Lost King for the first time, a film about how Richard III's skeleton was discovered below a car park in Leicester. He told The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee: \"I wasn't consulted or even knew I was in the film. The first I hear is I get a phone call while I'm on holiday - and eventually, after press previews, I persuade the producers to let me see a preview.\" Last year, a judge ruled that Mr Taylor was depicted as \"smug, unruly dismissive and patronising\" - with the plot suggesting he \"knowingly\" misled the public. \"I'm portrayed by someone on screen who looks like me, who sounds like me, who dresses like me - but behaves in a way that falls so far short of the standards I set for myself and what others might reasonably expect of me,\" the academic explained. Mr Taylor revealed he received emails at work telling him to \"rot in hell\", while others described him as a \"disgrace\". He added: \"Something that was a collaborative effort that showcased the best of British universities in my view was turned into this farce - where I was the villain and portrayed in a way that was completely inconsistent with the reality and the truth.\" Now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, Mr Taylor said \"none of the facts\" in the 2022 film were ever checked - and the Alan Partridge star, his company Baby Cow and Pathe Productions did not reach out to him before its release. \"The producers just went ahead, filmed it, produced it, stuck it out there and left me to deal with all the flack and all the fallout from it. Grossly unfair and I feel vindicated from the result we've achieved,\" he told Sky News. 'The film's going to look pretty silly' As part of the settlement, an on-screen clarification will now be added to the start of the film, but no scenes will be removed. When asked whether he was satisfied with this outcome, Mr Taylor replied: \"I'd have liked them to re-edit the film, but one's got to be realistic about what one can achieve. \"The insertion of the card will say that the person on screen is a fictitious portrayal - and the real Richard Taylor didn't behave like that … so the film's going to look pretty silly.\" Read more UK news:Community plagued by 25,000 tonnes of illegal wasteWhat tax rises could be announced in the budget? The case was due to proceed to trial, but a High Court hearing on Monday heard that the parties had settled the claim. In a statement afterwards, Coogan had said: \"If it wasn't for Philippa Langley, Richard III would still be lying under a car park in Leicester. It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity.\" He went on to add: \"That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.\" Reacting to the statement, Mr Taylor argued \"it's a pretty strange definition of happy when you've had to settle a defamation claim for seven figures in costs\". He said: \"Steve is never anything other than certain in himself and of his own position, but I think he's got it wrong - basic facts were not checked.\""

        "Content": "Julia Wandelt, a woman who claimed to be the missing British toddler Madeleine McCann, told Kate McCann: \"I know you loved me,\" a court has heard. The 24-year-old woman from southwest Poland is on trial at Leicester Crown Court along with Karen Spragg, 61, from Cardiff, accused of one count of stalking the McCann family by calling and messaging them and turning up at their home. On the second day of questioning from her defence, Tom Price KC, Wandelt told the jury that she travelled to the McCann family home in Leicestershire, in December last year, to try and speak to Gerry and Kate McCann. This came after she repeatedly tried to contact the parents and tried to meet them in person at an annual vigil held for Madeleine McCann. During her time in the witness box, Wandelt said she first began thinking she may be the missing Briton when she began suffering with mental health issues and questioning her identity. Madeleine went missing during a family holiday to Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May 2007. What exactly happened to her is not known. As it happened: McCann's alleged stalker confronts parents at family home 'Julia, I think you need help' Wandelt and Spragg travelled to the McCann family home and tried to speak to Mrs McCann outside the property on 7 December, 2024, the court was told. Giving her version of the meeting, Vandelt told the jury: \"I said Kate. She turned around, she started crying, I started crying. \"She started crying straight away, I got too upset. I planned to say other things, I did not say any of them. \"I said I would like to speak with you and can we speak for like two minutes? She said no. She said she will call the police. I said the police don't care. I think I said if she wants to call the police she can - maybe I said it.\" Then, the court heard that Mrs McCann went inside the house and Wandelt \"knocked\" on the door while crying, still trying to talk to her. When Maddie's father returned home shortly after, he told Wandelt: \"Julia, I think you need help,\" the court heard. 'I know you loved me' Prior to this meeting, Wandelt had made repeated attempts to contact Mr and Mrs McCann, she told the court. She added that she didn't think this was harassment and that she had also tried to contact relatives and family friends. In one message, the court was told that Wandelt said to Mrs McCann: \"I know people believe Maddie's dead, well she's not.\" In the message Wandelt added: \"I know you loved Madeleine. I know you loved me.\" Explaining her repeated attempts to contact the McCanns, Wandelt claimed that the police were failing the family and also herself and she was reaching out to help them. Here's a summary of some of the other top lines heard by the court in Leicester today: • Wandelt told the court she felt \"ashamed\" to receive around £400 from people on the internet because she \"knows what it looks like\"; • The Polish national signed off a letter to Mrs McCann, one of her repeated attempts to contact her, with: \"Lots of love, Madeleine\", the jury was told; • She also claimed to the court that contacting the family was a \"last resort\" and that she contacted multiple law enforcement agencies, charities and groups linked to the search for Madeleine McCann prior to that; • The jury was similarly told that Wandelt travelled to the US with a woman called Fia Johnasson, who, the jury was told, messaged her when she set up an Instagram account called \"I am Madeleine McCann\"; • While in the US, Wandelt alleged that Ms Johnasson facilitated her appearance on the Dr Phil chat show, but told the court she was not paid for it; • And Wandelt repeatedly said she was \"not a liar or attention seeker\". The trial continues."

        "Content": " Sky News has exclusively challenged Lord Peter Mandelson over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. It is the first time the Labour peer has been seen in the UK since he was fired as the ambassador to the US in September. Lord Mandelson was sacked due to his links to the late sex offender. It emerged over a series of days that the so-called \"Prince of Darkness\" had maintained his relationship with the disgraced financier following his first conviction, and had told him to fight it in the courts. It led Sir Keir Starmer to dismiss him, just one day after he had publicly backed the peer in the House of Commons at Prime Minister's Questions. Sir Keir said new information had come to light, which showed Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein was \"materially different\" to what he had told the government.

Officers targeted alleged drug kingpins in the Comando Vermelho gang and their money-laundering operations on Tuesday, leading to clashes so severe that health services, schools and transport were disrupted. They arrested 81 people and issued 250 warrants during the operation involving 2,500 security personnel across the Alemao and Penha favela, or slums, near the city's international airport. The number of dead, including four police officers, was confirmed by the city's governor, Claudio Castro, and is more than twice Rio's previous most deadly police operation. Governor Castro said on social media: \"We stand firm confronting narcoterrorism.\" Bursts of gunfire could be heard across the area from early in the day and smoke appeared above the city as gang members burned cars to slow the progress of armoured police vehicles.

        "Content": "Blasts have been reported in Gaza after Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his military to carry out \"powerful\" air strikes. Witnesses said they saw explosions and heard tank fire in Gaza City and Deir al Balah. An Associated Press reporter in Deir al Balah heard tanks firing from an area controlled by the Israeli army, and, in Gaza City, two health officials reported strikes, including near the Shifa hospital. At least two people were killed, and four others wounded, by a strike on a neighbourhood south of Gaza City, according to Gaza's Civil Defence. The announcement of strikes came shortly after Israel said that Hamas had opened fire on its forces in southern Gaza on Tuesday. Hamas has denied involvement in the attack in the city of Rafah. The militant Palestinian group also said in a statement that it remained committed to the US-backed ceasefire deal. Mr Netanyahu had also accused Hamas of violating the three-week-old ceasefire in the territory by handing over remains that were of an Israeli hostage who was already recovered. A statement from the prime minister's office said: \"Following the security consultations, Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed the military echelon to carry out powerful strikes in the Gaza Strip immediately.\" US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire, which began on 10 October, was holding, telling reporters: \"That doesn't mean there aren't going to be little skirmishes here and there. \"We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an (Israeli military) soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president's peace is going to hold despite that.\" Hamas on Tuesday said that it would postpone the planned handover of a body of a hostage it had recovered, claiming violations of the ceasefire by Israel. In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in Rafah, and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official.  An Israeli military official told Sky's Middle East correspondent Adam Parsons that Hamas have \"shown their true face\". The official told him: \"Hamas violated the ceasefire once again, carrying out an attack against IDF forces east to the yellow line, an area under Israeli control. \"This is yet another blatant violation of the ceasefire. This comes after Hamas has also shown their true face and the fact that are pretending to not know where the remaining hostages are.\" Hamas said on the Telegram messaging app that any Israeli escalation of attacks in Gaza would hinder search and recovery operations, and delay the return of the bodies of Israeli soldiers. There are thought to be 13 bodies of hostages still in Gaza. Read more:Red Cross and Egyptian teams allowed into GazaIsrael backing armed groups despite Gaza ceasefire Speaking to Sky News, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said: \"The first line of this agreement is that all of our hostages should have been returned on the first day of this agreement. \"They were supposed to give back all of our hostages, and there was supposed to be a ceasefire. There are still 13 of our murdered hostages (in Gaza). \"And secondly, Hamas are firing on our troops. That is not a ceasefire.\" 'This is not about ceasing fire' Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on Palestine, claimed on Sky News that there is an \"ongoing genocide\" in Gaza, an assertion Israel has always strongly denied, when asked about today's events. Ms Albanese said: \"There is a genocide ongoing. You want me to comment on the fact there is a ceasefire. \"I'm even uncomfortable with the term 'ceasefire', because the people in Gaza have been starved, been bombed, been left without homes. This is not about ceasing fire, it's about ceasing genocide. Israel has no right to be in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. \"If Israel comes to your studio and tells you 'they have attacked a soldier in Gaza'. What was the Israeli soldier doing in Gaza in the first place?\" After the ceasefire took effect, all 20 living hostages were freed in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, but the remains of the dead have been slow to be repatriated. Hamas has said there are problems finding them due to a lack of equipment to sift through the devastation and rubble in Gaza. The search for hostage bodies had been stepped up over the past few days after the arrival of heavy machinery from Egypt. Bulldozers were working in Khan Younis, and further north in Nuseirat, with Hamas fighters deployed around them. Some bodies are believed to be in Hamas' network of tunnels below Gaza."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  It has been tested and challenged, but this fragile ceasefire remains in place. And for that, at least, the Middle East is presently breathing a sign of relief. There are probably three factors at play here. Firstly, Israel, and particularly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, felt it had to respond to a series of provocations. Foremost among them today was an attack against one of its soldiers, who was in Israeli-controlled territory when targeted. A week ago, Israel responded to the killing of two of its soldiers with devastating air strikes on the Gaza Strip, so a pattern was established: \"If you attack our people, we will target you, but with greater ferocity.\" But there is also the video, filmed by an Israeli military drone, that seems to show Hamas operatives pretending to discover human remains that they had, in fact, just taken from a building and buried. Israel says this is, at best, a grotesque display of bad taste and, at worst, demonstrable evidence that Hamas is lying about not knowing where to find the deceased hostages. In the video, we see the remains, wrapped in a shroud, handed over to members of the Red Cross, who are unaware of the deceit, sparking a rare outburst of anger from the charity. \"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged when so much depends on this agreement being upheld, and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones,\" said its statement. Fury in Israel If the Red Cross are angry, a lot of Israelis are furious. The forum representing the families of hostages is calling for more military action, and the far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet are itching for the offensive to recommence. But the signs are that, for the moment at least, the reprisals have ceased. So Israel's response was inevitable. But Hamas's position is less predictable. How will Hamas respond? For a start, they are distancing themselves from the attack on the Israeli soldiers, suggesting that the people involved were not following orders from Hamas, and might not even be part of Hamas at all. For another, Hamas tried to calm the anger around the bulldozer video by rapidly claiming to have found the body of another hostage, and offering to return it within hours. That deal was rescinded after Israel launched its attacks, but, assuming this video is accurate, Hamas will know it undermines the organisation's credibility. It will be keen to make amends, to soothe doubts and to try to stay on a path that, long term, allows Hamas to still have a part to play in Gaza's future. America's role But the third factor is perhaps the most decisive. The US, in the shape of Vice President JD Vance, responded quickly and calmly, saying the ceasefire in Gaza was holding, describing the violence as \"little skirmishes here and there\". He went on: \"We know that Israel will respond, but the president's peace is going to hold.\" And that may yet be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Israel, after all, told America of its reprisal plans before a bomb had been dropped or a bullet fired. Netanyahu is well aware that the support of Donald Trump lays behind everything he does, and aspires to do. And he's also aware that Trump will not want the ceasefire, which has the word Trump right at the top, to be a failure. Read more:Netanyahu accuses Hamas of 'clear violation' So, for the moment at least, the ceasefire holds, even if the firing hasn't really ceased and the first condition, about the return of all hostages, living and dead, has not been fulfilled. But it holds because, for all the anger, mistrust, and the sense of being wronged, nobody wants to be seen to break it."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government's decision to slash foreign aid will lead to unrest, further crises and threaten UK security, a group of cross-party MPs has warned. A report by the International Development Committee found the decision in February to reduce aid to 0.3% of gross national income (GNI) by 2027/28 - coupled with the US cutting its aid budget - is having a severe impact. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates The foreign aid budget was cut to invest in defence from 0.5% of GNI, which was meant to be an interim reduction from 0.7% to cope with economic challenges caused by the pandemic. Total aid spending is set to reduce from £14.1bn in 2024 to £9.4bn by 2028/29. The committee, chaired by Labour MP Sarah Champion, said spending is being prioritised on humanitarian aid over development, which \"builds long-term resilience and should lead to reducing the need for humanitarian aid\". They said the international development minister, Baroness Chapman, has made it clear \"the UK will remain a leading humanitarian actor\".  But the committee said while they are glad those in \"desperate need of aid will be prioritised, particularly in the regions of Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan\", they are concerned about the long-term effect of pulling development aid. \"We are concerned that slashing development aid will continue to lead to unrest and further crises in the future, presenting a threat to UK security,\" the MPs said. Risk to UK's national security They said a reduction in foreign aid will have \"devastating consequences across the world\". The committee said it recognises an increase in defence spending is needed, but \"to do this at the expense of the world's most vulnerable undermines not only the UK's soft power, but also its national security\". They said the government must make \"every effort\" to return to spending 0.5% of GNI on foreign aid \"at a minimum, as soon as possible\". The committee also found long-term funding for development is \"essential\" to ensure value for money is achieved. However, they accused the government of seeing value for money only in terms of the taxpayer, saying that downplays \"equity and the importance of poverty reduction\" and causes tension. They agreed accountability to the taxpayer is \"key to reducing poverty globally, and maximising the impact of each pound to do so, must remain the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's central tenet for official development assistance spending\". Spending on migrant hotels Spending on migrant hotels in the UK was also criticised by the MPs, who said while international aid rules mean they can cover refugee hosting for the first 12 months in the UK, given the recent cuts, that is \"incompatible with the spirit\" of the UN's OECD Development Assistance Committee rules. \"Excessive spend on hotel costs is not an effective use of development budget,\" they said. The committee recommended costs of housing refugees should be capped \"at a fixed percentage\" of total foreign aid spending \"to protect a rapidly diminishing envelope of funding\". Read more: Govt struggles to slash aid spent on asylum hotels  'Short-sighted' Reacting to the report, Timothy Ingram, head of UK advocacy at WaterAid, said: \"The UK government's decision to cut the aid budget was one that defied both logic and humanity. Aid when delivered effectively in partnership with local communities is not charity - it's an investment in a safer and more prosperous world. \"Undermining it, especially vital finance for water, weakens the world's resilience to climate shocks, pandemics, and conflict - impacting the one in 10 people without access to clean water, and ultimately making us all less safe. \"This is a short-sighted political decision with long-term consequences for the UK's stability, economy and global standing. We join with MPs in urging the government, once again, to urgently reconsider.\" Lack of transparency over private contractors' spending In the report, MPs said it is worried the Foreign Office has not reviewed aid spending on multilateral organisations, which allows the UK less direct influence over spending, such as the World Bank or vaccine organisation Gavi since 2016, despite spending nearly £3bn on them in 2024. They said the use of private contractors does not offer inherently poor value for money, but a lack of transparency and data can mean under-delivering and a loss of \"in-house\" expertise. 'Tragic error' Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee, said: \"Ensuring aid delivers genuine value for money has never been more important. As major donors tighten their belts, we have to ensure that every penny we spend goes to the people most in need. \"The former Department for International Development was rightly seen as a world leader in value for money; the FCDO is broadly hanging on to that reputation. But it must make some urgent improvements. \"Reducing poverty must be the central aim of the development budget. While accountability to the taxpayer is an important consideration, the FCDO's current definition of value for money risks diverting focus away from improving the lives of the most vulnerable - the very reason the aid budget exists at all. \"The savage aid cuts announced this year are already proving to be a tragic error that will cost lives and livelihoods, undermine our international standing and ultimately threaten our national security. They must be reversed. \"Value for money is critical to making the most of a shrinking aid budget. While this report finds some positives, the government must take urgent action to wipe out waste and ensure the money we are still spending makes a genuine difference.\""

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n  Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers fled a key city in the hours before the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured its infantry division - leaving around 200,000 civilians trapped, Sky News understands. The SAF withdrew from military positions in the heart of Al Fashir, the capital of North Darfur, and the symbolic site was captured by the RSF with no resistance. Insiders told Sky News that the army struck a deal to facilitate safe passage for their soldiers. Remaining fighters, many of them local resistance forces from Al Fashir, withdrew to the western neighbourhood Daraja Oula, where civilians have been seeking refuge from intensified RSF shelling and drone attacks in recent months. Summary executions of the senior commanders who stayed behind are being shared on RSF social media channels in violent videos and celebratory posts. Other videos show queues of unarmed men leaving Al Fashir on foot. A senior humanitarian source told Sky News that aid workers first confirmed the arrival of army soldiers to displacement centres in the town Tawila, 50km (30 miles) from Al Fashir, on Monday evening in civilian clothing, having surrendered their weapons.  Hundreds of injured civilians and malnourished children have also arrived in Tawila since the fall of Al Fashir. More than 400 patients checked into the Medicines Sans Frontieres hospital on arrival with malnutrition and trauma wounds since Sunday, according to Medical Team Leader Dr Mouna Hanebali. \"We are seeing a lot of gunshots infected, unstable fractures and wounds infected as well - those are the injuries and torture. We see lots of malnutrition, all of the kids are malnourished, and even most of the adults as well,\" says Dr Mouna. \"Yesterday, we had around 70 (patients) under five. All the injured are mainly men, but still we are receiving kids, elderly, women, but the main proportion is young men.\" Ethnically-motivated attacks against civilians are being reported across Al Fashir at the hands of the RSF. Humanitarian groups are pushing for the evacuation of civilians as civil society groups report increasing attacks on first responders and community volunteers who are currently unable to access the safe passage privileges used by some soldiers to escape the RSF - after enduring 18 months of forced starvation and shelling by the paramilitary group. After 24 hours of silence from the Sudanese military, SAF commander-in-chief Abdelfattah Burhan confirmed whispers of abandonment.  He said: \"Everyone is following what happened in Al Fashir. Certainly, the leadership there, including the security committee, estimated that they should leave the city due to the systematic destruction and killing of civilians it was subjected to.\" Army soldiers have withdrawn from other state capitals in Darfur, including Al Geneina and Nyala. Soldiers told Sky News at the time that those instructions came directly from the military command.

        "Content": "A cloud-seeding experiment has been conducted over New Delhi to induce rainfall and clear the city's smog-filled air - with the move sparking anger among residents. A plane sprayed chemicals into clouds over some areas of the Indian capital to encourage rain and wash pollutants from the air, which remained in the \"very poor\" category, according to air quality monitors. India had six of the 10 most polluted cities globally, and New Delhi is the most polluted capital, according to a 2024 report from air quality monitoring database IQAir. Cloud seeding is a weather modification method that releases chemicals into clouds to trigger rain. It has been used in drought-prone regions, such as the western United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), though experts say its effectiveness remains uncertain. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, an environment minister in the Delhi government, said the trial was performed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, with more planned in the coming days. He said authorities were anticipating a brief spell of rainfall in some parts of the city in the following hours. New Delhi and its surrounding region, home to more than 30 million people, routinely rank among the world's most polluted. Air quality worsens in the capital every winter as farmers burn crop residue in nearby states and cooler temperatures keep hold of the smoke, which mixes with vehicle and industrial emissions. Pollution levels are often nearly 20 times higher than the World Health Organisation's (WHO) safe limit. Read more from Sky News:Fawlty Towers actress Prunella Scales has diedEngland cricket legend James Anderson knightedCyclone Montha approaches India Authorities have restricted diesel generators, imposed construction bans, and deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to curb the haze. But critics say there needs to be a long-term solution that dramatically reduces pollution itself, instead of actions that aim to mitigate the effects after it has already covered the region. Krishna Achuta Rao, professor at the centre for atmospheric sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, said that seeding clouds to reduce air pollution is ineffective because it can dissipate pollution only for a few days, after which the air quality returns to its former state. Instead, Professor Rao said, implementing strong laws that can result in reducing emissions from all sources - including industries, vehicular pollution and construction - is the only way to clean India's air. Last week, thick smog blanketed New Delhi after millions celebrated the Hindu festival Diwali with firecrackers, sending air pollution levels soaring to hazardous levels. Those celebrating in the city burst firecrackers late into Monday night, filling the air with smoke and fine particles that mixed with seasonal pollution and stagnant weather conditions. By Tuesday morning, the city's Air Quality Index had climbed above 350 in several neighbourhoods, a level considered \"severe\" and dangerous to breathe, according to the WHO's daily recommended maximum exposure."

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Tyler Robinson, 22, in the 10 September shooting of the conservative activist on a Utah college campus. His lawyers argued that photos of their client in a prison uniform and wearing shackles could prejudice future jurors. Given the extensive press interest in the case, they claimed any images of the defendant would likely spread widely. Judge Tony Graf agreed that the case had drawn \"extraordinary\" attention from the media and the general public. During a virtual court hearing, he said: \"Mr Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent.\" The charges he faces are extremely serious and he presents safety concerns in the courtroom, however, Judge Graf said.  While Robinson will therefore have to appear in restraints, the media will be blocked from photographing or filming them. Robinson, who has no prior criminal history, has been charged with aggravated murder in a case that has generated huge attention. He has been accused of shooting Mr Kirk - a fervent supporter of President Donald Trump who worked to steer young voters towards conservatism - from a rooftop overlooking a crowded courtyard at Utah Valley University. He was arrested the following night when he turned himself in to police. Read more:Kirk's death spurs movement onHow was conservative activist killed?Who was Charlie Kirk?

Judge Graf ordered Robinson to appear on 16 January and 30 January for his first in-person public hearings."

        "Content": "An estimated 1.2 million people a week have conversations with ChatGPT that indicate they are planning to take their own lives. The figure comes from its parent company OpenAI, which revealed 0.15% of users send messages including \"explicit indicators of potential suicide planning or intent\". Earlier this month, the company's chief executive Sam Altman estimated that ChatGPT now has more than 800 million weekly active users. While the tech giant does aim to direct vulnerable people to crisis helplines, it admitted \"in some rare cases, the model may not behave as intended in these sensitive situations\".  OpenAI evaluated over 1,000 \"challenging self-harm and suicide conversations\" with its latest model GPT-5 and found it was compliant with \"desired behaviours\" 91% of the time. But this would potentially mean that tens of thousands of people are being exposed to AI content that could exacerbate mental health problems. The company has previously warned that safeguards designed to protect users can be weakened in longer conversations - and work is under way to address this. \"ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,\" OpenAI explained.

Court filings suggest that, hours before he died, the teenager uploaded a photo that appeared to show his suicide plan - and when he asked whether it would work, ChatGPT offered to help him \"upgrade\" it. Last week, the Raines updated their lawsuit and accused OpenAI of weakening the safeguards to prevent self-harm in the weeks before his death in April this year. In a statement, the company said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with the Raine family for their unthinkable loss.

Why? \n                  Amazon agrees historic $2.5bn settlement for allegedly duping customers into Prime membership\n                 \n                  Amazon to invest £40bn in UK - with more warehouses and thousands of new jobs \n                 \n                  Amazon chooses Darlington for launch of drone delivery service\n                 The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has been blamed for the cuts. In a message sent to staff, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, alluded to the criticism that the company is cutting jobs while profiting £19.2bn in results published in July. \"Some may ask why we're reducing roles when the company is performing well,\" she wrote. \"What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\" Amazon is also continuing to unravel some of the hiring it made during the COVID-19 pandemic and has warned about reducing headcount and bureaucracy. In May 2021, for example, the business said it was hiring more than 10,000 UK jobs. The largest ever cut of 18,000 Amazon roles was announced in January 2023 when the consumer retail part of the business, including Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, were scaled back. It plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots, automating 75% of its operations, according to the New York Times. What next? Those who lose their job will be prioritised for openings within Amazon to help \"as many people as possible\" find new roles, she said. Hiring will continue, despite the latest cull, in \"key strategic areas\" while the online retail behemoth finds additional places we can \"remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains\". Amazon said it is \"shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\". In the UK, GMB said, \"We will be supporting our members across Amazon as they face this uncertain future.\" It is to announce financial results for the third quarter of this year on Thursday evening, UK time. Amazon UK has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  Rachel Reeves is unlikely to raise the basic rates of income tax and national insurance in order to avoid breaking a promise to protect \"working people\" in the budget. It comes as Sky News has obtained an internal definition of \"working people\" used by the Treasury. Officials have been tasked with protecting the income of the lower two-thirds of working people, meaning in theory people earning more than around £46,000 could face a squeeze in the budget. However, this is likely to rule out increases to the basic rate of income tax and national insurance, since they would pay more tax. Politics latest - follow live Rachel Reeves is unlikely to hike these taxes because the Treasury says those earning £45,000 or less qualify as \"working people\". Sky News understands that ministers are still considering whether to break manifesto pledges, and these options remain on the table. The main elements of the budget must be finalised by the middle of November, in the next two to three weeks.  Rachel Reeves is facing a black hole in the budget that could exceed £35bn, after the latest Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast came in worse than expected. The OBR had been anticipated to downgrade expected future productivity rates by 0.1% or 0.2% of GDP. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈        Each extra 0.1% point means an additional £7bn drop in revenue and a corresponding increase in the size of the black hole the Chancellor must fill in the budget. However, now the OBR is expected to downgrade future trend growth by 0.3%. This means that the black hole left by the productivity downgrade is around £21bn. The chancellor needs to find around £10bn because of welfare U-turns, reinstating the winter fuel allowance and other policy changes.  Read more from Sky News:Budget 2025: What tax rises and spending cuts could Reeves announce? On Monday, the chancellor also said she would increase headroom - the buffer between her spending projects and borrowing limited by her fiscal rules. This is likely to cost another £5bn to £10bn, to get her out of the doom loop \"cycle\" which Ms Reeves acknowledged to Sky News she risked being stuck in. This means the total size of the black hole likely to be needed to be filled is around £35bn or £40bn. Sources insist that this figure is before the final forecasts from the OBR, and therefore is subject to change. The Treasury said it does not comment on tax measures or the size of the black hole."

        "Content": "KitKats, Gaviscon, toothpaste, and even Freddo have all fallen victim to shrinkflation, consumer group Which? has found. As families struggle with the cost of a trip to the supermarket, a survey of shoppers revealed how many products are getting smaller - while others are being downgraded with cheaper ingredients. Among the examples are: • Aquafresh complete care original toothpaste - from £1.30 for 100ml to £2 for 75ml at Tesco, Sainsbury's and Ocado • Gaviscon heartburn and indigestion liquid - from £14 for 600ml to £14 for 500ml at Sainsbury's • Sainsbury's Scottish oats - from £1.25 for 1kg to £2.10 for 500g • KitKat two-finger multipacks - from £3.60 for 21 bars to £5.50 for 18 bars at Ocado • Quality Street tubs - from £6 for 600g to £7 for 550g at Morrisons • Freddo multipacks - from £1.40 for five bars to £1.40 for four bars at Morrisons, Ocado and Tesco Which? also received reports of popular treats missing key ingredients, as manufacturers seek to cut costs. The amount of cocoa butter in white KitKats has fallen below 20%, meaning they can no longer actually be sold as white chocolate. It comes after Penguin and Club bars lost their legal status as a chocolate biscuit, as they now contain more palm oil and shea oil than cocoa - as reported in the Sky News Money blog. Which? retail editor Reena Sewraz called on supermarkets to be \"more upfront\" about price changes to help households \"already under immense financial pressure\" get better value. While keeping track of the size and weight of products can be tricky, Which? has two top tips for detecting shrinkflation. The first is to be wary of familiar products labelled as \"new\" - because the only thing that's new may end up being the smaller size. Meanwhile, the second is to pay attention to how much an item costs per 100g or 100ml, as this can be an easy way of finding out when prices change. What have the companies said? A spokeswoman for Mondelez International, which makes Cadbury products, said any change to product sizes are a \"last resort\", but it's facing \"significantly higher input costs across our supply chain\" - including for energy. A Nestle spokesman said it was seeing \"significant increases in the cost of coffee\", and some \"adjustments\" were occasionally needed \"to maintain the same high quality and delicious taste that consumers know and love\". \"Retail pricing is always at the discretion of individual retailers,\" they added. A spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation also pointed to government policy, notably national insurance increases for employers and a new packaging tax.  Fresh food prices on the rise The Which? report comes as latest figures showed fresh food costs 4.3% more than it did a year ago. The increase in October, reported by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and market researchers NIQ, was up on the 4.1% year-on-year rise in September. Overall food inflation was down slightly, though, to 3.7% from last month's 4.2%. Read more from Sky News:Surprise move for Costa CoffeeStart-ups issue warning to Reeves There has also been a slowdown in overall shop price inflation, which the BRC said was down to \"fierce competition among retailers\" ahead of Black Friday sales. The annual shopping extravaganza will this year arrive in the same week as the chancellor's budget, which is set for Wednesday 26 November. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson called on Rachel Reeves to help \"relieve some pressures\" keeping prices high, with the national insurance rise in last year's budget having \"directly contributed to rising inflation\". \"Adding further taxes on retail businesses would inevitably keep inflation higher for longer,\" Ms Dickinson warned."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Pimco, the giant bond fund manager, has offloaded hundreds of millions of pounds of Thames Water debt as the crisis-hit utility limps towards a private sector rescue deal aimed at averting the threat of temporary nationalisation. Sky News has learnt that Pimco - run by the former Man Group boss Emmanuel Roman - has in recent weeks reduced its exposure to Thames Water's mountain of debt by selling the majority of its holdings to fellow investors including Apollo Global Management, Elliott Advisors and Silver Point Capital. Further details of the trades were unclear on Tuesday, although one insider said they accounted for \"the bulk\" of Pimco's investment in the debt of Britain's biggest water and wastewater treatment company. Money blog: 'We've assets worth £1m - how much inheritance tax will we owe?' A source close to Pimco said it had taken advantage of a recent increase in the price of Thames Water bonds amid growing optimism that the company's Class A creditors will be able to reach a deal with regulators and the government to keep it in private ownership. Last month, Sky News revealed that the group of lenders which want to take control of Thames Water had pledged to the industry regulator that they would not offload the company before the end of the decade. The Class A creditor group accounts for the bulk of the company's £20bn debt pile. \n                  English water firms get lowest environmental rating since records began\n                 \n                  Thames Water defers decision on fight for higher bills\n                 \n                  Thames Water creditors to pledge no sale before 2030\n                 Pimco has had a role on the co-ordinating committee of lenders which earlier this year agreed to provide £3bn emergency loan to Thames Water to keep it afloat. Half of that sum has already been drawn down by the company, with the remaining £1.5bn accessible to Thames Water subject to a number of conditions, which have yet to be met. The first half of the loan provides sufficient liquidity to secure Thames's ability to continue operating until mid-January, while the remainder would buy Thames Water enough breathing space to trade until at least next autumn. During the summer, Sky News revealed that Steve Reed, the then environment secretary, had engaged the restructuring firm FTI Consulting to undertake contingency planning for a special administration of Thames Water. This would entail the government taking ownership of the company, which has more than 15 million customers, and its debt being transferred - at least temporarily - to the state. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is determined to avoid this outcome because of the huge constraints on Britain's public finances. Sources close to the process say that discussions between Thames Water's creditors, the company, Ofwat and other regulators have become increasingly conciliatory in recent weeks. Last week, Thames Water and Ofwat announced a further extension to their negotiations, further deferring a potential referral to competition regulators of the company's next five-year price settlement. Read more from Sky News:KKR makes surprise move to brew up Costa Coffee bidIt's not your imagination, these products are shrinking A spokesperson for the London & Valley Water consortium, which comprises the Class A creditors, said the announcement reflected \"continued progress to develop a sustainable solution which will deliver improvements for Thames Water's customers, employees and the environment\". \"We will continue to work at pace with all stakeholders with a view to concluding discussions and agreeing the terms of a transaction as soon as possible, achieving an outcome that is first and foremost in customers' interests and avoids the unnecessary cost, risk and delay of a special administration,\" the group added. Reports suggested this month that CKI Infrastructure, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, had reiterated its call for the government to nationalise Thames Water, describing the creditors' plan as \"a high-risk proposition\". CKI has made a number of previous attempts to buy the company, although its interest has been criticised by a number of prominent parliamentarians sceptical about Chinese ownership of key British infrastructure. The Hong Kong group already owns Northumbrian Water. Pimco declined to comment."

        "Content": "An estimated 1.2 million people a week have conversations with ChatGPT that indicate they are planning to take their own lives. The figure comes from its parent company OpenAI, which revealed 0.15% of users send messages including \"explicit indicators of potential suicide planning or intent\". Earlier this month, the company's chief executive Sam Altman estimated that ChatGPT now has more than 800 million weekly active users. While the tech giant does aim to direct vulnerable people to crisis helplines, it admitted \"in some rare cases, the model may not behave as intended in these sensitive situations\".  OpenAI evaluated over 1,000 \"challenging self-harm and suicide conversations\" with its latest model GPT-5 and found it was compliant with \"desired behaviours\" 91% of the time. But this would potentially mean that tens of thousands of people are being exposed to AI content that could exacerbate mental health problems. The company has previously warned that safeguards designed to protect users can be weakened in longer conversations - and work is under way to address this. \"ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,\" OpenAI explained.

Court filings suggest that, hours before he died, the teenager uploaded a photo that appeared to show his suicide plan - and when he asked whether it would work, ChatGPT offered to help him \"upgrade\" it. Last week, the Raines updated their lawsuit and accused OpenAI of weakening the safeguards to prevent self-harm in the weeks before his death in April this year. In a statement, the company said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with the Raine family for their unthinkable loss.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government's decision to slash foreign aid will lead to unrest, further crises and threaten UK security, a group of cross-party MPs has warned. A report by the International Development Committee found the decision in February to reduce aid to 0.3% of gross national income (GNI) by 2027/28 - coupled with the US cutting its aid budget - is having a severe impact. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates The foreign aid budget was cut to invest in defence from 0.5% of GNI, which was meant to be an interim reduction from 0.7% to cope with economic challenges caused by the pandemic. Total aid spending is set to reduce from £14.1bn in 2024 to £9.4bn by 2028/29. The committee, chaired by Labour MP Sarah Champion, said spending is being prioritised on humanitarian aid over development, which \"builds long-term resilience and should lead to reducing the need for humanitarian aid\". They said the international development minister, Baroness Chapman, has made it clear \"the UK will remain a leading humanitarian actor\".  But the committee said while they are glad those in \"desperate need of aid will be prioritised, particularly in the regions of Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan\", they are concerned about the long-term effect of pulling development aid. \"We are concerned that slashing development aid will continue to lead to unrest and further crises in the future, presenting a threat to UK security,\" the MPs said. Risk to UK's national security They said a reduction in foreign aid will have \"devastating consequences across the world\". The committee said it recognises an increase in defence spending is needed, but \"to do this at the expense of the world's most vulnerable undermines not only the UK's soft power, but also its national security\". They said the government must make \"every effort\" to return to spending 0.5% of GNI on foreign aid \"at a minimum, as soon as possible\". The committee also found long-term funding for development is \"essential\" to ensure value for money is achieved. However, they accused the government of seeing value for money only in terms of the taxpayer, saying that downplays \"equity and the importance of poverty reduction\" and causes tension. They agreed accountability to the taxpayer is \"key to reducing poverty globally, and maximising the impact of each pound to do so, must remain the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's central tenet for official development assistance spending\". Spending on migrant hotels Spending on migrant hotels in the UK was also criticised by the MPs, who said while international aid rules mean they can cover refugee hosting for the first 12 months in the UK, given the recent cuts, that is \"incompatible with the spirit\" of the UN's OECD Development Assistance Committee rules. \"Excessive spend on hotel costs is not an effective use of development budget,\" they said. The committee recommended costs of housing refugees should be capped \"at a fixed percentage\" of total foreign aid spending \"to protect a rapidly diminishing envelope of funding\". Read more: Govt struggles to slash aid spent on asylum hotels  'Short-sighted' Reacting to the report, Timothy Ingram, head of UK advocacy at WaterAid, said: \"The UK government's decision to cut the aid budget was one that defied both logic and humanity. Aid when delivered effectively in partnership with local communities is not charity - it's an investment in a safer and more prosperous world. \"Undermining it, especially vital finance for water, weakens the world's resilience to climate shocks, pandemics, and conflict - impacting the one in 10 people without access to clean water, and ultimately making us all less safe. \"This is a short-sighted political decision with long-term consequences for the UK's stability, economy and global standing. We join with MPs in urging the government, once again, to urgently reconsider.\" Lack of transparency over private contractors' spending In the report, MPs said it is worried the Foreign Office has not reviewed aid spending on multilateral organisations, which allows the UK less direct influence over spending, such as the World Bank or vaccine organisation Gavi since 2016, despite spending nearly £3bn on them in 2024. They said the use of private contractors does not offer inherently poor value for money, but a lack of transparency and data can mean under-delivering and a loss of \"in-house\" expertise. 'Tragic error' Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee, said: \"Ensuring aid delivers genuine value for money has never been more important. As major donors tighten their belts, we have to ensure that every penny we spend goes to the people most in need. \"The former Department for International Development was rightly seen as a world leader in value for money; the FCDO is broadly hanging on to that reputation. But it must make some urgent improvements. \"Reducing poverty must be the central aim of the development budget. While accountability to the taxpayer is an important consideration, the FCDO's current definition of value for money risks diverting focus away from improving the lives of the most vulnerable - the very reason the aid budget exists at all. \"The savage aid cuts announced this year are already proving to be a tragic error that will cost lives and livelihoods, undermine our international standing and ultimately threaten our national security. They must be reversed. \"Value for money is critical to making the most of a shrinking aid budget. While this report finds some positives, the government must take urgent action to wipe out waste and ensure the money we are still spending makes a genuine difference.\""

It comes as the government launches a crack down on immigration enforcement, with more than 8,000 illegal migrants arrested - while more than 1,000 have been removed from the UK. \n                  Military barracks to be used to house asylum seekers\n                 \n                  David Lammy to face Commons grilling over wrongly released migrant sex offender\n                 \n                  Billions of pounds wasted by Home Office on asylum hotels, MPs say\n                 The 11,000 raids were carried out between October 2024 to September 2025 and represent a 51% increase on last year.

Home Office sources confirmed that more than 36,816 people - the total for 2024 - have now crossed the Channel so far in 2025. Under Operation Sterling, the government has invested £5m into immigration enforcement in an acknowledgment that the relaxed UK labour market can act as a pull factor for those making the dangerous journey.  The issue came to a head earlier this year when shadow home secretary Chris Philp made an unannounced visit to an asylum hotel where he said he found \"clear evidence of illegal working for Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats\". There have been reports that asylum seekers can rent legitimate delivery driver accounts within hours of arriving in the country - skipping employment legality checks.

Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat have previously told Sky News they are continuing to strengthen the technology they use to remove anyone working illegally.  In July, the Home Office struck an agreement with the firms to equip them with tools to identify patterns of misuse and riders who are not allowed to work in the UK. As part of the deal, the government will share the locations of asylum hotels. Home Secretary Shabana Mamhood said: \"Illegal working creates an incentive for people attempting to arrive in this country illegally. No more. \"Those found to be illegally working in beauty salons, car washes and as delivery drivers will be arrested, detained and removed from this country. \"I will do whatever it takes to secure Britain's borders.\""

It comes as Sky News has obtained an internal definition of \"working people\" used by the Treasury. Officials have been tasked with protecting the income of the lower two-thirds of working people, meaning in theory people earning more than around £46,000 could face a squeeze in the budget. However, this is likely to rule out increases to the basic rate of income tax and national insurance, since they would pay more tax. Politics latest - follow live Rachel Reeves is unlikely to hike these taxes because the Treasury says those earning £45,000 or less qualify as \"working people\". Sky News understands that ministers are still considering whether to break manifesto pledges, and these options remain on the table. The main elements of the budget must be finalised by the middle of November, in the next two to three weeks.  Rachel Reeves is facing a black hole in the budget that could exceed £35bn, after the latest Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast came in worse than expected. The OBR had been anticipated to downgrade expected future productivity rates by 0.1% or 0.2% of GDP. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈        Each extra 0.1% point means an additional £7bn drop in revenue and a corresponding increase in the size of the black hole the Chancellor must fill in the budget. However, now the OBR is expected to downgrade future trend growth by 0.3%. This means that the black hole left by the productivity downgrade is around £21bn. The chancellor needs to find around £10bn because of welfare U-turns, reinstating the winter fuel allowance and other policy changes.  Read more from Sky News:Budget 2025: What tax rises and spending cuts could Reeves announce? On Monday, the chancellor also said she would increase headroom - the buffer between her spending projects and borrowing limited by her fiscal rules. This is likely to cost another £5bn to £10bn, to get her out of the doom loop \"cycle\" which Ms Reeves acknowledged to Sky News she risked being stuck in. This means the total size of the black hole likely to be needed to be filled is around £35bn or £40bn. Sources insist that this figure is before the final forecasts from the OBR, and therefore is subject to change. The Treasury said it does not comment on tax measures or the size of the black hole."

Politics latest:Labour sinks to record poll low Scales and West, who died last November, may not have been among New Labour's biggest donors at the time, but they were vocal cheerleaders for the Blair government and high-profile activists. Her activism began much earlier. Back in 1977, at the height of her fame playing Sybil in Fawlty Towers, she attended the launch of the Anti-Nazi League at the House of Commons with Kinnock, Peter Hain and other celebrity supporters. In the 1980s, she served on the council of the actors' union Equity and performed at a benefit concert for the wives of striking miners. She also supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).

After Blair's landslide election victory in 1997, Scales and West were part of a group of A-list supporters and major party donors that became known as \"luvvies for Labour\". The couple were also active in party events. In 2000, they were among the leading performers in a glitzy centenary celebration for the Labour Party at the Old Vic Theatre in London, hosted by the then prime minister. A capacity audience of party members attended the event, which was staged to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the forming of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. In the 2005 general election campaign, Scales was the presenter for the party's election broadcast, while she and others, including actor Neil Pearson, were also involved in broadcasts during the 2010 campaign.

Paying tribute to the couple in West's 2001 autobiography, A Moment Towards The End Of The Play, Simon Callow wrote: \"He (and his wife Prunella Scales) have tirelessly fought the corner of actors; marching, signing petitions, campaigning wherever such things were needed, though never pompously or humourlessly.\" The dynasty lives on, albeit rather differently.

Peers inflicted defeats on zero-hours contracts, unfair dismissal claims from day one, industrial action ballot thresholds and union members paying a political levy. The flagship Employment Rights Bill, championed by Angela Rayner until she resigned as deputy prime minister, now goes back to the Commons yet again. Although the bill is now close to reaching the statute book, senior Tories and business leaders have fought an 11th-hour rearguard action in a bid to derail it. In the latest debate on the bill in the Lords, the government suffered five defeats by large margins at the hands of Tory, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers, including: Moving the zero hours amendment, Lib Dem Lord Fox said: \"We share ministers' aims on making sure that every employee has the right to guaranteed hours moving from zero-hours, guaranteed hours.\" But he added: \"For the smaller and medium-sized employer it is an added burden that doesn't need to be there if the employee does not wish to leave zero hours.\" \n                  Prunella Scales: Friend of Labour leaders and a high-profile campaigner\n                 \n                  Poll plunge: Why has Labour sunk so low?\n                 \n                  Why Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have both left the country\n                 The aim of this amendment is to make sure that both sides are managed well, and both sides have the opportunity to change.\" Read more from Sky News:Budget 2025: What tax rises and spending cuts could Reeves announce? On day one unfair dismissal claims, Conservative peer Baron Sharpe of Epsom said workers being protected from unfair dismissal from day one in a job would scare bosses off \"taking a risk\" on young workers. \"Making unfair dismissal a day one right will inhibit hiring, and this concern is heightened in the current labour market context of falling jobs,\" he said. And independent crossbencher Lord Vaux of Harrowden said: \"The introduction of day one unfair dismissal rights is the most damaging element in this Bill, in my opinion.\" But bosses' opposition to the bill was attacked by former TUC general secretary Baroness (Francis) O'Grady, who said: \"Under the Employment Rights Bill, employers can still dismiss workers fairly - for example, as they can now if they are incompetent or there is misconduct or a redundancy situation. \"But without the day one protection proposed by the government, when workers move to a new job, they would continue to bear the risk that they can be sacked at whim. \"When I look back on employers' opposition to the national minimum wage, to equal pay for women and to stronger health and safety rights, it is clear that business lobbies do not always know what is best for Britain.\""

        "Content": " Britain has secured a deal to sell 20 fighter jets to Turkey for £8bn. The agreement for new Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes deepens ties between the two NATO allies and boosts Turkish air defences. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signed the deal during a visit to the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Monday, calling it a \"win for British workers, a win for our defence industry, and a win for NATO security\". It's the largest fighter jet deal in almost 20 years - the cost of which has raised eyebrows - and is expected to help support thousands of British jobs. Turkey has sought the jets to make up ground with regional rivals like Israel, which has unleashed airstrikes across the Middle East this year. Europe, meanwhile, appears to be increasingly turning to Turkey as it seeks to reinforce its eastern flank. Ankara has the second largest military in NATO and may be asked to backstop any post-war stabilisation force in Ukraine. Foreign news reporter Able to travel at searing speeds of up to Mach 1.8 - 2,222kph - the Typhoon fighter jet can carry out a variety of roles including high-intensity combat, the RAF says. First deployed with the RAF above Libya in 2011, the Typhoon has since been used in Iraq and Syria since 2015 as Western nations have sought to strike Islamic State targets. The UK is among several countries that have stocks of the Typhoon, along with Germany, Italy and Spain. In recent years the fourth-generation Typhoon has lost ground to the fifth-generation F-35, which has advanced stealth capabilities, but the Eurofighter has remained a key part of UK defence as a multirole fighter. They are frequently called upon to intercept and shadow Russian aircraft near UK airspace.  The UK is set to replace it with the Tempest sixth-generation fighter from 2035, which is still in development.

Money blog: 'We've assets worth £1m - how much inheritance tax will we owe?' A loss of 30,000 jobs had been anticipated based on reporting from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. Amazon workers' union in the UK, GMB, had said, based on those numbers, that \"it is almost inevitable that many UK workers will lose their jobs\". \"The fact that companies can accrue such astronomical profits to the point where its [founder, Jeff Bezos] can holiday in space and hire out entire cities for his vulgar wedding prior to casting aside loyal workers without a thought just underlines everything that's wrong with a system that many feel is beyond repair,\" the union said.

In a message sent to staff, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, alluded to the criticism that the company is cutting jobs while profiting £19.2bn in results published in July. \"Some may ask why we're reducing roles when the company is performing well,\" she wrote. \"What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\" Amazon is also continuing to unravel some of the hiring it made during the COVID-19 pandemic and has warned about reducing headcount and bureaucracy. In May 2021, for example, the business said it was hiring more than 10,000 UK jobs. The largest ever cut of 18,000 Amazon roles was announced in January 2023 when the consumer retail part of the business, including Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, were scaled back. It plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots, automating 75% of its operations, according to the New York Times. What next? Those who lose their job will be prioritised for openings within Amazon to help \"as many people as possible\" find new roles, she said. Hiring will continue, despite the latest cull, in \"key strategic areas\" while the online retail behemoth finds additional places we can \"remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains\". Amazon said it is \"shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\". In the UK, GMB said, \"We will be supporting our members across Amazon as they face this uncertain future.\" It is to announce financial results for the third quarter of this year on Thursday evening, UK time. Amazon UK has been contacted for comment."

The figure comes from its parent company OpenAI, which revealed 0.15% of users send messages including \"explicit indicators of potential suicide planning or intent\". Earlier this month, the company's chief executive Sam Altman estimated that ChatGPT now has more than 800 million weekly active users. While the tech giant does aim to direct vulnerable people to crisis helplines, it admitted \"in some rare cases, the model may not behave as intended in these sensitive situations\".  OpenAI evaluated over 1,000 \"challenging self-harm and suicide conversations\" with its latest model GPT-5 and found it was compliant with \"desired behaviours\" 91% of the time.

The company has previously warned that safeguards designed to protect users can be weakened in longer conversations - and work is under way to address this. \"ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,\" OpenAI explained.

Court filings suggest that, hours before he died, the teenager uploaded a photo that appeared to show his suicide plan - and when he asked whether it would work, ChatGPT offered to help him \"upgrade\" it.

        "Content": " A university academic who is receiving \"substantial damages\" for how he was portrayed in a film has told Sky News he hasn't received an apology from star Steve Coogan - nor the two companies involved in its production. Richard Taylor said he was \"shell-shocked\" after seeing The Lost King for the first time, a film about how Richard III's skeleton was discovered below a car park in Leicester. He told The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee: \"I wasn't consulted or even knew I was in the film. The first I hear is I get a phone call while I'm on holiday - and eventually, after press previews, I persuade the producers to let me see a preview.\" Last year, a judge ruled that Mr Taylor was depicted as \"smug, unruly dismissive and patronising\" - with the plot suggesting he \"knowingly\" misled the public. \"I'm portrayed by someone on screen who looks like me, who sounds like me, who dresses like me - but behaves in a way that falls so far short of the standards I set for myself and what others might reasonably expect of me,\" the academic explained. Mr Taylor revealed he received emails at work telling him to \"rot in hell\", while others described him as a \"disgrace\". He added: \"Something that was a collaborative effort that showcased the best of British universities in my view was turned into this farce - where I was the villain and portrayed in a way that was completely inconsistent with the reality and the truth.\" Now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, Mr Taylor said \"none of the facts\" in the 2022 film were ever checked - and the Alan Partridge star, his company Baby Cow and Pathe Productions did not reach out to him before its release. \"The producers just went ahead, filmed it, produced it, stuck it out there and left me to deal with all the flack and all the fallout from it. Grossly unfair and I feel vindicated from the result we've achieved,\" he told Sky News. 'The film's going to look pretty silly' As part of the settlement, an on-screen clarification will now be added to the start of the film, but no scenes will be removed. When asked whether he was satisfied with this outcome, Mr Taylor replied: \"I'd have liked them to re-edit the film, but one's got to be realistic about what one can achieve. \"The insertion of the card will say that the person on screen is a fictitious portrayal - and the real Richard Taylor didn't behave like that … so the film's going to look pretty silly.\" Read more UK news:Community plagued by 25,000 tonnes of illegal wasteWhat tax rises could be announced in the budget? The case was due to proceed to trial, but a High Court hearing on Monday heard that the parties had settled the claim. In a statement afterwards, Coogan had said: \"If it wasn't for Philippa Langley, Richard III would still be lying under a car park in Leicester. It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity.\" He went on to add: \"That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.\" Reacting to the statement, Mr Taylor argued \"it's a pretty strange definition of happy when you've had to settle a defamation claim for seven figures in costs\". He said: \"Steve is never anything other than certain in himself and of his own position, but I think he's got it wrong - basic facts were not checked.\""

        "Headline": "The actress, best known for her role as Sybil, has died aged 93. She was watching the sitcom the day before she died. ",
        "Content": " John Cleese has paid tribute to his Fawlty Towers co-star Prunella Scales, who has died aged 93, describing her as a \"wonderful comic actress\". The star, who was living with dementia, was watching the sitcom the day before she died, her sons Samuel and Joseph West said in a statement confirming her death. \"Our darling mother Prunella Scales died peacefully at home in London yesterday.\" Her seven-decade acting career saw her in multiple roles from the 1950s, including in 1960s sitcom Marriage Lines, before featuring as the wife of John Cleese's character Basil Fawlty, in two series of Fawlty Towers in 1975 and 1979. The family statement added: \"Although dementia forced her retirement from a remarkable acting career of nearly 70 years, she continued to live at home. She was watching Fawlty Towers the day before she died. \"Pru was married to Timothy West for 61 years. He died in November 2024. \"She is survived by two sons and one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \"We would like to thank all those who gave Pru such wonderful care at the end of her life: her last days were comfortable, contented and surrounded by love.\" Prunella Scales was one of the most successful and popular comedy actresses of her generation - achieving worldwide fame and recognition as Sybil, the long-suffering wife of Basil Fawlty in the sitcom Fawlty Towers. Her performances, alongside John Cleese, are often regarded as arguably some of TV's funniest comedy moments ever. The sitcom, set in a hotel in the seaside resort of Torquay, continues to be broadcast. It was developed into a theatre production that moved to London's West End in 2024. 'National treasure' and 'British icon' John Cleese described his on-screen wife as \"a really wonderful comic actress\" and \"a very sweet lady\". \"Scene after scene she was absolutely perfect,\" he added. Jon Petrie, director of comedy at the BBC which broadcast Fawlty Towers, described her as a \"national treasure whose brilliance as Sybil Fawlty lit up screens and still makes us laugh today\". Broadcaster Gyles Brandreth told Sky News \"she was funny, independent, intelligent, interesting, interested, intrepid, a very... considerable actress. She was a mistress of her craft.\" In an earlier tribute on X, he posted images of Scales alongside Queen Camilla, from an event in May 2024. Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman said Scales \"was part of a golden era for British comedy\" whose talent \"gave many people a huge amount of enjoyment\". Meanwhile, Corinne Mills, for Alzheimer's Society, called her a \"a true British icon\" and praised her for \"shining an important light on the UK's biggest killer\". Sybil was 'poignant and beautiful' Sky News arts and entertainment reporter Bethany Minelle said the success of Fawlty Towers was largely down to how Prunella Scales portrayed her character, Sybil. \"She could have played that as a kind of moaning, whingeing, kind of negative kind of wife... the wife indoors. And she didn't. \"She absolutely gave it layers. It was poignant and beautiful.\" Seven-decade acting career But although she was regularly cast in comic roles, alongside comedy giants like Richard Briers and Ronnie Barker, her abilities ranged far more widely than that. Prunella Margaret Rumney Illingworth, who was born on 22 June 1932, had a seven-decade acting career. Her career break came with the early 1960s sitcom Marriage Lines, starring opposite Richard Briers. Scales also played Queen Elizabeth II in the British film A Question Of Attribution, a role which earned her a Bafta nomination. In 1973, Scales teamed up with Ronnie Barker in the series called Seven Of One, and in 1991 she starred alongside West on the West End stage in Long Day's Journey Into Night. Scales married West in 1963, and had two sons; the elder being the actor and director Samuel West. She was a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party and appeared on their party political broadcasts during the 2005 and 2010 general election campaigns. She also used her status to help charities, including the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA). Dementia caused her 'gradual disappearance' In January 2013, she revealed her short-term memory was fading and her husband later confirmed that Scales was living with vascular dementia. West told Piers Morgan's Life Stories: \"The sad thing is that you just watch the gradual disappearance of the person that you knew and loved and were very close to. \"When we've been to a concert, or a play, or a film, there's nothing very much we can say about it afterwards because Pru will have a fairly hazy memory.\" The couple appeared together in 10 series of the TV series Great Canal Journeys until Scales' dementia reportedly progressed to the point where they had to stop in 2020. The pair appeared in several more specials, where they looked back at their travels. Scales is survived by her sons, Samuel and Joseph West, stepdaughter Juliet West, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  Prunella Scales wasn't just a lifelong Labour supporter. She appeared in party political broadcasts for the party during the 2005 and 2010 general elections and was a tireless campaigner. She called the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock a \"dear friend\" and, along with her actor husband Timothy West, was a prominent Labour Party supporter when Tony Blair was prime minister. Politics latest:Labour sinks to record poll low Scales and West, who died last November, may not have been among New Labour's biggest donors at the time, but they were vocal cheerleaders for the Blair government and high-profile activists. Her activism began much earlier. Back in 1977, at the height of her fame playing Sybil in Fawlty Towers, she attended the launch of the Anti-Nazi League at the House of Commons with Kinnock, Peter Hain and other celebrity supporters. In the 1980s, she served on the council of the actors' union Equity and performed at a benefit concert for the wives of striking miners. She also supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). As well as her activism during Kinnock's leadership, in 1988 she played the Queen in Alan Bennett's play A Question of Attribution, at the National Theatre, quizzing Anthony Blunt about a painting in the royal collection that may have been a fake. \n                  Workers' rights bill set for parliamentary 'ping pong'\n                 \n                  Poll plunge: Why has Labour sunk so low?\n                 \n                  Why Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have both left the country\n                 According to The Guardian, when she later went to Buckingham Palace to receive her CBE, the Queen muttered as she handed over the gong: \"I suppose you think you should be up here doing this.\" And ahead of the 1992 general election, which Kinnock lost to John Major, she was quoted warmly praising the Labour leader in an Observer article on the relationship between politics and celebrities. After Blair's landslide election victory in 1997, Scales and West were part of a group of A-list supporters and major party donors that became known as \"luvvies for Labour\". The couple were also active in party events. In 2000, they were among the leading performers in a glitzy centenary celebration for the Labour Party at the Old Vic Theatre in London, hosted by the then prime minister. A capacity audience of party members attended the event, which was staged to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the forming of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. In the 2005 general election campaign, Scales was the presenter for the party's election broadcast, while she and others, including actor Neil Pearson, were also involved in broadcasts during the 2010 campaign.

She also appeared with her old friend Kinnock at a 2006 event for the play \"The Lady Of Burma\" at the Old Vic. Paying tribute to the couple in West's 2001 autobiography, A Moment Towards The End Of The Play, Simon Callow wrote: \"He (and his wife Prunella Scales) have tirelessly fought the corner of actors; marching, signing petitions, campaigning wherever such things were needed, though never pompously or humourlessly.\" The dynasty lives on, albeit rather differently. The couple's actor son Samuel West, who plays the irascible Siegfried Farnon in Channel 5's All Creatures Great And Small, also became a political activist, but unlike his parents was no fan of Mr Blair. While at Oxford University, he was a member of the far-left Socialist Workers Party and later the Socialist Alliance. He was also an outspoken critic of the New Labour government and the Iraq war. Prunella Scales, however, along with Timothy West, was one of the Labour Party's most stalwart and loyal showbiz supporters over many years."

        "Content": "Singer Chris Brown will be allowed to return to the United States as he awaits trial for an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub in 2023. Judge Tony Baumgartner granted the change to the American musician's bail conditions at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday. Brown has pleaded not guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Abraham Diaw at the Tape venue, a private members' club in Hanover Square, Mayfair, on 19 February, 2023. The R&B star, 36, has also denied having an offensive weapon - a bottle - in a public place, as well as attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. Heidi Stonecliffe KC, prosecuting, said the bail conditions remained \"very stringent\" and \"numerous\". The £5 million security fee Brown was previously ordered to pay to the court remains in place.

Brown's co-defendant, US national Omololu Akinlolu, 39, has also denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Brown's previous bail conditions allowed him to carry on with his scheduled international tour. He had to live at a specific address known to the court and was not permitted to visit the nightclub, contact Mr Diaw, or apply for international travel documents. Granting both defendants permission to return to the US, Judge Baumgartner said on Friday: \"You will have to come back to the United Kingdom when you are required to do so.\" He reminded them that failure to attend court dates when required could jeopardise the securities. The defendants spoke only to confirm their identities and that they understood the new conditions. They will next appear at the same court on 28 January."
