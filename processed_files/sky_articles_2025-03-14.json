        "Content": " A long-awaited rocket with a replacement crew for two stranded NASA astronauts has finally launched to the International Space Station (ISS). US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been stuck on the ISS for nine months, having had their journey home repeatedly pushed back. The Crew-10 mission was initially scheduled to launch the replacement crew of four astronauts from Florida on Wednesday, but a last-minute issue with the rocket's ground systems forced a delay. NASA said on Thursday that SpaceX, headed and founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, had resolved the issue - flushing a suspected pocket of air out of a hydraulic clamp arm - and that the weather was 95% favourable for a Friday launch. The crew is now expected to arrive at the ISS on Saturday night. They are NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, who are both military pilots, along with Japan's Takuya Onishi and Russia's Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, releasing Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams who have been on the ISS since June 2024. The pair originally planned to go to space for just eight days but got stuck on the station after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft started experiencing problems. \n                  Elon Musk calls famed astronaut Andreas Mogensen an 'idiot' after being accused of 'lying' about stranded astronauts\n                 \n                  NASA astronauts stuck on International Space Station say they 'don't feel like castaways'\n                 \n                  NASA astronaut in hospital with undisclosed medical condition after extended mission\n                 The mission has become entangled in politics as Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk claimed - without evidence - that former President Joe Biden left the astronauts on the station for political reasons. NASA said the two astronauts have had to remain on the ISS to maintain its minimum staffing level.  Read more on Sky News:What does being in space do to your health?Spacewalk after seven months in orbitStranded astronauts say space is 'happy place' NASA brought forward the Crew-10 mission from 26 March, swapping a delayed SpaceX capsule for one that would be ready sooner. Mr Trump and Mr Musk's demand for an earlier return was an unusual intervention and put additional pressure on NASA's preparation and safety process. by David Blevins, Sky correspondent in Washington\n Picture the scene - two NASA astronauts hitch-hiking on the celestial highway. That's the impression created by the president of the United States. Donald Trump has used evocative words like \"abandoned\" to describe their plight.\n He claimed his predecessor, Joe Biden, had failed Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n The pair are still in the International Space Station, nine months after they arrived on an eight-day mission. In a parallel universe moment in the Oval Office, the President said of the astronauts: \"I hope they like each other… maybe they'll love each other.\" Referencing pictures of Williams floating in space, he added: \"I see the woman with the wild hair, good solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair.\" But NASA refutes the President's claim, emphasising it's got nothing to do with politics. Their prolonged mission is the result of technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Keen to get in on the drama, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk began talking about a \"rescue mission\". One small step into space has become one giant leap for political spin. NASA's commercial crew programme manager, Steve Stich, said SpaceX's \"rapid pace of operations\" had required changes to some of the ways it verifies flight safety. The agency had to address some \"late-breaking\" issues, NASA space operations chief Ken Bowersox told reporters, including investigating a fuel leak on a recent SpaceX Falcon 9 launch and deterioration of a coating on some of the Dragon crew capsule's thrusters."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there is a \"good chance\" to end the war with Russia. The embattled Ukrainian president was speaking after he accepted a proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire and Vladimir Putin stuck to his red lines on needing certain conditions to be met. \"Right now, we have a good chance to end this war quickly and secure peace. We have solid security understandings with our European partners,\" Mr Zelenskyy said in a post on X. \"We are now close to the first step in ending any war - silence,\" he said, referring to a truce. Ukraine war latest updates He later urged the US and other allies to place further pressure on Moscow and reiterated his belief Mr Putin will delay the ceasefire for as long as possible. \"If there is a strong response from the United States, they will not let them play around. And if there are steps that Russia is not afraid of, they will delay the process,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy said a ceasefire along the more than 1,000km (600-mile) frontline could be controlled with US help through satellites and intelligence - earlier this week Washington resumed intelligence sharing and military aid after Ukraine accepted the ceasefire. Mr Zelenskyy also said officials at a meeting between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia this week discussed the issue of territory, but a difficult dialogue would be required to resolve it. \"The issue of territories is the most difficult after the ceasefire,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. It comes as Donald Trump said he sees \"pretty good vibes coming out of Russia\", and he thinks Moscow will make a deal on the war.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left thousands dead and injured, with millions displaced and towns and cities destroyed. After three years of war Moscow's forces now control nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory and have been advancing since the middle of last year. \"The ceasefire unblocks the way for the sides to end the war. And the territories... will be the point that makes it possible to end the war after this issue is resolved,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. The Kremlin has demanded Kyiv permanently cede the territory it has claimed. Mr Zelenskyy also said he was discussing future security guarantees and economic support with Kyiv's allies, saying 100% air defence cover would be required as deterrence in a peace deal. Meanwhile, Mr Putin met with US envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss the details of the proposal and has asked him to convey Moscow's thoughts to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. It comes ahead of a video call between Sir Keir Starmer and around 25 world leaders on Saturday, in which he will urge them to make concrete commitments to support Ukraine and increase pressure on Mr Putin to accept a ceasefire."

        "Content": " The American influencer who snatched a baby wombat from its distressed mother has said \"thousands threatened\" her life, and that she is \"truly sorry\" in an Instagram post. Sam Jones, who describes herself as an \"outdoor enthusiast and hunter\", wrote a lengthy statement on social media, saying she was \"extremely concerned\" about the wombat's health, so she ran away from the joey's mother out of fear of attack. She says she \"immediately\" returned it to its mother. \"I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realised that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have (…) I have learnt from this situation, and am truly sorry for the distress I have caused.\" In the now-deleted video posted to her 92,000 followers on Instagram, Jones said: \"I caught a baby wombat\", as a man filming her laughs. In the video, the wombat could be seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother followed on the road behind. She returned the baby wombat to the roadside after several seconds. Jones left the country on Friday after the Australian government said it was reviewing her visa. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticised the influencer, who sparked outrage across the country, telling reporters: \"To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress to the mother, is just an outrage. \"And, you know, I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. \"Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. \"Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother - see how you go there.\" Read more on Sky News:Tesla warns of 'disproportionate' tariff impactUK economy unexpectedly shrank in JanuarySky News flies over the world's biggest iceberg The country's interior minister Tony Burke said on Thursday that his department is reviewing the conditions of the American's visa - and whether she had breached immigration law. The baby wombat is a protected species of marsupial found only in Australia. \"Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,\" said Mr Burke. \"I can't wait for Australia to see the back of this individual. I don't expect she will return.\""

Vladimir Motin, 59, of Primorsky, St Petersburg, has been remanded in police custody and is due to appear at Hull Magistrates Court on Saturday, Humberside Police said. On Monday morning, about 13 miles off the East Yorkshire coast near Withernsea, the Solong sailed into the US-registered oil tanker Stena Immaculate, which was carrying jet fuel for the US Navy. One member of the Solong crew is believed to be dead. He has been named by the Crown Prosecution Service as 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia.

The Stena Immaculate, operated by US shipping firm Crowley, was stationary and at anchor while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme, on the River Humber, when it was struck by the smaller Solong, causing huge fires and explosions - the smoke from which was visible from space. The Solong had been sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at the time. It was initially feared it was carrying sodium cyanide but the German owner Ernst Russ said four containers on the vessel had previously been carrying the chemical.

The Solong drifted south of that location, to a point where it could be seen off the Lincolnshire coast. Salvage companies boarded the two vessels on Thursday and were carrying out initial damage assessments. Small fires were still being reported on the Solong's top deck, the coastguard said. Police said extensive lines of inquiry were continuing but it was taking time given the vessels were still at sea and there were a large number of witnesses.  Environmental impact not as severe as initially feared The Stena Immaculate had been carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks - at least one of which \"was ruptured\" during the collision, Crowley said. But it added that the jet fuel spill was having a \"limited\" impact. The potential environmental impact seems to be less severe than initially feared. Most of the spilt jet fuel has evaporated or burned off, Crowley said in an X post. There seems to have been no loss of engine fuel from either vessel and both are expected to remain afloat despite a gaping hole in the side of the Stena Immaculate and earlier fears the Solong would sink. The Solong, which was drifting, has now been secured by tugs."

        "Content": " A \"career criminal\" who murdered an Amazon delivery driver during an attempt to steal his van has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years. Mark Ross had climbed into Claudiu-Carol Kondor's vehicle and started to drive away while the victim was out delivering a parcel in Armley, Leeds, on 20 August last year. Mr Kondor, 42, held on to the vehicle from the open passenger door for half a mile as Ross drove down residential streets at speeds of almost 60mph, Leeds Crown Court heard. Ross later swerved erratically from side to side before deliberately hitting two parked cars on Heights Drive in Farnley. Mr Kondor, who was heard shouting for help as he held on to the moving van, died from head and chest injuries from the second crash when the vehicle struck a blue Mini, the court heard. Ross had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but denied murdering Mr Kondor, claiming he was unaware of him hanging on to the van and that speed bumps had caused him to lose control of the vehicle. He was found guilty of murder at Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday. Sentencing Ross on Friday, Mr Justice Goss said: \"Claudiu-Carol Kondor must have been terrified in the last 45 seconds of his life as you ignored his pleas to stop and drove faster, dragging him along the road, causing him mental and physical suffering.\" On the day of his death, Mr Kondor was delivering parcels using his own silver Transit van that was full of parcels he had collected from an Amazon depot. While he was away from his vehicle delivering a parcel, Ross, who lived nearby and had gone out to buy cannabis, climbed into the driver's seat and started to drive the van away, his trial heard. Mr Kondor attempted to stop him by opening the front nearside passenger door of the van and attempting to climb in. However, this did not stop Ross driving away, with Mr Kondor hanging on to the moving van through an open door. Ross 'tried again' after first crash Witnesses described Mr Kondor's legs dragging on the ground as he clung onto the inside of the open door, with one woman saying she heard him shouting \"Help!\". Prosecutor John Harrison KC told jurors: \"After speeding and swerving failed to get rid of Mr Kondor, the defendant deliberately drove into collision with two parked cars.\" He said Ross turned the steering wheel towards a black car parked on the side of the road, and when that did not knock Mr Kondor free from the van, he \"tried again\". \"The second collision was with a blue car which caused damage to the van, to the parked car and most significantly, caused fatal head and chest injuries to Mr Kondor,\" Mr Harrison said. Mr Kondor, who lived in Sheffield and was originally from Romania, was pronounced dead at the scene. Ross later met up with some people and the contents of the van were removed, the court heard.

Ross, of Conference Road, Armley, told the jury he had been involved in stealing vans previously, but said he had \"never been involved in anything like this before\", adding: \"I would have stopped the van and run off if I had known he was there.\" He was given a concurrent sentence of six months for a separate offence of theft after stealing cashmere jumpers from a lorry. Heartbroken partner pays tribute Mr Kondor's fiancee, Mariana Gheorghe, said in a victim impact statement that the Amazon driver had dreamed of owning his own van and bought it just three weeks before he was killed. She added that she had been \"forced to return to Romania with a broken heart\" after his death and described Mr Kondor as a \"man of integrity and hard work\". Ms Gheorghe said he had a difficult upbringing in Romania and moved to Italy at the age of 19, doing various jobs and working as a volunteer to help earthquake victims in 2009. She said Mr Kondor came to England in 2019 and worked as a delivery driver and security guard. She added: \"Of all his jobs he liked delivering the most. He enjoyed meeting people, delivering parcels on time and correctly. \"When he finished work each day he was happy to say he had done his best.\" Detective Chief Inspector James Entwistle said: \"It is truly heart-breaking that the life of an honest hard-working man has been snatched away by the cruel and callous actions of Mark Ross.\""

        "Content": "Racing commentator John Hunt has returned to the airwaves three days after witnessing the killer of his wife and two of his daughters jailed for the rest of his life. Kyle Clifford was handed a whole-life order at Cambridge Crown Court on Tuesday for murdering his ex-partner Louise Hunt, her sister Hannah and their mother Carol with a crossbow and knife on 9 July last year. The 26-year-old defendant refused to attend his sentencing and Mr Hunt delivered a message to the killer in court, telling him hell will \"roll the red carpet out for you\". On Friday Mr Hunt returned to work on BBC Radio 5 Live to cover the Cheltenham Festival. The court proceedings were not mentioned during his introduction to the programme. Mr Hunt held back tears throughout his statement to the court on Tuesday, telling Clifford: \"The screams of hell, Kyle. I can hear them faintly now. They're going to roll the red carpet out for you.\" He described Clifford as a \"psychopath\" and added: \"The impact of what you have done will be taken to my grave.\" Mr Hunt also vowed to \"see what my future is\" as he said his daughter Hannah \"handed me a second chance\" by raising the alarm before her death. He added: \"Whilst I am badly damaged, I am absolutely determined to see what my future is surrounded by so many amazing people, and the chance to do that, I firmly believe, has been gifted to me by my incredible Hansie (Hannah Hunt). \"I really believe that had she not managed to show such amazing physical and mental strength in raising the alarm after you, Kyle, fatally injured her, that I would have been your fourth victim that day. \"Hannah handed me a second chance, one that she worked so hard to achieve for me.\" Read more from Sky News:Russian captain of ship in crash off Yorkshire coast chargedMan who murdered Amazon driver while trying to steal van jailedHamas offers to release American-Israeli soldier Clifford became \"enraged\" when Louise ended their 18-month relationship, prosecutors said, leading him to \"carefully\" plan the murders.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  Thomas Tuchel spent five months planning his first England squad. There were some frustrations from a coach used to being around players constantly at club level from Paris Saint-Germain to Chelsea and Bayern Munich. \"I missed the dressing room humour,\" he said in response to a Sky News question today at Wembley. But the first German manager of the England team already feels he's learning new sides to him - and improving even at 51. \"It was the experience I was excited for,\" he said. \"And the cherry on top comes now when the players come into camp.\" And that big squad reveal showed he's just focused on the big prize - winning the World Cup - by turning to veterans. Progress, and ultimately success, in North America next summer will determine whether he stays on into a home European Championship in 2028. That could explain the lack of a radical squad overhaul. If anything, it's less daring than during the six-match Lee Carsley interim reign. Read more from Sky News:Man who murdered Amazon driver while trying to steal van jailedBritish man hit by Kenyan president's motorcade diesHamas offers to release American-Israeli soldier Welcome back Jordan Henderson after exiting the England stage to a chorus of fan jeers over his Saudi move. An appearance against Albania next Friday would put 490 days between England appearances for the former Liverpool captain. Now back from the comparative Saudi wilderness in the Dutch league with Ajax, two starts in the last nine matches were enough to put the midfielder on Tuchel's list as a \"pretty easy\" pick. The 34-year-old's \"leadership, character, personality, energy\" embodies the mission for Gareth Southgate's successor. Another veteran of Southgate's run to the Euro 2020 final - Marcus Rashford - is back in the fold after being discarded for last year's Euros and the latest losing final. Still only 27, the 60-cap striker is in a more welcoming environment again at Aston Villa after falling out of favour at Manchester United. Despite being without a Villa goal since starting his loan last month, the four assists were enough to convince Tuchel of his credentials again. Helped by a nudge from the most famous of England and Villa fans - Prince William - with a direct line to the England boss. \"He has a strong opinion,\" Tuchel said. One decision Tuchel did not dwell on was the holder of the captain's armband. It stays with Harry Kane. Not the moment to disrupt the leadership group with the striker, despite banging in the goals for Bayern Munich and sure of his England place despite doubts over his contributions later in tournaments. So this can seem like going back to familiar territory even though Tuchel is in unfamiliar territory in international management trying to build on Southgate's eight years at the helm. This seems, I asked Tuchel, more like continuity than a revolution. The reply gave an insight into the balancing act when picking an international squad. It's not necessarily just the 26 eligible players in the best form but how they gel for brief international camps and weeks away at tournaments. \"What we are looking for are on the values, how we want to build a squad and what we think you have to bring to the table to be picked,\" Tuchel said. \"There are different types of categories being picked. You can be picked on form and availability, on responsibility, on leadership, on personality. \"You may be picked because someone else gets injured. There are different reasons. But in the end it is about building a strong group. \"And in the end, the question is what you bring besides your talent, besides you being a top professional.\" Ultimately, it's about how you improve the team as a collective. That means Newcastle defender Dan Burn, 32, also finally gets his chance with his first England call-up. Versatile Myles Lewis-Skelly,18, is fast-tracked into the England seniors, having never played for the Under-21s after his rapid progress at Arsenal. Qualifying should not be the problematic part - with Albania, Serbia, Latvia and Andorra in the group. The trickiest part of his first squad unveiling news conference was letting down the travelling pack of German journalists by sticking to English. There is an English media and public to charm now to bring football home."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  The last thing I was expecting to discover on the doorstep of a Falkirk house was a 70-year-old woman crying at the near 16% council tax rise she and tens of thousands of others face next month. Falkirk is bracing for the UK's biggest hike in bills as the local authority faces a crisis of costs. One councillor responsible for the increases has called in the police after receiving beheading taunts and threats of violence. The area is facing its most difficult period in its 30-year history, while residents feel fragile and fobbed off. Councils oversee the running of schools and social care, maintaining roads and collecting bins. They take charge of housing, swimming pools and libraries. The list is endless. But Britain's local authorities are cash-strapped and there are questions about how they should be funded in the long term. Sky News went inside one Falkirk street to get a snapshot of the mood - and it was bleak. \n                  Most areas set to increase council tax by at least 4.99% from April\n                 \n                  Millions face council tax rise of more than 5% after government gives green light to bigger hikes\n                 \n                  Rising cost of social care and school transport to cause £54bn blackhole for councils\n                 We went door to door on Wilson Road and first stumbled across 70-year-old Catherine Mochar. The unpaid carer was seemingly unaware of the upcoming changes to her bill and became visibly upset at the prospect of scraping together more cash in her already extremely stretched household budget. \"It's absolutely ridiculous,\" she said as her voice cracked. Ms Mochar looks after her elderly sister and says her care package was revoked as the pensioner was deemed suitable to deal with the situation herself. She says she is not entitled to a council tax exemption and worries about finding an extra 15.6%. She said: \"I am a pensioner. I don't know where I am going to get it [the money] from. It is quite scary the thought of it.\" Round the corner from Catherine's house, we meet a family who feel like they are paying more and getting less. Claire Hamilton and William Reid have a three-year-old son and regularly use the local foodbank to make ends meet. \"It is going to become a choice between heating the house or paying council tax. Or getting food in and paying the council tax,\" Claire says. \"It is quite a jump for not a lot in return. The collections on the bins keep getting longer and longer.\" She continues: \"You want to do the best by your child and obviously they are not aware of all these stresses going on in the background.\" Council tax differs across UK A drop in the frequency of bin collections is a moan people across the UK share and feeds into the narrative surrounding local services. Council tax rates have been frozen or capped for much of the last two decades in Scotland, but this year the Scottish government has granted local leaders the power to go their own way. In England, a principle exists which usually prevents more than a 5% increase to council tax without a referendum, mostly to protect taxpayers from excessive increases. It is thought the average increase in England will not surpass last year's total of 5.1%. There are some exemptions including Bradford which is hiking costs by 10%. But Falkirk surpasses everyone and is the UK's most extreme case. Independent councillor Laura Murtagh initiated the idea of the 15.6% increase which was eventually voted through by most of her colleagues. Councillor behind 15.6% rise calls in police She stresses anything less than the increase she proposed would have resulted in services, including education provision, being slashed. But it has come at a personal cost. Ms Murtagh, who stresses she does not want to incite a further pile-on, tells Sky News she has contacted police after threats of violence and taunts online depicting beheadings. She said: \"It has made me not want to go out. It has made me not want to go to events. \"I am having a conversation with the police. They are nasty threats. There are people who have said you could do with a kicking or you could do with more than that. \"People are sharing memes where they are doing beheading memes or whatever.\" Read more from Sky News:Queen sent letter of support to rape survivor Gisele PelicotWhy is NHS England being abolished - and what is it? Local leaders say their rates have been much lower than their neighbours for many years which is unsustainable as demand for services soars. The leader of Falkirk Council, Cecil Meiklejohn, was asked by Sky News if she could justify the 15.6% rise. She said: \"It is quite a hike. We always knew council tax needed to go up. \"We know that we have to continue to deliver good quality services, and we can't do that without increasing our revenue and the only way we have the opportunity to do that locally is by increasing council tax.\" She concluded: \"We will work with people who are going to be impacted by the increase.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @samuelosborne93\n Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there is a \"good chance\" to end the war with Russia. The embattled Ukrainian president was speaking after he accepted a proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire and Vladimir Putin stuck to his red lines on needing certain conditions to be met. \"Right now, we have a good chance to end this war quickly and secure peace. We have solid security understandings with our European partners,\" Mr Zelenskyy said in a post on X. \"We are now close to the first step in ending any war - silence,\" he said, referring to a truce. Ukraine war latest updates He later urged the US and other allies to place further pressure on Moscow and reiterated his belief Mr Putin will delay the ceasefire for as long as possible. \"If there is a strong response from the United States, they will not let them play around. And if there are steps that Russia is not afraid of, they will delay the process,\" he said. Mr Zelenskyy said a ceasefire along the more than 1,000km (600-mile) frontline could be controlled with US help through satellites and intelligence - earlier this week Washington resumed intelligence sharing and military aid after Ukraine accepted the ceasefire. Mr Zelenskyy also said officials at a meeting between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia this week discussed the issue of territory, but a difficult dialogue would be required to resolve it. \"The issue of territories is the most difficult after the ceasefire,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. It comes as Donald Trump said he sees \"pretty good vibes coming out of Russia\", and he thinks Moscow will make a deal on the war.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left thousands dead and injured, with millions displaced and towns and cities destroyed. After three years of war Moscow's forces now control nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory and have been advancing since the middle of last year. \"The ceasefire unblocks the way for the sides to end the war. And the territories... will be the point that makes it possible to end the war after this issue is resolved,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. The Kremlin has demanded Kyiv permanently cede the territory it has claimed. Mr Zelenskyy also said he was discussing future security guarantees and economic support with Kyiv's allies, saying 100% air defence cover would be required as deterrence in a peace deal. Meanwhile, Mr Putin met with US envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss the details of the proposal and has asked him to convey Moscow's thoughts to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. It comes ahead of a video call between Sir Keir Starmer and around 25 world leaders on Saturday, in which he will urge them to make concrete commitments to support Ukraine and increase pressure on Mr Putin to accept a ceasefire."

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n Steve Witkoff didn't stay long in the Russian capital. According to footage posted of his motorcade leaving and returning to Moscow's Vnukovo airport, he was here for little more than 12 hours. And for most of that, it seems, he was left waiting. Trump's fixer leaves Moscow - peace talks latest Mr Witkoff, a former property mogul who has become Donald Trump's chief negotiator, and is often referred to as the president's 'fixer', had been dispatched to Moscow to deliver the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire to Vladimir Putin. His visit had been scheduled near the start of the week, following the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia. But after arriving around lunchtime on Thursday, he was left twiddling his thumbs for at least eight hours before being called into the Kremlin. Mr Putin was apparently too busy meeting someone else - Belarusian leader Aleksander Lukashenko - for a hastily arranged state visit that had been announced the day before.  Was ally's visit a classic Putin power play? We don't know for sure if the timing of Mr Lukashenko's visit was deliberate, but it certainly didn't feel like a coincidence. Instead, it felt like a classic Putin power play. The Kremlin leader doesn't like to be backed into a corner and told what to do, especially on his own turf. This felt like a message to the Americans - \"I'm the boss, I set the schedule, and I'm not beholden to anyone\". He did eventually grant Mr Witkoff that all-important face time, once night had fallen and behind closed-doors. We don't know how long they spoke for, nor the exact details of their discussion, but I think we can make a pretty good guess given Mr Putin's comments earlier in the evening. At a press conference alongside Mr Lukashenko, he made it abundantly clear that he'll only sign up to a ceasefire if he gets something in return. And it's not just one thing he wants. All Russia's red lines remain By the sounds of things, he still wants everything. His comment regarding the \"root causes\" of the conflict suggests all of Russia's red lines remain - no NATO membership for Ukraine, no NATO troops as peacekeepers, and for Russia to keep all the territory it has seized.

It's now up to Mr Trump to decide what to do next."

        "Content": " Mark Carney has been formally sworn in as the new prime minister of Canada, following the resignation of predecessor Justin Trudeau. Mr Carney, a former governor of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, will try to steer his country through a trade war brought by Donald Trump. Mr Trump has also made repeated threats to make the US neighbour to the north its 51st state. Speaking at a news conference after the swearing-in ceremony in Ottawa, Mr Carney said such talk was \"crazy\" and Canada will \"never ever be part of the US\". The American president has slapped 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products from 2 April. Mr Carney has already said he is ready to meet Mr Trump if he shows \"respect for Canadian sovereignty\" and is willing to take \"a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade\". The prime minister also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the US showed Canada some respect. Canada, which is the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, this week announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on those metals along with computers, sports equipment and other products worth $20bn in total. Canada already imposed tariffs on 4 March worth a similar amount on US goods in response to broader tariffs by Mr Trump. Mr Carney also said he respects what Mr Trump is looking to accomplish and hopes to have a call with the president.

        "Content": " A long-awaited rocket with a replacement crew for two stranded NASA astronauts has finally launched to the International Space Station (ISS). US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been stuck on the ISS for nine months, having had their journey home repeatedly pushed back. The Crew-10 mission was initially scheduled to launch the replacement crew of four astronauts from Florida on Wednesday, but a last-minute issue with the rocket's ground systems forced a delay. NASA said on Thursday that SpaceX, headed and founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, had resolved the issue - flushing a suspected pocket of air out of a hydraulic clamp arm - and that the weather was 95% favourable for a Friday launch. The crew is now expected to arrive at the ISS on Saturday night. They are NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, who are both military pilots, along with Japan's Takuya Onishi and Russia's Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, releasing Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams who have been on the ISS since June 2024. The pair originally planned to go to space for just eight days but got stuck on the station after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft started experiencing problems. \n                  Elon Musk calls famed astronaut Andreas Mogensen an 'idiot' after being accused of 'lying' about stranded astronauts\n                 \n                  NASA astronauts stuck on International Space Station say they 'don't feel like castaways'\n                 \n                  NASA astronaut in hospital with undisclosed medical condition after extended mission\n                 The mission has become entangled in politics as Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk claimed - without evidence - that former President Joe Biden left the astronauts on the station for political reasons. NASA said the two astronauts have had to remain on the ISS to maintain its minimum staffing level.  Read more on Sky News:What does being in space do to your health?Spacewalk after seven months in orbitStranded astronauts say space is 'happy place' NASA brought forward the Crew-10 mission from 26 March, swapping a delayed SpaceX capsule for one that would be ready sooner. Mr Trump and Mr Musk's demand for an earlier return was an unusual intervention and put additional pressure on NASA's preparation and safety process. by David Blevins, Sky correspondent in Washington\n Picture the scene - two NASA astronauts hitch-hiking on the celestial highway. That's the impression created by the president of the United States. Donald Trump has used evocative words like \"abandoned\" to describe their plight.\n He claimed his predecessor, Joe Biden, had failed Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n The pair are still in the International Space Station, nine months after they arrived on an eight-day mission. In a parallel universe moment in the Oval Office, the President said of the astronauts: \"I hope they like each other… maybe they'll love each other.\" Referencing pictures of Williams floating in space, he added: \"I see the woman with the wild hair, good solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair.\" But NASA refutes the President's claim, emphasising it's got nothing to do with politics. Their prolonged mission is the result of technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Keen to get in on the drama, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk began talking about a \"rescue mission\". One small step into space has become one giant leap for political spin. NASA's commercial crew programme manager, Steve Stich, said SpaceX's \"rapid pace of operations\" had required changes to some of the ways it verifies flight safety. The agency had to address some \"late-breaking\" issues, NASA space operations chief Ken Bowersox told reporters, including investigating a fuel leak on a recent SpaceX Falcon 9 launch and deterioration of a coating on some of the Dragon crew capsule's thrusters."

Sam Jones, who describes herself as an \"outdoor enthusiast and hunter\", wrote a lengthy statement on social media, saying she was \"extremely concerned\" about the wombat's health, so she ran away from the joey's mother out of fear of attack. She says she \"immediately\" returned it to its mother. \"I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realised that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have (…) I have learnt from this situation, and am truly sorry for the distress I have caused.\" In the now-deleted video posted to her 92,000 followers on Instagram, Jones said: \"I caught a baby wombat\", as a man filming her laughs. In the video, the wombat could be seen struggling and heard hissing as its mother followed on the road behind. She returned the baby wombat to the roadside after several seconds. Jones left the country on Friday after the Australian government said it was reviewing her visa. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticised the influencer, who sparked outrage across the country, telling reporters: \"To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress to the mother, is just an outrage. \"And, you know, I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. \"Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. \"Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother - see how you go there.\" Read more on Sky News:Tesla warns of 'disproportionate' tariff impactUK economy unexpectedly shrank in JanuarySky News flies over the world's biggest iceberg The country's interior minister Tony Burke said on Thursday that his department is reviewing the conditions of the American's visa - and whether she had breached immigration law.

        "Content": "Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, has appeared at the International Criminal Court, accused of crimes against humanity. The 79-year-old appeared in the Netherlands via video link on Friday. His lawyer said he was suffering from \"debilitating medical issues\" but the judge in The Hague, Iulia Antoanella Motoc, said the court doctor had found him to be \"fully mentally aware and fit\", adding that he was allowed to appear remotely because he had taken a long flight. The lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, also claimed Duterte's arrest and transfer were \"pure and simple kidnapping\". Wearing a jacket and tie, Duterte sounded frail as he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. He was read his rights and informed of the charges. His supporters contest his arrest and say the court does not have jurisdiction. If convicted, he faces life in prison. His daughter Sara Duterte, the current vice president of the Philippines, said she was hoping to visit her father and have the hearing moved after meeting supporters outside the court. Back home in the Philippine capital region, large screens were set up to allow families of suspects killed in brutal crackdowns on illegal drugs to watch the proceedings. Europe correspondent Today was Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court and due to the long flight and the 79-year-old's existing health issues he appeared by video link. In a frail voice the former strongman leader confirmed his name, as well as his date and place of birth. The delivery seemed worlds away from the fiery speeches he gave while in power.  We didn't see that much of him after that as the lawyers discussed the legal process and set a date for the formal confirmation of charges in September. There was no plea from Mr Duterte - that's for the future. While his opponents see today as the first step towards justice, the legal road ahead is long and if a trial does happen it could be years before a verdict is reached. Prosecutors accuse Duterte of forming and arming death squads said to have killed thousands of drug dealers and users during the crackdowns. Estimates of the death toll during his six-year presidential term vary, from more than 6,000 reported by national police, to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups. Prosecutors claim he was an \"indirect co-perpetrator\" in multiple murders, allegedly overseeing killings between November 2011 and March 2019. Before becoming president, Duterte was the mayor of the southern city of Davao. According to the prosecution, he issued orders to police and other \"hitmen\" who formed the so-called \"Davao Death Squads\" or DDS.  The warrant for his arrest said there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Duterte bears criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of murder\". Duterte has said he takes full responsibility for the \"war on drugs\". Following the initial hearing, a confirmation of charges hearing is likely to follow. That is when prosecutors present part of their evidence and judges decide which charges can be in an indictment. A trial is unlikely to begin before early 2026. Duterte was arrested on Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He told officers \"you have to kill me to bring me to The Hague\" during a 12-hour standoff, a Philippine police general said. He also refused to have his fingerprints taken and threatened Police Major General Nicolas Torre with lawsuits before he was bundled on to a government-chartered jet at a Philippine air base and taken to The Hague, Maj Gen Torre told the Associated Press."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  One thousand feet above the world's largest iceberg, it's hard to believe what you're seeing. It stretches all the way to the horizon - a field of white as far as the eye can see. Its edge looks thin in comparison, until you make out a bird flying alongside and realise it is, in fact, a cliff of ice hundreds of feet high. Scientists who have used satellites to track the iceberg's decades-long meanderings north from Antarctica have codenamed the iceberg A23a. But up close, numbers and letters don't do it justice. Watch iceberg Q&A with Tom Clarke It's a seemingly endless slab of white, fringed by an aquamarine glow - the ocean at its base backlit by a sill of reflective ice below. Monotonous yet magnificent; we're flying along the coastline of a nation of ice. And it's also hard to believe you're seeing it at all. Where it has run aground - 50 miles off the small island of South Georgia - seems impossibly remote. We're 800 miles from the Falkland Islands and 900 miles from the icy wastes of Antarctica. With no runway on South Georgia, there's only one aircraft that ever flies here. Once a month or so, a Royal Air Force A400 transport plane based in the Falklands carries out Operation Cold Stare - a maritime surveillance and enforcement flight over the British Overseas Territory that includes the neighbouring South Sandwich Islands. It's a smooth, albeit noisy, two-hour flight to South Georgia. But as the dramatic peaks of the island come into view, the ride - for us inexperienced passengers at least - gets scary. Gusts off the mountains and steep terrain throw the plane and its occupants around. Not that that stops the pilots completing their circuit of the island. We fly over some of its 500,000 square mile marine protected zone designed to protect the greatest concentration of marine mammals and birds on the planet that is found on South Georgia. Only then do we head out to the iceberg, and even though it's only a few minutes flying from South Georgia it's at first hard to see. It's so big and white it's indistinguishable from the horizon through the haze. Until suddenly, its edge comes into view. It's immediately apparent the A23a is not too long for this world. Large icebergs hundreds of metres across have already broken off and are drifting closer to South Georgia. All along its edges, cracks are appearing and arches at its base caverns are being eroded by the warmer ocean here, undercutting the ice, weakening it further. The iceberg might present a problem for some of South Georgia's super-abundant penguins, seals and seabirds. A jumble of rapidly fragmenting ice could choke up certain bays and beaches in which colonies of the animals breed. The trillion tonnes of fresh water melting out of the iceberg could also interfere with the food webs that sustain marine life. However, the breeding season is coming to an end and icebergs are also known to fertilise oceans with sediment carried from the Antarctic continent.

There's not much of it down here. But fishing vessels, cruise ships and research teams ply these waters and smaller lumps of ice called \"growlers\" are a regular risk. A23a will create many. Icebergs this big are too few for scientists to know if they are becoming more frequent or not. But they are symptomatic of a clearly emerging trend. As our climate warms, Antarctica is slowly melting. It's losing around 150 billion tonnes of ice a year - half of it breaking off the continent in the form of icebergs calving from glaciers, the rest melting directly from its vast ice sheets as temperatures gradually rise. The pace of A23a's disintegration is far, far faster. It will disappear in months, not millennia. But watching its edges crumble and slide into the South Atlantic, you can't help seeing it as the fate of a whole continent in miniature."

        "Content": "Hamas says it has offered to release Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier who holds American citizenship, and the bodies of four other dual nationals. However, two officials from the group told the news agency Reuters the release was conditional on beginning the talks on the second phase of a ceasefire and lifting of a total blockade imposed by Israel two weeks ago. Mr Alexander, 21, from the US state of New Jersey, was 19 when he was taken from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. He is believed to be the last living American hostage being held in Gaza. Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy, told reporters earlier this month that achieving his release was a \"top priority\", while US hostage negotiator Adam Boehler has been meeting Hamas leaders in recent days. Hamas said it was taking action after being contacted by mediators about negotiations for the second phase of a peace deal. The group, which runs Gaza and describes itself as an \"Islamic Resistance Movement\", said it had \"responded responsibly and positively\". It also mentioned its \"complete readiness to begin negotiations and reach a comprehensive agreement on the issues of the second phase\". It called on the \"occupation\" (Israel) to \"fully implement its obligations\". The Israeli prime minister's office, however, said Hamas had \"not budged a millimetre\" and was engaging in \"manipulation and psychological warfare\". Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase of the peace deal, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. It is believed Hamas still has 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. Middle East correspondent Israel and Hamas say they are both willing to extend the ceasefire in Gaza, but there is a significant difference in opinion as to how that should happen. Israel says it is committed to the 'Witkoff Plan' which proposes releasing half of the remaining 59 hostages immediately and then the remaining hostages at the end of six weeks, as long as there has been an agreement reached by then to end the war. Hamas is insisting on the implementation of phase two of the original agreement, which would see a complete withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza, an end to the fighting and the end of Hamas rule in Gaza. Each side is trying to curry favour with Washington: Israel by endorsing Mr Witkoff's plan and Hamas by releasing at least one US national, Edan Alexander. Talks in Doha have continued all week, which has been seen as a positive sign, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now recalled his negotiating team for further consultations this weekend. Israel has already stopped humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza and cut off electricity to a water treatment plant, inciting international condemnation, but not from the US. After 15 months of war, it's not clear what a resumption in fighting would achieve for Israel, and it could risk the lives of the remaining living hostages. A deal with Hamas remains the best opportunity to release the captives. But an end to the war, as Hamas is demanding, could collapse the Israeli government if the far-right parties resign, as they have threatened to do, and therefore end Mr Netanyahu's hold on power. Key, probably, will be US President Donald Trump's reaction and whether he agrees that Hamas are being manipulative and disingenuous or if he feels Mr Netanyahu is passing up on an opportunity to get more hostages home and extend the ceasefire. Fighting has been halted in Gaza since 19 January under the first phase of a three-section ceasefire, during which Hamas exchanged 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Read more:Donald Trump says he thinks US will annex GreenlandChurch may have to 'rethink' the pontificate But, when the first phase finished on 2 March, the two sides failed to agree to begin the second one. Israel offered to extend the first phase, while Hamas said it would resume releasing hostages only under the second phase, during which Israel is required to discuss troop withdrawal and a permanent end to the war. Israel blocked the entry of all supply trucks into Gaza on 2 March, while Hamas called on Egyptian and Qatari mediators to intervene."

The electric carmaker raised the issue in a letter to the US Trade Representative's (USTR's) Office on the same day Mr Trump bought a Tesla car in a show of support for his close ally after a bloodbath for the company's shares. Investor concerns, mostly linked to the trade war, have pushed Tesla's market value 50% down from its December peak - a hit of roughly £800bn. Money latest: Boost for Brit holidaymakers over £6 'euro-visa' The backlash against the trade war intensified this week when Tesla suffered its worst daily loss in five years as part of broader stock market falls on fears that US consumers and businesses are now facing the prospect of a recession.

Tesla said it wanted to avoid retaliation of the type it faced in prior trade disputes, which resulted in increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into countries subject to US tariffs. Canada and the EU are among nations to have responded with counter measures after US tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports came into effect this week.  \"US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions,\"Tesla said in the letter. \"For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries.\" Mr Trump is considering imposing significant tariffs on vehicles and parts made around the world in early April. Such duties were initially confined to Canada and Mexico but later mostly suspended for four weeks amid complaints from US carmakers. The president has said they will return on 2 April, alongside \"reciprocal\" tariffs which are widely expected to hit the European Union for the first time. Tesla's letter warned that protectionist policies designed to bolster US manufacturing and jobs were further harmful as \"certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States\". It called for a phased approach to allow more time to bolster supply chains. \"As a US manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices,\" the EV maker concluded.

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n Steve Witkoff didn't stay long in the Russian capital. According to footage posted of his motorcade leaving and returning to Moscow's Vnukovo airport, he was here for little more than 12 hours. And for most of that, it seems, he was left waiting. Trump's fixer leaves Moscow - peace talks latest Mr Witkoff, a former property mogul who has become Donald Trump's chief negotiator, and is often referred to as the president's 'fixer', had been dispatched to Moscow to deliver the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire to Vladimir Putin. His visit had been scheduled near the start of the week, following the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia. But after arriving around lunchtime on Thursday, he was left twiddling his thumbs for at least eight hours before being called into the Kremlin. Mr Putin was apparently too busy meeting someone else - Belarusian leader Aleksander Lukashenko - for a hastily arranged state visit that had been announced the day before.  Was ally's visit a classic Putin power play? We don't know for sure if the timing of Mr Lukashenko's visit was deliberate, but it certainly didn't feel like a coincidence. Instead, it felt like a classic Putin power play. The Kremlin leader doesn't like to be backed into a corner and told what to do, especially on his own turf. This felt like a message to the Americans - \"I'm the boss, I set the schedule, and I'm not beholden to anyone\". He did eventually grant Mr Witkoff that all-important face time, once night had fallen and behind closed-doors. We don't know how long they spoke for, nor the exact details of their discussion, but I think we can make a pretty good guess given Mr Putin's comments earlier in the evening. At a press conference alongside Mr Lukashenko, he made it abundantly clear that he'll only sign up to a ceasefire if he gets something in return. And it's not just one thing he wants. All Russia's red lines remain By the sounds of things, he still wants everything. His comment regarding the \"root causes\" of the conflict suggests all of Russia's red lines remain - no NATO membership for Ukraine, no NATO troops as peacekeepers, and for Russia to keep all the territory it has seized.

It's now up to Mr Trump to decide what to do next."

Mr Carney, a former governor of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, will try to steer his country through a trade war brought by Donald Trump. Mr Trump has also made repeated threats to make the US neighbour to the north its 51st state. Speaking at a news conference after the swearing-in ceremony in Ottawa, Mr Carney said such talk was \"crazy\" and Canada will \"never ever be part of the US\". The American president has slapped 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products from 2 April. Mr Carney has already said he is ready to meet Mr Trump if he shows \"respect for Canadian sovereignty\" and is willing to take \"a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade\". The prime minister also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the US showed Canada some respect. Canada, which is the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, this week announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on those metals along with computers, sports equipment and other products worth $20bn in total. Canada already imposed tariffs on 4 March worth a similar amount on US goods in response to broader tariffs by Mr Trump.

Libyan national Abu Agila Mas'ud was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on 12 May, but district court judge Dabney L Friedrich has agreed to a postponement following submissions from the prosecution and defence. According to a court document, lawyers had raised the issue of the case's complexity, and the amount of time they had to adequately prepare for both pretrial proceedings and the trial itself. Lawyers also referred to the issue of \"voluminous discovery, including evidence located in other countries\", and the need for the defence to determine how best to defend the case. A new date for the trial is yet to be set. Mas'ud denies three charges relating to the attack. When the Boeing 747 exploded over the Dumfries and Galloway town of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988, it killed all 259 passengers and crew on board and 11 people on the ground. The bombing - which took place as the plane made its way from London to New York - remains the UK's worst terrorist attack.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  The UK economy shrank at the start of 2025, according to official figures which had been expected to show further meagre growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that output declined by 0.1% during the month following the 0.4% growth seen in December. A growth figure of 0.1% had been tipped by a majority of economists but the ONS noted a slump in manufacturing output. Money latest: Biggest cuts in fixed rate mortgage deals in almost six months Its director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: \"The economy shrank a little in January but grew in the latest three months as a whole, with the overall picture continuing to be of weak growth. \"The fall in January was driven by a notable slowdown in manufacturing, with oil and gas extraction and construction also having weak months. \"However, services continued to grow in January led by a strong month for retail, especially food stores, as people ate and drank at home more.\" January's data marks a fresh blow for the chancellor as the economy faces headwinds on many fronts at a time when her stated priority is securing economic growth. Looming large for Rachel Reeves is the threat of an adverse business reaction to budget tax hikes she is due to impose from April. Firms are facing the bulk of the £40bn bill through employer national insurance contributions and are warning of job losses, weaker pay rises and investment, along with possible price hikes, to account for the surge in costs. Consumer spending power is also set to be tested at the same time as essential bills including those for council tax, water and household energy are due to rise sharply. Other challenges include the escalating trade war initiated by Donald Trump, which is tipped by economists to dent growth prospects globally. Ms Reeves is low on ammunition as she prepares a spring statement for MPs later this month, with the welfare bill set to be slashed to avoid breaking her own spending rules. At the same time, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its forecasts for UK growth ahead.  The chancellor said of the ONS data: \"The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences. \"That's why we are going further and faster to protect our country, reform our public services and kickstart economic growth to deliver on our Plan for Change. \"And why we are launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War, fundamentally reshaping the British state to deliver for working people and their families; and taking on the blockers to get Britain building again.\" Read more from Sky News:Queen sent letter of support to rape survivor Gisele PelicotWhy is NHS England being abolished - and what is it? Her Conservative counterpart, Mel Stride, urged her to use the spring statement to change course. \"It is no surprise that growth is down again, following near no growth in the last three months of 2024\", he said. \"After consistently talking Britain down, raising taxes to record highs and crushing business with their extreme employment legislation this government is a growth killer. \"Labour inherited the fastest growing economy in the G7 but since they arrived business confidence has collapsed and jobs are being lost.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  Since the turn of the year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has had a single priority, repeated loud and clear at every opportunity; growth.  It was a battle cry repeated from Beijing to Cape Town via Davos and repeatedly at home but, judging by figures for January, the economy is not yet listening. A contraction in GDP of 0.1% was below economists' consensus of a similar amount of growth in the first month of the year. Following a larger than expected positive bump of 0.4% in December, it confirms the trend established in the second half of 2024 of an economy bumping along at around zero. Money latest: Boost for Brit holidaymakers over £6 'euro-visa' The causes were a significant decline in production and manufacturing of metals, pharmaceuticals and oil and gas that a small increase in services growth, the engine of the British economy, could not offset. Accommodation and pub and restaurant sales were down, with an increase in food sales indicating even more people than in a typically parsimonious January chose to entertain themselves at home. There are caveats. This is just a single month's data (and missing trade figures that the ONS has delayed after discovering \"errors\") but both moves are cause for concern. These numbers only cover the first 10 days of Donald Trump's second term and the impacts of his tariffs regime will not show up in the data for a few months yet, but it is safe to say increased costs on metals exports will be unhelpful. Read more:What's going on with Trump and tariffs - and how will they affect UK? The slowdown in hospitality also highlights the impending impact of Rachel Reeves' first budget, which takes effect next month. Business groups say the increase in employee National Insurance rates and thresholds, undeniably a cost to business, has had a chilling effect on plans for investment and the growth it might generate. Ms Reeves knows this, and the negative sentiment in part explains a mantra that has seen support for a third runway at Heathrow and a second at Gatwick, and every area of public policy, from planning to clean power to defence spending, yoked to her growth mission. The challenge for the chancellor is that these are strategic policy choices that will be judged over years not months, and she has only 12 days until she has to deliver a spring statement expected to show all her room for manoeuvre squeezed by low growth and higher borrowing costs."

Sky News has learnt that Howden is targeting a binding agreement to acquire Risk Strategies, which is backed by investment firm Kelso, by the end of this month.

The electric carmaker raised the issue in a letter to the US Trade Representative's (USTR's) Office on the same day Mr Trump bought a Tesla car in a show of support for his close ally after a bloodbath for the company's shares. Investor concerns, mostly linked to the trade war, have pushed Tesla's market value 50% down from its December peak - a hit of roughly £800bn.

Tesla said it wanted to avoid retaliation of the type it faced in prior trade disputes, which resulted in increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into countries subject to US tariffs. Canada and the EU are among nations to have responded with counter measures after US tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports came into effect this week.  \"US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions,\"Tesla said in the letter. \"For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries.\" Mr Trump is considering imposing significant tariffs on vehicles and parts made around the world in early April. Such duties were initially confined to Canada and Mexico but later mostly suspended for four weeks amid complaints from US carmakers. The president has said they will return on 2 April, alongside \"reciprocal\" tariffs which are widely expected to hit the European Union for the first time. Tesla's letter warned that protectionist policies designed to bolster US manufacturing and jobs were further harmful as \"certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States\". It called for a phased approach to allow more time to bolster supply chains. \"As a US manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices,\" the EV maker concluded.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  The last thing I was expecting to discover on the doorstep of a Falkirk house was a 70-year-old woman crying at the near 16% council tax rise she and tens of thousands of others face next month. Falkirk is bracing for the UK's biggest hike in bills as the local authority faces a crisis of costs. One councillor responsible for the increases has called in the police after receiving beheading taunts and threats of violence. The area is facing its most difficult period in its 30-year history, while residents feel fragile and fobbed off. Councils oversee the running of schools and social care, maintaining roads and collecting bins. They take charge of housing, swimming pools and libraries. The list is endless. But Britain's local authorities are cash-strapped and there are questions about how they should be funded in the long term. Sky News went inside one Falkirk street to get a snapshot of the mood - and it was bleak. \n                  Most areas set to increase council tax by at least 4.99% from April\n                 \n                  Millions face council tax rise of more than 5% after government gives green light to bigger hikes\n                 \n                  Rising cost of social care and school transport to cause £54bn blackhole for councils\n                 We went door to door on Wilson Road and first stumbled across 70-year-old Catherine Mochar. The unpaid carer was seemingly unaware of the upcoming changes to her bill and became visibly upset at the prospect of scraping together more cash in her already extremely stretched household budget. \"It's absolutely ridiculous,\" she said as her voice cracked. Ms Mochar looks after her elderly sister and says her care package was revoked as the pensioner was deemed suitable to deal with the situation herself. She says she is not entitled to a council tax exemption and worries about finding an extra 15.6%. She said: \"I am a pensioner. I don't know where I am going to get it [the money] from. It is quite scary the thought of it.\" Round the corner from Catherine's house, we meet a family who feel like they are paying more and getting less. Claire Hamilton and William Reid have a three-year-old son and regularly use the local foodbank to make ends meet. \"It is going to become a choice between heating the house or paying council tax. Or getting food in and paying the council tax,\" Claire says. \"It is quite a jump for not a lot in return. The collections on the bins keep getting longer and longer.\" She continues: \"You want to do the best by your child and obviously they are not aware of all these stresses going on in the background.\" Council tax differs across UK A drop in the frequency of bin collections is a moan people across the UK share and feeds into the narrative surrounding local services. Council tax rates have been frozen or capped for much of the last two decades in Scotland, but this year the Scottish government has granted local leaders the power to go their own way. In England, a principle exists which usually prevents more than a 5% increase to council tax without a referendum, mostly to protect taxpayers from excessive increases. It is thought the average increase in England will not surpass last year's total of 5.1%. There are some exemptions including Bradford which is hiking costs by 10%. But Falkirk surpasses everyone and is the UK's most extreme case. Independent councillor Laura Murtagh initiated the idea of the 15.6% increase which was eventually voted through by most of her colleagues. Councillor behind 15.6% rise calls in police She stresses anything less than the increase she proposed would have resulted in services, including education provision, being slashed. But it has come at a personal cost. Ms Murtagh, who stresses she does not want to incite a further pile-on, tells Sky News she has contacted police after threats of violence and taunts online depicting beheadings. She said: \"It has made me not want to go out. It has made me not want to go to events. \"I am having a conversation with the police. They are nasty threats. There are people who have said you could do with a kicking or you could do with more than that. \"People are sharing memes where they are doing beheading memes or whatever.\" Read more from Sky News:Queen sent letter of support to rape survivor Gisele PelicotWhy is NHS England being abolished - and what is it? Local leaders say their rates have been much lower than their neighbours for many years which is unsustainable as demand for services soars. The leader of Falkirk Council, Cecil Meiklejohn, was asked by Sky News if she could justify the 15.6% rise. She said: \"It is quite a hike. We always knew council tax needed to go up. \"We know that we have to continue to deliver good quality services, and we can't do that without increasing our revenue and the only way we have the opportunity to do that locally is by increasing council tax.\" She concluded: \"We will work with people who are going to be impacted by the increase.\""

She insisted she was concentrating on winning as she looks to become the party's first ever mayor in May. In an interview with Sky News, Dame Andrea also spoke for the first time about her experience of domestic abuse, denying Reform has a \"woman problem\" but accepted \"we need to start talking more about issues, what women are interested in\". Having lost her seat as a Conservative in the 2024 election, Dame Andrea briefly quit politics only to return earlier this year as Reform's newest recruit. She is now standing as the party's candidate to become the first Greater Lincolnshire mayor, in a race that psephologists think could be Reform's best hope of turning itself from a party of protest into one that is governing. That's because Reform is on the march in Lincolnshire, which is a key battleground between the Conservatives and Reform in the local and mayoral elections in May. \n                  Mystery over claims of shaved cats in Lincolnshire village\n                 \n                  How people are coping with the floods: Carpets, furniture and food destroyed as homes deluged under feet of water\n                 \n                  Baby killed in car crash - police investigating whether incident linked to icy conditions\n                 Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, took the Conservative seat of Boston and Skegness in the last election as Reform came second in a further two of the county's eight constituencies. This farming country has long been part of the patchwork of Conservative England and it is in these heartlands that Reform hopes it can land a significant blow to its political rivals in the coming weeks. \"It's a worry,\" admits one Labour insider who doesn't much relish the prospect of having to deal with a newly minted Reform party mayor should Dame Andrea win in May against Labour candidate Jason Stockwood, the Conservative Rob Waltham and independent Marianne Overton. There is also the Lincolnshire council race, which Reform is targeting. All 70 seats are up for grabs and the Conservatives, which have a 38-seat majority, are defending 53 seats. The only way is up for Reform here, while the Conservatives, who have held this council for 10 of the past 13 elections, are bracing for a drubbing. Tories say Jenkyns is from Yorkshire The Conservatives make the point that they have a \"strong local candidate who is born and bred in Lincolnshire, whereas Dame Andrea is from Yorkshire\" when I ask them about the race. \"We are fighting hard, we have a proven track record of delivery in charge of local services whereas Reform aren't tried and tested,\" the Conservatives said. \"And if they're anything like Reform nationally, who don't turn up on important votes, then they won't show up for people locally.\" Dame Andrea is still based in Yorkshire where she used to be an MP, as this is where her son attends school. But she rents a place in Lincolnshire and has vowed to move to the county should she win the mayoralty. She also points out that she grew up in Lincolnshire and was a local councillor before moving to Yorkshire after her shock victory over Ed Balls in the 2015 general election. Read more:Rupert Lowe consulting lawyers over libel actionPolice launch investigation into Rupert Lowe over 'verbal threats' 'Fed up' farmers eyeing Reform When we meet her on the road in Lincolnshire, she takes us to meet some farmers whose livelihoods are under intense pressure - be it over local flooding and flood defences or changes to inheritance tax and farming subsidies that are affecting their farms. There is little love for Labour in the gathering of farmers, who in the main seem to be lapsed Conservative voters that are now eyeing Reform, as a number of them tell me how they are fed up with how the Environment Agency and local politicians are running their area. \"We're fed up with all of them,\" said one farmer. \"We just want some action. As farmers we know drainage is so important, we just want to get it sorted.\" They are also alarmed and anxious about the inheritance tax changes introduced by Labour and are pressing for carve-outs for small farms handed down from generation to generation amid fears they will have to sell up to pay the inheritance tax bills. But the troubles at the top of Reform hadn't gone unnoticed by this group. Unprompted, one of the farmers raised the row between the suspended Reform MP Rupert Lowe and the party leadership, telling Dame Andrea that while he \"really likes Reform\" he doesn't much like what he's seeing at the moment.  'Spat looks worse because Reform is small' The farmer said: \"I don't follow politics avidly. But I just look and say [Rupert Lowe] is full of common sense and I really like him and I don't know what's happened, but it looks from outside [he has been] chucked under the bus. \"And I'm like, am I getting second thoughts about Reform? I don't know what's gone on, but it concerns me about what's going on with Reform.\" Dame Andrea tries to downplay it and says the \"spat\" looks worse because it's a smaller party. \"To me it's about the movement, the right policies, to carry on. What is the alternative? This will blow over and Reform will keep getting strong,\" she said. Can Jenkyns and Farage co-exist? Dame Andrea would clearly like the infighting to stop, but it raises questions for me about how she will fit into this very male-dominated party, in which all four MPs are male, with Dame Andrea the only senior woman beyond the former Conservative minister Ann Widdicombe. She is, like Nigel Farage, a disrupter - Dame Andrea was one of the first Tories to call for Theresa May and Rishi Sunak to stand down, and a conviction politician who fervently backed Boris Johnson and Brexit. If she does win this mayoral race she will be a big personality in Reform alongside Farage, which leaves me wondering if they can co-exist in a party already at war. Jenkyns was in an abusive relationship Reform does struggle with female voters, with fewer women voting for the party against all age cohorts, young to old. Dame Andrea tells me she doesn't think the party has a \"woman problem\", but she does think it needs to talk about more issues that she thinks women are interested in, citing education, special educational needs and mental health. When I raise the matter of violence against women and how the party has handled revelations that one of its own MPs was jailed in a youth detention centre as a teenager for assaulting his girlfriend, Dame Andrea reveals to me she has been in an abusive relationship. \"I know how it can break you. I know how you sort of start losing your identity. So I've been on that side,\" she said. \"And I've also helped constituents to fight against this, so it matters, we need to do more in society because whether it's men or women, one is too much in my view.\" 👉Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast app👈 Out on the campaign trail, even in the Labour territory of Lincoln where Hamish Falconer is the local MP, Dame Andrea gets a warm welcome. She tells me she thinks she can win it: \"I might be living in blind hope here. But I've got that feeling.\" This corner of England has become a test bed for Reform to see if it can turn from a party of protest into one that has a shot at governing in the form of a regional mayor. If Reform can succeed in that - what might come next? It would be a remarkable comeback for Dame Andrea and a remarkable victory for Reform too."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  Since the turn of the year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has had a single priority, repeated loud and clear at every opportunity; growth.  It was a battle cry repeated from Beijing to Cape Town via Davos and repeatedly at home but, judging by figures for January, the economy is not yet listening. A contraction in GDP of 0.1% was below economists' consensus of a similar amount of growth in the first month of the year. Following a larger than expected positive bump of 0.4% in December, it confirms the trend established in the second half of 2024 of an economy bumping along at around zero. Money latest: Boost for Brit holidaymakers over £6 'euro-visa' The causes were a significant decline in production and manufacturing of metals, pharmaceuticals and oil and gas that a small increase in services growth, the engine of the British economy, could not offset. Accommodation and pub and restaurant sales were down, with an increase in food sales indicating even more people than in a typically parsimonious January chose to entertain themselves at home. There are caveats. This is just a single month's data (and missing trade figures that the ONS has delayed after discovering \"errors\") but both moves are cause for concern. These numbers only cover the first 10 days of Donald Trump's second term and the impacts of his tariffs regime will not show up in the data for a few months yet, but it is safe to say increased costs on metals exports will be unhelpful. Read more:What's going on with Trump and tariffs - and how will they affect UK? The slowdown in hospitality also highlights the impending impact of Rachel Reeves' first budget, which takes effect next month. Business groups say the increase in employee National Insurance rates and thresholds, undeniably a cost to business, has had a chilling effect on plans for investment and the growth it might generate. Ms Reeves knows this, and the negative sentiment in part explains a mantra that has seen support for a third runway at Heathrow and a second at Gatwick, and every area of public policy, from planning to clean power to defence spending, yoked to her growth mission. The challenge for the chancellor is that these are strategic policy choices that will be judged over years not months, and she has only 12 days until she has to deliver a spring statement expected to show all her room for manoeuvre squeezed by low growth and higher borrowing costs."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  The UK economy shrank at the start of 2025, according to official figures which had been expected to show further meagre growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that output declined by 0.1% during the month following the 0.4% growth seen in December. A growth figure of 0.1% had been tipped by a majority of economists but the ONS noted a slump in manufacturing output. Money latest: Biggest cuts in fixed rate mortgage deals in almost six months Its director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: \"The economy shrank a little in January but grew in the latest three months as a whole, with the overall picture continuing to be of weak growth. \"The fall in January was driven by a notable slowdown in manufacturing, with oil and gas extraction and construction also having weak months. \"However, services continued to grow in January led by a strong month for retail, especially food stores, as people ate and drank at home more.\" January's data marks a fresh blow for the chancellor as the economy faces headwinds on many fronts at a time when her stated priority is securing economic growth. Looming large for Rachel Reeves is the threat of an adverse business reaction to budget tax hikes she is due to impose from April. Firms are facing the bulk of the £40bn bill through employer national insurance contributions and are warning of job losses, weaker pay rises and investment, along with possible price hikes, to account for the surge in costs. Consumer spending power is also set to be tested at the same time as essential bills including those for council tax, water and household energy are due to rise sharply. Other challenges include the escalating trade war initiated by Donald Trump, which is tipped by economists to dent growth prospects globally. Ms Reeves is low on ammunition as she prepares a spring statement for MPs later this month, with the welfare bill set to be slashed to avoid breaking her own spending rules. At the same time, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its forecasts for UK growth ahead.  The chancellor said of the ONS data: \"The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences. \"That's why we are going further and faster to protect our country, reform our public services and kickstart economic growth to deliver on our Plan for Change. \"And why we are launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War, fundamentally reshaping the British state to deliver for working people and their families; and taking on the blockers to get Britain building again.\" Read more from Sky News:Queen sent letter of support to rape survivor Gisele PelicotWhy is NHS England being abolished - and what is it? Her Conservative counterpart, Mel Stride, urged her to use the spring statement to change course. \"It is no surprise that growth is down again, following near no growth in the last three months of 2024\", he said. \"After consistently talking Britain down, raising taxes to record highs and crushing business with their extreme employment legislation this government is a growth killer. \"Labour inherited the fastest growing economy in the G7 but since they arrived business confidence has collapsed and jobs are being lost.\""

        "Content": "A decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners complied with the Equality Act 2010, the Attorney General has told a court. Pensioners Peter and Florence Fanning are taking legal action against the decision to remove the universal element of the benefit. The change was announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves last July, which later led to the Scottish government following suit. Mr and Mrs Fanning, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, are arguing both governments failed to adequately consult with those of pension age and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. The Court of Session in Edinburgh is being asked to rule on whether the decision was unlawful. Documents used in the run-up to the decision were read to the court by Attorney General Andrew Webster KC, acting for the UK government, known as the first respondent. The Scottish government, known as the second respondent, is represented by James Mure KC while Mr and Mrs Fanning, known as the petitioners, are represented by Joanna Cherry KC. On Thursday, former SNP MP Ms Cherry said the decision to cut the payment had been \"unlawful\" on the grounds the UK and Scottish governments had failed in their duties to properly assess the impact, and that there had been an \"abject failure\" to carry out an equality impact assessment, as well as a failure to consult people of pension age who would be affected by the change. However, Mr Webster said on Friday \"the reasons why the petitioners do not get pension age winter heating payment (PAWHP) is because they are just below the threshold\" for the devolved Scottish benefit. He added there is \"no general common law duty to consult residents who may be affected by such a law\". Mr Webster said: \"At all stages, pensioner poverty and the effect of pensioner poverty was being considered, and effects to mitigate were being put forward - what can be done to encourage take-up, to encourage those who aren't claiming but who are entitled to get the benefit of winter fuel payment.\" He said that as of April 2024, the Fannings would not have been entitled to a benefit from the UK government, due to devolution, and said the Court of Session did not have \"jurisdiction\" to decide if laws made in England and Wales were unlawful.  Read more from Sky News:Ministers 'determined to fix broken benefits system'MPs briefing against work and pensions secretary should 'shut up' Mr Webster said a deliverability assessment on 20 July \"identified that the policy will have a higher proportion on couples; older pensioners will be less affected\". He claimed it had been \"done with rigour\", adding: \"Clearly considerations and possibility have been put forward and adopted, it is structured, it has looked at the details. \"It has been recorded, so it can be seen.\" Mr Webster cited \"engagement with Age UK and the Citizens Advice Bureau\", and said documents looked at \"the impact of pensioners in poverty\" and those just above the threshold who would experience \"cash loss\". In his submission, Mr Webster argued the Equality Act had been \"complied with\". The Scottish government learnt of the chancellor's announcement 90 minutes before a statement in the House of Commons, the court heard later. Mr Mure said it was \"out of the blue\", and PAWHP was the \"largest of devolved social security benefits\" due to be delivered by government agency Social Security Scotland following a consultation which began in October 2023, and it was intended as a universal benefit. The court heard \"the aims hadn't changed, albeit the Scottish government had changed eligibility on grounds of affordability\" as \"universality was simply not affordable\" due to budget cuts of £147m. The case, in front of Judge Lady Hood, was adjourned to a future date."

US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been stuck on the ISS for nine months, having had their journey home repeatedly pushed back. The Crew-10 mission was initially scheduled to launch the replacement crew of four astronauts from Florida on Wednesday, but a last-minute issue with the rocket's ground systems forced a delay. NASA said on Thursday that SpaceX, headed and founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, had resolved the issue - flushing a suspected pocket of air out of a hydraulic clamp arm - and that the weather was 95% favourable for a Friday launch. The crew is now expected to arrive at the ISS on Saturday night. They are NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, who are both military pilots, along with Japan's Takuya Onishi and Russia's Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, releasing Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams who have been on the ISS since June 2024. The pair originally planned to go to space for just eight days but got stuck on the station after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft started experiencing problems. \n                  Elon Musk calls famed astronaut Andreas Mogensen an 'idiot' after being accused of 'lying' about stranded astronauts\n                 \n                  NASA astronauts stuck on International Space Station say they 'don't feel like castaways'\n                 \n                  NASA astronaut in hospital with undisclosed medical condition after extended mission\n                 The mission has become entangled in politics as Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk claimed - without evidence - that former President Joe Biden left the astronauts on the station for political reasons.

In a parallel universe moment in the Oval Office, the President said of the astronauts: \"I hope they like each other… maybe they'll love each other.\" Referencing pictures of Williams floating in space, he added: \"I see the woman with the wild hair, good solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair.\" But NASA refutes the President's claim, emphasising it's got nothing to do with politics. Their prolonged mission is the result of technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Keen to get in on the drama, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk began talking about a \"rescue mission\". One small step into space has become one giant leap for political spin. NASA's commercial crew programme manager, Steve Stich, said SpaceX's \"rapid pace of operations\" had required changes to some of the ways it verifies flight safety. The agency had to address some \"late-breaking\" issues, NASA space operations chief Ken Bowersox told reporters, including investigating a fuel leak on a recent SpaceX Falcon 9 launch and deterioration of a coating on some of the Dragon crew capsule's thrusters."

        "Content": "By Katie Spencer, arts and entertainment correspondent, and Sabah Choudhry, news correspondent   How artificial intelligence will affect our lives going forward is a question being figured out across pretty much all industries right now.  While many in the arts have expressed concerns over how algorithms learn from their work, Black Eyes Peas star will.i.am believes it actually should \"inspire you to create\". An early artificial intelligence supporter, he says: \"If you're basing what you're going to do tomorrow off yesterday, you're not growing.\" The music producer spoke to Sky News after giving a demo of his new AI radio app in London. Rather than artificial intelligence being something with negative connotations, he insists its potential should \"inspire better, broader, deeper, faster…[it] shouldn't stop you from being human\". As one of the most prominent voices to position himself in the pro-AI camp, his enthusiasm is certainly infectious. Those who turned out to see the demonstration of his app-based platform RAiDiO.FYI got to see the musician and tech entrepreneur challenge one of his AI personas to make a joke comparing computer chips and guacamole chips with reasonably funny results. \n                  Gangs Of London is back - here's what you need to know\n                 \n                  Stalker who 'terrified' Cheryl jailed - as Girls Aloud singer feared for her and her son's safety\n                 \n                  Four female news presenters settle age and sex discrimination tribunal claims with BBC\n                 He hopes listeners will come to interact and talk with AI presenters in the not-too-distant future. But is it a gimmick or a taste of the future? Sky News put it to will that some of his musical counterparts worry AI - with its instant ability for anyone to make a song in his style - waters down the music industry. \"I don't think anything can water down our industry any more than TikTok has,\" he responded. \"We used to listen to three-minute songs, now we're down to nine seconds….TikTok and that algorithm, you know, changes what record companies are looking for, changes the architecture of the song… it's watered down…we an ocean (sic).\" Sean Paul on embracing AI  But Jamaican dancehall musician Sean Paul isn't entirely won over by AI's potential. \"It's a pandora's box,\" the rapper said, speaking to Sky News, \"when you open it, it's going to change all the parameters. It's down to you to get used to the game.\" \"I am apprehensive about certain parts of [it] in terms of making people lazy to writing\", the 52-year-old, who has worked with countless stars over his 20-year career, said. \"It can become a toy and make music more dispensable.\" He said he recognises there are copyright and ethical considerations with using AI in the music-making process - especially where algorithms are concerned and they may mimic popular sounds. He said: \"If it does happen that AI takes my stuff and I'm never compensated because of it (…) I will fight that. \"It's gonna happen. Already though, I feel me, the artist, the creator, I've got the short end of the stick for a long time. Even before the days of streaming - we get 0.0 something of the product - and it's we that created it.\" AI as a 'tool' However, he also acknowledged that \"times have changed\" - and that adapting is key to surviving the ever-changing music industry.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  One thousand feet above the world's largest iceberg, it's hard to believe what you're seeing. It stretches all the way to the horizon - a field of white as far as the eye can see. Its edge looks thin in comparison, until you make out a bird flying alongside and realise it is, in fact, a cliff of ice hundreds of feet high. Scientists who have used satellites to track the iceberg's decades-long meanderings north from Antarctica have codenamed the iceberg A23a. But up close, numbers and letters don't do it justice. Watch iceberg Q&A with Tom Clarke It's a seemingly endless slab of white, fringed by an aquamarine glow - the ocean at its base backlit by a sill of reflective ice below. Monotonous yet magnificent; we're flying along the coastline of a nation of ice. And it's also hard to believe you're seeing it at all. Where it has run aground - 50 miles off the small island of South Georgia - seems impossibly remote. We're 800 miles from the Falkland Islands and 900 miles from the icy wastes of Antarctica. With no runway on South Georgia, there's only one aircraft that ever flies here. Once a month or so, a Royal Air Force A400 transport plane based in the Falklands carries out Operation Cold Stare - a maritime surveillance and enforcement flight over the British Overseas Territory that includes the neighbouring South Sandwich Islands. It's a smooth, albeit noisy, two-hour flight to South Georgia. But as the dramatic peaks of the island come into view, the ride - for us inexperienced passengers at least - gets scary. Gusts off the mountains and steep terrain throw the plane and its occupants around. Not that that stops the pilots completing their circuit of the island. We fly over some of its 500,000 square mile marine protected zone designed to protect the greatest concentration of marine mammals and birds on the planet that is found on South Georgia. Only then do we head out to the iceberg, and even though it's only a few minutes flying from South Georgia it's at first hard to see. It's so big and white it's indistinguishable from the horizon through the haze. Until suddenly, its edge comes into view. It's immediately apparent the A23a is not too long for this world. Large icebergs hundreds of metres across have already broken off and are drifting closer to South Georgia. All along its edges, cracks are appearing and arches at its base caverns are being eroded by the warmer ocean here, undercutting the ice, weakening it further. The iceberg might present a problem for some of South Georgia's super-abundant penguins, seals and seabirds. A jumble of rapidly fragmenting ice could choke up certain bays and beaches in which colonies of the animals breed. The trillion tonnes of fresh water melting out of the iceberg could also interfere with the food webs that sustain marine life. However, the breeding season is coming to an end and icebergs are also known to fertilise oceans with sediment carried from the Antarctic continent. Read more:The megaberg: Bigger than London and five times the weight of Mt EverestThe waters once ran red with whale blood - now this island is conservation success story The impact on shipping is more relevant. There's not much of it down here. But fishing vessels, cruise ships and research teams ply these waters and smaller lumps of ice called \"growlers\" are a regular risk. A23a will create many. Icebergs this big are too few for scientists to know if they are becoming more frequent or not. But they are symptomatic of a clearly emerging trend. As our climate warms, Antarctica is slowly melting. It's losing around 150 billion tonnes of ice a year - half of it breaking off the continent in the form of icebergs calving from glaciers, the rest melting directly from its vast ice sheets as temperatures gradually rise. The pace of A23a's disintegration is far, far faster. It will disappear in months, not millennia. But watching its edges crumble and slide into the South Atlantic, you can't help seeing it as the fate of a whole continent in miniature."

        "Content": " The moon has turned red in an event known as a blood moon following a lunar eclipse - which was partly visible in the UK just before dawn on Friday. In the UK, the moon had already set below the horizon by the time of the full lunar eclipse at 6.58am, so only a partial lunar eclipse was visible and part, rather than all, of the moon appeared red. But the full lunar eclipse was visible to people in North and South America and spectacular pictures were published from there. The moon turned dark as it moved into Earth's shadow and eventually appeared red, hence the \"blood moon\" nickname. The sun, Earth, and moon are almost, rather than fully, aligned during a partial lunar eclipse, creating a dark section on the moon. A blood moon is a phenomenon that only happens a handful of times a year. The last total lunar eclipse was in May 2022 when the moon turned completely red. Read more:What we learnt flying over the world's largest icebergWhy African clawed frog may help stop mosquitoes spreading malaria Astronomer Jake Foster, at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: \"When the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, the only sunlight that can reach the moon must first pass through the Earth's atmosphere. \"As sunlight enters the atmosphere, different wavelengths (and therefore colours) of light will be scattered and bounced around by differing amounts. Blue light scatters a great deal, which is why our skies are blue. \"Red light is mostly unaffected by the gases of the atmosphere, so it travels all the way through them and out the other side where it can shine on the moon, making it appear red.\" From those watching from the UK, the moon was expected to start to turn red at around 5.30am and the best views would have been just before 6.30am, according to astronomers. No equipment was needed to look at it, Mr Foster said. According to the Royal Astronomical Society, some people living in the west of the UK may have been able to see a total lunar eclipse with the naked eye, weather permitting. Others in eastern and southeastern England are only expected to be able to see a partial lunar eclipse. This is because the moon will not be completely within the Earth's shadow by the time it sets. According to the latest Met Office forecast, much of the UK would have been covered by cloud when the eclipse was most visible, apart from parts of the South East, East Anglia and central Scotland."

        "Content": "By Katie Spencer, arts and entertainment correspondent, and Sabah Choudhry, news correspondent   How artificial intelligence will affect our lives going forward is a question being figured out across pretty much all industries right now.  While many in the arts have expressed concerns over how algorithms learn from their work, Black Eyes Peas star will.i.am believes it actually should \"inspire you to create\". An early artificial intelligence supporter, he says: \"If you're basing what you're going to do tomorrow off yesterday, you're not growing.\" The music producer spoke to Sky News after giving a demo of his new AI radio app in London. Rather than artificial intelligence being something with negative connotations, he insists its potential should \"inspire better, broader, deeper, faster…[it] shouldn't stop you from being human\". As one of the most prominent voices to position himself in the pro-AI camp, his enthusiasm is certainly infectious. Those who turned out to see the demonstration of his app-based platform RAiDiO.FYI got to see the musician and tech entrepreneur challenge one of his AI personas to make a joke comparing computer chips and guacamole chips with reasonably funny results. \n                  Gangs Of London is back - here's what you need to know\n                 \n                  Stalker who 'terrified' Cheryl jailed - as Girls Aloud singer feared for her and her son's safety\n                 \n                  Four female news presenters settle age and sex discrimination tribunal claims with BBC\n                 He hopes listeners will come to interact and talk with AI presenters in the not-too-distant future. But is it a gimmick or a taste of the future? Sky News put it to will that some of his musical counterparts worry AI - with its instant ability for anyone to make a song in his style - waters down the music industry. \"I don't think anything can water down our industry any more than TikTok has,\" he responded. \"We used to listen to three-minute songs, now we're down to nine seconds….TikTok and that algorithm, you know, changes what record companies are looking for, changes the architecture of the song… it's watered down…we an ocean (sic).\" Sean Paul on embracing AI  But Jamaican dancehall musician Sean Paul isn't entirely won over by AI's potential. \"It's a pandora's box,\" the rapper said, speaking to Sky News, \"when you open it, it's going to change all the parameters. It's down to you to get used to the game.\" \"I am apprehensive about certain parts of [it] in terms of making people lazy to writing\", the 52-year-old, who has worked with countless stars over his 20-year career, said. \"It can become a toy and make music more dispensable.\" He said he recognises there are copyright and ethical considerations with using AI in the music-making process - especially where algorithms are concerned and they may mimic popular sounds. He said: \"If it does happen that AI takes my stuff and I'm never compensated because of it (…) I will fight that. \"It's gonna happen. Already though, I feel me, the artist, the creator, I've got the short end of the stick for a long time. Even before the days of streaming - we get 0.0 something of the product - and it's we that created it.\" AI as a 'tool' However, he also acknowledged that \"times have changed\" - and that adapting is key to surviving the ever-changing music industry. Paul says none of his published music has been touched by AI - but he is open to experimenting with it. \"I've used it for trying to finish riddim patterns that I have….I used it as a tool… as I think everybody should.\" Some big names in music, like Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John, have openly called for a legal framework to be established to better protect artists, which will.i.am agrees is paramount \"to not always lead with greed, especially with powerful systems\" like AI. \"There needs to be some type of artificial intelligence constitution….I believe you should be licensed to put out AIs right now and you're not.\" AI and copyright concerns Over 1,000 artists, from Damon Albarn to Kate Bush, recently released a silent album to protest possible changes to UK copyright AI laws.

        "Content": "A man who stalked pop star Cheryl has been jailed for 16 weeks after leaving her \"terrified\". The Girls Aloud singer said she feared for her and her child's safety after Daniel Bannister turned up at her Buckinghamshire home last December. Bannister was already banned from doing so after being handed a restraining order and a four-month jail sentence last September, after visiting the property twice earlier in 2024 - in January and July. High Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard Bannister, who reportedly killed a man in 2012, \"can't stay away\" from Cheryl. The defendant, 50, admitted going to the 41-year-old's house and ringing the bell at the gate on 10 December. Cheryl \"immediately panicked\" when she spotted him outside her property for a third time, and was concerned for her seven-year-old son Bear, the court was told.

I feared for my safety and my child's safety. My son was due back from the cinema and I didn't want him to see Daniel. \"I was concerned he was looking for a way into the property. I want to protect my child from any harm.\" Liam Payne's death The singer's ex-partner Liam Payne died last October in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after falling from his third-floor hotel balcony.

District Judge Arvind Sharma also handed Bannister a new restraining order, banning him from contacting the singer. Judge Sharma said Bannister knew the star was \"very distressed and upset\" by what he was doing. The January 2024 visit In the January 2024 visit, the court was told Bannister spoke through an intercom system at the gate, claiming he had \"come to get Cheryl\". \"He said 'it's Daniel, I've come to get Cheryl',\" prosecutor Datta Ryan told the court. \"She was terrified and contacted her security guard. She felt violated, terrified and unsafe in her own home.\" The July 2024 visit In July of the same year, Bannister again called at the house. The singer was at home with her son when she saw Bannister outside. \"She called her brother,\" Ms Ryan said. \"The defendant was standing outside her property and remained there.\" 'I want a glass of wine' Speaking over the intercom, he said: \"I'm really thirsty I just want a glass of wine please,\" the court heard. \"The defendant has disregarded the victim and the court,\" Ms Ryan said. \"He can't stay away.\" Speaking about the third visit to her home, Bannister's lawyer Colin Mackrell said: \"He wanted to sort things out to reassure her.\" Bannister, who was described by Mr Mackrell as a \"serious musician\", has already served three months in prison, the court heard, and could be released in a matter of weeks. He killed 48-year-old Rajendra Patel in an attack at a south London YMCA shelter in 2012 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter, The Sun reported."

Clarke is suing Guardian News and Media (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast, including an article in April 2021 that said 20 women who knew him professionally had come forward with allegations of misconduct. Clarke denies the allegations, while GNM is defending its reporting as being both true and in the public interest. At a hearing on Friday, actress Louise Dylan said she heard through a friend that Clarke's former business partner Davie Fairbanks had claimed he saw her being groped by Clarke at the wrap party for The Knot. After learning of the current libel case she wrote an email to Clarke, who she described as a friend, in which she said the allegation was untrue, she said.

She also said she never spoke to journalists from the Guardian. The Guardian did not report the allegations about Ms Dylan. She said: \"They are reporters who are supposed to research an article before publishing something. \"I was told I had spoken to these journalists to corroborate a story but I had not.\" She said she had been at the wrap party with her friend and her boyfriend, following a group dinner beforehand. She said she didn't \"remember [the wrap party] too well,\" adding, \"I don't remember the specifics of the party other than we had a nice time\". Philip Williams, representing Clarke, previously told the court in written submissions that the actor \"has clearly established the falsity of all of the allegations\". The barrister continued that his client was \"barely able to reply to the allegations\" published by the Guardian and was \"perceived as a criminal by all those who previously trusted and worked with him\". Gavin Millar KC, for GNM, said in his written submissions that the paper \"did not simply accept what was said to it\" and that \"much time and resource was devoted to getting to the truth\". He also said that there is \"ample evidence\" that all of the articles were true or substantially true. Clarke, who is best known for his roles in Doctor Who and the Kidulthood movie trilogy, had his BAFTA membership and outstanding British contribution to cinema award suspended in 2021, following the allegations. He later dropped a legal action he had brought against the charity. The hearing before Mrs Justice Steyn is due to conclude next month, with a decision expected in writing at a later date. :: This article has been updated to make clear that The Guardian did not report the allegations about Ms Dylan."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n  Stephen Graham says the rise of \"misogynistic tendencies\" is concerning and we're \"all accountable to an extent\" to finding a solution. His new limited series Adolescence looks at the impact of social media on children and the accessibility to radicalised views online. Speaking to Sky News, Graham says there was a certain moment for him that inspired him to create the show. \"I read an article about a young girl who was stabbed to death by a young boy, and then a few months later, on the news there was a young girl who, again, had been brutally stabbed to death by a young boy in a completely different part of the country. \"If I'm really honest with you, that hurt my heart and I just thought, why? Why does this kind of thing happen? What is this society? Why have we reached this point where this kind of thing is happening? What was the reason?\" The four-part drama, he says, doesn't have the answer but instead holds a mirror up to society asking how can the growing presence of incel culture be quashed? \"You look at it and you see that we're kind of all accountable to an extent. There's failings within the school system, there's situations where the education system can look at this, look at what's happened with that kind of rise in these misogynistic tendencies. \n                  Matilda's Emma Thompson on her transformation into Trunchbull - and why she thinks the film is not a children's movie\n                 \n                  International Emmy Awards 2022: British shows including Sex Education and Vigil triumph at ceremony\n                 \n                  The Walk-In: MP Rosie Cooper criticises 'stupid' ITV series dramatising real-life far-right plot to kill her\n                 \"The society as a whole can look at this, parents obviously can look at this, and the government in many ways.\" What is the term incel? Derived from the phrase \"involuntarily celibate\", incel culture in its simplest form someone who deems themselves unable to find a romantic partner despite desiring one. A more radicalised sub-culture of incels has surfaced online in recent years which includes individuals who dislike feminism and believe that women have become too sexually selective. They believe men are the superior sex and men have the right to objectify and criticise women as a result. Influencers like Andrew Tate have been connected to the growing corner of the internet in which young boys are being radicalised from the certain viewpoint. Actor Ashley Walters, who stars alongside Graham in the series, says reading into the existence of the misogynistic group came as a bit of a shock and it worries him about the world children are growing up in. \"I'd seen bits of the Andrew Tate stuff kind of popping up online or whatever, but I never really delved into it. And for me, this was the first real experience. He adds: \"I do sometimes feel sorry for [kids]. When I was growing up, I was in a bubble. I didn't have a clue what was going on in the States and other parts of the world. \"It was just kind of in my little area that I grew up in with my family... I wasn't seeing Bentleys and designer clothes and all of this stuff. It's like I was happy with what I had. And now you're exposed to everything. It's no wonder that kids mentally grow up quicker.\" Read more from Sky News:Who is the real Belle Gibson?Meet the Eurovision hopefuls who sing their trollers' insults The Top Boy actor believes it can be hard for young boys to talk about their emotions. \"It's really important that we have these conversations and we make it normal to have discussions just like women and young girls do about feelings and whatever they're going through. \"That was one of the big reasons why I wanted to be a part of this conversation that we're creating, because I'm a strong advocate for, as a man, being vulnerable, crying in front of my friends, and just saying how I feel. \"It's even difficult for me at times, so I can't imagine how young men are at the moment... everything that's going on around social media in their lives, how difficult it is for them to start this conversation.\" 'This government needs to do something' Co-creator and writer Jack Thorne agrees and says the government should step in and guide children and their parents to the correct use of social media. \"I think this government needs to do something. And there's a private members' bill going through the Commons on Friday that has been watered down quite extensively by this government because they're frightened of big tech. \"And we need to be having conversations like Australia's having conversations, whether they're actually putting in legislation about restricting social media access. \"We need to be having those conversations in this country and we're not. And if we don't have these conversations, it is going to get worse.\" He adds: \"Doing this show I spent a lot of time in a lot of dark places. I saw where the web went and where the web goes. And it's not about Andrew Tate. Andrew Tate is the shorthand for adults. \"There's much worse stuff out there. And it teaches kids a logic... that makes sense of the world for them in a really distorted and ugly way. And unless we look at that and talk about that, things are only going to get worse.\" A government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to keeping young people safe online. \"Starting next week, Ofcom can begin enforcing the Online Safety Act's illegal content duties, targeting the most harmful material. \"By summer, children will be protected from harmful content, and platforms must take steps to ensure age-appropriate experiences online. \"These protections will act as the foundation and our priority is implementing them quickly and effectively. \"We also know there will be more to do and have already acted, including commissioning a study to assess current research on the impact of social media and smartphones, strengthening the evidence base on their impact on children's wellbeing. \"This will enable us to swiftly consider all options to inform our next steps in the safety of children online.\" Adolescence is streaming on Netflix now."

        "Content": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs has pleaded not guilty to a new indictment, accusing him of threatening to punish employees who did not assist in his alleged two-decade sex trafficking scheme. Combs, one of the most successful rappers and hip-hop producers in the US, was also accused of forcing employees to work long hours in what prosecutors described as \"forced labour\", the Manhattan federal court heard on Friday. The three-time Grammy winner has previously pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. His trial begins on 5 May. Several members of his family were present in court as he entered with greying hair, a grey beard, and wearing baggy prison clothes. Read more:What are the allegations against Sean Combs?

Combs has also been accused of organising \"freak offs\" - allegedly inducing women and male sex workers into drug-fuelled sexual performances. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, however, argues that these events were consensual. Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits by women and men who have accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. He has denied all wrongdoing. Combs has been held in a Brooklyn jail awaiting trial since his September 2024 arrest."

        "Content": " Police are hunting for four suspects who used two pythons to distract a cashier before stealing $400 worth of CBD oil from a petrol station. CCTV footage shows the cashier speaking to two of the suspects, a man a woman, after they approached the counter of the Citgo store in Madison County, Tennessee. The man is holding up a curled-up ball python as the woman strokes it. At one stage, the male suspect places the reptile on the counter as the woman appears to talk to someone off-camera. The man then dangles a second ball python over the counter before the video cuts out. Ball pythons are non-venomous constrictor snakes that are native to Africa and grow to a maximum length of around 1.8m. The CCTV footage has been shared online by 731 Crime Stoppers - a non-profit organisation in Tennessee which helps police locate wanted suspects. \n                  Trump trade war: Tesla warns of 'disproportionate' tariff impact \n                 \n                  Does Putin have something on Trump?
