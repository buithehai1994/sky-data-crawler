        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  This is going to be a big budget - not to mention a complex budget. It could, depending on how it lands, determine the fate of this government. And it's hard to think of many other budgets that have been preceded by quite so much speculation, briefing, and rumour. All of which is to say, you could be forgiven for feeling rather overwhelmed. But in practice, what's happening this week can really be boiled down to three things. 1. Not enough growth The first is that the economy is not growing as fast as many people had hoped. Or, to put it another way, Britain's productivity growth is much weaker than it once used to be. The upshot of that is that there's less money flowing into the exchequer in the form of tax revenues. 2. Not enough cuts The second factor is that last year and this, the chancellor promised to make certain cuts to welfare - cuts that would have saved the government billions of pounds of spending a year. But it has failed to implement those cuts. Put those extra billions together with the shortfall from that weaker productivity, and it's pretty clear there is a looming hole in the public finances. 3. Not enough levers The third thing to bear in mind is that Rachel Reeves has pledged to tie her hands in the way she responds to this fiscal hole. She has fiscal rules that mean she can't ignore it. She has a manifesto pledge which means she is somewhat limited in the levers she can pull to fill it. Put it all together, and it adds up to a momentous headache for the chancellor. She needs to raise quite a lot of money and all the \"easy\" ways of doing it (like raising income tax rates or VAT) seem to be off the table.  So… what will she do? Quite how she responds remains to be seen - as does the precise size of the fiscal hole. But if the rumours in Westminster are to be believed, she will fall back upon two tricks most of her predecessors have tried at various points. First, she will deploy \"fiscal drag\" to squeeze extra income tax and national insurance payments out of families for the coming five years. What this means in practice is that even though the headline rate of income tax might not go up, the amount of income we end up being taxed on will grow ever higher in the coming years. Second, the chancellor is expected to squeeze government spending in the distant years for which she doesn't yet need to provide detailed plans. Together, these measures may raise somewhere in the region of £10bn. But Reeves's big problem is that in practice she needs to raise two or three times this amount. So, how will she do that? Most likely is that she implements a grab-bag of other tax measures: more expensive council tax for high value properties; new CGT rules; new gambling taxes and more. No return to austerity, but an Osborne-like predicament… If this summons up a particular memory from history, it's precisely the same problem George Osborne faced back in 2012. He wanted to raise quite a lot of money but due to agreements with his coalition partners, he was limited in how many big taxes he could raise. The resulting budget was, at the time at least, the single most complex budget in history. Consider: in the years between 1970 and 2010 the average UK budget contained 14 tax measures. Osborne's 2012 budget contained a whopping 61 of them. And not long after he delivered it, the budget started to unravel. You probably recall the pasty tax, and maybe the granny tax and the charity tax. Essentially, he was forced into a series of embarrassing U-turns. If there was a lesson, it was that trying to wodge so many money-raising measures into a single fiscal event was an accident waiting to happen.  Except that… here's the interesting thing. In the following years, the complexity of budgets didn't fall - it rose. Osborne broke his own complexity record the next year with the 2013 budget (73 tax measures), and then again in 2016 (86 measures). By 2020 the budget contained a staggering 103 measures. And Reeves's own first budget, last autumn, very nearly broke this record with 94 measures. In short, budgets have become more and more complex, chock-full of even more (often microscopic) tax measures. Read more from Sky News:What tax measures are expected in budget?The political jeopardy facing Rachel Reeves in budget In part, this is a consequence of the fact that, long ago, chancellors seem to have agreed that it would be political suicide to raise the basic rate of income tax or VAT. The consequence is that they have been forced to resort to ever smaller and fiddlier measures to make their numbers add up. The question is whether this pattern continues this week. Do we end up with yet another astoundingly complex budget? Will that slew of measures backfire as they did for Osborne in 2012? And, more to the point, will they actually benefit the UK economy?"

        "Content": " Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to hold talks over the Ukraine peace plan. US and Ukrainian officials have held discussions in Geneva about a controversial 28-point proposal drawn up by America and Russia, which has since been countered by an amended deal drawn up by Kyiv's European allies. The White House said there were still a \"couple of points of disagreement\" as of Monday night, but spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said there was a \"sense of urgency\" to strike an agreement. \"The president wants to see this deal come together, and to see this war end,\" she added. Mr Zelenskyy echoed that message, saying \"there is still work for all of us to do to finalise the document\". \"We must do everything with dignity,\" he said in his nightly video address, adding: \"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump.\" It comes after Mr Trump, who had accused Ukraine of not being grateful enough for US military support while the Geneva talks were under way, suggested the process could be moving in the right direction. He had earlier given Kyiv until Thursday to agree to the plan, but US Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed the deadline, saying officials could keep negotiating. Moscow, however, has already signalled its opposition to the European version of the peace plan. It would halt fighting at present front lines, leaving discussions of territory for later, and also include a NATO-style US security guarantee for Ukraine.

Ms Leavitt has also insisted the US is not favouring the Russians. Starmer to lead talks of Ukraine's allies Ukraine's allies in the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" will hold a virtual meeting today, chaired by Sir Keir Starmer. The British prime minister said the alliance was focused on achieving a \"just and lasting peace\". It \"matters for all of us, because the conflict in Ukraine has had a direct impact here in the UK\", he added. The meeting will get under way hours after Russian drone strikes in Kyiv left triggered fires on residential buildings, forcing evacuations and leaving several people injured. The war was also a topic of discussion in a call between Mr Trump and China's Xi Jinping on Monday. Mr Xi urged \"all parties\" in the conflict to \"reduce differences\", according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. He reiterated that China supported all efforts conducive to peace. China has remained a consistent ally of Russia throughout its invasion of Ukraine, and is the top buyer of Russian oil, along with India."

        "Content": "By Greg Wilford, news editor   Police bodycam footage allegedly shows a Palestine Action activist attacking police with a sledgehammer during a break-in at an Israel-based defence firm's UK site, a court has heard. Prosecutors say six members of the group wearing red boiler suits used a prison van to gain entry to an Elbit Systems UK factory in Bristol during a \"meticulously organised\" attack in the early hours of 6 August last year. Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31, are jointly accused of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder. They deny all charges. Corner denies an additional charge of causing grievous bodily harm. He is accused of striking police sergeant Kate Evans on the back with a sledgehammer at the scene, leaving her with a fracture to her lumbar spine. PS Evans, PC Aaron Buxton and PC Peter Adams gave evidence at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday and jurors were shown police bodycam footage of officers confronting the suspects. Officers saw a security guard covered in foam as they arrived at the factory, where activists had allegedly splattered red paint around and were smashing the company's property with sledgehammers, the jury heard. One clip shows a man, allegedly Corner, swinging a sledgehammer at PC Buxton as he lay on his back amid a struggle with another suspect. \"As he has reached us he has swung the sledgehammer multiple times towards me,\" PC Buxton said. \"I was scared. I believe it made contact with my right calf and my work radio. I had quite considerable pain down that area of my leg following it and also I had some bruising come up.\" PC Buxton told jurors he then saw the man strike PS Evans in the back as she was kneeling down trying to arrest another suspect. Giving evidence, PS Evans said: \"I can remember looking up and PC Adams for some reason had a shocked face on him, and then I had a pain in my back. \"It was just a massive shock vibrating through my whole back, a thud on my back through my whole body extended down to my legs.\" She added: \"I think I was stunned to begin with, I didn't know what it was, I had no idea and I can remember looking round and seeing a male with a sledgehammer behind me.\" PS Evans told jurors she thought her \"spine was shattered\", saying: \"I can remember putting my right foot down and pain shot up.\" When other officers arrived and helped to arrest the suspects, PS Evans went to check on Corner when he complained that his handcuffs were too tight, jurors heard. \"We still have a duty of care to make sure no one is in pain,\" she said. \"They seemed perfectly fine to me.\" PS Evans said that Corner was accusing officers of being \"complicit in genocide\" and said \"something about murdering babies\". \"I said something like 'you have just hit me with a sledgehammer', and he didn't recognise that at all, he just started telling me I'm complicit in genocide again,\" she added. PS Evans said she needed help getting in and out of the shower after the incident and took painkillers to deal with the \"intense pain\". Jurors have heard that PS Evans was unable to work for three months after the incident.

Prosecutors told the jury that the ban is not relevant to the evidence in this case. The trial continues."

Simon Levy has been charged with murdering 53-year-old Carmenza Valencia-Trujillo, from Colombia, who died on the Aylesbury Estate, south-east London, on 17 March, the Metropolitan Police said. A police investigation was launched after a post-mortem examination was unable to determine a cause of death. Levy, of Beaufoy Road, Tottenham, north London, was previously charged in September with murdering 39-year-old Sheryl Wilkins who was found unresponsive in High Road, Tottenham, on 24 August.

        "Content": "By James Matthews, US correspondent  The revenge tour has come off the rails. Donald Trump had long promised retribution against his political enemies, but - to coin a phrase used around the White House - he's f****ed around and found out that it doesn't fly so easily through the courts. His mistake was in choosing a pilot unable to fly the plane. Lindsey Halligan is the lawyer who took the job of Trump-enforcer when others, better qualified, turned it down. The prosecution of Trump's adversaries would have been the job of Erik Siebert, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, but he gave it a body swerve. He had declined to prosecute the case against Letitia James, the New York attorney-general who successfully prosecuted the Trump organisation for business fraud. Siebert concluded there were not sufficient grounds to prosecute, which didn't please the president, and Seibert quit before he was pushed. \n                  Russian drones strike Kyiv as Zelenskyy eyes talks with Trump over 'delicate' peace plan\n                 \n                  Who actually wrote US-Russian peace plan for Ukraine?\n                 \n                  Several airlines cancel Venezuela flights after 'hazardous situation' warning\n                 A number of career prosecutors were similarly reluctant to take the case, leaving Trump checking availability. That's when he turned to Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer by trade. Her work experience didn't necessarily suit the job brief - the prosecutor with the highest of profiles had no prosecutorial experience. In pursuing the cases against Comey and James, she had to present evidence before a grand jury, something she hadn't done before. If that wasn't ideal, that wasn't all. Something else Halligan didn't have was the legal ability to do the job. Her appointment violated laws limiting the ability of the justice department to install top prosecutors. It was an elementary error that didn't pass by Judge Cameron Currie, who called it a \"defective appointment\". In setting aside the indictments against Comey and James, she wrote: \"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment… constitute unlawful exercises of executive power.\" The US Department of Justice can appeal the move, so Comey and James haven't reached road's end. Read more from Sky News:US hails 'tremendous progress' on Ukraine peace planTrump changes tack on Marjorie Taylor Greene But it's a significant boost for both, and a significant blow for Trump. He is the president in pursuit of sworn enemies, which his critics characterise as a weaponisation of the justice system. Those same critics will point to the haste and impropriety on display as evidence of it, and take heart from a system offering a robust resistance. Donald Trump appears undeterred. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed, and this will not be the final word on this matter.\" Letitia James is charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James Comey was charged with making false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation. Trump fired Comey in 2017, while he was overseeing an investigation into alleged Russian interference in the Trump 2016 campaign."

        "Content": "A \"devoted\" elderly couple jumped to their deaths from cliffs near Whitby Abbey as one of them struggled with bone cancer, an inquest heard. David and Susan Jeffcock had sent a letter to their solicitor confirming they intended to end their lives before they were found on rocks at the base of East Cliff, in Whitby, on 30 July. An inquest in Northallerton heard Mr Jeffcock, 80, and Mrs Jeffcock, 74, had moved to the north Yorkshire seaside town after they retired. Mr Jeffcock's nephew, Kevin Shepherd, said his uncle had bone cancer and must have decided to kill himself because he was in pain, with Susan jumping after him. In a statement read at the inquest, Mr Shepherd said: \"I was shocked to hear of their passing, and in such circumstances. \"I can only conclude he was in so much pain he didn't want to keep deteriorating.\" Mr Shepherd said that \"although she was younger, Susan chose to join David\", adding: \"That to me shows their devotion.\" He said Mr Jeffcock was \"a lovely man who lived a good life\", growing up in Sheffield and moving to Australia as a 10-pound Pom, before meeting and marrying \"Susan - the love of his life\" when he returned. Mr Shepherd said the couple decided not to have children and \"lived well together\", travelling the globe on their holidays. He said Mr Jeffcock worked as a taxi driver for several years and Mrs Jeffcock was a secretary at Stanley Tools. The inquest heard the couple spent much of their life together in Sheffield, but dreamed of retiring to a coastal town and ultimately moved to Whitby, one of their favourite spots, in a flat above the harbour. A statement from PC James Turner said that on 30 July a member of the public found a mobile phone and jacket at the top of a cliff, and looked over the edge to see two bodies on the rocks below. Both were pronounced dead at the scene and their bodies were airlifted by the Coastguard helicopter. Read more from Sky News:Jimmy Cliff: Reggae singer and actor diesNew 'national' day to be added to UK's calendar The cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries, the inquest heard. The hearing was told that Mr Jeffcock had been to A&E three times so far that year, including for shortness of breath and acute onset headaches. A police investigation found that Mr Jeffcock's health had worsened, and the couple had sent a letter to their solicitor saying they planned to end their lives. A statement from Detective Inspector Jenkinson of North Yorkshire Police said it was possible Mr Jeffcock jumped first and Mrs Jeffcock \"may have hesitated before following\". He said that a folded jacket had been weighed down with a brick and left at the top of the cliff \"as some sort of marker\", which \"shows preparation prior to the jump\". Senior north Yorkshire coroner Jonathan Leach said the couple had no history of mental health issues, but that Mr Jeffcock suffered from some physical health problems. He recorded a conclusion of suicide for both Mr and Mrs Jeffcock. Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "An Everton footballer was sent off after clashing with his own teammate during their Premier League match against Manchester United. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye was shown a red card after appearing to strike defender Michael Keane in the first half of the Monday night game at Old Trafford. The incident was sparked when Gueye - who misplaced a loose pass towards Keane in the penalty area to give the ball away - began berating his team-mate. Replays showed Gueye lifting his hand to Keane's face, before he was sent off for violent conduct by referee Tony Harrington. Despite going down to 10-men, Everton won the game 1-0 thanks to a goal from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Sky Sports commentator and former Manchester United defender Gary Neville questioned how forceful the \"slap\" really was during his co-commentary. \"There is no doubt a hand comes out to the face but it didn't look too much,\" he said. \"They might have had to send him off purely because there is a strike to the face.\" \"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red.\" Speaking on Monday Night Football, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said: \"I just think: Can a referee manage the situation a bit better? \"Can you get the two of them together and say: 'Hey can you behave yourselves?' Just sort of manage the situation rather than, that's the rulebook.\" Under Premier League rules, hitting an opponent or any other person in the head or face with a hand or arm is considered violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible. \"Was it negligible?\" asked Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\" After the game, Everton boss David Moyes said he believed the referee \"could have taken a bit longer to think about it\". \"I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action,\" he added. \"If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it. \"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\" Gueye is the first Premier League player to be sent off for striking a team-mate since Ricardo Fuller’s dismissal for Stoke City against West Ham in 2008. It is only the third time in Premier League history a player has been sent off for striking a team-mate, following the notorious 2005 double sending-off involving Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  This is going to be a big budget - not to mention a complex budget. It could, depending on how it lands, determine the fate of this government. And it's hard to think of many other budgets that have been preceded by quite so much speculation, briefing, and rumour. All of which is to say, you could be forgiven for feeling rather overwhelmed. But in practice, what's happening this week can really be boiled down to three things. 1. Not enough growth The first is that the economy is not growing as fast as many people had hoped. Or, to put it another way, Britain's productivity growth is much weaker than it once used to be. The upshot of that is that there's less money flowing into the exchequer in the form of tax revenues. 2. Not enough cuts The second factor is that last year and this, the chancellor promised to make certain cuts to welfare - cuts that would have saved the government billions of pounds of spending a year. But it has failed to implement those cuts. Put those extra billions together with the shortfall from that weaker productivity, and it's pretty clear there is a looming hole in the public finances. 3. Not enough levers The third thing to bear in mind is that Rachel Reeves has pledged to tie her hands in the way she responds to this fiscal hole. She has fiscal rules that mean she can't ignore it. She has a manifesto pledge which means she is somewhat limited in the levers she can pull to fill it. Put it all together, and it adds up to a momentous headache for the chancellor. She needs to raise quite a lot of money and all the \"easy\" ways of doing it (like raising income tax rates or VAT) seem to be off the table.  So… what will she do? Quite how she responds remains to be seen - as does the precise size of the fiscal hole. But if the rumours in Westminster are to be believed, she will fall back upon two tricks most of her predecessors have tried at various points. First, she will deploy \"fiscal drag\" to squeeze extra income tax and national insurance payments out of families for the coming five years. What this means in practice is that even though the headline rate of income tax might not go up, the amount of income we end up being taxed on will grow ever higher in the coming years. Second, the chancellor is expected to squeeze government spending in the distant years for which she doesn't yet need to provide detailed plans. Together, these measures may raise somewhere in the region of £10bn. But Reeves's big problem is that in practice she needs to raise two or three times this amount. So, how will she do that? Most likely is that she implements a grab-bag of other tax measures: more expensive council tax for high value properties; new CGT rules; new gambling taxes and more. No return to austerity, but an Osborne-like predicament… If this summons up a particular memory from history, it's precisely the same problem George Osborne faced back in 2012. He wanted to raise quite a lot of money but due to agreements with his coalition partners, he was limited in how many big taxes he could raise. The resulting budget was, at the time at least, the single most complex budget in history. Consider: in the years between 1970 and 2010 the average UK budget contained 14 tax measures. Osborne's 2012 budget contained a whopping 61 of them. And not long after he delivered it, the budget started to unravel. You probably recall the pasty tax, and maybe the granny tax and the charity tax. Essentially, he was forced into a series of embarrassing U-turns. If there was a lesson, it was that trying to wodge so many money-raising measures into a single fiscal event was an accident waiting to happen.  Except that… here's the interesting thing. In the following years, the complexity of budgets didn't fall - it rose. Osborne broke his own complexity record the next year with the 2013 budget (73 tax measures), and then again in 2016 (86 measures). By 2020 the budget contained a staggering 103 measures. And Reeves's own first budget, last autumn, very nearly broke this record with 94 measures. In short, budgets have become more and more complex, chock-full of even more (often microscopic) tax measures. Read more from Sky News:What tax measures are expected in budget?The political jeopardy facing Rachel Reeves in budget In part, this is a consequence of the fact that, long ago, chancellors seem to have agreed that it would be political suicide to raise the basic rate of income tax or VAT. The consequence is that they have been forced to resort to ever smaller and fiddlier measures to make their numbers add up. The question is whether this pattern continues this week. Do we end up with yet another astoundingly complex budget? Will that slew of measures backfire as they did for Osborne in 2012? And, more to the point, will they actually benefit the UK economy?"

        "Content": "By Greg Wilford, news editor   Police bodycam footage allegedly shows a Palestine Action activist attacking police with a sledgehammer during a break-in at an Israel-based defence firm's UK site, a court has heard. Prosecutors say six members of the group wearing red boiler suits used a prison van to gain entry to an Elbit Systems UK factory in Bristol during a \"meticulously organised\" attack in the early hours of 6 August last year. Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31, are jointly accused of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder. They deny all charges. Corner denies an additional charge of causing grievous bodily harm. He is accused of striking police sergeant Kate Evans on the back with a sledgehammer at the scene, leaving her with a fracture to her lumbar spine. PS Evans, PC Aaron Buxton and PC Peter Adams gave evidence at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday and jurors were shown police bodycam footage of officers confronting the suspects. Officers saw a security guard covered in foam as they arrived at the factory, where activists had allegedly splattered red paint around and were smashing the company's property with sledgehammers, the jury heard. One clip shows a man, allegedly Corner, swinging a sledgehammer at PC Buxton as he lay on his back amid a struggle with another suspect. \"As he has reached us he has swung the sledgehammer multiple times towards me,\" PC Buxton said. \"I was scared. I believe it made contact with my right calf and my work radio. I had quite considerable pain down that area of my leg following it and also I had some bruising come up.\" PC Buxton told jurors he then saw the man strike PS Evans in the back as she was kneeling down trying to arrest another suspect. Giving evidence, PS Evans said: \"I can remember looking up and PC Adams for some reason had a shocked face on him, and then I had a pain in my back. \"It was just a massive shock vibrating through my whole back, a thud on my back through my whole body extended down to my legs.\" She added: \"I think I was stunned to begin with, I didn't know what it was, I had no idea and I can remember looking round and seeing a male with a sledgehammer behind me.\" PS Evans told jurors she thought her \"spine was shattered\", saying: \"I can remember putting my right foot down and pain shot up.\" When other officers arrived and helped to arrest the suspects, PS Evans went to check on Corner when he complained that his handcuffs were too tight, jurors heard. \"We still have a duty of care to make sure no one is in pain,\" she said. \"They seemed perfectly fine to me.\" PS Evans said that Corner was accusing officers of being \"complicit in genocide\" and said \"something about murdering babies\". \"I said something like 'you have just hit me with a sledgehammer', and he didn't recognise that at all, he just started telling me I'm complicit in genocide again,\" she added. PS Evans said she needed help getting in and out of the shower after the incident and took painkillers to deal with the \"intense pain\". Jurors have heard that PS Evans was unable to work for three months after the incident.

Prosecutors told the jury that the ban is not relevant to the evidence in this case. The trial continues."

        "Content": " Reports of a \"board-level orchestrated coup\" at the BBC are \"complete nonsense\", non-executive director Sir Robbie Gibb has told MPs. Sir Robbie, whose position on the BBC board has been challenged by critics in recent weeks, was among senior leaders, including the broadcaster's chair, Samir Shah, to face questions from the Culture, Media and Sport committee about the current crisis. The hearing took place in the wake of the fallout over the edit of a speech by US President Donald Trump, which prompted the resignation of the corporation's director-general and the chief executive of BBC News, and the threat of a lawsuit from the US president. Former editorial adviser Michael Prescott, whose leaked memo sparked the recent chain of events, also answered questions from MPs - telling the hearing he felt he kept seeing \"incipient problems\" that were not being tackled. He also said Mr Trump's reputation had \"probably not\" been tarnished by the Panorama edit. During his own questioning, Sir Robbie addressed concerns of potential political bias - he left BBC News in 2017 to become then prime minister Theresa May's director of communications, a post he held until 2019, and was appointed to the BBC board in 2021 by Boris Johnson. \"I know it's hard to marry the fact that I spent two years as director of communications for the government... and my genuine passion for impartiality,\" he said. \"I want to hear the full range of views... I don't want the BBC to be partisan or favour any particular way.\" Asked about reports and speculation that there has been a \"board-level orchestrated coup\", Sir Robbie responded: \"It's up there as one of the most ridiculous charges... People had to find some angle. \"It's complete nonsense. It's also deeply offensive to fellow board members... people of great standing in different fields.\" He said his political work has been \"weaponised\" - and that it was hard as a non-executive member of the BBC to respond to criticism. 'We should have made the decision earlier' Mr Shah admitted the BBC was too slow in responding to the issue of the Panorama edit of Mr Trump, which had been flagged long before the leaked memo. \"Looking back, I think we should have made the decision earlier,\" he said. \"I think in May, as it happens. \"I think there is an issue about how quickly we respond, the speed of our response. Why do we not do it quickly enough? Why do we take so much time? And this was another illustration of that.\" Following reports of the leaked memo, it took nearly a week for the BBC to issue an apology. Mr Shah told the committee he did not think Mr Davie needed to resign over the issue and that he \"spent a great deal of time\" trying to stop him from doing so. Is director-general role too big for one person? Asked about his own position, Mr Shah said his job now is to \"steady the ship\", and that he is not someone \"who walks away from a problem\". A job advert for the BBC director-general role has since gone live on the corporation's careers website. Mr Shah told the hearing his view is that the role is \"too big\" for one person and that he is \"inclined\" to restructure roles at the top. He says he believes there should also be a deputy director-general who is \"laser-focused on journalism\", which is \"the most important thing and our greatest vulnerability\". Earlier in the hearing, Mr Prescott gave evidence alongside another former BBC editorial adviser, Caroline Daniel. He told the CMS committee that there are \"issues of denial\" at the BBC and said \"the management did not accept there was a problem\" with the Panorama episode. Mr Prescott's memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump's speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\". 'I can't think of anything I agree with Trump on' Mr Trump has said he is going to pursue a lawsuit of between $1bn and $5bn against the broadcaster, despite receiving an official public apology. Asked if the documentary had harmed Mr Trump's image, Mr Prescott responded: \"I should probably restrain myself a little bit, given that there is a potential legal action. \"All I could say is, I can't think of anything I agree with Donald Trump on.\" He was later pushed on the subject, and asked again if he agreed that the programme tarnished the president's reputation, to which he then replied: \"Probably not.\" Read more:Experts on why Trump might struggle to win lawsuitWhy are people calling for Sir Robbie Gibb to go? Mr Prescott, a former journalist, also told the committee he did not know how his memo was leaked to the Daily Telegraph. \"At the most fundamental level, I wrote that memo, let me be clear, because I am a strong supporter of the BBC. \"The BBC employs talented professionals across all of its factual and non-factual programmes, and most people in this country, certainly myself included, might go as far as to say that they love the BBC. He said he \"never envisaged\" the fallout that would occur. \"I was hoping the concerns I had could, and would, be addressed privately in the first instance.\" Asked if he thinks the BBC is institutionally biased, he said: \"No, I don't.\" He said that \"tonnes\" of the BBC's work is \"world class\" - but added that there is \"real work that needs to be done\" to deal with problems. Mr Davie, he said, did a \"first-rate job\" as director-general but had a \"blind spot\" toward editorial failings."

        "Content": " A survivor of a snowstorm in Chile, which left a British woman and four other tourists dead, has described the desperate attempts to save his fellow hikers. Christian Aldridge told UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee of his \"devastation\" at losing friend Victoria Bond, 40, in the incident. Telling of the desperate scenes, he described how a volunteer rescue party used a homemade stretcher to recover one of the missing hikers. Five bodies were recovered on Tuesday after a powerful snowstorm hit the Patagonia region inside Torres del Paine National Park. Mr Aldridge, 41, from Newquay in Cornwall, was with Ms Bond and three other British friends hoping to complete the O Circuit hiking trail. They were part of a larger group of around 30 as they trekked through the famous John Gardner pass when they fell into danger. The area was struck by winds in excess of 120mph, and the group attempted to make their way back to the Los Perros camp, which they had left that morning. \n                  All workers trapped in Chilean mine found dead, officials say\n                 \n                  Chile issues tsunami warning after 7.4-magnitude earthquake\n                 \n                  Kayaker survives being swallowed by humpback whale in Chile\n                 During the storm, equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane, Mr Aldridge became separated from Ms Bond, but he later managed to find some of the rest of the group. At base camp, they realised that some members were missing and decided to organise their own search party. Mr Aldridge, a TV director and producer, said the volunteer rescue party that took part in the search, which included two of their group, Tom and Matt, found three bodies. Mr Aldridge told Sky News: \"We're relieved to be alive, of course, but devastated because we've lost one of our best friends and one of the most amazing people I've met. \"And we're all carrying around with us a huge amount of grief, shock and guilt. We keep replaying everything that happened that day and asking, what could we have done differently? And it's overwhelming and it still doesn't feel real.\" Mr Aldridge added: \"They recovered one of [the hikers] and she was still alive at the time and brought her down on a homemade stretcher that the rest of us in the camp made from sleeping mats, polystyrene and walking poles. \"There were fortunately medics in these volunteer groups, but unfortunately she went into hypothermic cardiac arrest. She was shot twice and they worked on her for an hour, but she didn't make it through.\" The other members of the group of British friends who had hoped to complete the O Circuit were Hayley Newnham, 41, a PR agency owner, sports coach developer Matt Smith, 39, and Tom Player, 39, a composer from London, according to reports.

        "Content": "An Everton footballer was sent off after clashing with his own teammate during their Premier League match against Manchester United. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye was shown a red card after appearing to strike defender Michael Keane in the first half of the Monday night game at Old Trafford. The incident was sparked when Gueye - who misplaced a loose pass towards Keane in the penalty area to give the ball away - began berating his team-mate. Replays showed Gueye lifting his hand to Keane's face, before he was sent off for violent conduct by referee Tony Harrington. Despite going down to 10-men, Everton won the game 1-0 thanks to a goal from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Sky Sports commentator and former Manchester United defender Gary Neville questioned how forceful the \"slap\" really was during his co-commentary. \"There is no doubt a hand comes out to the face but it didn't look too much,\" he said. \"They might have had to send him off purely because there is a strike to the face.\" \"They were not fighting, it wasn't a scrap. It could have been dealt with by a yellow. I don't think it needed to be a red.\" Speaking on Monday Night Football, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said: \"I just think: Can a referee manage the situation a bit better? \"Can you get the two of them together and say: 'Hey can you behave yourselves?' Just sort of manage the situation rather than, that's the rulebook.\" Under Premier League rules, hitting an opponent or any other person in the head or face with a hand or arm is considered violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible. \"Was it negligible?\" asked Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\" After the game, Everton boss David Moyes said he believed the referee \"could have taken a bit longer to think about it\". \"I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action,\" he added. \"If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it. \"I'm disappointed we get the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our team-mates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\" Gueye is the first Premier League player to be sent off for striking a team-mate since Ricardo Fuller’s dismissal for Stoke City against West Ham in 2008. It is only the third time in Premier League history a player has been sent off for striking a team-mate, following the notorious 2005 double sending-off involving Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer.

The midfielder was also fined £30,000 and joined West Ham the following summer."

Officers in Nottingham have issued an appeal and released footage of the pickpocket, who they believe pretended to be drunk to fool his victim into thinking he was harmless. A brief video clip issued by Nottinghamshire Police on Monday shows the man approach a victim in Clumber Street, in Nottingham city centre, shortly after 7.30am on 16 November. The force said in a statement describing the incident: \"After greeting the man with a fist bump and engaging him in conversation, he performs a bizarre dance where he places one of his legs between the victim's leg and jumps up and down.\" Officers were able to use CCTV to track the offender's prior movement to a McDonald's. Police said the suspect did not appear to be intoxicated in CCTV footage from the McDonald's restaurant, recorded just minutes before the theft took place. They added that this indicated that \"he pretended to be intoxicated as part of a ploy to trick the victim into thinking he posed no threat and was being jovial\". \n                  Budget 2025: Rachel Reeves calls for Labour MPs to unite - but admits they might not like everything\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: Three things Rachel Reeves's speech boils down to - and two tricks the chancellor will fall back on\n                 \n                  Boy, 16, in life-threatening condition after shooting\n                 A clear image of the person responsible for this distraction theft has now been released, and police are urging people to contact them if they know who he is.

Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul. His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.\" UB40 star Ali Campbell, who covered Cliff's song Many Rivers To Cross in 1983, also paid tribute, saying he was \"absolutely heartbroken to hear about the passing of a Reggae forefather\" in a post on X. Campbell also called Cliff \"a pillar of our music, and one of the first to carry reggae out into the world\". A legend of music and screen A two-time Grammy-winning artist, Cliff was awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 2003, the highest honour in the arts and sciences, from the Jamaican government. Over the years, he would work with stars including the Rolling Stones, Sting, Elvis Costello, Annie Lennox, Paul Simon and Wyclef Jean. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. A prolific writer, frequently expressing his humanitarian views through his work, his 1969 track Vietnam was reportedly described by Bob Dylan as \"the best protest song\" he had ever heard. Cliff was also well known for cover versions of songs, including Johnny Nash's I Can See Clearly Now, which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1993 movie Cool Runnings, and Cat Stevens' Wild World. He twice performed on high-profile US chat show Saturday Night Live. An actor and a musician, as well as singing the title track of 1972 cult classic The Harder They Come, Cliff also starred in it. One of the first major commercial releases to come out of Jamaica, the movie is credited with bringing reggae to the world, as well as showing a grittier and more realistic side to the country. During this time, Cliff's fame rivalled Bob Marley as the reggae's most prominent artist. The storyline, which revolved around Cliff's character, Ivan, moving to Kingston, Jamaica, to make it as a musical superstar, had parallels with his own. 'Hurricane Hattie' He was born James Chambers, during a hurricane, on 30 July 1944, in St James Parish, northwestern Jamaica. In the 1950s, he moved with his father from the family farm to Kingston, determined to succeed in the music industry. He began writing as Jamaica was gaining its independence from Britain, and as the early sounds of reggae - first called ska - were being developed. At just 14, he became nationally famous for the song Hurricane Hattie, which he had written himself. Cliff would go on to record over 30 albums and perform all over the world, including in Paris, in Brazil and at the World's Fair, an international exhibition held in New York in 1964. The following year, Island Records' Chris Blackwell, the producer who launched Bob Marley And The Wailers, invited Cliff to work in the UK. 'I still have many rivers to cross!' Speaking about his burning passion for life during a 2019 interview, when the star had begun losing his sight, Cliff said: \"When I've achieved all my ambitions, then I guess that I will have done it and I can just say 'great'. \"But I'm still hungry. I want it. I've still got the burning fire that burns brightly inside of me - like I just said to you. I still have many rivers to cross!\" Cliff's last studio album, Refugees, made with Wyclef Jean, was released in 2022, and the singer said he wrote the title track \"due to emotional feelings towards freedom taken away from human beings\"."

Ms Hanson wore the garment shortly after she was denied permission to introduce a bill that would outlaw burkas and other full-face coverings in public places in Australia. The One Nation party leader said her actions were in protest at the Senate rejecting her proposed bill. \"So if the parliament won't ban it, I will display this oppressive, radical, non-religious head garb that risk our national security and the ill treatment of women on the floor of our parliament so that every Australian knows what's at stake,\" she added on social media.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  The Paralympics leadership is in dispute with the UK government over Russia's reinstatement to the Games, telling Sky News they will not ban countries from competing for launching wars. The UK was among 33 mainly European countries to sign a joint statement expressing \"serious concern\" that the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) members voted to lift the partial suspensions of Russia and Ukraine war ally Belarus. The decision has never been previously explained, but IPC president Andrew Parsons now tells us it \"is not linked to participation in wars\". \"Russia and Belarus, they used Paralympic sport to promote what they called the \"special operation\" at the time,\" he said in an interview. \"And this is what led to the first suspension, the suspension in 2023. Between 2023 and now... there is less evidence of that being used again for the promotion of the war.\" That was based on evidence provided to IPC members before the vote by a company specialising in online monitoring. There is also a sense for Mr Parsons that imposing sporting sanctions over the war in Ukraine is largely a European concern, with the rest of the world more likely to highlight the need to avoid an inconsistent approach. \n                  Paralympic bosses prepare ground for potential ban on transgender women competing in women's sports\n                 \n                  UK Athletics and former sports boss plead not guilty to manslaughter over death of athlete Abdullah Hayayei\n                 \n                  Paralympians arrive back in UK amid calls for more school support for disabled athletes\n                 Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea were the only non-European nations to sign up to the joint statements from governments about lifting the ban. Mr Parsons said: \"What came really strong was, why only Russia and Belarus? There are all the conflicts around the world and they have not been suspended.\" But a country launching a war is not a breach of the IPC constitution, he explained, despite the UK and other governments believing that was the case. Athletes from Russia and Belarus were banned from competing at the Beijing Paralympics shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022 amid threats of a boycott. The confusion could centre on this statement from March 2022 referencing the countries \"breaching the Olympic Truce\" without being clear if that was the reason for the ban. Russia and Belarus were then partially suspended as IPC members in 2023 through a general assembly vote for \"breaches of its constitutional membership obligations\" without mentioning the war in Ukraine. The countries were then reinstated following a fresh vote in September. But there will be no Russian or Belarusian teams at the Winter Paralympics next year in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, largely due to ongoing bans by sports federations. That led to the critical governments saying in their recent joint statement: \"We view this development with serious concern, given that the Russian aggression against Ukraine continues and the Russian and Belarusian breaches of the Olympic Charter remain.\" Read more from Sky News:Why Westerners are applying to live in RussiaUkrainian sumo wrestler makes history in Japan Speaking in his first interview since then, Mr Parsons said: \"I understand they are not demanding anything in that statement, only they want to know the consequences of that decision leading up to LA (2028 Paralympics), which is understandable. \"And we will respond to them with information that they want.\""

        "Content": "An 18th century Spanish galleon dubbed the \"holy grail of shipwrecks\" for its storied cache of 11 million gold and silver coins - worth an estimated $20bn (£16bn) - has yielded its first treasures. The San José, a 64-gun galleon of the Spanish Navy, was sunk by the British in 1708 when her powder magazines exploded near Cartagena, Colombia. Now a Colombian mission to salvage the wreck has retrieved its first artifacts; a cannon, three coins, and some porcelain. The recovery forms part of an expedition to the wreck, approved by Bogotá last year, following the rediscovery of the ship in 2015. The San José lies 600m (almost 2,000ft) below the Caribbean Sea, but its exact location is a state secret, and ownership of the treasure is hotly contested. It has been the subject of a legal battle in the United States, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure. Sea Search Armada, a group of American investors, claims to have discovered the ship in 1982, and demands $10bn for its part - estimating this to be about 50% of the treasure's worth. Colombia's government, meanwhile, says the purpose of its deep-sea mission is research and not treasure, and that the artifacts will be preserved and studied. The coins, known as macuquinas, have been taken to the National Museum of Colombia, while the other finds are being studied and preserved at the Caribbean Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research Center. The Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said subjecting the artifacts to laboratory analysis could shed new light on the ship's history.

The Colombian government is also investigating the cause of the ship's sinking, and has suggested it could have sunk for reasons other than an explosion, including damage to the hull. Bogotá says its research project comprises a number of phases, the first of which was a non-intrusive study of the wreck's archaeological context and debris field.  The newly recovered items were brought up as part of the second phase: collecting artifacts and adapting them for preservation in a non-marine environment."

US and Ukrainian officials have held discussions in Geneva about a controversial 28-point proposal drawn up by America and Russia, which has since been countered by an amended deal drawn up by Kyiv's European allies. The White House said there were still a \"couple of points of disagreement\" as of Monday night, but spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said there was a \"sense of urgency\" to strike an agreement. \"The president wants to see this deal come together, and to see this war end,\" she added. Mr Zelenskyy echoed that message, saying \"there is still work for all of us to do to finalise the document\". \"We must do everything with dignity,\" he said in his nightly video address, adding: \"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump.\" It comes after Mr Trump, who had accused Ukraine of not being grateful enough for US military support while the Geneva talks were under way, suggested the process could be moving in the right direction. He had earlier given Kyiv until Thursday to agree to the plan, but US Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed the deadline, saying officials could keep negotiating. Moscow, however, has already signalled its opposition to the European version of the peace plan. It would halt fighting at present front lines, leaving discussions of territory for later, and also include a NATO-style US security guarantee for Ukraine.

Ms Leavitt has also insisted the US is not favouring the Russians.

The British prime minister said the alliance was focused on achieving a \"just and lasting peace\". It \"matters for all of us, because the conflict in Ukraine has had a direct impact here in the UK\", he added. The meeting will get under way hours after Russian drone strikes in Kyiv left triggered fires on residential buildings, forcing evacuations and leaving several people injured. The war was also a topic of discussion in a call between Mr Trump and China's Xi Jinping on Monday. Mr Xi urged \"all parties\" in the conflict to \"reduce differences\", according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. He reiterated that China supported all efforts conducive to peace. China has remained a consistent ally of Russia throughout its invasion of Ukraine, and is the top buyer of Russian oil, along with India."

        "Content": "By James Matthews, US correspondent  The revenge tour has come off the rails. Donald Trump had long promised retribution against his political enemies, but - to coin a phrase used around the White House - he's f****ed around and found out that it doesn't fly so easily through the courts. His mistake was in choosing a pilot unable to fly the plane. Lindsey Halligan is the lawyer who took the job of Trump-enforcer when others, better qualified, turned it down. The prosecution of Trump's adversaries would have been the job of Erik Siebert, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, but he gave it a body swerve. He had declined to prosecute the case against Letitia James, the New York attorney-general who successfully prosecuted the Trump organisation for business fraud. Siebert concluded there were not sufficient grounds to prosecute, which didn't please the president, and Seibert quit before he was pushed. \n                  Russian drones strike Kyiv as Zelenskyy eyes talks with Trump over 'delicate' peace plan\n                 \n                  Who actually wrote US-Russian peace plan for Ukraine?\n                 \n                  Several airlines cancel Venezuela flights after 'hazardous situation' warning\n                 A number of career prosecutors were similarly reluctant to take the case, leaving Trump checking availability. That's when he turned to Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer by trade. Her work experience didn't necessarily suit the job brief - the prosecutor with the highest of profiles had no prosecutorial experience. In pursuing the cases against Comey and James, she had to present evidence before a grand jury, something she hadn't done before. If that wasn't ideal, that wasn't all. Something else Halligan didn't have was the legal ability to do the job. Her appointment violated laws limiting the ability of the justice department to install top prosecutors. It was an elementary error that didn't pass by Judge Cameron Currie, who called it a \"defective appointment\". In setting aside the indictments against Comey and James, she wrote: \"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment… constitute unlawful exercises of executive power.\" The US Department of Justice can appeal the move, so Comey and James haven't reached road's end. Read more from Sky News:US hails 'tremendous progress' on Ukraine peace planTrump changes tack on Marjorie Taylor Greene But it's a significant boost for both, and a significant blow for Trump. He is the president in pursuit of sworn enemies, which his critics characterise as a weaponisation of the justice system. Those same critics will point to the haste and impropriety on display as evidence of it, and take heart from a system offering a robust resistance. Donald Trump appears undeterred. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed, and this will not be the final word on this matter.\" Letitia James is charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James Comey was charged with making false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation. Trump fired Comey in 2017, while he was overseeing an investigation into alleged Russian interference in the Trump 2016 campaign."

The Madison Police Department said on Sunday night she had been taken into custody in the state of Illinois. Now an adult, she was sentenced to 40 years in a psychiatric hospital after carrying out the nearly fatal attack in 2014. Police in Madison, Wisconsin, had said earlier on Sunday that she was at large and her whereabouts were unknown. \"If you see Geyser, please call 911,\" the force said. She was last seen around 8pm local time on Saturday with an adult acquaintance. Geyser had been moved to a group home this year after being granted conditional release from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. Her lawyer Tony Cotton said he did not know what had happened and urged Geyser to turn herself in. \"It's in her best interest for her to turn herself in immediately and not continue with this course of action,\" he said in an Instagram video post. \"We don't know any of the facts about what happened or who might have assisted her.\" Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier, were 12 years old when they lured a classmate to a suburban Milwaukee park after a sleepover, authorities said. Geyser stabbed their victim more than a dozen times as Weier egged her on. The victim barely survived the ordeal. The girls told investigators they had carried out the attack in order to please Slender Man, an online horror character. They said they wanted to earn the right to be Slender Man's servants and they feared he'd harm their families if they didn't follow through.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  This is going to be a big budget - not to mention a complex budget. It could, depending on how it lands, determine the fate of this government. And it's hard to think of many other budgets that have been preceded by quite so much speculation, briefing, and rumour. All of which is to say, you could be forgiven for feeling rather overwhelmed. But in practice, what's happening this week can really be boiled down to three things. 1. Not enough growth The first is that the economy is not growing as fast as many people had hoped. Or, to put it another way, Britain's productivity growth is much weaker than it once used to be. The upshot of that is that there's less money flowing into the exchequer in the form of tax revenues. 2. Not enough cuts The second factor is that last year and this, the chancellor promised to make certain cuts to welfare - cuts that would have saved the government billions of pounds of spending a year. But it has failed to implement those cuts. Put those extra billions together with the shortfall from that weaker productivity, and it's pretty clear there is a looming hole in the public finances. 3. Not enough levers The third thing to bear in mind is that Rachel Reeves has pledged to tie her hands in the way she responds to this fiscal hole. She has fiscal rules that mean she can't ignore it. She has a manifesto pledge which means she is somewhat limited in the levers she can pull to fill it. Put it all together, and it adds up to a momentous headache for the chancellor. She needs to raise quite a lot of money and all the \"easy\" ways of doing it (like raising income tax rates or VAT) seem to be off the table.  So… what will she do? Quite how she responds remains to be seen - as does the precise size of the fiscal hole. But if the rumours in Westminster are to be believed, she will fall back upon two tricks most of her predecessors have tried at various points. First, she will deploy \"fiscal drag\" to squeeze extra income tax and national insurance payments out of families for the coming five years. What this means in practice is that even though the headline rate of income tax might not go up, the amount of income we end up being taxed on will grow ever higher in the coming years. Second, the chancellor is expected to squeeze government spending in the distant years for which she doesn't yet need to provide detailed plans. Together, these measures may raise somewhere in the region of £10bn. But Reeves's big problem is that in practice she needs to raise two or three times this amount. So, how will she do that? Most likely is that she implements a grab-bag of other tax measures: more expensive council tax for high value properties; new CGT rules; new gambling taxes and more. No return to austerity, but an Osborne-like predicament… If this summons up a particular memory from history, it's precisely the same problem George Osborne faced back in 2012. He wanted to raise quite a lot of money but due to agreements with his coalition partners, he was limited in how many big taxes he could raise. The resulting budget was, at the time at least, the single most complex budget in history. Consider: in the years between 1970 and 2010 the average UK budget contained 14 tax measures. Osborne's 2012 budget contained a whopping 61 of them. And not long after he delivered it, the budget started to unravel. You probably recall the pasty tax, and maybe the granny tax and the charity tax. Essentially, he was forced into a series of embarrassing U-turns. If there was a lesson, it was that trying to wodge so many money-raising measures into a single fiscal event was an accident waiting to happen.  Except that… here's the interesting thing. In the following years, the complexity of budgets didn't fall - it rose. Osborne broke his own complexity record the next year with the 2013 budget (73 tax measures), and then again in 2016 (86 measures). By 2020 the budget contained a staggering 103 measures. And Reeves's own first budget, last autumn, very nearly broke this record with 94 measures. In short, budgets have become more and more complex, chock-full of even more (often microscopic) tax measures. Read more from Sky News:What tax measures are expected in budget?The political jeopardy facing Rachel Reeves in budget In part, this is a consequence of the fact that, long ago, chancellors seem to have agreed that it would be political suicide to raise the basic rate of income tax or VAT. The consequence is that they have been forced to resort to ever smaller and fiddlier measures to make their numbers add up. The question is whether this pattern continues this week. Do we end up with yet another astoundingly complex budget? Will that slew of measures backfire as they did for Osborne in 2012? And, more to the point, will they actually benefit the UK economy?"

It is one of the first events in the historic West Yorkshire town for the monthly cheese club and there is a decent turn-out. Discussion of Wednesday's budget is not as popular as an accompaniment to the cheese as the selection of wines. But no one holds back on what is required of the chancellor. Natalie Rogers, who runs her own small business with her partner, said there needs to be focus. \"I think investing in small businesses, investing in these northern towns, where at one time we were making all the money for the country, can we not get back to that? We're not investing in local industries.\" At the next table, with a group of friends, Ali Fletcher said there needs to be bigger targets. \"I think wealth inequality is a major problem. The divide is getting wider. For me, a wealth tax is absolutely critical. We need to address this question of 'Is there any money left?'.

This corner of Halifax, close to the town's historic Piece Hall, is buzzing with clubs, bars and restaurants, trying hard to defy the crunch in the night-time economy. It is a useful measure of how the landscapes of our town and cities has changed. \"Whenever there's a budget, for a few days afterwards, there's a drop off in trade,\" said Michael Ainsworth, owner of the Graystone Unity, a bar and music venue in the town. \"I accept the government needs to raise money but, in this day and age, there's better ways to go about doing that, like closing tax loopholes for the huge businesses to operate up with banking arrangements outside the UK.\" In the bar, a folk singer is going through a quirky and caustic set. In the basement, a punk band called Edward Molby is considerably louder. On a sofa in the main bar, recent graduates Josh Kinsella and Ruby Firth, newly arrived in Halifax because of its more affordable housing, pinpoint what they want on Wednesday. \"Can we stop triple-locking the pensions, please? Stop giving pensioners everything. For God's sake, I know they have hard times in the 70s and the 80s, but it just feels like we're now paying for everyone else.\" Ben Randm is a familiar face at the bar and well known on the music scene with his band, Silver Tongued Rascals. \"Everyday people are seen as statistics, we're always the afterthought. When the cuts are done, we're always impeded and the ramifications that has for people's livelihoods, for people's mental health, for people's passion and drive... it's such a struggle.\" He, like many in the night-time economy sector, wants extra help for hospitality and venues that, he says, provide a vital community link. David Van Gestel chose Halifax to open the third branch of MAMIL, a bar in jokey honour of those cycling \"middle-aged men in Lycra\". On a busy quiz night, he said venues had to provide something different to get people out of their homes. \"I think the government needs to start putting some initiatives in place.

The company had been testing whether a key ingredient in the drugs could slow progression of the brain disorder. Novo Nordisk, which began the trials two years ago, had always treated the study as an outside bet but one which had the potential to land big rewards, if successful, as earnings from its core diabetes/weight loss space come under pressure from intense competition.

Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: \"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success. \n                  Budget 2025: Rachel Reeves calls for Labour MPs to unite - but admits they might not like everything\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: Three things Rachel Reeves's speech boils down to - and two tricks the chancellor will fall back on\n                 \n                  UK visitors will need advance permission to travel under new rules | Money blog\n                 \"While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,\" he said.

Novo's shares settled around 9% down on the day, building on losses over the year to date that have now extended beyond 55%. The share price reaction would suggest that some investors had factored in a measure of success from Novo's trials. Some market analysts expressed horror over the scale of Monday's share price decline. Sydbank's Soren Lontoft said of the trial's end: \"Based on the history of Alzheimer's treatment, this doesn't come as a big surprise to me. \"The share's reaction is probably more due to the bad sentiment around the Novo Nordisk share and the negative news flow over the past year - perhaps there was hope for a little tailwind from this study.\""

Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week, we chat to relationship coach Lorin Krenn...  The sky truly is the limit with salary... but the income range in relationship coaching varies enormously. Many beginners earn very little in their first years because they are stumbling their way into a field they know little about. Once a coach develops real skill, delivers consistent results and builds a stable client base, it is realistic to earn between £40,000 and £60,000 a year. Coaches who specialise, gain a reputation for depth and offer structured programmes often reach the £70,000-£100,000 range. At the high end, where a coach becomes a recognised authority with a global audience and offers advanced programmes, retreats and intensives, earnings can rise into multiple six figures and even seven figures. Read the latest consumer news here In high-end private coaching, sessions can reach several thousand pounds... especially within intensives. Clients are not paying for the coach's time. They are paying for mastery, depth, efficiency and the ability to facilitate transformation quickly. I have offered my work for a reduced rate in rare situations where someone was in genuine need. It is very realistic to work fewer than 40 hours... with completely flexible scheduling. You can coach from anywhere in the world and meet clients in person when possible. I work between 40 and 60 hours a week because I do more than coach. I write books, teach, lead global programmes and serve an international audience. I do not take many breaks... because my work does not feel like work. It is my greatest passion and sense of purpose. When I take time off, it is quality time with my wife or our close friends. The time is intentional and allows my body to rest and recharge. Complaints about splitting chores come up often... because chores are rarely about chores. They symbolise deeper emotional patterns. The argument is usually about feeling unsupported or disconnected. The fairest approach is to stop focusing on the dishwasher and address the real emotional dynamic. When the emotional connection is restored, the practical details become easy to solve. \n                  Budget 2025: Rachel Reeves calls for Labour MPs to unite - but admits they might not like everything\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: Three things Rachel Reeves's speech boils down to - and two tricks the chancellor will fall back on\n                 \n                  UK visitors will need advance permission to travel under new rules | Money blog\n                 Couples go wrong in communicating when they... speak from old wounds rather than from the present.

Read more from Sky News:What it's really like to be a make-up artistThe changes people want to see in the budgetDyson in the dock over busted £350 fan - will its fob-off hold? Some people cheat because... of unresolved issues with self-worth and a deep need for validation. Others cheat because they struggle to receive love. Even with a loving partner, they feel unworthy and unconsciously sabotage. It is rarely about the other person. It is about the unresolved relationship with oneself. It is possible to mend a relationship after someone has cheated... The key is radical honesty and full responsibility. The partner who cheated must reveal the whole truth. Both must understand why it happened. Trust is rebuilt through consistent action and emotional repair. Before coaching I worked as a personal trainer specialising in functional strength and group classes... Fitness was a bridge for me because physical health has always been a core pillar of my life. But it was never my deepest passion. It sustained me until I built the path toward the work I do today. The part of my job that I dislike is... emails and technical work. It does not excite me. I am an extrovert at heart. I want to coach, guide, host events and be with people rather than handle admin or tech structure. Many coaches feel the same. Coaching is unregulated... which means many people call themselves relationship coaches without real experience or a clear framework. I trained across multiple disciplines, studied healing modalities from shamanic work to modern somatic practices, trained in men's work, became a certified hypnotherapist to work with deep subconscious patterns and developed my own methodology through years of working with individuals and couples. Neutrality is essential... I do not take sides. I focus on the dynamic rather than the personalities. After many years it becomes second nature. There are moments when one partner is acting out of integrity. In those cases I do not side against them but I name the truth directly. Clarity is part of the work. In an established relationship the red flags are... secrecy, chronic irresponsibility or using money to control. Transparency is non-negotiable. Nothing can be hidden. Financial stress comes up as a problem for couples often... but it is rarely about the money itself. Money represents safety and security. If both partners are under financial pressure, their bodies go into stress, which makes intimacy difficult. There is also the wounded relationship with money. Hiding spending, manipulating, resenting the other for earning more. If someone wants a thriving relationship, they must look honestly at their own relationship with money."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  This is going to be a big budget - not to mention a complex budget. It could, depending on how it lands, determine the fate of this government. And it's hard to think of many other budgets that have been preceded by quite so much speculation, briefing, and rumour. All of which is to say, you could be forgiven for feeling rather overwhelmed. But in practice, what's happening this week can really be boiled down to three things. 1. Not enough growth The first is that the economy is not growing as fast as many people had hoped. Or, to put it another way, Britain's productivity growth is much weaker than it once used to be. The upshot of that is that there's less money flowing into the exchequer in the form of tax revenues. 2. Not enough cuts The second factor is that last year and this, the chancellor promised to make certain cuts to welfare - cuts that would have saved the government billions of pounds of spending a year. But it has failed to implement those cuts. Put those extra billions together with the shortfall from that weaker productivity, and it's pretty clear there is a looming hole in the public finances. 3. Not enough levers The third thing to bear in mind is that Rachel Reeves has pledged to tie her hands in the way she responds to this fiscal hole. She has fiscal rules that mean she can't ignore it. She has a manifesto pledge which means she is somewhat limited in the levers she can pull to fill it. Put it all together, and it adds up to a momentous headache for the chancellor. She needs to raise quite a lot of money and all the \"easy\" ways of doing it (like raising income tax rates or VAT) seem to be off the table.  So… what will she do? Quite how she responds remains to be seen - as does the precise size of the fiscal hole. But if the rumours in Westminster are to be believed, she will fall back upon two tricks most of her predecessors have tried at various points. First, she will deploy \"fiscal drag\" to squeeze extra income tax and national insurance payments out of families for the coming five years. What this means in practice is that even though the headline rate of income tax might not go up, the amount of income we end up being taxed on will grow ever higher in the coming years. Second, the chancellor is expected to squeeze government spending in the distant years for which she doesn't yet need to provide detailed plans. Together, these measures may raise somewhere in the region of £10bn. But Reeves's big problem is that in practice she needs to raise two or three times this amount. So, how will she do that? Most likely is that she implements a grab-bag of other tax measures: more expensive council tax for high value properties; new CGT rules; new gambling taxes and more. No return to austerity, but an Osborne-like predicament… If this summons up a particular memory from history, it's precisely the same problem George Osborne faced back in 2012. He wanted to raise quite a lot of money but due to agreements with his coalition partners, he was limited in how many big taxes he could raise. The resulting budget was, at the time at least, the single most complex budget in history. Consider: in the years between 1970 and 2010 the average UK budget contained 14 tax measures. Osborne's 2012 budget contained a whopping 61 of them. And not long after he delivered it, the budget started to unravel. You probably recall the pasty tax, and maybe the granny tax and the charity tax. Essentially, he was forced into a series of embarrassing U-turns. If there was a lesson, it was that trying to wodge so many money-raising measures into a single fiscal event was an accident waiting to happen.  Except that… here's the interesting thing. In the following years, the complexity of budgets didn't fall - it rose. Osborne broke his own complexity record the next year with the 2013 budget (73 tax measures), and then again in 2016 (86 measures). By 2020 the budget contained a staggering 103 measures. And Reeves's own first budget, last autumn, very nearly broke this record with 94 measures. In short, budgets have become more and more complex, chock-full of even more (often microscopic) tax measures. Read more from Sky News:What tax measures are expected in budget?The political jeopardy facing Rachel Reeves in budget In part, this is a consequence of the fact that, long ago, chancellors seem to have agreed that it would be political suicide to raise the basic rate of income tax or VAT. The consequence is that they have been forced to resort to ever smaller and fiddlier measures to make their numbers add up. The question is whether this pattern continues this week. Do we end up with yet another astoundingly complex budget? Will that slew of measures backfire as they did for Osborne in 2012? And, more to the point, will they actually benefit the UK economy?"

Motability is a scheme whereby people getting personal independence payments (PIP) can sacrifice part of their benefits in exchange for a rental vehicle, if they are eligible.

However, luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes will be removed as options, alongside the likes of Audi, Lexus, and Alfa Romeo, \"immediately\".  An announcement from Motability said: \"In the short term, Motability Operations will work closely with UK-based manufacturers to increase the share of British-built vehicles leased by customers, while maintaining affordability, choice and quality. \"This includes doubling the number of Nissan British-built vehicles that the scheme leases to around 40,000. \"The intention would be that 25% of cars on the scheme would be UK-built by 2030, up from 7% today.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Backing British car manufacturing will support thousands of well-paid, skilled jobs and is exactly the long-term investment our Modern Industrial Strategy delivers. \"We are growing the economy to bring down debt, cut NHS waiting lists and cut the cost of living.\" Read more:What tax rises could be announced this week?Reeves hints at more welfare cuts The government is tonight refusing to say if it will change the Motability eligibility criteria in the budget, with any changes in this regard likely to come about as a result of the Timms review into PIP.

He said the chancellor will \"take the fair and necessary choices\" at the budget this week. \"The chancellor will take the tough decisions necessary to keep inflation down, protect families and businesses from rising costs to safeguard the public services and keep debt under control for the long term,\" he added.

But what I don't want to do is, as a country, just focus just on the billionaires because there are other people that have needed to leave.\" He said that while the government has closed some loopholes, it is also making it \"easier for people to come here who have high talents\". Over the weekend, it was revealed one of Britain's richest men, Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, has left the UK due to the government's targeting of the super rich."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  Wednesday's budget is going to be big. It will be big in terms of tax rises, big in terms of setting the course of the economy and public services, and big in terms of political jeopardy for this government. The chancellor has a lot of different groups to try to assuage and a lot is at stake. \"There are lots of different audiences to this budget,\" says one senior Labour figure. \"The markets will be watching, the public on the cost of living, the party on child poverty and business will want to like the direction in which we are travelling - from what I've seen so far, it's a pretty good package.\" The three core principles underpinning the chancellor's decisions will be to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living. There will be no return to austerity and no more increases in government borrowing. Politics Live: Reeves's 'mansplaining' claims are just a 'smokescreen', says shadow chancellor What flows from that is more investment in the NHS, already the big winner in the 2024 Budget, and tax rises to keep funding public services and help plug gaps in the government's finances. \n                  Budget 2025: Rachel Reeves calls for Labour MPs to unite - but admits they might not like everything\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: Three things Rachel Reeves's speech boils down to - and two tricks the chancellor will fall back on\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch dismisses Rachel Reeves' 'mansplain' claim - and warns against budget tax rises\n                 Some of these gaps are beyond Rachel Reeves's control, such as the decision by the independent fiscal watchdog (the Office for Budget Responsibility) to downgrade the UK's productivity forecasts - leaving the chancellor with a £20bn gap in the public finances - or the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs on the global economy.  Others are self-inflicted, with the chancellor having to find about £7bn to plug her reversals on winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts. By not pulling the borrowing lever, she hopes to send a message to the markets about stability, and that should help keep down inflation and borrowing costs low, which in turn helps with the cost of living, because inflation and interest rates feed into what we pay for food, for energy, rent and mortgage costs. That's what the government is trying to do, but what about the reality when this budget hits? This is going to be another big Labour budget, where people will be taxed more and the government will spend more. Only a year ago the chancellor raised a whopping £40bn in taxes and said she wasn't coming back for more. Now she's looking to raise more than £30bn. That the prime minister refused to recommit to his manifesto promise not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance on working people at the G20 in South Africa days ahead of the budget is instructive: this week we could see the government announce manifesto-breaking tax rises that will leave millions paying more.  Freeze to income thresholds expected The biggest tax lever, raising income tax rates, was going to be pulled but has now been put back in neutral after the official forecasts came in slightly better than expected, and Downing Street thought again about being the first government in 50 years to raise the income tax rate. On the one hand, this measure would have been a very clean and clear way of raising £20bn of tax. On the other, there was a view from some in government that the PM and his chancellor would never recover from such a clear breach of trust, with a fair few MPs comparing it to the tuition fees U-turn that torpedoed Nick Clegg's Lib Dems in the 2015 general election. Instead, the biggest revenue raiser in the budget will be another two-year freeze on income tax thresholds until 2030. This is the very thing that Reeves promised she would not do at the last budget in 2024 because \"freezing the thresholds will hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\". This week, those words will come back to haunt the chancellor.  Two-child cap big headline grabber There will also be more spending and the biggest headline grabber will be the decision to lift the two-child benefit cap. This was something the PM refused to commit to in the Labour manifesto, because it was one of the things he said he couldn't afford to do if he wanted to keep taxes low for working people. But on Wednesday, the government will announce it's spending £3bn-a-year to lift that cap. Labour MPs will like it, polling suggests the public will not. What we are going to get on Wednesday is another big tax and spend Labour budget on top of the last. For the Conservatives, it draws clear dividing lines to take Labour on. They will argue that this is the \"same old Labour\", taxing more to spend more, and more with no cuts to public spending. Having retreated on welfare savings in the summer, to then add more to the welfare bill by lifting the two-child cap is a gift for Labour's opponents and they will hammer the party on the size of the benefits bill, where the cost of supporting people with long-term health conditions is set to rise from £65bn-a-year to a staggering £100bn by 2029-30.  Mansion tax on the cards There is also a real risk of blow-up in this budget as the chancellor unveils a raft of revenue measures to find that £30bn. There could be a mansion tax for those living in more expensive homes, a gambling tax, a tourism tax, a milkshake tax. Ministers are fearful that one of these more modest revenue-raising measures becomes politically massive and blows up. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 This is what happened to George Osborne in 2012 when he announced plans to put 20% of VAT on hot food sold in bakeries and supermarkets. The plan quickly became an attack on the working man's lunch from out-of-touch Tories and the \"pasty tax\" was ditched two months later. And what about the voters? Big tax and spend budgets are the opposite of what Sir Keir Starmer promised the country when he was seeking election. His administration was not going to be another Labour tax and spend government but instead invest in infrastructure to turbocharge growth to help pay for better services and improve people's everyday lives. Seventeen months in, the government doesn't seem to be doing things differently. A year ago, it embarked on the biggest tax-raising budget in a generation, and this week, it goes back on its word and lifts taxes for working people. It creates a big trust deficit. Government attempts to tell a better story There are those in Labour who will read this and point to worse-than-expected government finances, global headwinds and the productivity downgrades as reasons for tax raising. But it is true too that economists had argued in the run-up to the election that Labour's position on not cutting spending or raising taxes was unsustainable when you looked at the public finances. Labour took a gamble by saying tax rises were not needed before the election and another one when the chancellor said last year she was not coming back for more. After a year-and-a-half of governing, the country isn't feeling better off, the cost of living isn't easing, the economy isn't firing, the small boats haven't been stopped, and the junior doctors are again on strike. Read more:Reeves hints at more welfare cutsReeves vows to 'grip the cost of living'What tax rises could chancellor announce?  The PM told me at the G7 summit in Canada in June that one of his regrets of his first year wasn't \"we haven't always told our story as well as we should\". What you will hear this week is the government trying to better tell that story about what it has achieved to improve people's lives - be that school breakfast clubs or extending free childcare, increasing the national living wage, giving millions of public sector workers above-inflation pay rises. You will also hear more about the NHS, as the waiting lists for people in need of non-urgent care within 18 weeks remain stubbornly high. It stood at 7.6m in July 2024 and was at 7.4m at the end of September. The government will talk on Wednesday about how it intends to drive those waits down. But there is another story from the last 18 months too: Labour said the last budget was a \"once in a parliament\" tax-raising moment, now it's coming back for more. Labour said in the election it would protect working people and couldn't afford to lift the two child-benefit cap, and this week could see both those promises broken.  Can PM convince his MPs? Labour flip-flopped on winter fuel allowance and on benefit cuts, and is now raising your taxes. Downing Street has been in a constant state of flux as the PM keeps changing his top team, the deputy prime minister had to resign for underpaying her tax, while the UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, was sacked over his ties to the Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted paedophile. It doesn't seem much like politics being done differently. All of the above is why this budget is big. Because Wednesday is not just about the tax and spend measures, big as they may be. It is also about this government, this prime minister, this chancellor. Starmer said ahead of this budget that he was \"optimistic\" and \"if we get this right, our country has a great future\". But he has some serious convincing to do. Many of his own MPs and those millions of people who voted Labour in, have lost confidence in their ability to deliver, which is why the drumbeat of leadership change now bangs. Going into Wednesday, it's difficult to imagine how this second tax-raising budget will lessen that noise around a leader and a Labour government that, at the moment, is fighting to survive."

        "Content": "Two members of the House of Lords are set to be suspended over a cash for access scandal following meetings with undercover journalists. Former British Army chief Lord Dannatt and Lord Evans of Watford were found to have broken the rules on providing parliamentary services in return for \"payment or reward\" in separate cases. Politics latest: Badenoch says she's getting better as Tory leader Lord Evans will be suspended from the Lords for five months, and Lord Dannatt for four months, after the Lords Conduct Committee upheld the findings and recommendations of the independent Commissioner for Standards. Their suspensions, which neither peer appealed, will come into force once agreed by the House of Commons. Crossbench peer Lord Dannatt was found to have showed a \"clear willingness to undertake activity that would have amounted to paid parliamentary services\" during his conversations with the Guardian undercover journalists, but no money was exchanged. However, it later emerged he provided parliamentary services in return for payment in three other cases. \n                  Two-thirds of woman in armed forces have experienced sexualised behaviour, damning internal survey finds\n                 \n                  Family of Kenyan woman allegedly murdered by British soldier welcome extradition proceedings\n                 \n                  Soldiers hospitalised yet again after riding around in army's problem-plagued vehicle\n                 He corresponded with ministers and officials on behalf of companies in which he had a financial interest, and, in two cases, attended a meeting with a minister or senior official. UK Mitrogen, Teledyne UK and Blue International Holdings were the companies.  The conduct committee said it gave \"due weight to Lord Dannatt's expressions of remorse and recognition of the potential damage such cases cause to the reputation of the House\". But it added: \"The key aggravating factor in the case was the fact that there were four separate findings of breaches of the code. The sheer number of Lord Dannatt's improper interactions with ministers or officials, and their duration over a period of two years, justify a significant sanction.\" Labour peer Lord Evans, a publisher and entrepreneur, was accused of offering \"cash for access\" during meetings with undercover Guardian journalists posing as potential clients of Affinity, a company owned by his son, and which the peer holds a third of the shares. The commissioner said Lord Evans failed to act on his personal honour when he told the undercover reporters he would be willing to introduce them to MPs, given his financial interest in Affinity. Lord Evans also sponsored events at the House of Lords on behalf of the company and approached fellow peers to speak at those events, so provided parliamentary services to the company he had a financial incentive in. It was also concluded Lord Evans broke House of Lords events rules as tickets for the events were advertised at above cost price. The events were used to promote and drum up business for Affinity - and Lord Evans, as sponsor of the events, \"failed to satisfy himself that the events complied with the house's rules\", the commissioner said. Lord Dannatt said the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists also investigated the \"two UK-based matters\", and concluded he had not conducted consultant lobbying. In a statement, he said: \"I deeply regret the commissioner's findings regarding my personal honour, and I decided that the honourable course of action was not to waste the conduct committee's time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction. \"I accept further that ignorance of all aspects of the code of conduct does not constitute a defence and that registration of my interests with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, and my declaration of my relevant interests in correspondence and at meetings, as occurred in all three matters, was insufficient. \"I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith, which was my motivation in the three matters, is not an excuse or justification for breaching the Code of Conduct. \"At nearly 75, no one is too old to learn lessons, and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56-years public service.\""

        "Content": "Shares in Novo Nordisk, the Danish firm best known for its Wegovy and Ozempic weight loss drugs, have plunged after it called a halt to closely-watched trials on a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The company had been testing whether a key ingredient in the drugs could slow progression of the brain disorder. Novo Nordisk, which began the trials two years ago, had always treated the study as an outside bet but one which had the potential to land big rewards, if successful, as earnings from its core diabetes/weight loss space come under pressure from intense competition. Money latest: UK visitors face new rules The drug tested was Rybelsus, a pill approved only for type 2 diabetes, which contains semaglutide like Wegovy and Ozempic But shares fell more than 12% initially in Copenhagen, to lows not seen since the summer of 2021, when Novo revealed that the planned expansion of the trial, into a third year, would not proceed. Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: \"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success. \n                  Budget 2025: Rachel Reeves calls for Labour MPs to unite - but admits they might not like everything\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: Three things Rachel Reeves's speech boils down to - and two tricks the chancellor will fall back on\n                 \n                  UK visitors will need advance permission to travel under new rules | Money blog\n                 \"While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,\" he said. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affect more than 55 million people globally. There is no cure. Novo's shares settled around 9% down on the day, building on losses over the year to date that have now extended beyond 55%. The share price reaction would suggest that some investors had factored in a measure of success from Novo's trials. Some market analysts expressed horror over the scale of Monday's share price decline. Sydbank's Soren Lontoft said of the trial's end: \"Based on the history of Alzheimer's treatment, this doesn't come as a big surprise to me. \"The share's reaction is probably more due to the bad sentiment around the Novo Nordisk share and the negative news flow over the past year - perhaps there was hope for a little tailwind from this study.\""

        "Content": " Reports of a \"board-level orchestrated coup\" at the BBC are \"complete nonsense\", non-executive director Sir Robbie Gibb has told MPs. Sir Robbie, whose position on the BBC board has been challenged by critics in recent weeks, was among senior leaders, including the broadcaster's chair, Samir Shah, to face questions from the Culture, Media and Sport committee about the current crisis. The hearing took place in the wake of the fallout over the edit of a speech by US President Donald Trump, which prompted the resignation of the corporation's director-general and the chief executive of BBC News, and the threat of a lawsuit from the US president. Former editorial adviser Michael Prescott, whose leaked memo sparked the recent chain of events, also answered questions from MPs - telling the hearing he felt he kept seeing \"incipient problems\" that were not being tackled. He also said Mr Trump's reputation had \"probably not\" been tarnished by the Panorama edit. During his own questioning, Sir Robbie addressed concerns of potential political bias - he left BBC News in 2017 to become then prime minister Theresa May's director of communications, a post he held until 2019, and was appointed to the BBC board in 2021 by Boris Johnson. \"I know it's hard to marry the fact that I spent two years as director of communications for the government... and my genuine passion for impartiality,\" he said. \"I want to hear the full range of views... I don't want the BBC to be partisan or favour any particular way.\" Asked about reports and speculation that there has been a \"board-level orchestrated coup\", Sir Robbie responded: \"It's up there as one of the most ridiculous charges... People had to find some angle. \"It's complete nonsense. It's also deeply offensive to fellow board members... people of great standing in different fields.\" He said his political work has been \"weaponised\" - and that it was hard as a non-executive member of the BBC to respond to criticism. 'We should have made the decision earlier' Mr Shah admitted the BBC was too slow in responding to the issue of the Panorama edit of Mr Trump, which had been flagged long before the leaked memo. \"Looking back, I think we should have made the decision earlier,\" he said. \"I think in May, as it happens. \"I think there is an issue about how quickly we respond, the speed of our response. Why do we not do it quickly enough? Why do we take so much time? And this was another illustration of that.\" Following reports of the leaked memo, it took nearly a week for the BBC to issue an apology. Mr Shah told the committee he did not think Mr Davie needed to resign over the issue and that he \"spent a great deal of time\" trying to stop him from doing so. Is director-general role too big for one person? Asked about his own position, Mr Shah said his job now is to \"steady the ship\", and that he is not someone \"who walks away from a problem\". A job advert for the BBC director-general role has since gone live on the corporation's careers website. Mr Shah told the hearing his view is that the role is \"too big\" for one person and that he is \"inclined\" to restructure roles at the top. He says he believes there should also be a deputy director-general who is \"laser-focused on journalism\", which is \"the most important thing and our greatest vulnerability\". Earlier in the hearing, Mr Prescott gave evidence alongside another former BBC editorial adviser, Caroline Daniel. He told the CMS committee that there are \"issues of denial\" at the BBC and said \"the management did not accept there was a problem\" with the Panorama episode. Mr Prescott's memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump's speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\". 'I can't think of anything I agree with Trump on' Mr Trump has said he is going to pursue a lawsuit of between $1bn and $5bn against the broadcaster, despite receiving an official public apology. Asked if the documentary had harmed Mr Trump's image, Mr Prescott responded: \"I should probably restrain myself a little bit, given that there is a potential legal action. \"All I could say is, I can't think of anything I agree with Donald Trump on.\" He was later pushed on the subject, and asked again if he agreed that the programme tarnished the president's reputation, to which he then replied: \"Probably not.\" Read more:Experts on why Trump might struggle to win lawsuitWhy are people calling for Sir Robbie Gibb to go? Mr Prescott, a former journalist, also told the committee he did not know how his memo was leaked to the Daily Telegraph. \"At the most fundamental level, I wrote that memo, let me be clear, because I am a strong supporter of the BBC. \"The BBC employs talented professionals across all of its factual and non-factual programmes, and most people in this country, certainly myself included, might go as far as to say that they love the BBC. He said he \"never envisaged\" the fallout that would occur. \"I was hoping the concerns I had could, and would, be addressed privately in the first instance.\" Asked if he thinks the BBC is institutionally biased, he said: \"No, I don't.\" He said that \"tonnes\" of the BBC's work is \"world class\" - but added that there is \"real work that needs to be done\" to deal with problems. Mr Davie, he said, did a \"first-rate job\" as director-general but had a \"blind spot\" toward editorial failings."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Jimmy Cliff, a musical artist who helped bring reggae to an international audience, has died aged 81. Known for hits including You Can Get It If You Really Want, The Harder They Come, and Many Rivers To Cross, his career spanned six decades. His wife, Latifa Chambers wrote on Instagram: \"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career. He really appreciated each and every fan for their love.\" Thanking the medical staff who helped during his illness, she added: \"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Signed by his wife, and two of his children, Latifa and Lilty, the statement concluded: \"We see you Legend.\" \n                  Reports of BBC coup 'complete nonsense', board member tells MPs\n                 \n                  Rapper Ghetts facing new charges after allegedly causing death by dangerous driving\n                 \n                  Dharmendra dies: Modi pays tribute to 'iconic' film star and Bollywood legend\n                 Tributes to the singer included those from Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, calling him \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world... Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul. His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.\" UB40 star Ali Campbell, who covered Cliff's song Many Rivers To Cross in 1983, also paid tribute, saying he was \"absolutely heartbroken to hear about the passing of a Reggae forefather\" in a post on X. Campbell also called Cliff \"a pillar of our music, and one of the first to carry reggae out into the world\". A legend of music and screen A two-time Grammy-winning artist, Cliff was awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 2003, the highest honour in the arts and sciences, from the Jamaican government. Over the years, he would work with stars including the Rolling Stones, Sting, Elvis Costello, Annie Lennox, Paul Simon and Wyclef Jean. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. A prolific writer, frequently expressing his humanitarian views through his work, his 1969 track Vietnam was reportedly described by Bob Dylan as \"the best protest song\" he had ever heard. Cliff was also well known for cover versions of songs, including Johnny Nash's I Can See Clearly Now, which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1993 movie Cool Runnings, and Cat Stevens' Wild World. He twice performed on high-profile US chat show Saturday Night Live. An actor and a musician, as well as singing the title track of 1972 cult classic The Harder They Come, Cliff also starred in it. One of the first major commercial releases to come out of Jamaica, the movie is credited with bringing reggae to the world, as well as showing a grittier and more realistic side to the country. During this time, Cliff's fame rivalled Bob Marley as the reggae's most prominent artist. The storyline, which revolved around Cliff's character, Ivan, moving to Kingston, Jamaica, to make it as a musical superstar, had parallels with his own. 'Hurricane Hattie' He was born James Chambers, during a hurricane, on 30 July 1944, in St James Parish, northwestern Jamaica. In the 1950s, he moved with his father from the family farm to Kingston, determined to succeed in the music industry. He began writing as Jamaica was gaining its independence from Britain, and as the early sounds of reggae - first called ska - were being developed. At just 14, he became nationally famous for the song Hurricane Hattie, which he had written himself. Cliff would go on to record over 30 albums and perform all over the world, including in Paris, in Brazil and at the World's Fair, an international exhibition held in New York in 1964. The following year, Island Records' Chris Blackwell, the producer who launched Bob Marley And The Wailers, invited Cliff to work in the UK. 'I still have many rivers to cross!' Speaking about his burning passion for life during a 2019 interview, when the star had begun losing his sight, Cliff said: \"When I've achieved all my ambitions, then I guess that I will have done it and I can just say 'great'. \"But I'm still hungry. I want it. I've still got the burning fire that burns brightly inside of me - like I just said to you. I still have many rivers to cross!\" Cliff's last studio album, Refugees, made with Wyclef Jean, was released in 2022, and the singer said he wrote the title track \"due to emotional feelings towards freedom taken away from human beings\"."

        "Content": "Indian film star and Bollywood icon Dharmendra has died aged 89. One of the nation's most popular actors, he was a defining presence in Indian cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. A senior police official who spoke to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the star's death, just days before his 90th birthday, on condition of anonymity. Now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has joined those paying tribute to the Punjabi icon, who also worked as a producer and politician. Mr Modi said: \"He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. \"The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people.\" Known as India's He-Man, he was often cast as a larger-than-life hero; upright, patriotic and fearless. \n                  Ariana Grande rushed by red carpet intruder at premiere of Wicked: For Good\n                 \n                  Cinema giant Vue picks finance chief ahead of potential float\n                 \n                  How to get cheap cinema tickets at Odeon, Vue and Cineworld\n                 He was often compared to Hollywood contemporaries James Dean and Paul Newman, according to the Hindustan Times. But he was popular as a romantic lead, too, frequently appearing alongside Hema Malini, with whom he acted in more than two dozen films. Their on-screen chemistry was real enough and the pair later married. He appeared alongside her in Sholay - a 1975 spin on the spaghetti western, regarded as one of India's greatest films. He's also remembered for the 1975 romantic comedy Chupke Chupke, and the 1971 action drama Mera Gaon Mera Desh. His final film will be the war biopic Ikkis, which is yet to be released.

Born in 1935, the actor grew up in a farming family, and was just 19 when he married his first wife, Prakash Kaur. He moved to Mumbai in the late 1950s and made his Bollywood debut in 1960, with his first appearance alongside Malini coming in 1970's Tum Haseen Main Jawaan. Their marriage in 1980 was controversial, however, since Dharmendra never divorced his first wife and continued to live with her, while Malini lived separately. Local media claimed he briefly converted to Islam before his second marriage, because Indian law only allows polygamy for Muslims. But he aggressively denied the claim when he ran for public office in 2004, saying: \"I am a Hindu. The question of my having ever changed religion does not exist.\" He would go on to be elected to the Indian parliament for the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, representing a Rajasthan seat from 2004 to 2009. Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian honour, in 2012, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He is survived by his wives, children and grandchildren. He had four children with his first wife, including two sons who would follow in his footsteps as actors - Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol. With Malini he had two daughters, including Bollywood actor Esha Deol."

        "Content": "An 18th century Spanish galleon dubbed the \"holy grail of shipwrecks\" for its storied cache of 11 million gold and silver coins - worth an estimated $20bn (£16bn) - has yielded its first treasures. The San José, a 64-gun galleon of the Spanish Navy, was sunk by the British in 1708 when her powder magazines exploded near Cartagena, Colombia. Now a Colombian mission to salvage the wreck has retrieved its first artifacts; a cannon, three coins, and some porcelain. The recovery forms part of an expedition to the wreck, approved by Bogotá last year, following the rediscovery of the ship in 2015. The San José lies 600m (almost 2,000ft) below the Caribbean Sea, but its exact location is a state secret, and ownership of the treasure is hotly contested. It has been the subject of a legal battle in the United States, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure. Sea Search Armada, a group of American investors, claims to have discovered the ship in 1982, and demands $10bn for its part - estimating this to be about 50% of the treasure's worth. Colombia's government, meanwhile, says the purpose of its deep-sea mission is research and not treasure, and that the artifacts will be preserved and studied. The coins, known as macuquinas, have been taken to the National Museum of Colombia, while the other finds are being studied and preserved at the Caribbean Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research Center. The Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said subjecting the artifacts to laboratory analysis could shed new light on the ship's history. In a statement, it said: \"Each of the archaeological objects collected from the shipwreck opens up the possibilities of discovering more aspects of the history of the San José galleon. \"The direct study of the macuquinas, the porcelain cups, the cannon and the sediment remains associated with these objects will allow us to delve deeper into aspects of the investigation.\" Read more:Pictures reveal shipwreck carrying billions in lost treasureThe billion dollar treasure wreck and the row over who owns it Areas of study include the composition of the artifacts, the origin of their manufacture, chronology, and production technologies of the time. The Colombian government is also investigating the cause of the ship's sinking, and has suggested it could have sunk for reasons other than an explosion, including damage to the hull. Bogotá says its research project comprises a number of phases, the first of which was a non-intrusive study of the wreck's archaeological context and debris field.  The newly recovered items were brought up as part of the second phase: collecting artifacts and adapting them for preservation in a non-marine environment."
