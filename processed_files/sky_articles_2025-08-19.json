        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  \"It's an interesting moment,\" was how one government source described the High Court ruling that will force an Essex hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers within weeks. That may prove to be the understatement of the summer. For clues as to why, just take a glance at what the Home Office's own lawyer told the court on Tuesday. Granting the injunction \"runs the risk of acting as an impetus for further violent protests\", the barrister said - pointing out that similar legal claims by other councils would \"aggravate pressures on the asylum estate\". Right on cue and just hours after the ruling came in, Broxbourne Council - over the border in Hertfordshire - posted online that it was urgently seeking legal advice with a view to taking similar court action. The risks here are clear. Recent figures show just over 30,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels across the country. If they start to empty out following a string of court claims, the Home Office will struggle to find alternative options. After all, they are only in hotels because of a lack of other types of accommodation. There are several caveats though. This is just an interim injunction that will be heard in full in the autumn. So the court could swing back in favour of the hotel chain - and by extension the Home Office. Read more:Who says what on asylum hotels? We have been here before Remember, this isn't the first legal claim of this kind. Other councils have tried to leverage the power of the courts to shut down asylum hotels, with varying degrees of success. In 2022, Ipswich Borough Council failed to get an extension to an interim injunction to prevent migrants being sent to a Novotel in the town. As in Epping, lawyers argued there had been a change in use under planning rules. But the judge eventually decided that the legal duty the Home Office has to provide accommodation for asylum seekers was more important. So there may not be a direct read across from this case to other councils. Home Office officials are emphasising this injunction was won on the grounds of planning laws rather than national issues such as public order, and as such, each case will be different. Failing Labour approach or Tory tricks? But government sources also smell dirty tricks from Epping Council and are suggesting that the Tory-led local authority made the legal claim for political reasons. Pointing to the presence of several prominent Tory MPs in the Essex area - as well as the threat posed by Reform in the county - the question being posed is why this legal challenge was not brought when asylum seekers first started being sent to the hotel in 2020 during the Conservatives' time in government. Epping Council would no doubt reject that and say recent disorder prompted them to act. But that won't stop the Tories and Reform of seizing on this as evidence of a failing approach from Labour. So there are political risks for the government, yes, but it's the practicalities that could flow from this ruling that pose the bigger danger."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has said American troops will not be sent to Ukraine, but the US may provide air support as part of a peace deal with Russia. A day after his extraordinary White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the leaders of Kyiv's European allies, the US president told Fox News \"when it comes to security, [Europeans] are willing to put people on the ground. We're willing to help them with things, especially, probably, by air\". Ukraine war - follow the latest developments Mr Trump did not elaborate, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters US air support was \"an option and a possibility\". She said the US president \"has definitively stated US boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies\". Air support could take many forms, including missile defence systems or fighter jets enforcing a no-fly zone - and it's not clear what role the US would play under any proposed peace deal.  Zelenskyy-Putin summit It comes as planning for a possible Zelenskyy-Putin summit get under way. Talks between the Ukrainian and Russian president are seen by Mr Trump as vital to ending the war. Sky News understands a meeting could happen before the end of the month, with Geneva, Vienna, Rome, Budapest, and Doha among the venues being considered. Geneva, Switzerland, is considered the best option, with Rome or the Vatican disliked by the Russians and Budapest, Hungary, not favoured by the Ukrainians. European allies are understood to want security guarantees to be defined before the meeting. A NATO-like treaty, guaranteeing Ukraine's allies would come to its defence in case of any future Russian attack, is being worked on and could be completed by next week. Like the US, Sky News understands Italy is opposed to putting boots on the ground in Ukraine. But EU diplomats are confident this is the best chance yet to stop the war, and allies could return to Washington in early September to celebrate any deal being struck.

        "Content": "By Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor in Ukraine   Ukrainians have given a lukewarm reaction to this week's White House summit. There is bafflement and unease here after US President Donald Trump switched sides to support his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, dropping calls for a ceasefire and proposing that Ukraine surrender territory. While allies are talking up the prospects of progress, people here remain unconvinced. Ukraine war latest - Trump rules out using US troops  The Trump administration's contradictory statements on possible security guarantees are causing concern here. MP Lesia Vasylenko told Sky News it is not at all clear what the allies have in mind. \"Who is going to be there backing Ukraine in case Russia decides to revisit their imperialistic plans and strategies and in case they want to restart this war of aggression?\" For many Ukrainians, there is a troubling sense of deja vu.  In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to give up not land but its nuclear arsenal, inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for security assurances from Russia and other powers. They know how that ended up to their enormous cost. Putin reneged on Russia's side of the bargain, with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and once again with his full-scale attack three and a half years ago. We met veteran Ukrainian diplomat Yuri Kostenko, who helped lead those negotiations in the 90s. He said there is a danger the world makes the same mistake and trusts Vladimir Putin when he says he wants to stop the killing, something Mr Trump said he now believes. ðŸ‘‰â€¯Listen to Sky Newsâ€¯Dailyâ€¯on your podcast appâ€¯ðŸ‘ˆâ€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ â€¯ \"It's not true, it's not true, Russia never, never, it's my practices in more than 30 years, Russia never stop their aggression plans to occupy all Ukraine and I think that Mr Trump, if he really believes Mr Putin, it will be a very big mistake, Mr Trump, a very big mistake.\" Before the Alaska summit, allies agreed the best path to peace was forcing Mr Putin to stop his invasion, hitting him where it hurts with severe sanctions on his oil trade. But Mr Trump has given up calls for a ceasefire and withdrawn threats to impose those tougher sanctions. Instead, he has led allies down a different and more uncertain path. Read more on Sky News:Putin wasn't there, but influenced summitPeace further away, not closerFive takeaways from White House talks Ukrainians we met on the streets of Kyiv said they would love to believe in progress more than anything, but are not encouraged by what they are hearing. While the diplomacy moves on in an unclear direction, events on the ground and in the skies above Ukraine are depressingly predictable. Russia is continuing hundreds of drone attacks every night, and its forces are advancing on the front. If Vladimir Putin really wants this war to end, he's showing no sign of it, while Ukrainians fear Donald Trump is taking allies down a blind alley of fruitless diplomacy."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        One of Britain's most legendary TV dramatists, Sir Phil Redmond, is no stranger to tackling difficult issues on screen. Courting controversy famously with his hard-hitting storylines on his children's show Grange Hill for the BBC in 1978, before he switched over to Channel 4 to give it its two most prominent soaps, Brookside (1982) and later Hollyoaks (1995). He's been a pivotal figure at Channel 4 from its inception, widely considered to be a father to the channel. While he's been responsible for putting some of TV's most impactful storylines to air for them - from the first lesbian kiss, to bodies buried under patios - off-screen nowadays, he's equally radical about what should happen. \"Channel 4's job in 1980 was to provide a platform for the voices, ideas, and people that weren't able to break through into television. They did a fantastic job. I was part of that, and now it's done.\" It's not that he wants to kill off Channel 4 but - as broadcasting bosses gather for Edinburgh's annual TV Festival - he believes they urgently should be talking about mergers. A suggestion which goes down about as well as you might imagine, he says, when he brings it up with those at the top. He laughs: \"The people with the brains think it's a good idea, the people who've got the expense accounts think it's horrendous.\" A 'struggling' BBC trying to 'survive' With charter renewal talks under way to determine the BBC's future funding, Sir Phil says \"there's only one question, and that is what's going to happen to the BBC?\" \"We've got two public sector broadcasters - the BBC and Channel 4 - both owned by the government, by us as the taxpayers, and what they're trying to do now is survive, right? \"No bureaucracy ever deconstructs itselfâ€¦ the BBC is strugglingâ€¦ Channel 4 has got about a billion quid coming in a year. If you mix that, all the transmissions, all the back office stuff, all the technical stuff, all that cashâ€¦ you can keep that kind of coterie of expertise on youth programming and then say 'don't worry about the money, just go out and do what you used to do, upset people!'.\" How feasible would that be? Redmond claims, practically, you could pull it off in a week - \"we could do it now, it's very simple, it's all about keyboards and switches\". But the screenwriter admits that winning people over mentally to his way of thinking would take a few years of persuading. As for his thoughts on what could replace the BBC licence fee, he says charging people to download BBC apps on their phones seems like an obvious source of income. \"There are 25 million licences and roughly 90 million mobile phones. If you put a small levy on each mobile phone, you could reduce the actual cost of the licence fee right down, and then it could just be tagged on to VAT. \"Those parts are just moving the tax system around a bit. [then] you wouldn't have to worry about all the criminality and single mothers being thrown in jail, all this kind of nonsense.\" 'Subsidising through streaming is not the answer' Earlier this year, Peter Kosminsky, the director of historical drama Wolf Hall, suggested a levy on UK streaming revenues could fund more high-end British TV on the BBC. Sir Phil describes that as \"a sign of desperation\". \"If you can't actually survive within your own economic basis, you shouldn't be doing it. \"I don't think top slicing or subsidising one aspect of the business is the answer, you have to just look at the whole thing as a totality.\" Since selling his production company, Mersey Television, two decades ago, much of his current work has focused on acting as an ambassador for the culture and creative industries. Although he's taken a step away from television, he admits he's disappointed by how risk-averse programme makers appear to have become. \"Dare I say it? There needs to be an intellectual foundation to it all.\" TV's 'missing a trick' He believes TV bosses are too scared of being fined by Ofcom, and that's meant soaps are not going as far as they should. \"The benefits [system], you know, immigration, all these things are really relevant subjects for drama to bring out all the arguments, the conflicts. \"The majority of the people know the benefits system is broken, that it needs to be fixed because they see themselves living on their estate with a 10 or 12-year-old car and then there's someone else down the road who knows how to fill a form in, and he's driving around in a Â£65k BMW, right? Those debates would be really great to bring out on TV, they're missing a trick.\" While some of TV's biggest executives are slated to speak at the Edinburgh Television Festival, Redmond is not convinced they will be open to listening. \"They will go where the perceived wisdom is as to where the industry is going. The fact that the industry is taking a wrong turn, we really need somebody else to come along and go 'Oi!'\" When I ask if that could be him, he laughs. Cue dramatic music and closing credits. As plot twists go, the idea of one of TV's most radical voices making a boardroom comeback to stir the pot, realistic or not, is at the very least food for thought for the industry. Edinburgh TV Festival runs from 19 - 22 August."

        "Content": "By Ben van der Merwe, digital investigations journalist, and Sam Doak, OSINT producer  Thousands have fled parts of Gaza City in recent days amid airstrikes and advancing Israeli troops, new satellite imagery shows.  Israel's advance comes as it prepares to mount a full-scale invasion of the city, where the UN says around one million Palestinians are sheltering. Satellite imagery shows that entire tent camps in southeast Gaza City were emptied between 9 and 17 August as families fled the renewed attacks. The video below shows the moment of an airstrike in southeastern Gaza City on 13 August. Sky News geolocated the footage to a building less than 200 metres from a major tent camp. Another video, taken on 15 August, shows a strike on a building right next to the camp. By the following day, almost all the camp's residents had fled, along with people sheltering at 30 other locations in the area. Fresh vehicle tracks in the area indicate extensive troop movements on the ground. The satellite image below, taken on 17 August, shows at least nine military vehicles in the streets surrounding one former tent camp. Sky News counted 58 military vehicles in the area on 17 August, including 17 bulldozers. The image below shows four IDF vehicles, including a bulldozer, parked next to the remains of one tent camp. Several nearby buildings had been levelled in the days beforehand. Between 9 and 17 August, at least 132 buildings were destroyed in less than one square kilometre of the city. It's unclear how much of the destruction was carried out by IDF bulldozers and how much was a result of airstrikes. On Monday, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli tanks had made further advances into eastern Gaza City. The advances came as Hamas said it had approved a ceasefire deal presented by mediators Egypt and Qatar. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed his country's military to prepare for a full-scale invasion and occupation of the city in order to \"free Gaza from Hamas\". The UN has said that the invasion risks \"catastrophic consequences\" for the estimated one million Palestinians sheltering in the city, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the plan would \"only bring more bloodshed\".

        "Content": "Children who vape are three times more likely to go on to be smokers, according to new analysis which linked youth vaping to a series of health issues. Vapers were not only more likely to smoke later in life, but they were also more likely to smoke more frequently and intensely, according to experts from the University of York and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The researchers analysed 56 reviews on 384 studies on youth vaping in an umbrella review, with some 21 of these reviews looking at the use of e-cigarettes in young people and later cigarette smoking. The largest global review on vaping in young people also discovered that there is an increased risk of respiratory illnesses, like asthma or asthma exacerbation, and substance abuse, including drinking and marijuana use. The study also suggested there are links between youth vaping and pneumonia, bronchitis, lower total sperm counts, dizziness, headaches, and migraines. A link between depression and suicidal thoughts among young vapers was also identified.  Consistent evidence The data available \"consistently indicated a significant association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people\", the researchers wrote in the journal Tobacco Control. The authors said it was difficult to \"infer causality\" from their review, but said the \"repeated strong associations in prospective cohort studies are consistent with a causal relationship\". \"The consistency in the evidence is striking,\" Dr Su Golder, associate professor in health science at the University of York, said. \"Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.\" Dr Greg Hartwell, clinical assistant professor at LSHTM said the review showed \"exactly why further restrictions on the tobacco industry [...] are so important\".

The crackdown on the disposable devices, also known as single-use vapes, was introduced in the hopes of making vapes less accessible to children, as statistics show a growing popularity among those aged 11 to 15. NHS figures from last year showed nearly a quarter of children in that age bracket had tried vaping, and nearly one in 10 did it frequently. The ban applies both in shops and online for sales across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Reusable vapes can still be sold. Commenting on the study, Jamie Strachan, operations director at vape retailer VPZ, said vaping \"should never be marketed to, sold to, or used by children and non-smokers\". \"VPZ supports strict regulation that prevents under-18s from obtaining vaping products,\" he added. Dr James Murphy, director of science and research at British American Tobacco (BAT), claimed there was \"little evidence that vaping is a gateway to smoking\". \"Smart regulation that gives adults access to better alternatives, while enforcing high standards and preventing underage use, is vital to achieving the UK's smoke-free goal,\" he added."

        "Headline": "The Bell Hotel has to stop housing asylum seekers by 12 September after Epping Forest District Council argued it was not being used for its intended purpose as a hotel.",
        "Content": " A council has won its bid to temporarily block asylum seekers from being housed at a hotel in Essex. Epping Forest District Council sought an interim High Court injunction to stop migrants from being accommodated at The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is owned by Somani Hotels Limited. The interim injunction demanded that the hotel be cleared of its occupants within 14 days, but in his ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Eyre granted the temporary block, while extending the time limit by which it must stop housing asylum seekers to 12 September. Somani Hotels said it intended to appeal the decision, its barrister, Piers Riley-Smith, arguing it would set a precedent that could affect \"the wider strategy\" of housing asylum seekers in hotels. But the judge turned down the group's request, saying that he was \"not persuaded there is such a compelling reason\". Somani could still ask the Court of Appeal for the go-ahead to appeal against the judgment. Welcoming the judgment as \"a ruling for common sense\", the council's leader, councillor Chris Whitbread, told Sky News the hotel \"should be empty\". He said: \"We always knew the Bell Hotel was the wrong location because of its close proximity to schools and other parts of the community. It was never going to work out, and we did repeat that to them on several occasions.\" Mr Whitbread said he had been \"on the side of local people from day one\" on the issue, but asked that anyone who wanted to continue to protest or demonstrate outside the hotel do so peacefully. He added: \"What we don't want is to have people thinking this is some great victory today.\" Earlier, Mr Whitbread said the last few weeks have placed \"an intolerable strain\" on local people, but warned it was \"not the end of the matter\", as the council must now \"return to the court and seek a permanent injunction\". Sex assault charge Several protests have been held outside the hotel in recent weeks after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, was charged with trying to kiss a teenage girl and denies the allegations. He is due to stand trial later this month. A government attempt to delay the application was rejected by the High Court judge earlier on Tuesday, Home Office barristers arguing the case had a \"substantial impact\" on the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, in performing her legal duties to asylum seekers. Moving asylum seekers in \"extremely short order\" would cause a \"very significant operational burden\", Edward Brown KC, said. But Mr Justice Eyre dismissed the Home Office's bid, stating that the department's involvement was \"not necessary\". The judge said the hotel's owners \"sidestepped the public scrutiny and explanation which would otherwise have taken place if an application for planning permission or for a certificate of lawful use had been made\". He added: \"It was also deliberately taking the chance that its understanding of the legal position was incorrect. This is factor of particular weight in the circumstances of this case.\" 'Getting out of hand' At a hearing last week, the council claimed Somani Hotels breached planning rules because the site is not being used for its intended purpose as a hotel. Philip Coppel KC, for the council, said the problem was \"getting out of hand\" and \"causing great anxiety\" to local people. He said the hotel \"is no more a hotel [to asylum seekers] than a borstal to a young offender\". Piers Riley-Smith, for Somani Hotels Limited, said a \"draconian\" injunction would cause \"hardship\" for those in the hotel, arguing \"political views\" were not grounds for an injunction to be granted. Asylum seekers a 'financial lifeline' He also said contracts to house asylum seekers were a \"financial lifeline\" for the hotel, which was only 1% full in August 2022, when it was open to paying customers. The hotel housed migrants from May 2020 to March 2021, then from October 2022 to April 2024, with the council never instigating any formal enforcement proceedings against this use, Mr Riley-Smith said. They were being placed there again in April 2025 and Mr Riley-Smith said a planning application was not made \"having taken advice from the Home Office\". Despite the carefully chosen words by the leader of Epping Forest District Council on the steps of the High Court that this was about residents contacting him to overturn a breach of planning law, anti-migrant protesters will see this as a victory for their demonstrations across the country this summer. The fact that the Home Office was not allowed to intervene in a case directly related to the home secretary's duties to house asylum seekers will fuel the enthusiasm of political opponents in local councils. Yvette Cooper is now under \"acute pressure\" to find suitable accommodation, government lawyers said. But the UK's towns and cities have deliberately diverse and varied planning constraints, so Tuesday's result may not be so easy to replicate.\n In Great Yarmouth, for example, there is a specific provision to ensure a hostel is not allowed on its waterfront.\n In Tuesday's court hearing, the barrister for Epping District Council advised ministers to look at property already held by them, where government-owned land is substantially exempt from many planning laws, suggesting instead 'a portacabin on the Crown Estate'\n Expect to hear that a lot inside and outside courtrooms in the coming months.\n\n At the end of the hearing last week, Mr Justice Eyre ordered that Somani Hotels could not \"accept any new applications\" from asylum seekers to stay at the site until he had made his ruling on the temporary injunction. Reacting to Tuesday's judgment, border security minister Dame Angela Eagle said the government will \"continue working with local authorities and communities to address legitimate concerns\". She added: \"Our work continues to close all asylum hotels by the end of this parliament.\" 'A victory for mums and dads' Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called the outcome of the case \"a victory for the mums and dads I spoke to in Epping who just want their children to be safe\". In a message posted on X, she said: \"Putting a hotel full of young male illegal immigrants in the middle of a community like Epping was always going to lead to issues. They need to be moved out of the area immediately.\" Read more on Sky News:Flight attendant 'four times over limit'Councillor jailed for sexually abusing girlFirst British Sikh to manage English club Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, said hotels \"cost the taxpayer billions, trap people in limbo and are flashpoints in communities\". He urged ministers to \"partner with local councils to provide safe, cost-effective accommodation within communities\". A further hearing on whether the injunction should be made permanent is expected to be held at a later date, and is expected to last two days."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  \"It's an interesting moment,\" was how one government source described the High Court ruling that will force an Essex hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers within weeks. That may prove to be the understatement of the summer. For clues as to why, just take a glance at what the Home Office's own lawyer told the court on Tuesday. Granting the injunction \"runs the risk of acting as an impetus for further violent protests\", the barrister said - pointing out that similar legal claims by other councils would \"aggravate pressures on the asylum estate\". Right on cue and just hours after the ruling came in, Broxbourne Council - over the border in Hertfordshire - posted online that it was urgently seeking legal advice with a view to taking similar court action. The risks here are clear. Recent figures show just over 30,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels across the country. If they start to empty out following a string of court claims, the Home Office will struggle to find alternative options. After all, they are only in hotels because of a lack of other types of accommodation. There are several caveats though. This is just an interim injunction that will be heard in full in the autumn. So the court could swing back in favour of the hotel chain - and by extension the Home Office. Read more:Who says what on asylum hotels? We have been here before Remember, this isn't the first legal claim of this kind. Other councils have tried to leverage the power of the courts to shut down asylum hotels, with varying degrees of success. In 2022, Ipswich Borough Council failed to get an extension to an interim injunction to prevent migrants being sent to a Novotel in the town. As in Epping, lawyers argued there had been a change in use under planning rules. But the judge eventually decided that the legal duty the Home Office has to provide accommodation for asylum seekers was more important. So there may not be a direct read across from this case to other councils. Home Office officials are emphasising this injunction was won on the grounds of planning laws rather than national issues such as public order, and as such, each case will be different. Failing Labour approach or Tory tricks? But government sources also smell dirty tricks from Epping Council and are suggesting that the Tory-led local authority made the legal claim for political reasons. Pointing to the presence of several prominent Tory MPs in the Essex area - as well as the threat posed by Reform in the county - the question being posed is why this legal challenge was not brought when asylum seekers first started being sent to the hotel in 2020 during the Conservatives' time in government. Epping Council would no doubt reject that and say recent disorder prompted them to act. But that won't stop the Tories and Reform of seizing on this as evidence of a failing approach from Labour. So there are political risks for the government, yes, but it's the practicalities that could flow from this ruling that pose the bigger danger."

        "Content": "Children who vape are three times more likely to go on to be smokers, according to new analysis which linked youth vaping to a series of health issues. Vapers were not only more likely to smoke later in life, but they were also more likely to smoke more frequently and intensely, according to experts from the University of York and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The researchers analysed 56 reviews on 384 studies on youth vaping in an umbrella review, with some 21 of these reviews looking at the use of e-cigarettes in young people and later cigarette smoking. The largest global review on vaping in young people also discovered that there is an increased risk of respiratory illnesses, like asthma or asthma exacerbation, and substance abuse, including drinking and marijuana use. The study also suggested there are links between youth vaping and pneumonia, bronchitis, lower total sperm counts, dizziness, headaches, and migraines. A link between depression and suicidal thoughts among young vapers was also identified.  Consistent evidence The data available \"consistently indicated a significant association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people\", the researchers wrote in the journal Tobacco Control. The authors said it was difficult to \"infer causality\" from their review, but said the \"repeated strong associations in prospective cohort studies are consistent with a causal relationship\". \"The consistency in the evidence is striking,\" Dr Su Golder, associate professor in health science at the University of York, said. \"Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.\" Dr Greg Hartwell, clinical assistant professor at LSHTM said the review showed \"exactly why further restrictions on the tobacco industry [...] are so important\".

The crackdown on the disposable devices, also known as single-use vapes, was introduced in the hopes of making vapes less accessible to children, as statistics show a growing popularity among those aged 11 to 15. NHS figures from last year showed nearly a quarter of children in that age bracket had tried vaping, and nearly one in 10 did it frequently. The ban applies both in shops and online for sales across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Reusable vapes can still be sold. Commenting on the study, Jamie Strachan, operations director at vape retailer VPZ, said vaping \"should never be marketed to, sold to, or used by children and non-smokers\". \"VPZ supports strict regulation that prevents under-18s from obtaining vaping products,\" he added. Dr James Murphy, director of science and research at British American Tobacco (BAT), claimed there was \"little evidence that vaping is a gateway to smoking\". \"Smart regulation that gives adults access to better alternatives, while enforcing high standards and preventing underage use, is vital to achieving the UK's smoke-free goal,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        One of Britain's most legendary TV dramatists, Sir Phil Redmond, is no stranger to tackling difficult issues on screen. Courting controversy famously with his hard-hitting storylines on his children's show Grange Hill for the BBC in 1978, before he switched over to Channel 4 to give it its two most prominent soaps, Brookside (1982) and later Hollyoaks (1995). He's been a pivotal figure at Channel 4 from its inception, widely considered to be a father to the channel. While he's been responsible for putting some of TV's most impactful storylines to air for them - from the first lesbian kiss, to bodies buried under patios - off-screen nowadays, he's equally radical about what should happen. \"Channel 4's job in 1980 was to provide a platform for the voices, ideas, and people that weren't able to break through into television. They did a fantastic job. I was part of that, and now it's done.\" It's not that he wants to kill off Channel 4 but - as broadcasting bosses gather for Edinburgh's annual TV Festival - he believes they urgently should be talking about mergers. A suggestion which goes down about as well as you might imagine, he says, when he brings it up with those at the top. He laughs: \"The people with the brains think it's a good idea, the people who've got the expense accounts think it's horrendous.\" A 'struggling' BBC trying to 'survive' With charter renewal talks under way to determine the BBC's future funding, Sir Phil says \"there's only one question, and that is what's going to happen to the BBC?\" \"We've got two public sector broadcasters - the BBC and Channel 4 - both owned by the government, by us as the taxpayers, and what they're trying to do now is survive, right? \"No bureaucracy ever deconstructs itselfâ€¦ the BBC is strugglingâ€¦ Channel 4 has got about a billion quid coming in a year. If you mix that, all the transmissions, all the back office stuff, all the technical stuff, all that cashâ€¦ you can keep that kind of coterie of expertise on youth programming and then say 'don't worry about the money, just go out and do what you used to do, upset people!'.\" How feasible would that be? Redmond claims, practically, you could pull it off in a week - \"we could do it now, it's very simple, it's all about keyboards and switches\". But the screenwriter admits that winning people over mentally to his way of thinking would take a few years of persuading. As for his thoughts on what could replace the BBC licence fee, he says charging people to download BBC apps on their phones seems like an obvious source of income. \"There are 25 million licences and roughly 90 million mobile phones. If you put a small levy on each mobile phone, you could reduce the actual cost of the licence fee right down, and then it could just be tagged on to VAT. \"Those parts are just moving the tax system around a bit. [then] you wouldn't have to worry about all the criminality and single mothers being thrown in jail, all this kind of nonsense.\" 'Subsidising through streaming is not the answer' Earlier this year, Peter Kosminsky, the director of historical drama Wolf Hall, suggested a levy on UK streaming revenues could fund more high-end British TV on the BBC. Sir Phil describes that as \"a sign of desperation\". \"If you can't actually survive within your own economic basis, you shouldn't be doing it. \"I don't think top slicing or subsidising one aspect of the business is the answer, you have to just look at the whole thing as a totality.\" Since selling his production company, Mersey Television, two decades ago, much of his current work has focused on acting as an ambassador for the culture and creative industries. Although he's taken a step away from television, he admits he's disappointed by how risk-averse programme makers appear to have become. \"Dare I say it? There needs to be an intellectual foundation to it all.\" TV's 'missing a trick' He believes TV bosses are too scared of being fined by Ofcom, and that's meant soaps are not going as far as they should. \"The benefits [system], you know, immigration, all these things are really relevant subjects for drama to bring out all the arguments, the conflicts. \"The majority of the people know the benefits system is broken, that it needs to be fixed because they see themselves living on their estate with a 10 or 12-year-old car and then there's someone else down the road who knows how to fill a form in, and he's driving around in a Â£65k BMW, right? Those debates would be really great to bring out on TV, they're missing a trick.\" While some of TV's biggest executives are slated to speak at the Edinburgh Television Festival, Redmond is not convinced they will be open to listening. \"They will go where the perceived wisdom is as to where the industry is going. The fact that the industry is taking a wrong turn, we really need somebody else to come along and go 'Oi!'\" When I ask if that could be him, he laughs. Cue dramatic music and closing credits. As plot twists go, the idea of one of TV's most radical voices making a boardroom comeback to stir the pot, realistic or not, is at the very least food for thought for the industry. Edinburgh TV Festival runs from 19 - 22 August."

The highly anticipated reunion was announced in August last year, after the brothers seemingly put the feud which led to their split in 2009 behind them. At the time, Noel said he \"simply could not go on working with Liam\", but having just completed the UK-leg of their comeback tour, he has nothing but praise for his younger sibling. \"Liam's smashing it. I'm proud of him,\" Noel told talkSport in his first interview since the tour began. \"I couldn't do the stadium thing like he does it, it's not in my nature. But I've got to say, I kind of look and I think 'good for you, mate'. He's been amazing. \"It's great just to be back with Bonehead [Paul Arthurs] and Liam and just be doing it again.\"  When asked if he has felt emotional during the tour, Noel added: \"I guess when it's all said and done we will sit and reflect on it, but it's great being back in the band with Liam, I forgot how funny he was.\" He went on to say he was \"completely blown away\" after the band's opening night in Cardiff, and \"grossly underestimated\" what he was getting himself into when first signing up for the shows. He said: \"It was kind of after about five minutes, I was like, 'all right, can I just go back to the dressing room and start this again?' \"I've done stadiums before and all that, but I don't mind telling you, my legs had turned to jelly after about halfway through the second song.\" \"Every night is the crowd's first night, you know what I mean?\" he continued. \"So every night's got that kind of same energy to it, but it's been truly amazing.

        "Headline": "The government says the asylum system is under \"unprecedented strain\", while protesters claim their communities are suffering, but a new High Court ruling could affect thousands of migrants being housed in hotels.",
        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n        For the second summer in a row, \"asylum hotels\" have become a flashpoint of protest, with some turning violent. The government has said the asylum system is under \"unprecedented strain\", forcing it to use hotels to accommodate migrants. Meanwhile, the number of asylum seekers crossing the Channel has surpassed 50,000 since Labour came to power and has reached 27,881 in the year to 14 August. Sky News looks at the numbers, why housing migrants has become such a fraught topic, when the practice could end, and a legal ruling in Essex which is set to bring further challenges to asylum seekers living in certain hotels.  How many hotels are being used for asylum seekers? The Home Office says fewer than 210 hotels are now being used to house asylum seekers, down from more than 400 in the summer of 2023. According to the latest available data, 32,345 asylum seekers were being housed in hotels at the end of March 2025 - 31% of the 103,684 asylum seekers receiving accommodation support in the UK at the time. That figure was up from 29,585 at the end of June 2024, just before Labour came into office, but down from the end of 2024, when 38,079 asylum seekers were in hotels according to the Refugee Council. March's figure is also down 42% from the peak of 56,042 at the end of September 2023. The data from March shows London was by far the most common place for asylum seekers to be housed in hotels, with 12,024 in the capital, followed by the South East with 3,738, the West Midlands with 3,306 and the North West with 3,167. Why are hotels being used? When people arrive in the UK and apply for asylum, saying they want to stay as a refugee because it would be unsafe for them to return to their own country, they can access emergency temporary accommodation if they have no other way of supporting themselves. Rising Channel crossings mean more of those applications. Asylum seekers need initial accommodation while they wait for their case to be processed, and that is when a hostel or hotel is commonly used. As part of the government's system, asylum seekers are supposed to move swiftly from initial accommodation to longer-term temporary accommodation, such as shared houses or flats. But with a lot of arrivals and a big processing backlog, they are spending longer in hotels, which are often more expensive than other accommodation. The government says the needs of people already in the UK and on long housing waiting lists are another factor in keeping migrants in hotels instead of other accommodation. Why are people protesting? There have been demonstrations outside asylum hotels in recent years by anti-immigration protesters, often met with counter-protests. Many of the protesters have voiced safety concerns for their communities and discontent with the high costs of hotel accommodation, while counter-protesters express support for migrant rights. Epping has been a flashpoint, with multiple protests, initially sparked when an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault after allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Since the disorder broke out, Essex Police said more than a dozen people have been charged in connection with the demonstrations, which included counter-protests from Stand Up To Racism. But the local council has now been granted a temporary injunction blocking migrants from being housed at a hotel there.  It has triggered the potential for more councils, including those controlled by Reform UK, to follow suit. One of the most notorious protests was at the Holiday Inn Express hotel in Rotherham in August last year, when rioters smashed its windows and started fires outside. More recently, there have been protests outside asylum hotels in Altrincham near Manchester, Norwich, Islington and Canary Wharf in London and Epping Forest in Essex.  What is it like for asylum seekers in hotels? Initial accommodation for asylum seekers can be full-board, half-board, or self-catering. They are not given a choice on where they stay. If they are in catered accommodation such as hotels, they are provided with three meals a day and essential personal hygiene items and toiletries, and receive a \"personal allowance\" of Â£9.95 a week. In self-catered accommodation, each person gets Â£49.18 a week loaded onto a payment card, to cover food and other essentials. This government support lasts until the person's asylum claim has been processed. Read more from Sky News:Clampdown on ads for crossingsBadenoch wants migrants in campsAnti-migrant protests in Norwich Campaigners for asylum seekers' rights, such as Migrant Voice, have spoken out against the use of hotels, claiming they often provide inadequate living conditions and a lack of privacy and security, as many are targeted by protesters. When will hotels stop being used for asylum seekers? The government has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, in 2029, a move Chancellor Rachel Reeves has claimed will save Â£1bn a year. Ministers say they inherited a \"broken system\", with 400 hotels being used to accommodate asylum seekers at the peak of the crisis under the Tories. In July, the government said some migrants were \"gaming the system\" by resisting efforts to move them into alternative housing without a valid reason. It said a new policy meant housing support would be removed from those who block transfer requests, and that they risked becoming homeless while waiting for their asylum cases to be processed.  A government spokesperson told Sky News: \"Since taking office, we have taken immediate action to fix the asylum system and have started closing down hotels and returning more than 35,000 people with no right to be here. \"From over 400 asylum hotels open in summer 2023, costing almost Â£9ma day, there are now less than 210, and we want them all closed by the end of this parliament. \"We will continue to work closely with community partners across the country, and discuss any concerns they have, as we look to fix this broken system together.\" The government said the cost of asylum hotels was reduced from an average of Â£8.3m per day in 2023/24 to Â£5.77m per day in 2024/25. A \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme between the UK and France has now come into force, allowing the UK to send some people who have crossed the Channel back to France immediately in exchange for asylum seekers with ties to the UK, who are considered more likely to have a successful asylum claim."

Lindsay and Craig Foreman were seized in Kerman, in central Iran, in early January while on a round-the-world motorbike trip. Their family say they strongly deny any wrongdoing. Their son, Joe Bennett, told Sky News the pair, from East Sussex, had been separated from the prison where they were staying together and moved to different jails in the Tehran area. \"Craig's been moved now to Evin prison... which many people will recognise the name of, renowned as one of the harshest prisons, if not the harshest in Iran. \"It heightened our concerns because... the reports are damning... multiple people to a cell, overcrowding.

Geneva, Switzerland, is considered the best option, with Rome or the Vatican disliked by the Russians and Budapest, Hungary, not favoured by the Ukrainians. European allies are understood to want security guarantees to be defined before the meeting. A NATO-like treaty, guaranteeing Ukraine's allies would come to its defence in case of any future Russian attack, is being worked on and could be completed by next week.

        "Content": "By Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor in Ukraine   Ukrainians have given a lukewarm reaction to this week's White House summit. There is bafflement and unease here after US President Donald Trump switched sides to support his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, dropping calls for a ceasefire and proposing that Ukraine surrender territory. While allies are talking up the prospects of progress, people here remain unconvinced. Ukraine war latest - Trump rules out using US troops  The Trump administration's contradictory statements on possible security guarantees are causing concern here. MP Lesia Vasylenko told Sky News it is not at all clear what the allies have in mind. \"Who is going to be there backing Ukraine in case Russia decides to revisit their imperialistic plans and strategies and in case they want to restart this war of aggression?\" For many Ukrainians, there is a troubling sense of deja vu.  In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to give up not land but its nuclear arsenal, inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for security assurances from Russia and other powers. They know how that ended up to their enormous cost. Putin reneged on Russia's side of the bargain, with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and once again with his full-scale attack three and a half years ago. We met veteran Ukrainian diplomat Yuri Kostenko, who helped lead those negotiations in the 90s. He said there is a danger the world makes the same mistake and trusts Vladimir Putin when he says he wants to stop the killing, something Mr Trump said he now believes. ðŸ‘‰â€¯Listen to Sky Newsâ€¯Dailyâ€¯on your podcast appâ€¯ðŸ‘ˆâ€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ â€¯ \"It's not true, it's not true, Russia never, never, it's my practices in more than 30 years, Russia never stop their aggression plans to occupy all Ukraine and I think that Mr Trump, if he really believes Mr Putin, it will be a very big mistake, Mr Trump, a very big mistake.\" Before the Alaska summit, allies agreed the best path to peace was forcing Mr Putin to stop his invasion, hitting him where it hurts with severe sanctions on his oil trade. But Mr Trump has given up calls for a ceasefire and withdrawn threats to impose those tougher sanctions. Instead, he has led allies down a different and more uncertain path.

Russia is continuing hundreds of drone attacks every night, and its forces are advancing on the front. If Vladimir Putin really wants this war to end, he's showing no sign of it, while Ukrainians fear Donald Trump is taking allies down a blind alley of fruitless diplomacy."

As all eyes moved from Donald Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, the White House claimed Russia has agreed to the US providing 'NATO-style protection' when the fighting ends. Trump rules out US troops in Ukraine; latest updates Although there has been no confirmation from the Kremlin, Ukraine, the UK, and other Western allies say details of a post-war security agreement will be finalised in the coming days. What has been said so far? Security guarantees have long been talked about as a way of ensuring peace in Ukraine when fighting comes to an end. Since March, when the UK and France spearheaded a largely European 'coalition of the willing' and potential peacekeeping force, many have claimed it would be ineffective without American backing. The US has repeatedly refused to be drawn on its involvement - until now. Two days after Mr Putin travelled to Alaska for talks with the Trump team, US special envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Russia had agreed to Ukrainian security guarantees. He claimed that during the summit, the Kremlin had conceded the US \"could offer Article-5 like protection\", which he described as \"game-changing\". Article 5 is one of the founding principles of NATO and states that an attack on any of its 32 member states is considered an attack on them all. This was bolstered by the US president himself after he met his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington on Monday. He said the pair had \"discussed security guarantees\", which would be \"provided by the various European countries\" - \"with coordination with the United States of America\". Writing on X the following day, the Ukrainian leader said the \"concrete content\" of the security agreement would be \"formalised on paper within the next 10 days\". US reports say security agreement talks will be headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  What would security guarantees look like? Very few details have emerged so far, despite the series of high-profile meetings. Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Mr Trump said European nations are going to \"frontload\" the security agreement with soldiers. \"They want to have boots on the ground\", he told the broadcaster, referring to the UK, France, and Germany in particular. He insisted the US would not send ground troops, adding: \"You have my assurance and I'm president.\" Sir Keir Starmer said the coalition of the willing is \"preparing for the deployment of a reassurance force\" in the event of \"hostilities ending\". This was the original basis for the coalition - soldiers from various European and allied nations placed strategically across Ukraine to deter Russia from launching future attacks. But troops alone are unlikely to be enough of a deterrent for Vladimir Putin, military analyst Sean Bell says. \"This is all about credibility and I don't think boots on the ground is a credible answer,\" he tells Sky News. Stationing soldiers along Ukraine's 1,000-mile border with Russia would require around 100,000 soldiers at a time, which would have to be trained, deployed, and rotated, requiring 300,000 in total. The entire UK Army would only make up 10% of that, with France likely able to contribute a further 10%, Bell says. Several European nations would feel unable to sacrifice any troops for an umbrella force due to their proximity to Ukraine and risk of further Russian aggression. \"You're not even close to getting the numbers you need,\" Bell adds. \"And even if you could, putting all of NATO's frontline forces in one country facing Russia would be really dangerous - and leave China, North Korea, Iran, or Russia free to do whatever they wanted.\" Current proposals for Ukrainian security guarantees are far from the first. In December 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum alongside the UK, US, and Russia. The Ukrainians agreed to give up their Soviet-inherited nuclear weapons in exchange for recognition of their sovereignty and a place on the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Twenty years later in 2014, however, Russia violated the terms with its illegal annexation of Crimea and the war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian in the Donbas region. Similarly, the Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015 were designed to bring an end to the Donbas war. Mediated by France and Germany, they promised a ceasefire, withdrawal of weapons, and local elections in the separatist-occupied Donbas, but were repeatedly violated and failed to result in lasting peace. 'Article 5-like protection' When Mr Witkoff first mentioned security guarantees again, he described them as \"Article 5-like\" or \"NATO-style\". Article 5 is one of the founding principles of NATO and states that an attack on any of its 32 member states is considered an attack on them all. It has only ever been invoked once since its inception in 1949 - by the US in response to the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Russia has repeatedly insisted Ukraine should not be allowed to join NATO and cited the risk of it happening among its original reasons for attacking Kyiv in 2022. NATO general-secretary Mark Rutte has said Ukrainian membership is not on the table, but that an alternative \"Article 5-type\" arrangement could be viable. The alliance's military leaders are due to meet on Wednesday to discuss options. It is not clear how such a special security agreement and formal NATO membership would differ. Bell says that negotiations on this - and any surrendering of Ukrainian territory - will be the two most difficult in ending the war. But he stresses they are both key in providing the \"flesh on the bones\" to what the coalition of the willing has offered so far. \"It will be about trying to find things that make the Western commitment to the security of Ukraine enduring,\" Bell adds. US airpower, intelligence and a better Ukrainian military Other potential options for a security agreement include air support, a no-maritime zone, intelligence sharing, and military supplies. Imposing either a no-fly over Ukraine or no-maritime zone across the Black Sea would \"play to NATO's strengths\" - as US air and naval capabilities alone far outstrip Russia's, Bell says. Sharing American intelligence with Kyiv to warn of any future Russian aggression would also be a \"massive strength\" to any potential deterrence force, he adds. Ukraine is already offering to buy an extra $90bn (Â£66.6bn) in US weapons with the help of European funds, Mr Zelenskyy said this week. And any security agreement would likely extend to other military equipment, logistics, and training to help Ukraine better defend itself years down the line, Bell says. \"At first it would need credible Western support, but over time, you would hope the international community makes sure Ukraine can build its own indigenous capability. \"Because while there's a lot of focus on Ukraine at the moment, in five years' time, there will be different governments and different priorities - so that has to endure.\""

        "Content": "By Ben van der Merwe, digital investigations journalist, and Sam Doak, OSINT producer  Thousands have fled parts of Gaza City in recent days amid airstrikes and advancing Israeli troops, new satellite imagery shows.  Israel's advance comes as it prepares to mount a full-scale invasion of the city, where the UN says around one million Palestinians are sheltering. Satellite imagery shows that entire tent camps in southeast Gaza City were emptied between 9 and 17 August as families fled the renewed attacks. The video below shows the moment of an airstrike in southeastern Gaza City on 13 August. Sky News geolocated the footage to a building less than 200 metres from a major tent camp. Another video, taken on 15 August, shows a strike on a building right next to the camp. By the following day, almost all the camp's residents had fled, along with people sheltering at 30 other locations in the area. Fresh vehicle tracks in the area indicate extensive troop movements on the ground. The satellite image below, taken on 17 August, shows at least nine military vehicles in the streets surrounding one former tent camp. Sky News counted 58 military vehicles in the area on 17 August, including 17 bulldozers. The image below shows four IDF vehicles, including a bulldozer, parked next to the remains of one tent camp. Several nearby buildings had been levelled in the days beforehand. Between 9 and 17 August, at least 132 buildings were destroyed in less than one square kilometre of the city. It's unclear how much of the destruction was carried out by IDF bulldozers and how much was a result of airstrikes. On Monday, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli tanks had made further advances into eastern Gaza City. The advances came as Hamas said it had approved a ceasefire deal presented by mediators Egypt and Qatar. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed his country's military to prepare for a full-scale invasion and occupation of the city in order to \"free Gaza from Hamas\". The UN has said that the invasion risks \"catastrophic consequences\" for the estimated one million Palestinians sheltering in the city, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the plan would \"only bring more bloodshed\".

        "Content": " One of Sweden's most famous wooden churches is being moved to a new site - to prevent it from being swallowed by the world's largest underground iron-ore mine. The Kiruna Church, called Kiruna Kyrka in Swedish, and its belfry, are being moved this week along a three-mile route east to a new city centre. They are the latest buildings to be moved from the current location of Kiruna - Sweden's northernmost city, which is around 124 miles inside the Arctic Circle. The city has a population of around 23,000 people, including members of the Indigenous Sami community, living across an area of nearly 7,528 square miles.  This week, thousands of visitors have descended upon the city to watch and take part in the moving of the church. The church's vicar, Lena Tjarnberg, kicked off the move with a blessing on Tuesday morning. The move is expected to take until Wednesday afternoon. The relocation of the church has become a meticulously planned two-day media event, organised by LKAB, the state-owned mining company, and highlighted by an appearance from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf. It will feature a music show, including a performance by KAJ, Sweden's 2025 Eurovision representative, who had been the bookmakers' top pick to win this year's competition, but finished fourth behind Austria, Israel and Estonia. Stefan Holmblad Johansson, LKAB's project manager for the move, would not say how much the move had cost the mining company. Famous for its Midnight Sun and Northern Lights, Kiruna and its surrounding region attract visitors to Swedish Lapland throughout the entire year. The move of Kiruna's centre, including the church, has been in the works since 2004. As the nearby mine expanded deeper underground, residents began seeing cracks in buildings and roads. In order to reach a new depth of 1,365 meters (4,478 feet) - and to prevent Kiruna from being swallowed up - officials began moving buildings to a new downtown at a safe distance from the mine. As of July, 25 buildings had been lifted onto beams and wheeled east. Sixteen, including the church, remain. The Sami reindeer herding organisations in Kiruna have warned that a new mine could threaten reindeer migration routes and imperil the livelihood of herders in the area."

The man, whose name has not officially been released in keeping with Germany's privacy rules, but who has previously been referred to as Taleb A, arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Prosecutors claim he aimed to kill as many people as possible and had spent several weeks planning the attack, which was carried out with a rented BMW, which reached speeds of up to 30mph (48kph). Officials state he was not under the influence of alcohol and allege the attack was motivated \"out of dissatisfaction and frustration with the course and outcome of a civil law dispute and the failure of various criminal complaints.\" The youngest victim was nine-year-old Andre Gleissner, while the five women who died were aged between 45 and 75. Officials have said the suspect does not fit the usual profile of an extremist, but previously said he was flagged as a potential threat, including by Saudi authorities. He described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and on social media expressed support for the far-right.

Her attacker, Momade Jussab, of Swinfield Close, Feltham, was arrested on arrival at Gatwick.

Kelly said: \"I do not understand why I, and other victims like me, have been excluded from the CIC Scheme. \"I was attacked on a flight en route to the UK, I am a UK citizen, and this crime was investigated and prosecuted by British authorities. \"I should be entitled to compensation, and being excluded from the scheme is unfair and illogical. \"I am still suffering with the effects of the attack and want to move forward with my life.\" The Civil Aviation Act was updated in 1996 to ensure criminal acts on foreign planes bound for the UK can be prosecuted in UK criminal courts.

The satellite, spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope, does not have a name yet and has been designated S/2025 U1. First spotted on 2 February by the space-bound telescope, it measures roughly six miles (10km) in diameter and joins 28 other known moons orbiting the icy giant. Maryame El Moutamid, from the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado and lead investigator on the project to study the rings and moons of Uranus, believes its tiny size is likely to be the reason why it has been invisible to telescopes until now. \"It's a small moon but a significant discovery, which is something that even NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft didn't see during its flyby nearly 40 years ago,\" she said. \"No other planet has as many small inner moons as Uranus,\" said Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, a member of the research team.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has said American troops will not be sent to Ukraine, but the US may provide air support as part of a peace deal with Russia. A day after his extraordinary White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the leaders of Kyiv's European allies, the US president told Fox News \"when it comes to security, [Europeans] are willing to put people on the ground. We're willing to help them with things, especially, probably, by air\". Ukraine war - follow the latest developments Mr Trump did not elaborate, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters US air support was \"an option and a possibility\". She said the US president \"has definitively stated US boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies\". Air support could take many forms, including missile defence systems or fighter jets enforcing a no-fly zone - and it's not clear what role the US would play under any proposed peace deal.  Zelenskyy-Putin summit It comes as planning for a possible Zelenskyy-Putin summit get under way. Talks between the Ukrainian and Russian president are seen by Mr Trump as vital to ending the war. Sky News understands a meeting could happen before the end of the month, with Geneva, Vienna, Rome, Budapest, and Doha among the venues being considered. Geneva, Switzerland, is considered the best option, with Rome or the Vatican disliked by the Russians and Budapest, Hungary, not favoured by the Ukrainians. European allies are understood to want security guarantees to be defined before the meeting. A NATO-like treaty, guaranteeing Ukraine's allies would come to its defence in case of any future Russian attack, is being worked on and could be completed by next week. Like the US, Sky News understands Italy is opposed to putting boots on the ground in Ukraine. But EU diplomats are confident this is the best chance yet to stop the war, and allies could return to Washington in early September to celebrate any deal being struck.

        "Content": " Promises of security guarantees for Ukraine have been lauded as \"game-changing\" and \"historic\" in the hope of bringing an end to the war with Russia. As all eyes moved from Donald Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, the White House claimed Russia has agreed to the US providing 'NATO-style protection' when the fighting ends. Trump rules out US troops in Ukraine; latest updates Although there has been no confirmation from the Kremlin, Ukraine, the UK, and other Western allies say details of a post-war security agreement will be finalised in the coming days. What has been said so far? Security guarantees have long been talked about as a way of ensuring peace in Ukraine when fighting comes to an end. Since March, when the UK and France spearheaded a largely European 'coalition of the willing' and potential peacekeeping force, many have claimed it would be ineffective without American backing. The US has repeatedly refused to be drawn on its involvement - until now. Two days after Mr Putin travelled to Alaska for talks with the Trump team, US special envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Russia had agreed to Ukrainian security guarantees. He claimed that during the summit, the Kremlin had conceded the US \"could offer Article-5 like protection\", which he described as \"game-changing\". Article 5 is one of the founding principles of NATO and states that an attack on any of its 32 member states is considered an attack on them all. This was bolstered by the US president himself after he met his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington on Monday. He said the pair had \"discussed security guarantees\", which would be \"provided by the various European countries\" - \"with coordination with the United States of America\". Writing on X the following day, the Ukrainian leader said the \"concrete content\" of the security agreement would be \"formalised on paper within the next 10 days\". US reports say security agreement talks will be headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  What would security guarantees look like? Very few details have emerged so far, despite the series of high-profile meetings. Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Mr Trump said European nations are going to \"frontload\" the security agreement with soldiers. \"They want to have boots on the ground\", he told the broadcaster, referring to the UK, France, and Germany in particular. He insisted the US would not send ground troops, adding: \"You have my assurance and I'm president.\" Sir Keir Starmer said the coalition of the willing is \"preparing for the deployment of a reassurance force\" in the event of \"hostilities ending\". This was the original basis for the coalition - soldiers from various European and allied nations placed strategically across Ukraine to deter Russia from launching future attacks. But troops alone are unlikely to be enough of a deterrent for Vladimir Putin, military analyst Sean Bell says. \"This is all about credibility and I don't think boots on the ground is a credible answer,\" he tells Sky News. Stationing soldiers along Ukraine's 1,000-mile border with Russia would require around 100,000 soldiers at a time, which would have to be trained, deployed, and rotated, requiring 300,000 in total. The entire UK Army would only make up 10% of that, with France likely able to contribute a further 10%, Bell says. Several European nations would feel unable to sacrifice any troops for an umbrella force due to their proximity to Ukraine and risk of further Russian aggression. \"You're not even close to getting the numbers you need,\" Bell adds. \"And even if you could, putting all of NATO's frontline forces in one country facing Russia would be really dangerous - and leave China, North Korea, Iran, or Russia free to do whatever they wanted.\" Current proposals for Ukrainian security guarantees are far from the first. In December 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum alongside the UK, US, and Russia. The Ukrainians agreed to give up their Soviet-inherited nuclear weapons in exchange for recognition of their sovereignty and a place on the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Twenty years later in 2014, however, Russia violated the terms with its illegal annexation of Crimea and the war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian in the Donbas region. Similarly, the Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015 were designed to bring an end to the Donbas war. Mediated by France and Germany, they promised a ceasefire, withdrawal of weapons, and local elections in the separatist-occupied Donbas, but were repeatedly violated and failed to result in lasting peace. 'Article 5-like protection' When Mr Witkoff first mentioned security guarantees again, he described them as \"Article 5-like\" or \"NATO-style\". Article 5 is one of the founding principles of NATO and states that an attack on any of its 32 member states is considered an attack on them all. It has only ever been invoked once since its inception in 1949 - by the US in response to the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Russia has repeatedly insisted Ukraine should not be allowed to join NATO and cited the risk of it happening among its original reasons for attacking Kyiv in 2022. NATO general-secretary Mark Rutte has said Ukrainian membership is not on the table, but that an alternative \"Article 5-type\" arrangement could be viable. The alliance's military leaders are due to meet on Wednesday to discuss options. It is not clear how such a special security agreement and formal NATO membership would differ. Bell says that negotiations on this - and any surrendering of Ukrainian territory - will be the two most difficult in ending the war. But he stresses they are both key in providing the \"flesh on the bones\" to what the coalition of the willing has offered so far. \"It will be about trying to find things that make the Western commitment to the security of Ukraine enduring,\" Bell adds. US airpower, intelligence and a better Ukrainian military Other potential options for a security agreement include air support, a no-maritime zone, intelligence sharing, and military supplies. Imposing either a no-fly over Ukraine or no-maritime zone across the Black Sea would \"play to NATO's strengths\" - as US air and naval capabilities alone far outstrip Russia's, Bell says. Sharing American intelligence with Kyiv to warn of any future Russian aggression would also be a \"massive strength\" to any potential deterrence force, he adds. Ukraine is already offering to buy an extra $90bn (Â£66.6bn) in US weapons with the help of European funds, Mr Zelenskyy said this week. And any security agreement would likely extend to other military equipment, logistics, and training to help Ukraine better defend itself years down the line, Bell says. \"At first it would need credible Western support, but over time, you would hope the international community makes sure Ukraine can build its own indigenous capability. \"Because while there's a lot of focus on Ukraine at the moment, in five years' time, there will be different governments and different priorities - so that has to endure.\""

        "Content": "By Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor in Ukraine   Ukrainians have given a lukewarm reaction to this week's White House summit. There is bafflement and unease here after US President Donald Trump switched sides to support his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, dropping calls for a ceasefire and proposing that Ukraine surrender territory. While allies are talking up the prospects of progress, people here remain unconvinced. Ukraine war latest - Trump rules out using US troops  The Trump administration's contradictory statements on possible security guarantees are causing concern here. MP Lesia Vasylenko told Sky News it is not at all clear what the allies have in mind. \"Who is going to be there backing Ukraine in case Russia decides to revisit their imperialistic plans and strategies and in case they want to restart this war of aggression?\" For many Ukrainians, there is a troubling sense of deja vu.  In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to give up not land but its nuclear arsenal, inherited from the Soviet Union, in return for security assurances from Russia and other powers. They know how that ended up to their enormous cost. Putin reneged on Russia's side of the bargain, with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and once again with his full-scale attack three and a half years ago. We met veteran Ukrainian diplomat Yuri Kostenko, who helped lead those negotiations in the 90s. He said there is a danger the world makes the same mistake and trusts Vladimir Putin when he says he wants to stop the killing, something Mr Trump said he now believes. ðŸ‘‰â€¯Listen to Sky Newsâ€¯Dailyâ€¯on your podcast appâ€¯ðŸ‘ˆâ€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ â€¯ \"It's not true, it's not true, Russia never, never, it's my practices in more than 30 years, Russia never stop their aggression plans to occupy all Ukraine and I think that Mr Trump, if he really believes Mr Putin, it will be a very big mistake, Mr Trump, a very big mistake.\" Before the Alaska summit, allies agreed the best path to peace was forcing Mr Putin to stop his invasion, hitting him where it hurts with severe sanctions on his oil trade. But Mr Trump has given up calls for a ceasefire and withdrawn threats to impose those tougher sanctions. Instead, he has led allies down a different and more uncertain path.

Russia is continuing hundreds of drone attacks every night, and its forces are advancing on the front. If Vladimir Putin really wants this war to end, he's showing no sign of it, while Ukrainians fear Donald Trump is taking allies down a blind alley of fruitless diplomacy."

But on the face of it we are further away from peace now than we were two weeks ago. The consensus that was held back then was that Vladimir Putin would only relent under maximum pressure. He does not want slivers of territory. He wants the whole of Ukraine extinguished and absorbed into his greater Russia. Ukraine talks latest: Trump sets up Zelenskyy-Putin meeting  To stop him, allies agreed an immediate ceasefire was necessary, along with much more painful pressure, namely sanctions hitting his oil industry. Europeans and Republicans in Congress agree on that. Then Alaska and Donald Trump's U-turn. No ceasefire and no more severe sanctions. So less pressure. Yesterday's reality TV diplomatic circus in Washington has not shifted him on that stance, so he stays it seems now aligned with Mr Putin on those crucial points.  Making matters worse for Ukraine, allies seem to be accepting it will have to give up land taken by force. They sweeten the pill by saying of course only Ukraine can decide whether or not to cede territory, but there is now enormous pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to do so. ðŸ‘‰â€¯Listen to Sky Newsâ€¯Dailyâ€¯on your podcast appâ€¯ðŸ‘ˆâ€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ â€¯ In return there is nebulous and vague talk of security guarantees.

        "Content": "By Mickey Carroll, science and technology reporter and Tim Baker, political reporter   The UK government has dropped its demands to create a backdoor into Apple's encryption, according to the US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard. In a post on X in the early hours of Tuesday, Ms Gabbard said the UK had withdrawn its demand to access global Apple users' data if required. She wrote: \"The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.\" The US spy chief said it was the result of months of working closely with partners in the UK, US President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance. In February, there were reports the government had ordered Apple to create a way for UK security services to access its encrypted user data. Such orders, called Technical Capability Notices (TCN), are not public and legally, neither of the parties can publicly confirm their existence. Apple soon withdrew its \"advanced data protection\" feature for UK users, which offered end-to-end encryption for cloud data storage, meaning only the account holder could see any stored data.  Apple has not responded to a Sky News request for comment on Ms Gabbard's post. A UK government spokesperson told Sky News it does not comment on operational matters. They did say, however, that it had long had \"joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats\". \"Those arrangements have long contained safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example, the Data Access Agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting the data of each other's citizens,\" they said. \"We will continue to build on those arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe,\" they added.  When Apple withdrew its advanced data protection in February, a spokesperson said it had \"withdrawn the feature given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy\". The US government soon stepped in, with Ms Gabbard saying she had \"grave concerns\" about the UK or any other country \"requiring Apple or any company to create a 'backdoor' that would allow access to Americans' personal encrypted data\". She added: \"This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.\" She asked the CIA, NSA and multiple other US intelligence agencies to examine the reported TCN. Read more from technology:Backlash against new online safety rulesMusk's X wants 'significant' changes to OSA On Tuesday, civil rights groups cautiously welcomed Ms Gabbard's post. \"If true, this decision is hugely welcome,\" said Sam Grant, director of external relations at human rights organisation Liberty, who are challenging the government's use of the TCN in court. \"Creating any back door into our private data would be a reckless and potentially unlawful move from the government. \"As long as this power exists within the Investigatory Powers Act, it remains a risk that any future government might also try to use it to create a back door into other end-to-end encrypted services we all use. \"The safest thing for the UK Government to do is repeal this law, and commit to safeguarding our privacy by protecting end-to-end encryption.\" Open Rights Group executive director Jim Killock said: \"While the UK may have dropped its demands for Apple to backdoor all of its users across the globe, UK users may still be banned from benefiting from ADP encryption. \"And if Apple does restore ADP to UK users, there will be serious questions of trust. \"The UK's powers to attack encryption are still on the law books, and pose a serious risk to user security and protection against criminal abuse of our data.\""

Kayle Bates, 67, is to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison on Tuesday evening. Bates was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and attempted sexual battery in the killing of Janet White in Bay County on 14 June 1982. He abducted Ms White from the insurance office where she worked, took her into woodland behind the building and attempted to rape her, before stabbing her to death and tearing a diamond ring from one of her fingers, according to court documents. Florida carries out its executions using a three-drug lethal injection consisting of a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state's Department of Corrections. Bates' death warrant was signed by the state's Republican governor Ron DeSantis. Lawyers representing Bates have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court, as well as a federal lawsuit, claiming Mr DeSantis's process for signing death warrants is discriminatory. The federal lawsuit was dismissed last Tuesday. The Florida Supreme Court also denied Bates's pending claims on the same day, which included arguments that evidence of organic brain damage had been inadequately considered during his second penalty phase. The court ruled Bates has had three decades to raise the claims. A US Supreme Court decision on Bates's final appeal is still pending.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Energy bills are now expected to rise in autumn, a reversal from the previously anticipated price drop, a prominent forecaster has said. Households will be charged Â£17 more for a typical annual bill from October as the energy price cap is due to rise, according to consultants Cornwall Insight. In roughly six weeks, an average dual fuel bill will be Â£1,737 a year, Cornwall Insights predicted, 1% above the current price cap of Â£1,720 a year. The price cap limits the cost per unit of energy and is revised every three months by the energy regulator Ofgem. Bills had previously been forecast by the consultants to fall in October. Such an increase had not been anticipated until now. Why are bills getting more expensive? Charges are predicted to be introduced from October to fund government policies. Measures such as the expansion of the warm home discount, announced in June, will add roughly Â£15 to an average monthly bill. The discount will provide Â£150 in support to 2.7 million extra people this year, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 6 million. Volatile electricity and gas prices are also to blame for the forecast increase. Read more:Something odd is happening in the marketsRedundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plant Turbulent geopolitical events during Ofgem's observation period for determining the cap, including the unpredictability of US trade policy, have also had an impact, while Israel's airstrikes on Iran intensified concerns about disruption to gas shipments. Prices have eased, however, with British wholesale gas costs dropping to the lowest level in more than a year. Also helping to keep the possible bill rise relatively small is news from the European Parliament that rules on gas storage stocks for the winter would be eased. Bulk buying and storage of gas in warmer months helps eliminate pressure on supplies when demand is at its highest during cold snaps. When will bills go down? A small drop in bills is forecast for January, but it is subject to geopolitical movements, weather patterns and changes to policy costs. An extra charge, for example, could be added to support new nuclear generating capacity. The official Ofgem announcement will be made on 27 August."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The putative owners of The Daily Telegraph will take another step towards gaining control of the right-wing newspaper in the coming days when they formally notify Whitehall of their plans. Sky News has learnt that lawyers acting for RedBird Capital Partners, the US-based investor which will own a majority stake in the publisher if the deal is approved, could set out the company's proposals in a filing with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as soon as this week. The move would represent another step towards concluding the 27-month hiatus over the Telegraph's ownership - a period which began with Lloyds Banking Group forcing the newspaper's parent company into insolvency proceedings over outstanding loans owed by the Barclay family. Sources said that the notification by RedBird Capital's lawyers would pave the way for the lifting of an interim enforcement order (IEO) imposed by Lucy Frazer, the then Conservative culture secretary, in December 2023, which prevented the acquirers from exerting any control over the Telegraph. The removal of the IEO is likely to result in the DCMS issuing a new public interest intervention notice (PIIN), which would prompt investigations by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority into the Â£500m takeover. Last month, the House of Lords approved legislation to allow a UAE state-backed investor - IMI - to acquire a stake of up to 15% in the Telegraph as part of the RedBird deal. The takeover had originally been conceived as a joint endeavour between RedBird and IMI but was thwarted by political opposition to foreign state ownership of national newspapers. \n                  Billionaire Blavatnik courted to take Daily Telegraph stake\n                 \n                  Daily Mail chief to pay Â£35m for Telegraph stake\n                 \n                  Telegraph sale agreed 'in principle' after two-year ownership impasse\n                 IMI is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and ultimate owner of Manchester City Football Club. Other bidders tried to gatecrash the deal, with the field of rival contenders led by Dovid Efune, the owner of The New York Sun. Last month, his key backer - the hedge fund founder Jeremy Hosking - told Sky News their bid was \"ready to go\" if the RedBird-led transaction fell apart. Announcing its agreement to acquire the Daily and Sunday Telegraph titles in May, Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird Capital, said it marked the \"start of a new era\" for two of Britain's most prominent newspapers. However, it is nearly a month since the Lords voted to approve the legislation allowing IMI to own a minority stake, a verdict which prompted Mr Cardinale to say: \"With legislation now in place, we will move quickly and in the forthcoming days work with DCMS to progress to completion and implement new ownership for The Telegraph.\" Sources said the formal notification to Whitehall could come as soon as this week but could yet be delayed further. Senior Telegraph executives and journalists are said to be frustrated at the latest phase of the process. Sky News has already revealed that Sir Leonard Blavatnik, owner of the DAZN sports streaming platform, and Daily Mail proprietor Lord Rothermere are preparing to buy minority stakes as part of the RedBird-led transaction. RedBird said in May that it was \"in discussions with select UK-based minority investors with print media expertise and strong commitment to upholding the editorial values of the Telegraph\". The Telegraph titles' parent company was forced into insolvency proceedings in 2023 by Lloyds, which ran out of patience with the Barclay family, their long-standing owner. RedBird IMI, a joint venture between the two firms, paid Â£600m several months later to acquire a call option that was intended to convert into ownership of the Telegraph newspapers and The Spectator magazine. The Spectator was sold last year for Â£100m to Sir Paul Marshall, the hedge fund billionaire, who has installed Lord Gove, the former cabinet minister, as its editor. None of the parties involved in the Telegraph ownership situation would comment on Tuesday when contacted by Sky News."

The typical time spent making dinner dropped to just under 31 minutes, according to market research provider Worldpanel.

Reeves reportedly considering property tax   Changes in consumer behaviour were also seen over the summer, with a 6% decline in trips to casual and fast service restaurants. Bucking the trend were coffee shops, which witnessed a 3% increase in visits. Buying habits While savings were made outside of the home, shoppers turned to brand-name goods in the grocery store. Branded goods sales rose 6% in the four weeks up to 10 August, faster than the increase in own-label item sales. In particular, people tended to buy branded personal care, sweets and chocolate, and fizzy and soft drinks. Branded sales of such items accounted for 75% of money spent on the goods. It's far above the nearly half (46%) of overall grocery spending on branded goods.

The increase came despite shopping becoming yet more expensive. Price rises  Grocery prices became 5% pricier, a slight slowdown from the 5.2% uptick in July. It's this continuously rising grocery bill that has meant less spending on things like restaurants. Latest official data on inflation, which has been increasing since May, will be released on Wednesday morning. Price wars Competition to offer better deals has again seen discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl gain market share. Tesco held and cemented its position as the UK's most popular grocery shop, growing the proportion of people doing their shopping there.  Second most popular was Sainsbury's, followed by Asda, whose market share dropped, despite vowing to cut prices and profit less to win customers back. The fourth most popular spot was kept by German chain Aldi. Tesco and Sainsbury's saw slight rises of around 1% in their share prices on Tuesday morning."

Sky News has learnt that Elaine O'Donnell, a former EY partner and chartered accountant, has been appointed non-executive chair of The Beauty Tech Group. Ms O'Donnell's appointment comes as the Manchester-based company - which comprises the CurrentBody, ZIIP Beauty and Tria Laser brands - steps up preparations for a stock market listing which could value it at about Â£350m. Previously chair of Games Workshop, Ms O'Donnell is expected to oversee the appointment of other non-executive directors ahead of an initial public offering (IPO). Money latest: No more stamp duty? Reeves reportedly considering property tax The timing of an attempt to go public will be dependent upon market conditions, according to people close to the company.

The company is owned by its management team - led by Mr Newman but also including co-founder and chief technology officer Andrew Showman and finance chief Sam Glynn - and a group of high-net-worth individuals. It describes itself as a global industry leader in home-use beauty technology, and is focused on products which use LED, radio frequency, microcurrent and laser treatments. A successful stock market debut would represent a positive development for the London Stock Exchange during a period when searching questions are being posed about its attractiveness as a listing destination. Several companies have announced plans to shift their primary listings across the Atlantic, the latest of which was payments company Wise. The Beauty Tech Group saw a substantial increase in revenue last year, with sales passing the Â£100m mark for the first time, up from Â£80m in 2023. Its revenues comprise just under a quarter from the UK and 77% internationally. Since the beginning of this year, it has been exclusively focused on own-brand sales. The beauty technology market is projected to grow from Â£2.7bn in global sales in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate of up to 17% until 2026, according to a report by the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. In a statement issued to Sky News earlier this year, Mr Newman said: \"2024 was another significant year financially and strategically for the Group. \"We delivered revenue of over Â£100m and successfully acquired Tria Laser while also completing the integration of ZIIP Beauty. \"These acquisitions have diversified and increased the Group's product offering across the rapidly growing beauty tech market and, in line with our strategic ambitions, the Group is now focused exclusively on own-brand products. \"I am pleased that the Group's strong performance through 2024 has continued into January and I am confident that 2025 will be another record year. \"As increasing international demand and the Group's operational infrastructure provide foundations for the next stage of its global growth, the Group is considering its strategic options, which includes a London IPO later this year.\" The Beauty Tech Group counts Harrods among its retail partners, while its products are also sold on more than 20 direct-to-consumer websites around the world. It recently partnered with Manchester University's dermatology department to research opportunities for advanced beauty technologies relevant to areas of consumer demand, such as hair regrowth and anti-ageing.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n  \"It's an interesting moment,\" was how one government source described the High Court ruling that will force an Essex hotel to be emptied of asylum seekers within weeks. That may prove to be the understatement of the summer. For clues as to why, just take a glance at what the Home Office's own lawyer told the court on Tuesday. Granting the injunction \"runs the risk of acting as an impetus for further violent protests\", the barrister said - pointing out that similar legal claims by other councils would \"aggravate pressures on the asylum estate\". Right on cue and just hours after the ruling came in, Broxbourne Council - over the border in Hertfordshire - posted online that it was urgently seeking legal advice with a view to taking similar court action. The risks here are clear. Recent figures show just over 30,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels across the country. If they start to empty out following a string of court claims, the Home Office will struggle to find alternative options. After all, they are only in hotels because of a lack of other types of accommodation. There are several caveats though. This is just an interim injunction that will be heard in full in the autumn. So the court could swing back in favour of the hotel chain - and by extension the Home Office. Read more:Who says what on asylum hotels? We have been here before Remember, this isn't the first legal claim of this kind. Other councils have tried to leverage the power of the courts to shut down asylum hotels, with varying degrees of success. In 2022, Ipswich Borough Council failed to get an extension to an interim injunction to prevent migrants being sent to a Novotel in the town. As in Epping, lawyers argued there had been a change in use under planning rules. But the judge eventually decided that the legal duty the Home Office has to provide accommodation for asylum seekers was more important. So there may not be a direct read across from this case to other councils. Home Office officials are emphasising this injunction was won on the grounds of planning laws rather than national issues such as public order, and as such, each case will be different. Failing Labour approach or Tory tricks? But government sources also smell dirty tricks from Epping Council and are suggesting that the Tory-led local authority made the legal claim for political reasons. Pointing to the presence of several prominent Tory MPs in the Essex area - as well as the threat posed by Reform in the county - the question being posed is why this legal challenge was not brought when asylum seekers first started being sent to the hotel in 2020 during the Conservatives' time in government. Epping Council would no doubt reject that and say recent disorder prompted them to act. But that won't stop the Tories and Reform of seizing on this as evidence of a failing approach from Labour. So there are political risks for the government, yes, but it's the practicalities that could flow from this ruling that pose the bigger danger."

        "Content": "By Mickey Carroll, science and technology reporter and Tim Baker, political reporter   The UK government has dropped its demands to create a backdoor into Apple's encryption, according to the US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard. In a post on X in the early hours of Tuesday, Ms Gabbard said the UK had withdrawn its demand to access global Apple users' data if required. She wrote: \"The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.\" The US spy chief said it was the result of months of working closely with partners in the UK, US President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance. In February, there were reports the government had ordered Apple to create a way for UK security services to access its encrypted user data. Such orders, called Technical Capability Notices (TCN), are not public and legally, neither of the parties can publicly confirm their existence. Apple soon withdrew its \"advanced data protection\" feature for UK users, which offered end-to-end encryption for cloud data storage, meaning only the account holder could see any stored data.  Apple has not responded to a Sky News request for comment on Ms Gabbard's post. A UK government spokesperson told Sky News it does not comment on operational matters. They did say, however, that it had long had \"joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats\". \"Those arrangements have long contained safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example, the Data Access Agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting the data of each other's citizens,\" they said. \"We will continue to build on those arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe,\" they added.  When Apple withdrew its advanced data protection in February, a spokesperson said it had \"withdrawn the feature given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy\". The US government soon stepped in, with Ms Gabbard saying she had \"grave concerns\" about the UK or any other country \"requiring Apple or any company to create a 'backdoor' that would allow access to Americans' personal encrypted data\". She added: \"This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.\" She asked the CIA, NSA and multiple other US intelligence agencies to examine the reported TCN. Read more from technology:Backlash against new online safety rulesMusk's X wants 'significant' changes to OSA On Tuesday, civil rights groups cautiously welcomed Ms Gabbard's post. \"If true, this decision is hugely welcome,\" said Sam Grant, director of external relations at human rights organisation Liberty, who are challenging the government's use of the TCN in court. \"Creating any back door into our private data would be a reckless and potentially unlawful move from the government. \"As long as this power exists within the Investigatory Powers Act, it remains a risk that any future government might also try to use it to create a back door into other end-to-end encrypted services we all use. \"The safest thing for the UK Government to do is repeal this law, and commit to safeguarding our privacy by protecting end-to-end encryption.\" Open Rights Group executive director Jim Killock said: \"While the UK may have dropped its demands for Apple to backdoor all of its users across the globe, UK users may still be banned from benefiting from ADP encryption. \"And if Apple does restore ADP to UK users, there will be serious questions of trust. \"The UK's powers to attack encryption are still on the law books, and pose a serious risk to user security and protection against criminal abuse of our data.\""

Vapers were not only more likely to smoke later in life, but they were also more likely to smoke more frequently and intensely, according to experts from the University of York and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The researchers analysed 56 reviews on 384 studies on youth vaping in an umbrella review, with some 21 of these reviews looking at the use of e-cigarettes in young people and later cigarette smoking. The largest global review on vaping in young people also discovered that there is an increased risk of respiratory illnesses, like asthma or asthma exacerbation, and substance abuse, including drinking and marijuana use. The study also suggested there are links between youth vaping and pneumonia, bronchitis, lower total sperm counts, dizziness, headaches, and migraines. A link between depression and suicidal thoughts among young vapers was also identified.  Consistent evidence The data available \"consistently indicated a significant association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people\", the researchers wrote in the journal Tobacco Control. The authors said it was difficult to \"infer causality\" from their review, but said the \"repeated strong associations in prospective cohort studies are consistent with a causal relationship\". \"The consistency in the evidence is striking,\" Dr Su Golder, associate professor in health science at the University of York, said. \"Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.\" Dr Greg Hartwell, clinical assistant professor at LSHTM said the review showed \"exactly why further restrictions on the tobacco industry [...] are so important\". Read more from Sky News:Redundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plantRevealed: Roads set to face worst bank holiday traffic  Ban on disposable vapes The study was published after a ban on selling or supplying disposable vapes, both with or without nicotine, came into force across the UK in June. The crackdown on the disposable devices, also known as single-use vapes, was introduced in the hopes of making vapes less accessible to children, as statistics show a growing popularity among those aged 11 to 15. NHS figures from last year showed nearly a quarter of children in that age bracket had tried vaping, and nearly one in 10 did it frequently. The ban applies both in shops and online for sales across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Reusable vapes can still be sold. Commenting on the study, Jamie Strachan, operations director at vape retailer VPZ, said vaping \"should never be marketed to, sold to, or used by children and non-smokers\". \"VPZ supports strict regulation that prevents under-18s from obtaining vaping products,\" he added. Dr James Murphy, director of science and research at British American Tobacco (BAT), claimed there was \"little evidence that vaping is a gateway to smoking\". \"Smart regulation that gives adults access to better alternatives, while enforcing high standards and preventing underage use, is vital to achieving the UK's smoke-free goal,\" he added."

The historic encounter yielded more than 7,000 photographs of Uranus and helped scientists discover two new rings and 11 new moons around the planet. The new addition could hint at more tiny moons waiting to be found. \"There's probably a lot more of them and we just need to keep looking,\" Mr Tiscareno said."

        "Content": "By Mickey Carroll, science and technology reporter and Tim Baker, political reporter   The UK government has dropped its demands to create a backdoor into Apple's encryption, according to the US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard. In a post on X in the early hours of Tuesday, Ms Gabbard said the UK had withdrawn its demand to access global Apple users' data if required. She wrote: \"The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.\" The US spy chief said it was the result of months of working closely with partners in the UK, US President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance. In February, there were reports the government had ordered Apple to create a way for UK security services to access its encrypted user data. Such orders, called Technical Capability Notices (TCN), are not public and legally, neither of the parties can publicly confirm their existence. Apple soon withdrew its \"advanced data protection\" feature for UK users, which offered end-to-end encryption for cloud data storage, meaning only the account holder could see any stored data.  Apple has not responded to a Sky News request for comment on Ms Gabbard's post. A UK government spokesperson told Sky News it does not comment on operational matters. They did say, however, that it had long had \"joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats\". \"Those arrangements have long contained safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example, the Data Access Agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting the data of each other's citizens,\" they said. \"We will continue to build on those arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe,\" they added.  When Apple withdrew its advanced data protection in February, a spokesperson said it had \"withdrawn the feature given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy\". The US government soon stepped in, with Ms Gabbard saying she had \"grave concerns\" about the UK or any other country \"requiring Apple or any company to create a 'backdoor' that would allow access to Americans' personal encrypted data\". She added: \"This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.\" She asked the CIA, NSA and multiple other US intelligence agencies to examine the reported TCN. Read more from technology:Backlash against new online safety rulesMusk's X wants 'significant' changes to OSA On Tuesday, civil rights groups cautiously welcomed Ms Gabbard's post. \"If true, this decision is hugely welcome,\" said Sam Grant, director of external relations at human rights organisation Liberty, who are challenging the government's use of the TCN in court. \"Creating any back door into our private data would be a reckless and potentially unlawful move from the government. \"As long as this power exists within the Investigatory Powers Act, it remains a risk that any future government might also try to use it to create a back door into other end-to-end encrypted services we all use. \"The safest thing for the UK Government to do is repeal this law, and commit to safeguarding our privacy by protecting end-to-end encryption.\" Open Rights Group executive director Jim Killock said: \"While the UK may have dropped its demands for Apple to backdoor all of its users across the globe, UK users may still be banned from benefiting from ADP encryption. \"And if Apple does restore ADP to UK users, there will be serious questions of trust. \"The UK's powers to attack encryption are still on the law books, and pose a serious risk to user security and protection against criminal abuse of our data.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        One of Britain's most legendary TV dramatists, Sir Phil Redmond, is no stranger to tackling difficult issues on screen. Courting controversy famously with his hard-hitting storylines on his children's show Grange Hill for the BBC in 1978, before he switched over to Channel 4 to give it its two most prominent soaps, Brookside (1982) and later Hollyoaks (1995). He's been a pivotal figure at Channel 4 from its inception, widely considered to be a father to the channel. While he's been responsible for putting some of TV's most impactful storylines to air for them - from the first lesbian kiss, to bodies buried under patios - off-screen nowadays, he's equally radical about what should happen. \"Channel 4's job in 1980 was to provide a platform for the voices, ideas, and people that weren't able to break through into television. They did a fantastic job. I was part of that, and now it's done.\" It's not that he wants to kill off Channel 4 but - as broadcasting bosses gather for Edinburgh's annual TV Festival - he believes they urgently should be talking about mergers. A suggestion which goes down about as well as you might imagine, he says, when he brings it up with those at the top. He laughs: \"The people with the brains think it's a good idea, the people who've got the expense accounts think it's horrendous.\" A 'struggling' BBC trying to 'survive' With charter renewal talks under way to determine the BBC's future funding, Sir Phil says \"there's only one question, and that is what's going to happen to the BBC?\" \"We've got two public sector broadcasters - the BBC and Channel 4 - both owned by the government, by us as the taxpayers, and what they're trying to do now is survive, right? \"No bureaucracy ever deconstructs itselfâ€¦ the BBC is strugglingâ€¦ Channel 4 has got about a billion quid coming in a year. If you mix that, all the transmissions, all the back office stuff, all the technical stuff, all that cashâ€¦ you can keep that kind of coterie of expertise on youth programming and then say 'don't worry about the money, just go out and do what you used to do, upset people!'.\" How feasible would that be? Redmond claims, practically, you could pull it off in a week - \"we could do it now, it's very simple, it's all about keyboards and switches\". But the screenwriter admits that winning people over mentally to his way of thinking would take a few years of persuading. As for his thoughts on what could replace the BBC licence fee, he says charging people to download BBC apps on their phones seems like an obvious source of income. \"There are 25 million licences and roughly 90 million mobile phones. If you put a small levy on each mobile phone, you could reduce the actual cost of the licence fee right down, and then it could just be tagged on to VAT. \"Those parts are just moving the tax system around a bit. [then] you wouldn't have to worry about all the criminality and single mothers being thrown in jail, all this kind of nonsense.\" 'Subsidising through streaming is not the answer' Earlier this year, Peter Kosminsky, the director of historical drama Wolf Hall, suggested a levy on UK streaming revenues could fund more high-end British TV on the BBC. Sir Phil describes that as \"a sign of desperation\". \"If you can't actually survive within your own economic basis, you shouldn't be doing it. \"I don't think top slicing or subsidising one aspect of the business is the answer, you have to just look at the whole thing as a totality.\" Since selling his production company, Mersey Television, two decades ago, much of his current work has focused on acting as an ambassador for the culture and creative industries. Although he's taken a step away from television, he admits he's disappointed by how risk-averse programme makers appear to have become. \"Dare I say it? There needs to be an intellectual foundation to it all.\" TV's 'missing a trick' He believes TV bosses are too scared of being fined by Ofcom, and that's meant soaps are not going as far as they should. \"The benefits [system], you know, immigration, all these things are really relevant subjects for drama to bring out all the arguments, the conflicts. \"The majority of the people know the benefits system is broken, that it needs to be fixed because they see themselves living on their estate with a 10 or 12-year-old car and then there's someone else down the road who knows how to fill a form in, and he's driving around in a Â£65k BMW, right? Those debates would be really great to bring out on TV, they're missing a trick.\" While some of TV's biggest executives are slated to speak at the Edinburgh Television Festival, Redmond is not convinced they will be open to listening. \"They will go where the perceived wisdom is as to where the industry is going. The fact that the industry is taking a wrong turn, we really need somebody else to come along and go 'Oi!'\" When I ask if that could be him, he laughs. Cue dramatic music and closing credits. As plot twists go, the idea of one of TV's most radical voices making a boardroom comeback to stir the pot, realistic or not, is at the very least food for thought for the industry. Edinburgh TV Festival runs from 19 - 22 August."

The highly anticipated reunion was announced in August last year, after the brothers seemingly put the feud which led to their split in 2009 behind them. At the time, Noel said he \"simply could not go on working with Liam\", but having just completed the UK-leg of their comeback tour, he has nothing but praise for his younger sibling. \"Liam's smashing it. I'm proud of him,\" Noel told talkSport in his first interview since the tour began. \"I couldn't do the stadium thing like he does it, it's not in my nature. But I've got to say, I kind of look and I think 'good for you, mate'. He's been amazing. \"It's great just to be back with Bonehead [Paul Arthurs] and Liam and just be doing it again.\"  When asked if he has felt emotional during the tour, Noel added: \"I guess when it's all said and done we will sit and reflect on it, but it's great being back in the band with Liam, I forgot how funny he was.\" He went on to say he was \"completely blown away\" after the band's opening night in Cardiff, and \"grossly underestimated\" what he was getting himself into when first signing up for the shows. He said: \"It was kind of after about five minutes, I was like, 'all right, can I just go back to the dressing room and start this again?' \"I've done stadiums before and all that, but I don't mind telling you, my legs had turned to jelly after about halfway through the second song.\" \"Every night is the crowd's first night, you know what I mean?\" he continued. \"So every night's got that kind of same energy to it, but it's been truly amazing. I'm not usually short for words, but I can't really articulate it.\" Having played to packed crowds in Cardiff, London, Manchester, Dublin and Edinburgh, Oasis have scheduled dates around the world including in major cities across the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Japan.
