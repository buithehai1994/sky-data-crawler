        "Content": " Worldwide stock markets have plummeted for the second day running as the fallout from Donald Trump's global tariffs continues. While European and Asian markets suffered notable falls, American indexes were the worst hit, with Wall Street closing to a sea of red on Friday following Thursday's rout - the worst day in US markets since the COVID-19 pandemic. As it happened: Worst week's trading in five years All three of the US's major indexes were down by more than 5% at market close; The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 5.5%, the S&P 500 was 5.97% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 5.82%. The Nasdaq was also 22% below its record-high set in December, which indicates a bear market. Read more: What's a bear market?

The UK's leading stock market, the FTSE 100, also suffered its worst daily drop in more than five years, closing 4.95% down, a level not seen since March 2020. And the Japanese exchange Nikkei 225 dropped by 2.75% at end of trading, down 20% from its recent peak in July last year. Trump holds trade deal talks - reports It comes as a source told CNN that Mr Trump has been in discussions with Vietnamese, Indian and Israeli representatives to negotiate bespoke trade deals that could alleviate proposed tariffs on those countries before a deadline next week. The source told the US broadcaster the talks were being held in advance of the reciprocal levies going into effect next week. Vietnam faced one of the highest reciprocal tariffs announced by the US president this week, with 46% rates on imports. Israeli imports face a 17% rate, and Indian goods will be subject to 26% tariffs.

Mr Trump said China \"played it wrong\" and \"panicked - the one thing they cannot afford to do\" in another all-caps Truth Social post earlier on Friday. Later, on Air Force One, the US president told reporters that \"the beauty\" of the tariffs is that they allow for negotiations, referencing talks with Chinese company ByteDance on the sale of social media app TikTok.  He said: \"We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, 'We'll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs?' \"The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. They always have.\""

The Dow lost more than 2,000 points in a single day - that's only happened three times before in its long history. The Nasdaq closed in Bear Market - the opposite of Bull Market - reflecting a 20% drop from a recent high. The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P500 Index all recorded their worst week since the global pandemic five years ago. That's what happens when the world's two largest economies - America and China - declare a trade war. Other countries are still debating retaliating for Mr Trump's tariffs - \"there will be blood\", according to one Wall Street bank.

But the chair of the Federal Reserve, the man tasked with keeping US inflation in check, struck a much more sombre tone.  Jerome Powell said: \"It is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects.\" \"While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it's also possible that the effects could be more persistent,\" he warned. That's bad news for American consumers, who've benefitted from an open market. With free trade, America lost manufacturing jobs but gained cheap products from places like China.

        "Content": "By Ben van der Merwe, digital investigations journalist  Gaza's health ministry has removed 1,852 people from its official list of fatalities since October, after finding that some had died of natural causes or were alive but had been imprisoned. The list of deaths currently stands at 50,609 following the removals. Almost all of the names removed (97%) had initially been submitted through an online form which allows families to record the deaths of loved ones where the body is missing. The head of the statistics team at Gazaâ€™s health ministry, Zaher Al Wahidi, told Sky News that names submitted via the form had been removed as a precautionary measure pending a judicial investigation into each one. \"We realised that a lot of people [submitted via the form] died a natural death,\" Mr Wahidi said. \"Maybe they were near an explosion and they had a heart attack, or [living in destroyed] houses caused them pneumonia or hypothermia. All these cases we donâ€™t [attribute to] the war.\" Others submitted via the form were found to be imprisoned or to be missing with insufficient evidence that they had died. Some families submitting false claims, Mr Wahidi said, may have been motivated by the promise of government financial assistance. It is the largest removal of names from the list since the war began, and comes after 1,441 names were removed between August and October - 54% of them originating in hospital morgue records rather than the online form. Mr Wahidi says his team audited the hospital data after receiving complaints from people who had ended up on the list despite being alive. They found that hospital clerks, when operating without access to the central population registry and lacking full names or dates of birth for the dead, had marked the wrong people as dead in their records. In total, 8% of people who were listed as dead in August have since been removed from the official death toll. Many of those may later be added back in, as the judicial investigations proceed. 'It doesn't look like manipulation' Gabriel Epstein, a research assistant at US thinktank The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there's no reason to think the errors are the result of deliberate manipulation intended to inflate the share of women and children among the dead. \"If 90% of the removed entries were men aged 18-40, that would look like manipulation,\" he said. \"But it doesnâ€™t look like that.\" Of those entries removed since the start of the war and whose demographic information was recorded, 41% are men aged 18 to 60, while 59% are women, children and elderly people. By comparison, 44% of remaining deaths are working-age men. This means that the removals have had the effect of slightly reducing the share of women and children in the official list. Names were previously added to the list without verification Until October, Mr Wahidi said, names submitted via the online form had been added to the official list of registered deaths before undergoing a judicial confirmation process. The publication of unverified deaths submitted via the form had previously led to issues with the data, with 1,295 deaths submitted via the form being removed from the list prior to October. This included 474 people who were later added back again. Sky News previously understood that names from the form were only published after undergoing judicial confirmation. However, Mr Wahidi says this practice only began in October. \"This does cause me to downgrade the quality of the earlier lists, definitely below where I thought they were,\" said Professor Michael Spagat, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. Read more:Analysis: Gaza aid workers' deathsWhat happened to the ceasefire? A Ministry of Health document from July 2024 confirms that names submitted through the online form were, at the time, included in the official fatality list before being verified. These names \"are initially included in the final count of martyrs, but verification procedures are undertaken afterward\", the document says. \"They basically said that they were posting these things provisionally pending investigation,\" said Prof Spagat. \"There may have been literally zero people, including us, who actually absorbed this message, but they werenâ€™t hiding it either.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The cost of having staff is going up this Sunday as the increase in employers' national insurance kicks in. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the October budget employers will have to pay a 15% rate of national insurance contributions (NIC) on their employees from 6 April - up from 13.8%. She also lowered the threshold at which employers pay NIC from Â£9,100 a year to Â£5,000 a year, meaning they start paying at an earlier point on staff salaries. This is on top of the national minimum wage rising, the business relief rate for hospitality, retail and leisure reducing from 75% to 40% and the rising cost of ingredients and services. Sky News spoke to people working in some of the industries that will be hardest hit by the rise in NIC: Nurseries, hospitality, retail, small businesses and care. NURSERIES Nearly all (96% of 728) nurseries surveyed by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said they will have no choice but to put up fees because of the NIC rise, leaving parents to pick up the shortfall. \n                  Bills, bills, bills: How can you beat the hikes?\n                 \n                  Cost of living calculator: See how much your bills are going up\n                 \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves 'rejects' analysis average family set to be Â£1,400 a year poorer by 2030\n                 The NDNA has warned nurseries could close due to the rise, with 14% saying their business is at risk, 69% reducing spending on resources and 39% considering offering fewer places with government-funded hours as 92% said they do not cover their costs. Sarah has two children, with her youngest starting later this month, but they were just informed fees will now be Â£92 a day - compared with Â£59 at the same nursery when her eldest started five years ago. \"I'm not sure how we will afford this. Our salaries haven't increased by 50% during this time,\" she said. \"We're stuck as there aren't enough nursery spaces in our area, so we will have to struggle.\" Karen Richards, director of the Wolds Childcare group in Nottinghamshire, has started a petition to get the government to exempt private nurseries - the majority of providers - from the NIC changes as she said it is unfair nurseries in schools do not have to pay the NIC. She told Sky News she will have to find about Â£183,000 next year to cover the increase across her five nurseries and reducing staff numbers is \"not off the table\" but it is more likely they will reduce the number of children they have. Joeli Brearley, founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group, told Sky News: \"Parents are already drowning in childcare costs, and now, thanks to the national insurance hike, nurseries are passing even more fees on to families who simply can't afford it. \"It's the same story every time - parents pay the price while the government looks the other way. How exactly are we meant to 'boost the economy' when we can't even afford to go to work?\" Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of the NDNA, said staffing costs make up about 75% of nurseries' costs and they will have to find Â£2,600 more per employee to pay for the NIC rise - Â£47,000 for an average nursery. \"The government says it wants to offer 'cheaper childcare' for parents on the one hand but then with the other expects nurseries to absorb the costs of National Insurance Contributions themselves,\" she told Sky News. \"High-quality early education and care gives children the best start in life and enables parents to work. The government must invest in this vital infrastructure to make sure nurseries can continue to deliver this social and economic good.\" HOSPITALITY The hospitality industry has warned of closures, price rises, lack of growth and shorter opening hours. Dan Brod, co-owner of The Beckford Group, a small southwest England restaurant and country pub/hotel group, said the economic situation now is \"much worse\" than during COVID. The group has put plans for two more projects on hold and Mr Brod said the only option is to put up prices, but with the rising supplier costs, wages, business rates and NIC hike they will \"stay still\" financially. Read more:Reeves admits it won't be easy for businesses to absorb NI hikeUK businesses issue warning over 'deeply troubling' Trump tariffs He told Sky News: \"What we're nervous about is we're still in the cost of living crisis and even though our places are in very wealthy areas of the country, Wiltshire, Somerset and Bath, people are feeling the situation in their pockets, people are going out less.\" Mr Brod said they are not getting rid of any staff as their business strongly depends on the quality of their hospitality so they are having to make savings elsewhere. \"I'm still optimistic, I still feel that humans need hospitality but we're not valued as an industry and the social benefit is never taken into account by government.\" Aktar Islam, owner/chef at two Michelin-starred Opheem in Birmingham, said the NIC rise will cost him up to Â£120,000 more in staff costs a year and to maintain the financial position he is in now they would have to make \"another million pounds\". He got emails from eight suppliers on Thursday saying they were raising their costs, and said he will have to raise prices but is concerned about the impact on diners. The restaurateur hires four commis chefs to train each year but will not be able to this year, or the next few. \"It's very short-sighted of the government, you're not going to grow the economy by taxing hospitality out of existence, these sort of businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,\" he said. \"They think if a hospitality business closes another will open but people know it's tough, why would they want to do that? It's not going to happen.\" The chef sent hundreds of his \"at home\" kits to fellow chefs this week for their staff as an acknowledgement of how much of a \"s*** show\" the situation is - \"a little hug from us\". RETAIL Some of the UK's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Boots, Marks & Spencer and Next, wrote to Rachel Reeves after the budget to say the NIC hike would lead to higher consumer prices, smaller pay rises, job cuts and store closures. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), representing more than 200 major retailers and brands, said the costs are so significant neither small or large retailers will be able to absorb them. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury committee in November that job losses due to the NIC changes were likely to be higher than the 50,000 forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon and Accessorize, said retailers had the choice of protecting staff numbers or cancelling investment plans. He said they were trying to protect staff numbers and would be increasing prices but they would likely have to halt plans to increase store numbers. Helen Dickinson, head of the BRC, told Sky News the national living wage rise and NIC increase will cost businesses Â£5bn, adding more than 10% to the cost of hiring someone in an entry-level role. A further tax on packaging coming in October means retailers will face Â£7bn in extra costs this year, she said. \"This huge cost burden will undoubtedly reduce investment in stores and jobs and is likely to lead to higher prices,\" she added. SMALL BUSINESSES A massive 85% of 1,400 small business owners surveyed by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in March reported rising costs compared with the same time last year, with 47% citing tax as the main barrier to growth - the highest level in more than a decade. Just 8% of those businesses saw an increase in staff numbers over the last quarter, while 21% had to reduce their workforce. Kate Rumsey, whose family has run Rumsey's Chocolates in Wendover, Buckinghamshire and Thame, Oxfordshire, for 21 years, said the NIC rise, minimum wage increase and business relief rate reduction will push her staff costs up by 15 to 17% - Â£70,000 to Â£80,000 annually. To offset those costs, she has had to reduce opening hours, including closing on Sundays and bank holidays in one shop for the first time ever, make one person redundant, not replace short-term staff and introduce a hiring freeze. The soaring price of cocoa has added to her woes and she has had to increase prices by about 10% and will raise them further. She told Sky News: \"We're very much taking more of a short-term view at the moment, it's so seasonal in this business so I said to the team we'll just get through Q1 then re-evaluate. \"I feel this is a bit about the survival of the fittest and many businesses won't survive.\" Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the FSB, said the NIC rise \"holds back growth\" and has seen small business confidence drop to its lowest point since the first year of the pandemic. With the \"highest tax burden for 70 years\", she called on the chancellor to introduce a \"raft of pro-small business measures\" in the autumn budget so it can deliver on its pledge for growth. She reminded employers they can claim the Employment Allowance, which has doubled after an FSB campaign to take the first Â£10,500 off an employer's annual bill.  CARE The care sector has been warning the government since the October that budget care homes will be forced to close due to the financial pressures the employers' national insurance rise will place on them. Care homes receive funding from councils as well as from private fees, but as local authorities feel the squeeze more and more their contributions are not keeping up with rising costs. The industry has argued without it the NHS would be crippled. Raj Sehgal, founding director of ArmsCare, a family-run group of six care homes in Norfolk, said the NIC increase means a Â£360,000 annual impact on the group's Â£3.6m payroll. In an attempt to offset those costs, the group is scrapping staff bonuses and freezing management salaries. It is also considering reducing day hours, where there are more staff on, so the fewer numbers of night staff work longer hours and with no paid break. Mr Sehgal said: \"But what that does do unfortunately, is impact the quality you're going to be able to provide, at a time when we need to be improving quality, but something has to give. \"The government just doesn't seem to understand that the funding needs to be there. You cannot keep enforcing higher costs on businesses and not be able to fund those without actually finding the money from somewhere.\" He said the issue is exacerbated by the fact local authority funding, despite increasing to 5%, will not cover the 10% rise. \"It's going to be a really, really tough ride. And we are going to see a number of providers close their doors,\" he warned. Nadra Ahmed, executive co-chair of the National Care Association, said those who receive, or are waiting to access, care as well as staff will feel the impact the hardest. \"As providers see further shortfalls in the commissioning of care services, they will start to limit what they can do to ensure their viability or, as a last resort exit the market,\" she said. \"This is very short-sighted, with serious consequences, which alludes to the understanding of this government.\" Government decided to 'wipe the slate clean' A Treasury spokesperson told Sky News the government is \"pro-business\" but has \"taken the difficult but necessary decisions to wipe the slate clean and properly fund our public services after years of declines\". \"Our budget choices have already delivered an NHS with falling waiting lists, a Â£3.7bn rescue package for social care, and vital protection for Britain's small businesses,\" they said. \"We're making tough choices today to secure a better tomorrow through our Plan for Change. By investing in economic growth and early years education while capping corporation tax, we're putting more money in working people's pockets and giving every child the best start in life.\""

        "Content": "\n          Journalist\n              @amritsingh_mann\n  It has become almost impossible to book a driving test on the government website due to bots on the booking system, driving instructors have told Sky News. The only official way to book a practical car driving test is through the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) website. New test slots are released by the DVSA at 6am every Monday, but \"no matter how fast I am, there's nothing available\", said Aman Sanghera, a driving instructor based in west London.  When asked about the cause, she said: \"All of the tests are taken by bots, they are definitely taking over the booking system.\" In this context, bots are automated software designed to mimic human behaviour and programmed to carry out actions like searching for and reserving driving test appointments on the official government website much faster than humans can. Individuals and companies use bots to block-book driving test slots and then resell them at a profit, which is not illegal, although it is a violation of the DVSA's terms of use. Recent data shows the DVSA has closed over 800 business accounts for misuse of its booking service in the past two years. Ms Sanghera, who has been in the trade for over a decade, said the usage of bots started a few months ago \"but is now getting out of hand\". She said: \"I've actually heard about driving instructors being approached by certain individuals to then take on their IDs to log in and to run this scam. \"I struggle to actually book a test for my students, which means that by the time my students are logging in, they've got no chance.\" Driving instructors can book driving tests on behalf of their pupils using a dedicated service, allowing them to bypass the general queue and potentially secure test slots more efficiently. As a result, Ms Sanghera said students are \"forced to go to third-party sites\" to secure \"the same test dates which are then available later on during the day at a premium rate of like Â£200-Â£300\". She added: \"Given that the DVSA is a government-regulated body, one would expect a more robust and fair system to ensure affordability and accessibility for all candidates.\" The standard test fee is Â£62, offered by the DVSA, which is responsible for carrying out driving tests in Great Britain. The biggest concern for the driving instructors Sky News has spoken to, including Ms Sanghera, is \"the fact that students are being exploited\". When Ahmed Ali struggled to find a practical test on the DVSA website, he turned to third-party sites - a decision he now regrets. He said: \"I've spent about Â£650 on driving tests, and I've sat zero tests. I've given all this money to third-parties that look for cancellations so they could try to get you a faster test.\" But the 20-year-old said that despite making the payments, he \"didn't hear back from them again\", which is illegal. \"When you lose all that money, you get to a point where you can't really afford to find another driving test,\" he said. \"I just feel very frustrated because I've spent all this money, all this time into driving, and I haven't sat a single driving test.\" Read more from Sky News:Russell Brand charged with rape and sexual assaultLast UK blast furnaces days from closureShip owner files legal claim after North Sea crash The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via the official Gov.uk website and told Sky News it \"deploys enhanced bot protection to help stop automated systems from buying up tests unfairly\". \"These applications, however, are constantly evolving and changing, and DVSA's work on this is ongoing,\" it said. From Tuesday, the DVSA will require learner drivers to provide 10 full working days' notice to change or cancel their car driving test without losing the test fee, up from the current three days. Also part of the DVSA's crackdown to reduce waiting times is a consultation expected to launch in spring 2025 \"to streamline the driving test booking process\" and \"tighten terms and conditions\"."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n \"Truth and reconciliation\" - it felt like an interesting phrase after everything that's been said in the past two weeks, but it came from a source close to the current Sentebale team, when I asked if they could really see any chance of rebuilding what has gone wrong. It's been explosive. First, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, the founders, said they'd taken the \"heartbreaking\" decision to step away in solidarity with the trustees, who had found working with the chair Dr Sophie Chandauka \"untenable\". Then Dr Chandauka, speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky News last Sunday, accused Prince Harry of \"harassment and bullying at scale\". A source close to the charity's former trustees described her allegations as \"categorically false\" and \"completely baseless\". This week I've been in communication with those on both sides. The acrimony and anger have been palpable, but equally clear from my conversations has been the desire on all sides to try and explain what they feel caused this catastrophic breakdown. All parties are keen \"that polo match\" doesn't become the distraction - the match where it looked like Dr Chandauka and the Sussexes had fallen out. All of those involved want that to be put to one side, as they tell me there are much more fundamental questions that need to be answered. Taking on board everything I've been told, you can largely boil it down to three main areas. How was the charity being run? I've been told work had been going on for some time internally to look at the governance of Sentebale. Was the current setup - how it was being run and the composition of the chair, trustees and the people in those roles - appropriate for a charity heading towards its 20th anniversary? \n                  Sentebale: Watchdog opens case into 'concerns raised' at charity set up by Prince Harry\n                 \n                  Prince Harry's charity row explained: Why he left Sentebale and what happens now\n                 \n                  Catastrophic row risks Harry's deeply personal tribute to Princess Diana\n                 What was the future for Sentebale? Set up because of a genuine heartfelt desire to help young people in Lesotho with HIV and AIDS, was it time for them to broaden that remit? Were there obstacles to those changes happening? But also did it really need to fundamentally change? And financially what was going on? Again a lot has been said by both sides about money spent on consultants' fees, and who may have been responsible for sponsors stepping away, and fundraising levels falling. On Friday, the Charity Commission confirmed it has now opened a compliance case to assess concerns raised about the charity.  In a statement, Dr Chandauka said: \"We hope that, together, these actions will give the general public, our colleagues, partners, supporters, donors and the communities we serve comfort that Sentebale and its new board of trustees are acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture for Sentebale to thrive.\" Prince Harry's statement, also representing Prince Seeiso and the former trustees, said: \"We share in the relief that the Charity Commission confirmed they will be conducting a robust inquiry. We fully expect it will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign. We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve.\" Read more:Prince Harry's charity row explainedAnalysis: Row risks Harry's personal tribute to DianaClaims at charity set up by Prince Harry 'a surprise' One insider, still working for the charity, did tell me they still had some hope that there may come a time when there would be some form of \"truth and reconciliation process\". They added that they have always felt \"if you keep your eye on the charitable objective, then I've often found everything falls into place\". Ultimately, at times this week, it has felt like that has been lost from this story. With all the blame and accusations flying around, there's been little attention on the young people they support, and those they want to help in the future, that could seriously lose out. Sentebale means so much to Harry, I had in some ways expected more of a robust response to the allegations being laid firmly at his door.  In recent years, unleashed from the constraints of royal life, he hasn't been one to hold back. But you wonder how much everything else that's been going on at home this week prevented him from more publicly responding. My inbox has had constant updates from Meghan's brand \"As Ever\", you have to remember this was meant to be Meghan's big week, where her new products, including flower sprinkles and raspberry spread, finally went on sale and sold out within hours. In some ways that context underlines one of the difficulties some have spoken to me about, with Harry living this new life. Speak to those on both sides of this row, and one thing they will actually agree on is that Harry remains a man committed to those principles of service, duty and helping others - it's in his DNA. But unlike when he was a working royal, commercial interests are now at play, and that may impact other aspects of his philanthropic endeavours. Now it's all in the hands of the Charity Commission, and for now, both sides have fallen silent."

Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a protected legal US resident who has lived in Maryland since 2011 - was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and deported to his home country last month. However, an immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Mr Garcia should be shielded from deportation to El Salvador as he likely faced persecution from local gangs. After legal challenges were filed by Mr Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled the Trump administration must arrange for his return by 7 April. She added the deportation was \"an illegal act\", and heard from Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni that Mr Garcia should not have been removed. He said he could not tell the judge on what authority Mr Garcia was arrested, why he was sent to El Salvador, and why the US could not retrieve him. The Trump administration admitted on Monday that deporting Mr Garcia was an \"administrative error\", but said they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador. \n                  A red wall on Wall Street - but President Trump appears to believe it will all work out\n                 \n                  Stock markets slump for second day running after Trump announces tariffs - in worst day for indexes since COVID\n                 \n                  Global markets have given Trump a clear no-confidence vote - and his fickleness is making the problem worse  \n                 Read more:Turkish student in US should not be deported for now, judge ordersTrump administration deports hundreds of Venezuelans despite court order US vice president JD Vance and White House officials also insist that the 29-year-old was a member of MS-13 - an international criminal gang formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs. The group was declared a terrorist organisation by the Trump administration last month. Mr Vance cited an anonymous testimony in the 2019 ruling that said Mr Garcia had been a member of the gang in New York - where he has never lived.

        "Content": "By Jayson Mansaray, arts and entertainment producer  Despite The Who's Quadrophenia being set over 60 years ago, Pete Townshend's themes of identity, mental health, and modern masculinity are just as relevant today. The album is having a renaissance as Pete Townshend's Quadrophenia A Mod ballet is being brought to life via dance at Sadler's Wells East, and Sky News has an exclusive first look. As Townshend puts it, the album he wrote is \"perfect\" for the stage. \"My wife Rachel did the orchestration for me, and as soon as I heard it I said to her it would make a fabulous ballet and we never really let that go,\" he tells Sky News. \"Heavy percussion, concussive sequences. They're explosive moments. They're also romantic movement moments.\" If you identify with the demographics of Millennial, Gen Y or Gen Z, you might not be familiar with The Who and Mod culture. But in post-war Britain the Mods were a cultural phenomenon characterised by fashion, music, and of course, scooters. The young rebels were seen as a counter-culture to the establishment and The Who, with Roger Daltry's lead vocals and Pete Townshend's writing, were the soundtrack. \n                  The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey tells fans he's going blind during live show\n                 \n                  Shel Talmy, producer who worked with David Bowie, The Kinks and The Who, dies aged 87\n                 \n                  Stamps celebrate 60 years of The Who including iconic album covers\n                 Quadrophenia the album is widely regarded as an essay on the British adolescent experience at the time, focusing on the life of fictional protagonist Jimmy - a young Mod struggling with his sanity, self-doubt, and alienation.â€¯ Townshend sets the rock opera in 1965 but thinks its themes of identity, mental health, and modern masculinity are just as relevant today. He says: \"The phobias and the restrictions and the unwritten laws about how young men should behave. The ground that they broke, that we broke because I was a part of it. \"Men were letting go of [the] wartime-related, uniform-related stance that if I wear this kind of outfit it makes me look like a man.\" This struggle of modern masculinity and identity appears to be echoing today as manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate, incel culture, and Netflix's Adolescence make headlines. For dancer Paris Fitzpatrick, who takes on the lead role of Jimmy, the story resonates. \"I think there's a connection massively and I think there may even be a little more revival in some way,\" he tells Sky News. \"I love that myself. I love non-conforming to gender norms and typical masculinity; I think it's great to challenge things.\" Despite the album being written before he was born, the dancer says he was familiar with the genre already. \"I actually did an art GCSE project about Mods and rockers and Quadrophenia,\" he says. \"I think we'll be able to bring it to new audiences and hopefully, maybe people will be inspired to to learn more about their music and the whole cultural movement of the early 60s.\" Read more from Sky News:Tributes to 'genius' KilmerRichest billionaires namedSpringsteen's seven new albums In 1979, the album was adapted into a film directed by Franc Roddam starring Ray Winstone and Sting but Townshend admits because the film missed key points he is \"not a big fan\". \"What it turned out to be in the movie was a story about culture, about social scenario and less about really the specifics of mental illness and how that affects young people,\" he adds, also complimenting Roddam's writing for the film. Perhaps a testament to Pete Townshend's creativity, Quadrophenia started as an album, was successfully adapted to film and now it will hit the stage as a contemporary ballet. It appears that over six decades later Mod culture is still cool and their issues still relatable. Quadrophenia, a Mod Ballet will tour to Plymouth Theatre Royal from 28 May to 1 June 2025, Edinburgh Festival Theatre from 10 to 14 June 2025 and the Mayflower, Southampton from 18 to 21 June 2025 before having its official opening at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London on 24 June running to 13 July 2025 and then visiting The Lowry, Salford from 15 to 19 July 2025."

        "Content": "\n          Journalist\n              @amritsingh_mann\n  It has become almost impossible to book a driving test on the government website due to bots on the booking system, driving instructors have told Sky News. The only official way to book a practical car driving test is through the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) website. New test slots are released by the DVSA at 6am every Monday, but \"no matter how fast I am, there's nothing available\", said Aman Sanghera, a driving instructor based in west London.  When asked about the cause, she said: \"All of the tests are taken by bots, they are definitely taking over the booking system.\" In this context, bots are automated software designed to mimic human behaviour and programmed to carry out actions like searching for and reserving driving test appointments on the official government website much faster than humans can. Individuals and companies use bots to block-book driving test slots and then resell them at a profit, which is not illegal, although it is a violation of the DVSA's terms of use. Recent data shows the DVSA has closed over 800 business accounts for misuse of its booking service in the past two years. Ms Sanghera, who has been in the trade for over a decade, said the usage of bots started a few months ago \"but is now getting out of hand\". She said: \"I've actually heard about driving instructors being approached by certain individuals to then take on their IDs to log in and to run this scam. \"I struggle to actually book a test for my students, which means that by the time my students are logging in, they've got no chance.\" Driving instructors can book driving tests on behalf of their pupils using a dedicated service, allowing them to bypass the general queue and potentially secure test slots more efficiently. As a result, Ms Sanghera said students are \"forced to go to third-party sites\" to secure \"the same test dates which are then available later on during the day at a premium rate of like Â£200-Â£300\". She added: \"Given that the DVSA is a government-regulated body, one would expect a more robust and fair system to ensure affordability and accessibility for all candidates.\" The standard test fee is Â£62, offered by the DVSA, which is responsible for carrying out driving tests in Great Britain. The biggest concern for the driving instructors Sky News has spoken to, including Ms Sanghera, is \"the fact that students are being exploited\". When Ahmed Ali struggled to find a practical test on the DVSA website, he turned to third-party sites - a decision he now regrets. He said: \"I've spent about Â£650 on driving tests, and I've sat zero tests. I've given all this money to third-parties that look for cancellations so they could try to get you a faster test.\" But the 20-year-old said that despite making the payments, he \"didn't hear back from them again\", which is illegal. \"When you lose all that money, you get to a point where you can't really afford to find another driving test,\" he said. \"I just feel very frustrated because I've spent all this money, all this time into driving, and I haven't sat a single driving test.\" Read more from Sky News:Russell Brand charged with rape and sexual assaultLast UK blast furnaces days from closureShip owner files legal claim after North Sea crash The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via the official Gov.uk website and told Sky News it \"deploys enhanced bot protection to help stop automated systems from buying up tests unfairly\". \"These applications, however, are constantly evolving and changing, and DVSA's work on this is ongoing,\" it said. From Tuesday, the DVSA will require learner drivers to provide 10 full working days' notice to change or cancel their car driving test without losing the test fee, up from the current three days. Also part of the DVSA's crackdown to reduce waiting times is a consultation expected to launch in spring 2025 \"to streamline the driving test booking process\" and \"tighten terms and conditions\"."

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the October budget employers will have to pay a 15% rate of national insurance contributions (NIC) on their employees from 6 April - up from 13.8%. She also lowered the threshold at which employers pay NIC from Â£9,100 a year to Â£5,000 a year, meaning they start paying at an earlier point on staff salaries. This is on top of the national minimum wage rising, the business relief rate for hospitality, retail and leisure reducing from 75% to 40% and the rising cost of ingredients and services. Sky News spoke to people working in some of the industries that will be hardest hit by the rise in NIC: Nurseries, hospitality, retail, small businesses and care. NURSERIES Nearly all (96% of 728) nurseries surveyed by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said they will have no choice but to put up fees because of the NIC rise, leaving parents to pick up the shortfall. \n                  Bills, bills, bills: How can you beat the hikes?\n                 \n                  Cost of living calculator: See how much your bills are going up\n                 \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves 'rejects' analysis average family set to be Â£1,400 a year poorer by 2030\n                 The NDNA has warned nurseries could close due to the rise, with 14% saying their business is at risk, 69% reducing spending on resources and 39% considering offering fewer places with government-funded hours as 92% said they do not cover their costs. Sarah has two children, with her youngest starting later this month, but they were just informed fees will now be Â£92 a day - compared with Â£59 at the same nursery when her eldest started five years ago. \"I'm not sure how we will afford this. Our salaries haven't increased by 50% during this time,\" she said. \"We're stuck as there aren't enough nursery spaces in our area, so we will have to struggle.\" Karen Richards, director of the Wolds Childcare group in Nottinghamshire, has started a petition to get the government to exempt private nurseries - the majority of providers - from the NIC changes as she said it is unfair nurseries in schools do not have to pay the NIC. She told Sky News she will have to find about Â£183,000 next year to cover the increase across her five nurseries and reducing staff numbers is \"not off the table\" but it is more likely they will reduce the number of children they have. Joeli Brearley, founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group, told Sky News: \"Parents are already drowning in childcare costs, and now, thanks to the national insurance hike, nurseries are passing even more fees on to families who simply can't afford it. \"It's the same story every time - parents pay the price while the government looks the other way. How exactly are we meant to 'boost the economy' when we can't even afford to go to work?\" Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of the NDNA, said staffing costs make up about 75% of nurseries' costs and they will have to find Â£2,600 more per employee to pay for the NIC rise - Â£47,000 for an average nursery. \"The government says it wants to offer 'cheaper childcare' for parents on the one hand but then with the other expects nurseries to absorb the costs of National Insurance Contributions themselves,\" she told Sky News. \"High-quality early education and care gives children the best start in life and enables parents to work. The government must invest in this vital infrastructure to make sure nurseries can continue to deliver this social and economic good.\" HOSPITALITY The hospitality industry has warned of closures, price rises, lack of growth and shorter opening hours. Dan Brod, co-owner of The Beckford Group, a small southwest England restaurant and country pub/hotel group, said the economic situation now is \"much worse\" than during COVID. The group has put plans for two more projects on hold and Mr Brod said the only option is to put up prices, but with the rising supplier costs, wages, business rates and NIC hike they will \"stay still\" financially.

He got emails from eight suppliers on Thursday saying they were raising their costs, and said he will have to raise prices but is concerned about the impact on diners. The restaurateur hires four commis chefs to train each year but will not be able to this year, or the next few. \"It's very short-sighted of the government, you're not going to grow the economy by taxing hospitality out of existence, these sort of businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,\" he said. \"They think if a hospitality business closes another will open but people know it's tough, why would they want to do that? It's not going to happen.\" The chef sent hundreds of his \"at home\" kits to fellow chefs this week for their staff as an acknowledgement of how much of a \"s*** show\" the situation is - \"a little hug from us\". RETAIL Some of the UK's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Boots, Marks & Spencer and Next, wrote to Rachel Reeves after the budget to say the NIC hike would lead to higher consumer prices, smaller pay rises, job cuts and store closures. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), representing more than 200 major retailers and brands, said the costs are so significant neither small or large retailers will be able to absorb them. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury committee in November that job losses due to the NIC changes were likely to be higher than the 50,000 forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon and Accessorize, said retailers had the choice of protecting staff numbers or cancelling investment plans. He said they were trying to protect staff numbers and would be increasing prices but they would likely have to halt plans to increase store numbers. Helen Dickinson, head of the BRC, told Sky News the national living wage rise and NIC increase will cost businesses Â£5bn, adding more than 10% to the cost of hiring someone in an entry-level role. A further tax on packaging coming in October means retailers will face Â£7bn in extra costs this year, she said. \"This huge cost burden will undoubtedly reduce investment in stores and jobs and is likely to lead to higher prices,\" she added. SMALL BUSINESSES A massive 85% of 1,400 small business owners surveyed by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in March reported rising costs compared with the same time last year, with 47% citing tax as the main barrier to growth - the highest level in more than a decade. Just 8% of those businesses saw an increase in staff numbers over the last quarter, while 21% had to reduce their workforce. Kate Rumsey, whose family has run Rumsey's Chocolates in Wendover, Buckinghamshire and Thame, Oxfordshire, for 21 years, said the NIC rise, minimum wage increase and business relief rate reduction will push her staff costs up by 15 to 17% - Â£70,000 to Â£80,000 annually. To offset those costs, she has had to reduce opening hours, including closing on Sundays and bank holidays in one shop for the first time ever, make one person redundant, not replace short-term staff and introduce a hiring freeze. The soaring price of cocoa has added to her woes and she has had to increase prices by about 10% and will raise them further. She told Sky News: \"We're very much taking more of a short-term view at the moment, it's so seasonal in this business so I said to the team we'll just get through Q1 then re-evaluate. \"I feel this is a bit about the survival of the fittest and many businesses won't survive.\" Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the FSB, said the NIC rise \"holds back growth\" and has seen small business confidence drop to its lowest point since the first year of the pandemic. With the \"highest tax burden for 70 years\", she called on the chancellor to introduce a \"raft of pro-small business measures\" in the autumn budget so it can deliver on its pledge for growth. She reminded employers they can claim the Employment Allowance, which has doubled after an FSB campaign to take the first Â£10,500 off an employer's annual bill.  CARE The care sector has been warning the government since the October that budget care homes will be forced to close due to the financial pressures the employers' national insurance rise will place on them. Care homes receive funding from councils as well as from private fees, but as local authorities feel the squeeze more and more their contributions are not keeping up with rising costs. The industry has argued without it the NHS would be crippled. Raj Sehgal, founding director of ArmsCare, a family-run group of six care homes in Norfolk, said the NIC increase means a Â£360,000 annual impact on the group's Â£3.6m payroll. In an attempt to offset those costs, the group is scrapping staff bonuses and freezing management salaries. It is also considering reducing day hours, where there are more staff on, so the fewer numbers of night staff work longer hours and with no paid break. Mr Sehgal said: \"But what that does do unfortunately, is impact the quality you're going to be able to provide, at a time when we need to be improving quality, but something has to give. \"The government just doesn't seem to understand that the funding needs to be there. You cannot keep enforcing higher costs on businesses and not be able to fund those without actually finding the money from somewhere.\" He said the issue is exacerbated by the fact local authority funding, despite increasing to 5%, will not cover the 10% rise. \"It's going to be a really, really tough ride. And we are going to see a number of providers close their doors,\" he warned. Nadra Ahmed, executive co-chair of the National Care Association, said those who receive, or are waiting to access, care as well as staff will feel the impact the hardest. \"As providers see further shortfalls in the commissioning of care services, they will start to limit what they can do to ensure their viability or, as a last resort exit the market,\" she said. \"This is very short-sighted, with serious consequences, which alludes to the understanding of this government.\" Government decided to 'wipe the slate clean' A Treasury spokesperson told Sky News the government is \"pro-business\" but has \"taken the difficult but necessary decisions to wipe the slate clean and properly fund our public services after years of declines\". \"Our budget choices have already delivered an NHS with falling waiting lists, a Â£3.7bn rescue package for social care, and vital protection for Britain's small businesses,\" they said. \"We're making tough choices today to secure a better tomorrow through our Plan for Change. By investing in economic growth and early years education while capping corporation tax, we're putting more money in working people's pockets and giving every child the best start in life.\""

Officers and paramedics were called shortly after 3pm on Friday to Beckenham Place Park in Lewisham.

In a statement, officers added that emergency services are \"co-ordinating a search\" and \"the park has been evacuated\". Beckenham Place Park, which borders the London borough of Bromley, covers around 240 acres, according to the park's website.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n \"Truth and reconciliation\" - it felt like an interesting phrase after everything that's been said in the past two weeks, but it came from a source close to the current Sentebale team, when I asked if they could really see any chance of rebuilding what has gone wrong. It's been explosive. First, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, the founders, said they'd taken the \"heartbreaking\" decision to step away in solidarity with the trustees, who had found working with the chair Dr Sophie Chandauka \"untenable\". Then Dr Chandauka, speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky News last Sunday, accused Prince Harry of \"harassment and bullying at scale\". A source close to the charity's former trustees described her allegations as \"categorically false\" and \"completely baseless\". This week I've been in communication with those on both sides. The acrimony and anger have been palpable, but equally clear from my conversations has been the desire on all sides to try and explain what they feel caused this catastrophic breakdown. All parties are keen \"that polo match\" doesn't become the distraction - the match where it looked like Dr Chandauka and the Sussexes had fallen out. All of those involved want that to be put to one side, as they tell me there are much more fundamental questions that need to be answered. Taking on board everything I've been told, you can largely boil it down to three main areas. How was the charity being run? I've been told work had been going on for some time internally to look at the governance of Sentebale. Was the current setup - how it was being run and the composition of the chair, trustees and the people in those roles - appropriate for a charity heading towards its 20th anniversary? \n                  Sentebale: Watchdog opens case into 'concerns raised' at charity set up by Prince Harry\n                 \n                  Prince Harry's charity row explained: Why he left Sentebale and what happens now\n                 \n                  Catastrophic row risks Harry's deeply personal tribute to Princess Diana\n                 What was the future for Sentebale? Set up because of a genuine heartfelt desire to help young people in Lesotho with HIV and AIDS, was it time for them to broaden that remit? Were there obstacles to those changes happening? But also did it really need to fundamentally change? And financially what was going on? Again a lot has been said by both sides about money spent on consultants' fees, and who may have been responsible for sponsors stepping away, and fundraising levels falling. On Friday, the Charity Commission confirmed it has now opened a compliance case to assess concerns raised about the charity.  In a statement, Dr Chandauka said: \"We hope that, together, these actions will give the general public, our colleagues, partners, supporters, donors and the communities we serve comfort that Sentebale and its new board of trustees are acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture for Sentebale to thrive.\" Prince Harry's statement, also representing Prince Seeiso and the former trustees, said: \"We share in the relief that the Charity Commission confirmed they will be conducting a robust inquiry. We fully expect it will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign. We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve.\" Read more:Prince Harry's charity row explainedAnalysis: Row risks Harry's personal tribute to DianaClaims at charity set up by Prince Harry 'a surprise' One insider, still working for the charity, did tell me they still had some hope that there may come a time when there would be some form of \"truth and reconciliation process\". They added that they have always felt \"if you keep your eye on the charitable objective, then I've often found everything falls into place\". Ultimately, at times this week, it has felt like that has been lost from this story. With all the blame and accusations flying around, there's been little attention on the young people they support, and those they want to help in the future, that could seriously lose out. Sentebale means so much to Harry, I had in some ways expected more of a robust response to the allegations being laid firmly at his door.  In recent years, unleashed from the constraints of royal life, he hasn't been one to hold back. But you wonder how much everything else that's been going on at home this week prevented him from more publicly responding. My inbox has had constant updates from Meghan's brand \"As Ever\", you have to remember this was meant to be Meghan's big week, where her new products, including flower sprinkles and raspberry spread, finally went on sale and sold out within hours. In some ways that context underlines one of the difficulties some have spoken to me about, with Harry living this new life. Speak to those on both sides of this row, and one thing they will actually agree on is that Harry remains a man committed to those principles of service, duty and helping others - it's in his DNA. But unlike when he was a working royal, commercial interests are now at play, and that may impact other aspects of his philanthropic endeavours. Now it's all in the hands of the Charity Commission, and for now, both sides have fallen silent."

        "Content": "By Jayson Mansaray, arts and entertainment producer  Despite The Who's Quadrophenia being set over 60 years ago, Pete Townshend's themes of identity, mental health, and modern masculinity are just as relevant today. The album is having a renaissance as Pete Townshend's Quadrophenia A Mod ballet is being brought to life via dance at Sadler's Wells East, and Sky News has an exclusive first look. As Townshend puts it, the album he wrote is \"perfect\" for the stage. \"My wife Rachel did the orchestration for me, and as soon as I heard it I said to her it would make a fabulous ballet and we never really let that go,\" he tells Sky News. \"Heavy percussion, concussive sequences. They're explosive moments. They're also romantic movement moments.\" If you identify with the demographics of Millennial, Gen Y or Gen Z, you might not be familiar with The Who and Mod culture. But in post-war Britain the Mods were a cultural phenomenon characterised by fashion, music, and of course, scooters. The young rebels were seen as a counter-culture to the establishment and The Who, with Roger Daltry's lead vocals and Pete Townshend's writing, were the soundtrack. \n                  The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey tells fans he's going blind during live show\n                 \n                  Shel Talmy, producer who worked with David Bowie, The Kinks and The Who, dies aged 87\n                 \n                  Stamps celebrate 60 years of The Who including iconic album covers\n                 Quadrophenia the album is widely regarded as an essay on the British adolescent experience at the time, focusing on the life of fictional protagonist Jimmy - a young Mod struggling with his sanity, self-doubt, and alienation.â€¯ Townshend sets the rock opera in 1965 but thinks its themes of identity, mental health, and modern masculinity are just as relevant today. He says: \"The phobias and the restrictions and the unwritten laws about how young men should behave. The ground that they broke, that we broke because I was a part of it. \"Men were letting go of [the] wartime-related, uniform-related stance that if I wear this kind of outfit it makes me look like a man.\" This struggle of modern masculinity and identity appears to be echoing today as manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate, incel culture, and Netflix's Adolescence make headlines. For dancer Paris Fitzpatrick, who takes on the lead role of Jimmy, the story resonates. \"I think there's a connection massively and I think there may even be a little more revival in some way,\" he tells Sky News. \"I love that myself. I love non-conforming to gender norms and typical masculinity; I think it's great to challenge things.\" Despite the album being written before he was born, the dancer says he was familiar with the genre already. \"I actually did an art GCSE project about Mods and rockers and Quadrophenia,\" he says. \"I think we'll be able to bring it to new audiences and hopefully, maybe people will be inspired to to learn more about their music and the whole cultural movement of the early 60s.\" Read more from Sky News:Tributes to 'genius' KilmerRichest billionaires namedSpringsteen's seven new albums In 1979, the album was adapted into a film directed by Franc Roddam starring Ray Winstone and Sting but Townshend admits because the film missed key points he is \"not a big fan\". \"What it turned out to be in the movie was a story about culture, about social scenario and less about really the specifics of mental illness and how that affects young people,\" he adds, also complimenting Roddam's writing for the film. Perhaps a testament to Pete Townshend's creativity, Quadrophenia started as an album, was successfully adapted to film and now it will hit the stage as a contemporary ballet. It appears that over six decades later Mod culture is still cool and their issues still relatable. Quadrophenia, a Mod Ballet will tour to Plymouth Theatre Royal from 28 May to 1 June 2025, Edinburgh Festival Theatre from 10 to 14 June 2025 and the Mayflower, Southampton from 18 to 21 June 2025 before having its official opening at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London on 24 June running to 13 July 2025 and then visiting The Lowry, Salford from 15 to 19 July 2025."

        "Content": "Prince Andrew's reputation was \"irrecoverable\" following his Newsnight interview, according to his senior aide. A witness statement from Dominic Hampshire also reveals he was told by intelligence services they had \"genuine concerns\" about the alleged Chinese spy Yang Tengbo and his \"influence on the Duke of York\". The court papers, released on Friday, were used in a case related to Yang, who was excluded from the UK on national security grounds in March 2023. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Hampshire, who worked with the Duke of York until leaving the royal household in 2022, provided evidence to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). His evidence was initially kept private, but the commission released it on Friday after appeals by news organisations. Here are some of the key points from his evidence: â€¢ Mr Hampshire had two meetings with Prince Andrew and the King to discuss a fund connected to Yang Tengbo. â€¢ Prince Andrew \"has always had a communication channel\" with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. â€¢ Intelligence services had \"genuine concerns\" about Yang and his \"influence on the Duke of York\". â€¢ Mr Hampshire used \"significant artistic licence\" with Yang to stroke his ego. â€¢ Yang \"categorically does not have a close relationship with the duke\". Some of the evidence related to the prince's disastrous BBC interview about Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Hampshire said: \"After the Newsnight interview and in the following few months, it was clear that the duke's reputation was irrecoverable. \"This was a common feeling within the royal household, despite what the duke thought may happen. \"It was very clear internally within the royal household that we would have to look at options for the duke's future away from royal duties.\" Mr Hampshire added that, while he appreciated Yang's \"loyalty and support for standing by the duke when all others were deserting him\", Yang - referred to as Chris - \"categorically does not have a close relationship with the duke\". Judges banned Yang from the UK, saying the businessman was a \"close confidant\" of Prince Andrew and posed a threat to national security. Yang unsuccessfully challenged that decision. The documents show that Mr Hampshire had two meetings with the Duke of York and the King at which a fund known as the Eurasia Fund was discussed. That fund is connected to Yang. King met Andrew's aide Buckingham Palace issued a statement on Friday to confirm the scope of those meetings: \"While His Majesty met with The Duke and his adviser [Dominic Hampshire] to hear outline proposals for independent funding over the past year, the individual known as H6 [Yang] was not mentioned at any time or in any way as part of these discussions.\" Royal correspondent We now know considerably more about the plans and proposals to help Prince Andrew move forward after his car crash television interview. And how the late Queen and the King were both kept informed about the ideas being considered, including two meetings with the King, the duke and his most senior advisor. It's also much clearer how disastrous the interview had been for the duke's reputation. And how Andrew's connections with China were possibly his only hope when it came to his next move, outside life as a working royal. The palace would much rather all this had been kept secret.\n The fact a statement has been released is significant and shows how keen the royal household is to distance itself from any association with the alleged Chinese spy. We know too that the palace disputes some of the assertions made in Dominic Hampshire's candid witness statement. Mr Hampshire was one of the few people who stuck by the prince after the Newsnight interview. He played a considerable role in efforts to find Andrew future employment. The Duke of York has posed a real problem for the King and continues to do so. His finances have long been questioned, including how he affords the upkeep of Royal Lodge, his Windsor home. Dominic Hampshire made considerable attempts to block the release of these documents. Which once more underscores how Prince Andrew's past still haunts him and his family to this day. In his witness statement, Mr Hampshire said that the duke \"has always had a communication channel\" with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, \"largely to support the success of Pitch@Palace in China, and this was never hidden\". However, he dismissed the significance of the communications: \"The content of the letters was a top-level 'nothingness' and a courtesy-type of letter. For example, the duke sends a letter to the president for his birthday each year.\" Read more from Sky News:Who is Yang Tengbo?Royal aide made a 'mystifying' decisionAndrew's 'crude attempt to enrich himself' Blowing smoke and stroking his ego He added: \"As is regularly the case in some communications, there was significant artistic license in 'blowing smoke' and stroking his [Yang's] ego to maintain... support of the duke.\" Yang was known only as H6 until a judge lifted an anonymity order in December 2024. The Chinese national was first excluded from the UK in 2023 after the Home Office said he was considered to have engaged in \"covert and deceptive activity\" on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Yang has previously stated that \"the widespread description of me as a 'spy' is entirely untrue\". In a separate statement released on Friday, Mr Hampshire said: \"The Palace was kept informed of all my commercial endeavours on behalf of the Duke of York, and full disclosure of all communications with Mr Yang, the Hampton Group and China was offered to both Buckingham Palace and the intelligence services. \"At all times I sought to protect the best interests of the Royal Family with integrity and loyalty. \"I am now a private businessman and none of my business interests are connected to any member of the Royal Family.\""

        "Content": " The UK has had its hottest day of the year so far - as a \"severe\" rating for wildfires remaining in place across the country. Temperatures across the south of England reached 23C on Friday, making it the warmest day since 21 September 2024, the Met Office said. The highest temperature on Friday was 23.7C (74.6F) in Otterbourne, Hampshire, while Wales also had its warmest day of the year so far, where it was 22.4C (72.3F) in Usk. The Met Office said the temperature is \"very warm for early April\", with the average for this time of year typically around 12C in England and 10C in Scotland. Check the latest forecast where you are Sky News meteorologist Jo Robinson said the weather will continue to be \"dry and sunny\" into Saturday and Sunday. She said daytime temperatures are expected to remain above average in the south and west, with the cool wind easing next week as high pressure becomes centred over the UK and Ireland. It comes as the Met Office has predicted a \"severe\" likelihood of wildfires breaking out across parts of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, due to current weather conditions. The forecaster said the combination of \"ongoing dry, warm, but often breezy, weather\" could lead to further outbreaks of fires after blazes broke out in Dorset and Scotland earlier this week. The \"severe\" wildfire rating was first issued by the Met Office on 1 April. The Met Office said it will be downgraded in some areas from Sunday, but remains at an amber level in the South East of England. Warnings not to use BBQs Ahead of the warm weekend, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has advised Londoners not to have barbecues in open spaces, to avoid inadvertently starting a fire. LFB assistant commissioner Paul McCourt said: \"We want everyone to enjoy the sunshine, but we urge people to take the necessary precautions to stay safe and help prevent a grass fire from starting.â€¯ \"The Met Office has issued an amber wildfire warning, covering London, and this will be in place for the rest of the week. \"As the weather warms up and we head towards Friday and the weekend, we would urge Londoners not to have barbecues in open spaces or on balconies, including disposable barbecues, to throw rubbish away, and to dispose of cigarettes carefully to avoid inadvertently starting a fire.\" A similar warning was issued by the Isle of Man Fire and Rescue Service, who posted on Facebook to warn: \"Wildfires spread fast, leaving behind scorched landscapes, lost habitats, and can be a big strain on firefighter resources. \"Don't let carelessness be the cause!\" Several hectares of woodland in the Moors Valley Country Park on the Dorset-Hampshire border have already been destroyed due to wildfires that broke out on Monday and Wednesday.  Two more major wildfires at nearby Canford Heath in Dorset were also tackled by the Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service overnight into Thursday morning. While in Scotland, a large grass fire at Gartur Moss in Port of Menteith, Stirling, stretched for half a kilometre. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service then attended a separate fire on Thursday just north of Loch Dee in Galloway Forest Park. Officials said there is a \"very high to extreme\" risk of wildfire remains across the country until Monday and urged the public not to light fires outdoors. What has caused the UK's wildfires? Wildfires are not that unusual during spring in the UK, but recent dry weather has raised the fire risk, Sky News weather presenter Kirsty McCabe says. She says that during March, Scotland recorded around 64% of its average March rainfall, with southern Scotland only recording 49%. According to provisional figures from the Met Office, the UK recorded just 43% of its average rainfall for March. \"If we look at the UK as a whole, March was a very dry month, with below average rainfall for many,\" McCabe says.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹The last blast furnaces left operating in Britain could see their fate sealed within days, after their Chinese owners took the decision to cut off the crucial supply of ingredients keeping them running. Jingye, the owner of British Steel in Scunthorpe, has, according to union representatives, cancelled future orders for the iron ore, coal and other raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running. The upshot is that they may have to close next month - even sooner than the earliest date suggested for its closure. Read more: Thousands of jobs at risk as British Steel consults unions over closure The fate of the blast furnaces - the last two domestic sources of virgin steel, made from iron ore rather than recycled - is likely to be determined in a matter of days, with the Department for Business and Trade now actively pondering nationalisation. The upshot is that even as Britain contends with a trade war across the Atlantic, it is now working against the clock to secure the future of steelmaking at Scunthorpe. The talks between the government and Jingye broke down last week after the Chinese company, which bought British Steel out of receivership in 2020, rejected a Â£500m offer of public money to replace the existing furnaces with electric arc furnaces. \n                  How have Trump's tariffs already affected China?\n                 \n                  In the engine room of China's economy Trump's tariffs are already beginning to bite\n                 \n                  Zhenhao Zou: More than 20 new potential victims come forward after 'prolific' rapist convicted for assaulting 10 women\n                 The sum is the same one it offered to Tata Steel, which has shut down the other remaining UK blast furnaces in Port Talbot and is planning to build electric furnaces - which have far lower carbon emissions. However, the owners argue that the amount is too little to justify extra investment at Scunthorpe, and said last week they were now consulting on the date of shutting both the blast furnaces and the attached steelworks. Since British Steel is the main provider of steel rails to Network Rail - as well as other construction steels available from only a few sites in the world - the closure would leave the UK more reliant on imports for critical infrastructure sites. However, since the site belongs to its Chinese owners, a decision to nationalise the site would involve radical steps government officials are wary of taking. They also fear leaving taxpayers exposed to a potentially loss-making business for the long run. The dilemma has been heightened by the sharp turn in geopolitical sentiment following Donald Trump's return to the White House. The incipient trade war and threatened cut in American support to Europe have sparked fresh calls for countries to act urgently to secure their own supplies of critical materials, especially those used for defence and infrastructure.

Israeli imports face a 17% rate, and Indian goods will be subject to 26% tariffs.

        "Headline": "The names have been removed pending further investigation, Gaza's health ministry says. Experts tell Sky News there is no sign of deliberate manipulation.",
        "Content": "By Ben van der Merwe, digital investigations journalist  Gaza's health ministry has removed 1,852 people from its official list of fatalities since October, after finding that some had died of natural causes or were alive but had been imprisoned. The list of deaths currently stands at 50,609 following the removals. Almost all of the names removed (97%) had initially been submitted through an online form which allows families to record the deaths of loved ones where the body is missing. The head of the statistics team at Gazaâ€™s health ministry, Zaher Al Wahidi, told Sky News that names submitted via the form had been removed as a precautionary measure pending a judicial investigation into each one. \"We realised that a lot of people [submitted via the form] died a natural death,\" Mr Wahidi said. \"Maybe they were near an explosion and they had a heart attack, or [living in destroyed] houses caused them pneumonia or hypothermia. All these cases we donâ€™t [attribute to] the war.\" Others submitted via the form were found to be imprisoned or to be missing with insufficient evidence that they had died. Some families submitting false claims, Mr Wahidi said, may have been motivated by the promise of government financial assistance. It is the largest removal of names from the list since the war began, and comes after 1,441 names were removed between August and October - 54% of them originating in hospital morgue records rather than the online form. Mr Wahidi says his team audited the hospital data after receiving complaints from people who had ended up on the list despite being alive. They found that hospital clerks, when operating without access to the central population registry and lacking full names or dates of birth for the dead, had marked the wrong people as dead in their records. In total, 8% of people who were listed as dead in August have since been removed from the official death toll. Many of those may later be added back in, as the judicial investigations proceed. 'It doesn't look like manipulation' Gabriel Epstein, a research assistant at US thinktank The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there's no reason to think the errors are the result of deliberate manipulation intended to inflate the share of women and children among the dead. \"If 90% of the removed entries were men aged 18-40, that would look like manipulation,\" he said. \"But it doesnâ€™t look like that.\" Of those entries removed since the start of the war and whose demographic information was recorded, 41% are men aged 18 to 60, while 59% are women, children and elderly people. By comparison, 44% of remaining deaths are working-age men. This means that the removals have had the effect of slightly reducing the share of women and children in the official list. Names were previously added to the list without verification Until October, Mr Wahidi said, names submitted via the online form had been added to the official list of registered deaths before undergoing a judicial confirmation process. The publication of unverified deaths submitted via the form had previously led to issues with the data, with 1,295 deaths submitted via the form being removed from the list prior to October. This included 474 people who were later added back again. Sky News previously understood that names from the form were only published after undergoing judicial confirmation. However, Mr Wahidi says this practice only began in October. \"This does cause me to downgrade the quality of the earlier lists, definitely below where I thought they were,\" said Professor Michael Spagat, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. Read more:Analysis: Gaza aid workers' deathsWhat happened to the ceasefire? A Ministry of Health document from July 2024 confirms that names submitted through the online form were, at the time, included in the official fatality list before being verified. These names \"are initially included in the final count of martyrs, but verification procedures are undertaken afterward\", the document says. \"They basically said that they were posting these things provisionally pending investigation,\" said Prof Spagat. \"There may have been literally zero people, including us, who actually absorbed this message, but they werenâ€™t hiding it either.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n \"Truth and reconciliation\" - it felt like an interesting phrase after everything that's been said in the past two weeks, but it came from a source close to the current Sentebale team, when I asked if they could really see any chance of rebuilding what has gone wrong. It's been explosive. First, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, the founders, said they'd taken the \"heartbreaking\" decision to step away in solidarity with the trustees, who had found working with the chair Dr Sophie Chandauka \"untenable\". Then Dr Chandauka, speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky News last Sunday, accused Prince Harry of \"harassment and bullying at scale\". A source close to the charity's former trustees described her allegations as \"categorically false\" and \"completely baseless\". This week I've been in communication with those on both sides. The acrimony and anger have been palpable, but equally clear from my conversations has been the desire on all sides to try and explain what they feel caused this catastrophic breakdown. All parties are keen \"that polo match\" doesn't become the distraction - the match where it looked like Dr Chandauka and the Sussexes had fallen out. All of those involved want that to be put to one side, as they tell me there are much more fundamental questions that need to be answered. Taking on board everything I've been told, you can largely boil it down to three main areas. How was the charity being run? I've been told work had been going on for some time internally to look at the governance of Sentebale. Was the current setup - how it was being run and the composition of the chair, trustees and the people in those roles - appropriate for a charity heading towards its 20th anniversary? \n                  Sentebale: Watchdog opens case into 'concerns raised' at charity set up by Prince Harry\n                 \n                  Prince Harry's charity row explained: Why he left Sentebale and what happens now\n                 \n                  Catastrophic row risks Harry's deeply personal tribute to Princess Diana\n                 What was the future for Sentebale? Set up because of a genuine heartfelt desire to help young people in Lesotho with HIV and AIDS, was it time for them to broaden that remit? Were there obstacles to those changes happening? But also did it really need to fundamentally change? And financially what was going on? Again a lot has been said by both sides about money spent on consultants' fees, and who may have been responsible for sponsors stepping away, and fundraising levels falling. On Friday, the Charity Commission confirmed it has now opened a compliance case to assess concerns raised about the charity.  In a statement, Dr Chandauka said: \"We hope that, together, these actions will give the general public, our colleagues, partners, supporters, donors and the communities we serve comfort that Sentebale and its new board of trustees are acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture for Sentebale to thrive.\" Prince Harry's statement, also representing Prince Seeiso and the former trustees, said: \"We share in the relief that the Charity Commission confirmed they will be conducting a robust inquiry. We fully expect it will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign. We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve.\" Read more:Prince Harry's charity row explainedAnalysis: Row risks Harry's personal tribute to DianaClaims at charity set up by Prince Harry 'a surprise' One insider, still working for the charity, did tell me they still had some hope that there may come a time when there would be some form of \"truth and reconciliation process\". They added that they have always felt \"if you keep your eye on the charitable objective, then I've often found everything falls into place\". Ultimately, at times this week, it has felt like that has been lost from this story. With all the blame and accusations flying around, there's been little attention on the young people they support, and those they want to help in the future, that could seriously lose out. Sentebale means so much to Harry, I had in some ways expected more of a robust response to the allegations being laid firmly at his door.  In recent years, unleashed from the constraints of royal life, he hasn't been one to hold back. But you wonder how much everything else that's been going on at home this week prevented him from more publicly responding. My inbox has had constant updates from Meghan's brand \"As Ever\", you have to remember this was meant to be Meghan's big week, where her new products, including flower sprinkles and raspberry spread, finally went on sale and sold out within hours. In some ways that context underlines one of the difficulties some have spoken to me about, with Harry living this new life. Speak to those on both sides of this row, and one thing they will actually agree on is that Harry remains a man committed to those principles of service, duty and helping others - it's in his DNA. But unlike when he was a working royal, commercial interests are now at play, and that may impact other aspects of his philanthropic endeavours. Now it's all in the hands of the Charity Commission, and for now, both sides have fallen silent."

The Dow lost more than 2,000 points in a single day - that's only happened three times before in its long history. The Nasdaq closed in Bear Market - the opposite of Bull Market - reflecting a 20% drop from a recent high. The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P500 Index all recorded their worst week since the global pandemic five years ago. That's what happens when the world's two largest economies - America and China - declare a trade war.

Jerome Powell said: \"It is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects.\" \"While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it's also possible that the effects could be more persistent,\" he warned.

        "Content": " South Korea's constitutional court has confirmed the dismissal of PresidentÂ Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December after declaring martial law. His decision to send troops onto the streets led to the country's worst political crisis in decades. The court ruled to uphold the impeachment saying the conservative leader \"violated his duty as commander-in-chief by mobilising troops\" when he declared martial law. The president was also said to have taken actions \"beyond the powers provided in the constitution\".  Supporters and opponents of the president gathered in their thousands in central Seoul as they awaited the ruling, with his critics reacting joyfully to the court's verdict once it came through in the early hours of Friday. Explainer: Who is the Yoon Suk Yeol?Analysis: South Korea's reputation rocked by president's dismissal The 64-year-old shocked MPs, the public and international allies in early December when he declared martial law, meaning all existing laws regarding civilians were suspended in place of military law. \n                  South Korea's reputation has been rocked by martial law and president's dismissal\n                 \n                  South Korea: Man found dead after falling into Seoul sinkhole\n                 \n                  'Worst ever' wildfires rage in South Korea, killing at least 24 people\n                 After suddenly declaring martial law, Mr Yoon sent hundreds of soldiers and police officers to the National Assembly. He has argued that he sought to maintain order, but some senior military and police officers sent there have told hearings and investigators that Mr Yoon ordered them to drag out politicians to prevent an assembly vote on his decree. The state of emergency after Mr Yoon declared martial law only lasted about six hours as parliament eventually voted to block the decree. His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December, accusing him of rebellion. Mr Yoon maintained that imposing martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North anti-state forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats. Asia correspondent As Mr Yoonâ€™s impeachment ruling began a nervous hush fell across the thousands who had gathered to watch it. People literally clung to each other in anxious anticipation.  When the verdict came, screaming erupted. South Koreans often sit in orderly groups when they protest.  Not now. People literally leapt to their feet, jumped around and sang traditional protest songs.  But it wasnâ€™t just a moment of celebration, it was a moment of emotion too. We saw at least one grown man openly sobbing. Thereâ€™s a sense people feel theyâ€™ve been pulled back from a precipice, that if Mr Yoon had remained in power the consequences could have been far broader than just who holds the presidency. At least one person we spoke to invoked Korea's years of military dictatorship, many genuinely believe heâ€™d have attempted to reinstate martial law. That past weighs heavy here despite this countryâ€™s remarkable advances.\n\nThe most palpable emotion was relief.  \n\n The unanimous verdict to uphold parliament's impeachment and remove Mr Yoon from office required the support of at least six of the court's eight justices. In January, Mr Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.

She added the deportation was \"an illegal act\", and heard from Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni that Mr Garcia should not have been removed. He said he could not tell the judge on what authority Mr Garcia was arrested, why he was sent to El Salvador, and why the US could not retrieve him.

        "Content": " A US government department has said it is \"disappointed\" following the conviction of aÂ woman for breaching a \"buffer zone\" outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic. Livia Tossici-Bolt, 64, was sentenced on Friday to a conditional discharge for two years at Poole Magistrates' Court after breaching the Public Spaces Protection Order on two days in March 2023. She had held a sign saying: \"Here to talk, if you want\". The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) posted a statement on X, saying: \"We are disappointed with the UK court's conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated 'buffer zone' at an abortion clinic.\" It added: \"Freedom of expression must be protected for all.\" DRL is part of the US State Department, which is responsible for the country's foreign policy and relations. The bureau says its aim is to champion \"American values, including the rule of law and individual rights\" including \"protecting freedom of expression\". Speaking after the case, Tossici-Bolt, a retired medical scientist from Bournemouth, said: \"This is a dark day for Great Britain. I was not protesting and did not harass or obstruct anyone. \"All I did was offer consensual conversation in a public place, as is my basic right, and yet the court found me guilty. \"Freedom of expression is in a state of crisis in the UK. What has happened to this country? The US State Department was right to be concerned by this case as it has serious implications for the entire Western world.\" But District Judge Orla Austin formed a different opinion, telling the court that the defendant \"lacks insight that her presence could have a detrimental effect on the women attending the clinic\". She added: \"I accept her beliefs were truly held beliefs. Although it's accepted this defendant held pro-life views, it's important to note this case is not about the rights and wrongs about abortion but about whether the defendant was in breach of the PSPO [Public Spaces Protection Order].\" Tossici-Bolt was also ordered to pay Â£20,000 towards court costs and a Â£26 victim surcharge. The case has become the focus of a free speech controversy involving the US government. Vice President JD Vance confronted Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on the issue. He said in February he feared free speech in Britain was \"in retreat\". Read more from Sky News:Russell Brand responds to rape chargesTribute to girl who died in house fireTrump suffers no-confidence vote Downing Street said it was vital that women using abortion services can do so \"without being subject to harassment or distress\" and the right to protest does not \"give people the right to harass others\". Asked whether there is a problem with free speech in the UK, the prime minister's spokesperson said Britain has \"a very proud tradition of free speech over many centuries, and we remain proud of it today\". Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council welcomed the conviction, stating that the buffer zone enacted in 2022 was there so patients and staff \"could safely access\" the clinic \"without fear of intimidation\". The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said it welcomed the verdict which \"will protect women and the staff who provide abortion care\". During the trial Rosalind Comyn, defending, said: \"The council hasn't produced any evidence that Ms Tossici-Bolt was in fact either observed by any service user or any other forms of harm were caused by her behaviour. \"My point is not that breaches can never cause harm, rather that there is no evidence that Ms Tossici-Bolt's conduct did in this case.\""

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹The last blast furnaces left operating in Britain could see their fate sealed within days, after their Chinese owners took the decision to cut off the crucial supply of ingredients keeping them running. Jingye, the owner of British Steel in Scunthorpe, has, according to union representatives, cancelled future orders for the iron ore, coal and other raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running. The upshot is that they may have to close next month - even sooner than the earliest date suggested for its closure. Read more: Thousands of jobs at risk as British Steel consults unions over closure The fate of the blast furnaces - the last two domestic sources of virgin steel, made from iron ore rather than recycled - is likely to be determined in a matter of days, with the Department for Business and Trade now actively pondering nationalisation. The upshot is that even as Britain contends with a trade war across the Atlantic, it is now working against the clock to secure the future of steelmaking at Scunthorpe. The talks between the government and Jingye broke down last week after the Chinese company, which bought British Steel out of receivership in 2020, rejected a Â£500m offer of public money to replace the existing furnaces with electric arc furnaces. \n                  How have Trump's tariffs already affected China?\n                 \n                  In the engine room of China's economy Trump's tariffs are already beginning to bite\n                 \n                  Zhenhao Zou: More than 20 new potential victims come forward after 'prolific' rapist convicted for assaulting 10 women\n                 The sum is the same one it offered to Tata Steel, which has shut down the other remaining UK blast furnaces in Port Talbot and is planning to build electric furnaces - which have far lower carbon emissions. However, the owners argue that the amount is too little to justify extra investment at Scunthorpe, and said last week they were now consulting on the date of shutting both the blast furnaces and the attached steelworks. Since British Steel is the main provider of steel rails to Network Rail - as well as other construction steels available from only a few sites in the world - the closure would leave the UK more reliant on imports for critical infrastructure sites. However, since the site belongs to its Chinese owners, a decision to nationalise the site would involve radical steps government officials are wary of taking. They also fear leaving taxpayers exposed to a potentially loss-making business for the long run. The dilemma has been heightened by the sharp turn in geopolitical sentiment following Donald Trump's return to the White House. The incipient trade war and threatened cut in American support to Europe have sparked fresh calls for countries to act urgently to secure their own supplies of critical materials, especially those used for defence and infrastructure.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The cost of having staff is going up this Sunday as the increase in employers' national insurance kicks in. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the October budget employers will have to pay a 15% rate of national insurance contributions (NIC) on their employees from 6 April - up from 13.8%. She also lowered the threshold at which employers pay NIC from Â£9,100 a year to Â£5,000 a year, meaning they start paying at an earlier point on staff salaries. This is on top of the national minimum wage rising, the business relief rate for hospitality, retail and leisure reducing from 75% to 40% and the rising cost of ingredients and services. Sky News spoke to people working in some of the industries that will be hardest hit by the rise in NIC: Nurseries, hospitality, retail, small businesses and care. NURSERIES Nearly all (96% of 728) nurseries surveyed by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said they will have no choice but to put up fees because of the NIC rise, leaving parents to pick up the shortfall. \n                  Bills, bills, bills: How can you beat the hikes?\n                 \n                  Cost of living calculator: See how much your bills are going up\n                 \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves 'rejects' analysis average family set to be Â£1,400 a year poorer by 2030\n                 The NDNA has warned nurseries could close due to the rise, with 14% saying their business is at risk, 69% reducing spending on resources and 39% considering offering fewer places with government-funded hours as 92% said they do not cover their costs. Sarah has two children, with her youngest starting later this month, but they were just informed fees will now be Â£92 a day - compared with Â£59 at the same nursery when her eldest started five years ago. \"I'm not sure how we will afford this. Our salaries haven't increased by 50% during this time,\" she said. \"We're stuck as there aren't enough nursery spaces in our area, so we will have to struggle.\" Karen Richards, director of the Wolds Childcare group in Nottinghamshire, has started a petition to get the government to exempt private nurseries - the majority of providers - from the NIC changes as she said it is unfair nurseries in schools do not have to pay the NIC. She told Sky News she will have to find about Â£183,000 next year to cover the increase across her five nurseries and reducing staff numbers is \"not off the table\" but it is more likely they will reduce the number of children they have. Joeli Brearley, founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group, told Sky News: \"Parents are already drowning in childcare costs, and now, thanks to the national insurance hike, nurseries are passing even more fees on to families who simply can't afford it. \"It's the same story every time - parents pay the price while the government looks the other way. How exactly are we meant to 'boost the economy' when we can't even afford to go to work?\" Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of the NDNA, said staffing costs make up about 75% of nurseries' costs and they will have to find Â£2,600 more per employee to pay for the NIC rise - Â£47,000 for an average nursery. \"The government says it wants to offer 'cheaper childcare' for parents on the one hand but then with the other expects nurseries to absorb the costs of National Insurance Contributions themselves,\" she told Sky News. \"High-quality early education and care gives children the best start in life and enables parents to work. The government must invest in this vital infrastructure to make sure nurseries can continue to deliver this social and economic good.\" HOSPITALITY The hospitality industry has warned of closures, price rises, lack of growth and shorter opening hours. Dan Brod, co-owner of The Beckford Group, a small southwest England restaurant and country pub/hotel group, said the economic situation now is \"much worse\" than during COVID. The group has put plans for two more projects on hold and Mr Brod said the only option is to put up prices, but with the rising supplier costs, wages, business rates and NIC hike they will \"stay still\" financially. Read more:Reeves admits it won't be easy for businesses to absorb NI hikeUK businesses issue warning over 'deeply troubling' Trump tariffs He told Sky News: \"What we're nervous about is we're still in the cost of living crisis and even though our places are in very wealthy areas of the country, Wiltshire, Somerset and Bath, people are feeling the situation in their pockets, people are going out less.\" Mr Brod said they are not getting rid of any staff as their business strongly depends on the quality of their hospitality so they are having to make savings elsewhere. \"I'm still optimistic, I still feel that humans need hospitality but we're not valued as an industry and the social benefit is never taken into account by government.\" Aktar Islam, owner/chef at two Michelin-starred Opheem in Birmingham, said the NIC rise will cost him up to Â£120,000 more in staff costs a year and to maintain the financial position he is in now they would have to make \"another million pounds\". He got emails from eight suppliers on Thursday saying they were raising their costs, and said he will have to raise prices but is concerned about the impact on diners. The restaurateur hires four commis chefs to train each year but will not be able to this year, or the next few. \"It's very short-sighted of the government, you're not going to grow the economy by taxing hospitality out of existence, these sort of businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,\" he said. \"They think if a hospitality business closes another will open but people know it's tough, why would they want to do that? It's not going to happen.\" The chef sent hundreds of his \"at home\" kits to fellow chefs this week for their staff as an acknowledgement of how much of a \"s*** show\" the situation is - \"a little hug from us\". RETAIL Some of the UK's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Boots, Marks & Spencer and Next, wrote to Rachel Reeves after the budget to say the NIC hike would lead to higher consumer prices, smaller pay rises, job cuts and store closures. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), representing more than 200 major retailers and brands, said the costs are so significant neither small or large retailers will be able to absorb them. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury committee in November that job losses due to the NIC changes were likely to be higher than the 50,000 forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon and Accessorize, said retailers had the choice of protecting staff numbers or cancelling investment plans. He said they were trying to protect staff numbers and would be increasing prices but they would likely have to halt plans to increase store numbers. Helen Dickinson, head of the BRC, told Sky News the national living wage rise and NIC increase will cost businesses Â£5bn, adding more than 10% to the cost of hiring someone in an entry-level role. A further tax on packaging coming in October means retailers will face Â£7bn in extra costs this year, she said. \"This huge cost burden will undoubtedly reduce investment in stores and jobs and is likely to lead to higher prices,\" she added. SMALL BUSINESSES A massive 85% of 1,400 small business owners surveyed by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in March reported rising costs compared with the same time last year, with 47% citing tax as the main barrier to growth - the highest level in more than a decade. Just 8% of those businesses saw an increase in staff numbers over the last quarter, while 21% had to reduce their workforce. Kate Rumsey, whose family has run Rumsey's Chocolates in Wendover, Buckinghamshire and Thame, Oxfordshire, for 21 years, said the NIC rise, minimum wage increase and business relief rate reduction will push her staff costs up by 15 to 17% - Â£70,000 to Â£80,000 annually. To offset those costs, she has had to reduce opening hours, including closing on Sundays and bank holidays in one shop for the first time ever, make one person redundant, not replace short-term staff and introduce a hiring freeze. The soaring price of cocoa has added to her woes and she has had to increase prices by about 10% and will raise them further. She told Sky News: \"We're very much taking more of a short-term view at the moment, it's so seasonal in this business so I said to the team we'll just get through Q1 then re-evaluate. \"I feel this is a bit about the survival of the fittest and many businesses won't survive.\" Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the FSB, said the NIC rise \"holds back growth\" and has seen small business confidence drop to its lowest point since the first year of the pandemic. With the \"highest tax burden for 70 years\", she called on the chancellor to introduce a \"raft of pro-small business measures\" in the autumn budget so it can deliver on its pledge for growth. She reminded employers they can claim the Employment Allowance, which has doubled after an FSB campaign to take the first Â£10,500 off an employer's annual bill.  CARE The care sector has been warning the government since the October that budget care homes will be forced to close due to the financial pressures the employers' national insurance rise will place on them. Care homes receive funding from councils as well as from private fees, but as local authorities feel the squeeze more and more their contributions are not keeping up with rising costs. The industry has argued without it the NHS would be crippled. Raj Sehgal, founding director of ArmsCare, a family-run group of six care homes in Norfolk, said the NIC increase means a Â£360,000 annual impact on the group's Â£3.6m payroll. In an attempt to offset those costs, the group is scrapping staff bonuses and freezing management salaries. It is also considering reducing day hours, where there are more staff on, so the fewer numbers of night staff work longer hours and with no paid break. Mr Sehgal said: \"But what that does do unfortunately, is impact the quality you're going to be able to provide, at a time when we need to be improving quality, but something has to give. \"The government just doesn't seem to understand that the funding needs to be there. You cannot keep enforcing higher costs on businesses and not be able to fund those without actually finding the money from somewhere.\" He said the issue is exacerbated by the fact local authority funding, despite increasing to 5%, will not cover the 10% rise. \"It's going to be a really, really tough ride. And we are going to see a number of providers close their doors,\" he warned. Nadra Ahmed, executive co-chair of the National Care Association, said those who receive, or are waiting to access, care as well as staff will feel the impact the hardest. \"As providers see further shortfalls in the commissioning of care services, they will start to limit what they can do to ensure their viability or, as a last resort exit the market,\" she said. \"This is very short-sighted, with serious consequences, which alludes to the understanding of this government.\" Government decided to 'wipe the slate clean' A Treasury spokesperson told Sky News the government is \"pro-business\" but has \"taken the difficult but necessary decisions to wipe the slate clean and properly fund our public services after years of declines\". \"Our budget choices have already delivered an NHS with falling waiting lists, a Â£3.7bn rescue package for social care, and vital protection for Britain's small businesses,\" they said. \"We're making tough choices today to secure a better tomorrow through our Plan for Change. By investing in economic growth and early years education while capping corporation tax, we're putting more money in working people's pockets and giving every child the best start in life.\""

Joeli Brearley, founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group, told Sky News: \"Parents are already drowning in childcare costs, and now, thanks to the national insurance hike, nurseries are passing even more fees on to families who simply can't afford it. \"It's the same story every time - parents pay the price while the government looks the other way. How exactly are we meant to 'boost the economy' when we can't even afford to go to work?\" Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of the NDNA, said staffing costs make up about 75% of nurseries' costs and they will have to find Â£2,600 more per employee to pay for the NIC rise - Â£47,000 for an average nursery. \"The government says it wants to offer 'cheaper childcare' for parents on the one hand but then with the other expects nurseries to absorb the costs of National Insurance Contributions themselves,\" she told Sky News. \"High-quality early education and care gives children the best start in life and enables parents to work. The government must invest in this vital infrastructure to make sure nurseries can continue to deliver this social and economic good.\" HOSPITALITY The hospitality industry has warned of closures, price rises, lack of growth and shorter opening hours. Dan Brod, co-owner of The Beckford Group, a small southwest England restaurant and country pub/hotel group, said the economic situation now is \"much worse\" than during COVID. The group has put plans for two more projects on hold and Mr Brod said the only option is to put up prices, but with the rising supplier costs, wages, business rates and NIC hike they will \"stay still\" financially.

He got emails from eight suppliers on Thursday saying they were raising their costs, and said he will have to raise prices but is concerned about the impact on diners. The restaurateur hires four commis chefs to train each year but will not be able to this year, or the next few. \"It's very short-sighted of the government, you're not going to grow the economy by taxing hospitality out of existence, these sort of businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,\" he said. \"They think if a hospitality business closes another will open but people know it's tough, why would they want to do that? It's not going to happen.\" The chef sent hundreds of his \"at home\" kits to fellow chefs this week for their staff as an acknowledgement of how much of a \"s*** show\" the situation is - \"a little hug from us\". RETAIL Some of the UK's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Boots, Marks & Spencer and Next, wrote to Rachel Reeves after the budget to say the NIC hike would lead to higher consumer prices, smaller pay rises, job cuts and store closures. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), representing more than 200 major retailers and brands, said the costs are so significant neither small or large retailers will be able to absorb them. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury committee in November that job losses due to the NIC changes were likely to be higher than the 50,000 forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon and Accessorize, said retailers had the choice of protecting staff numbers or cancelling investment plans. He said they were trying to protect staff numbers and would be increasing prices but they would likely have to halt plans to increase store numbers. Helen Dickinson, head of the BRC, told Sky News the national living wage rise and NIC increase will cost businesses Â£5bn, adding more than 10% to the cost of hiring someone in an entry-level role. A further tax on packaging coming in October means retailers will face Â£7bn in extra costs this year, she said. \"This huge cost burden will undoubtedly reduce investment in stores and jobs and is likely to lead to higher prices,\" she added. SMALL BUSINESSES A massive 85% of 1,400 small business owners surveyed by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in March reported rising costs compared with the same time last year, with 47% citing tax as the main barrier to growth - the highest level in more than a decade. Just 8% of those businesses saw an increase in staff numbers over the last quarter, while 21% had to reduce their workforce. Kate Rumsey, whose family has run Rumsey's Chocolates in Wendover, Buckinghamshire and Thame, Oxfordshire, for 21 years, said the NIC rise, minimum wage increase and business relief rate reduction will push her staff costs up by 15 to 17% - Â£70,000 to Â£80,000 annually. To offset those costs, she has had to reduce opening hours, including closing on Sundays and bank holidays in one shop for the first time ever, make one person redundant, not replace short-term staff and introduce a hiring freeze. The soaring price of cocoa has added to her woes and she has had to increase prices by about 10% and will raise them further. She told Sky News: \"We're very much taking more of a short-term view at the moment, it's so seasonal in this business so I said to the team we'll just get through Q1 then re-evaluate. \"I feel this is a bit about the survival of the fittest and many businesses won't survive.\" Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the FSB, said the NIC rise \"holds back growth\" and has seen small business confidence drop to its lowest point since the first year of the pandemic. With the \"highest tax burden for 70 years\", she called on the chancellor to introduce a \"raft of pro-small business measures\" in the autumn budget so it can deliver on its pledge for growth. She reminded employers they can claim the Employment Allowance, which has doubled after an FSB campaign to take the first Â£10,500 off an employer's annual bill.  CARE The care sector has been warning the government since the October that budget care homes will be forced to close due to the financial pressures the employers' national insurance rise will place on them. Care homes receive funding from councils as well as from private fees, but as local authorities feel the squeeze more and more their contributions are not keeping up with rising costs. The industry has argued without it the NHS would be crippled. Raj Sehgal, founding director of ArmsCare, a family-run group of six care homes in Norfolk, said the NIC increase means a Â£360,000 annual impact on the group's Â£3.6m payroll. In an attempt to offset those costs, the group is scrapping staff bonuses and freezing management salaries. It is also considering reducing day hours, where there are more staff on, so the fewer numbers of night staff work longer hours and with no paid break. Mr Sehgal said: \"But what that does do unfortunately, is impact the quality you're going to be able to provide, at a time when we need to be improving quality, but something has to give. \"The government just doesn't seem to understand that the funding needs to be there. You cannot keep enforcing higher costs on businesses and not be able to fund those without actually finding the money from somewhere.\" He said the issue is exacerbated by the fact local authority funding, despite increasing to 5%, will not cover the 10% rise. \"It's going to be a really, really tough ride. And we are going to see a number of providers close their doors,\" he warned. Nadra Ahmed, executive co-chair of the National Care Association, said those who receive, or are waiting to access, care as well as staff will feel the impact the hardest. \"As providers see further shortfalls in the commissioning of care services, they will start to limit what they can do to ensure their viability or, as a last resort exit the market,\" she said. \"This is very short-sighted, with serious consequences, which alludes to the understanding of this government.\" Government decided to 'wipe the slate clean' A Treasury spokesperson told Sky News the government is \"pro-business\" but has \"taken the difficult but necessary decisions to wipe the slate clean and properly fund our public services after years of declines\". \"Our budget choices have already delivered an NHS with falling waiting lists, a Â£3.7bn rescue package for social care, and vital protection for Britain's small businesses,\" they said. \"We're making tough choices today to secure a better tomorrow through our Plan for Change. By investing in economic growth and early years education while capping corporation tax, we're putting more money in working people's pockets and giving every child the best start in life.\""

Despite balmy spring weather with sunny skies and temperatures in the high teens Celsius, no migrants arrived in small boats from Europe for the week between 28 March and 3 April.

The start of 2025 has seen the highest number of people making small boat crossings at the start of the year since records began in 2018, with almost 6,500 people making the trip - roughly 1,000 more than this time last year.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       Calls are growing for the UK to withdraw from the treaty banning the use of landmines. Nations in eastern Europe, including Poland and Finland, have signalled they will leave the 1997 Ottawa Treaty so they are allowed to lay mines amid an increasing threat from Russia and Belarus. The UK government remains committed to staying part of the Ottawa Treaty, but some want it to be abandoned or at least reviewed. Politics latest: PM will speak to world leaders over the weekend In a debate in the House of Lords, several peers made the case for the UK being more open to the use of landmines, including the Duke of Wellington, former soldiers and aid workers and the grandson of prime minister Clement Attlee. Former defence secretary Sir Ben Wallace has also called for the UK to withdraw from the treaty. Lord Robathan, who was an officer in the Coldstream Guards and also in the SAS before becoming a Conservative MP, recalled a vehicle he was in was hit by a mine in Iraq. \n                  'Sensitive military documents' found in Newcastle street\n                 \n                  Spring statement: Rachel Reeves to bring back 'securonomics' but in a markedly different guise\n                 \n                  Defence firms held back by UK ethical banking standards, industry says\n                 The Ottawa Treaty was signed in late 1997, with the UK as one of the initial members. Nations that are not signatories include Russia, China, Iran, India, North Korea, South Korea and the United States. According to the UN, more than 40 million mines have been destroyed since the treaty came into force and \"vast\" previously mined areas have been cleared. He described the Ottawa Treaty as \"window dressing\" - adding that British soldiers \"should have\" the defence of being able to use landmines should the UK enter a war. \"I have seen UK soldiers maimed in Afghanistan and Iraq in the recent past. \"This convention does nothing for them or for peace. It takes away one line of defence from our own soldiers,\" he said. Lord Robathan also spoke of his work clearing landmines. The Duke of Wellington, a descendant of Arthur Wellesley who won the Battle of Waterloo, told the chamber how he was a trustee of the HALO Trust that worked with Princess Diana on de-mining. But 25 years after the Ottawa Treaty was signed, \"the military situation has changed unimaginably\", the duke said - claiming that potentially millions of mines have been laid by Russia. The duke said he wanted changes to how the UK interprets the treaty. \"I humbly suggest to the minister that the government seek to preserve the principles of the Ottawa convention but attempt to modify it to take account of the new technologies and the transformed military situation in Europe,\" he said. The Ottawa Treaty also prevents the UK from producing, selling and transferring mines to other nations.

Friday 4 April marks International Mine Awareness Day, and barrister Ben Keith of Campaign For Landmine Justice used the event to call for action to be taken against nations using the weapons. Mr Keith told Sky News that countries using mines and companies making them should contribute to a UN fund for victims. He said: \"Victims need comprehensive support including medical care, psychological counselling, prosthetics, vocational training, and social reintegration services. \"Their needs are lifelong, but current funding mechanisms are fragmented, inconsistent, and vastly insufficient.\" Foreign Office minister Baroness Chapman of Darlington responded on behalf of the government. She said the UK has \"engaged\" closely with the nations that are withdrawing from the Ottawa Treaty to understand their decisions. The minister said: \"The government continue to believe that we can advance both our own national security and that of our allies, and the vital humanitarian norms that protect civilians, which these treaties represent. \"Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the fundamental change in the geopolitical context that has taken place, and I am grateful to all noble Lords for raising these questions.\""

Politics Live: UK 'regrets return to protectionism', says Lammy Sky News understands families had concerns about the \"duty of candour\" element being watered down, with a source close to the discussions calling what was proposed an \"absolute mess\". The duty of candour was meant to put a legal duty on public authorities and officials to tell the truth and proactively cooperate with official investigations and inquiries, with criminal punishments for those who breach it. However, the source said what was proposed had \"that many loopholes\" that the duty would be rendered \"useless and ineffective\".

The next anniversary of the 1989 disaster, on 15 April, will mark 36 years since 97 fans were unlawfully killed after gross negligence by police at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield. Shortly before kick-off, supporters were let through a gate, which caused crowding in the stand and a crush. Nobody has ever been convicted for its subsequent cover-up, which sparked a decades-long fight for justice. The Hillsborough Law is also supported by victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, infected blood scandal, and bereaved COVID families, who want to prevent cover-ups in the event of future tragedies and give victims better access to justice when going up against the state.  Government 'fully committed' to duty of candour Sir Keir Starmer first promised the long-awaited legislation two years ago while in opposition, and after winning the general election last year said it would be on the statute books by the time of the next anniversary.

She acknowledged this will be \"disappointing news\", adding that the government remains \"committed to a Hillsborough Law that will include a legal duty of candour for public servants and criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply\". She said: \"We are not walking away. In fact, our engagement with victims, families and survivors will only increase in the weeks ahead. We are determined to listen and work with families and campaigners.\" A government spokesperson echoed that sentiment, telling Sky News: \"The Hillsborough disaster is one of the greatest stains on British history, and the families of those who lost loved ones have shown endless determination to get justice. \"Having consulted with these groups over the past few weeks, we believe more time is needed to draft the best version of a Hillsborough Law. \"We remain fully committed to bringing in this legislation at pace, which will include a legal duty of candour for public servants and criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply.\""

The album is having a renaissance as Pete Townshend's Quadrophenia A Mod ballet is being brought to life via dance at Sadler's Wells East, and Sky News has an exclusive first look. As Townshend puts it, the album he wrote is \"perfect\" for the stage. \"My wife Rachel did the orchestration for me, and as soon as I heard it I said to her it would make a fabulous ballet and we never really let that go,\" he tells Sky News. \"Heavy percussion, concussive sequences.

He says: \"The phobias and the restrictions and the unwritten laws about how young men should behave. The ground that they broke, that we broke because I was a part of it. \"Men were letting go of [the] wartime-related, uniform-related stance that if I wear this kind of outfit it makes me look like a man.\" This struggle of modern masculinity and identity appears to be echoing today as manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate, incel culture, and Netflix's Adolescence make headlines. For dancer Paris Fitzpatrick, who takes on the lead role of Jimmy, the story resonates. \"I think there's a connection massively and I think there may even be a little more revival in some way,\" he tells Sky News. \"I love that myself. I love non-conforming to gender norms and typical masculinity; I think it's great to challenge things.\" Despite the album being written before he was born, the dancer says he was familiar with the genre already. \"I actually did an art GCSE project about Mods and rockers and Quadrophenia,\" he says. \"I think we'll be able to bring it to new audiences and hopefully, maybe people will be inspired to to learn more about their music and the whole cultural movement of the early 60s.\" Read more from Sky News:Tributes to 'genius' KilmerRichest billionaires namedSpringsteen's seven new albums In 1979, the album was adapted into a film directed by Franc Roddam starring Ray Winstone and Sting but Townshend admits because the film missed key points he is \"not a big fan\". \"What it turned out to be in the movie was a story about culture, about social scenario and less about really the specifics of mental illness and how that affects young people,\" he adds, also complimenting Roddam's writing for the film. Perhaps a testament to Pete Townshend's creativity, Quadrophenia started as an album, was successfully adapted to film and now it will hit the stage as a contemporary ballet. It appears that over six decades later Mod culture is still cool and their issues still relatable. Quadrophenia, a Mod Ballet will tour to Plymouth Theatre Royal from 28 May to 1 June 2025, Edinburgh Festival Theatre from 10 to 14 June 2025 and the Mayflower, Southampton from 18 to 21 June 2025 before having its official opening at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London on 24 June running to 13 July 2025 and then visiting The Lowry, Salford from 15 to 19 July 2025."
