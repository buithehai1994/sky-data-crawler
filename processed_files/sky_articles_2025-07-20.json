        "Content": "\n          Special correspondent\n              @AlexCrawfordSky\n  The main road entering the besieged Syrian city of Sweida from the west has changed dramatically over 12 hours. A bulldozer, parked on the side of the road, has been used to create several berms to form a sand barrier around 25km (16 miles) from the city centre. Dozens of Syrian security forces were standing in lines in front of the barricades when we arrived, and there were forces further up the road stopping vehicles from going any further. The Arab tribal fighters we'd seen fighting furiously inside the city the day before were now all camped alongside the road. Some were sleeping on the back of their pick-ups. \"We're not giving up,\" one shouted to us as we walked towards the checkpoint. The ceasefire agreement between Druze leaders who are bunkered down inside the city and the Bedouins - and the tribal fighters who have flocked to join them - has frustrated some. Some of them, waiting with guns slung over their backs, are itching to return to battle. But for now, tribal leaders have instructed them to hold fire. \n                  Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria? \n                 \n                  Inside Sweida: The Syrian city ravaged by sectarian violence - where bodies line streets and homes are burned\n                 \n                  Every shop and home burned or ransacked: The Syrian city engulfed in tribal violence\n                 Read more: Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria? How long that will last is probably key to Syria's future and whether it can be a peaceful one. Khalaf al Modhi, the head of a group of tribes called United Tribes, told the group of fighters: \"We are not against the Druze. We are not here to kill the Druze.\" But he spent many minutes castigating the senior Druze cleric inside Sweida whom many of the tribes see as the agitator behind the violent clashes. Hikmat al Hijiri is head of a Druze faction that is deeply suspicious of the new government led by Ahmed al Sharaa and is resisting ceding power to Damascus. The retreat of the Arab tribes from the city centre means the Druze militia under Hijiri's control are now the ones deciding who goes in or out of the city. About 30,000 mostly Druze people are thought to be trapped inside the city and surrounding towns, with no electricity, little internet and dwindling supplies of food and water. The humanitarian situation is dramatically worsening by the day. But at the time of writing, there were still no agreed safe corridors to bring out those pinned inside. On top of this, there are nearly 130,000 people displaced and forced out of their homes because of the fighting, according to UN estimates. Maintaining the ceasefire is key to ensuring solutions are found to help those suffering, and quickly. It's also the most serious challenge facing the new Syrian leader and his interim government. The level of distrust between the Hijiri-led Druze faction and the new government is strong and deep. So much so that the Druze leaders have refused to accept truckloads of aid organised by any of the government outlets. The new Syrian leader has struggled to convince the country's minorities that their safety under his leadership is assured. Druze civilians and human rights activists reported mass killings and executions of Druze by government troops who were sent in last week to quell the latest clashes between the Druze and Arab Bedouins who have been at odds for many years. Read more from Sky News:At least 67 killed while waiting for aid in Gaza, officials sayFourteen people die in South Korea after torrential rain Government forces pulled out of the city only after Israel unleashed a spate of airstrikes, saying they were defending the Druze. The bombings killed hundreds of Syrian troops. But with the withdrawal of the government troops, the Arab Bedouin population said the city's Druze militia embarked on a string of revenge atrocities. That in turn led to thousands of tribal fighters massing from around the country to defend their Arab brethren. When we were inside the city, we saw multiple corpses lying on the streets, and many appeared to have been killed with a shot to the head. Homes and businesses are still burning after mass pillaging as fighters retreated. And now, there is a growing humanitarian disaster unfolding. Additional reporting by camera operator Garwen McLuckie, specialist producer Chris Cunningham, as well as Syrian producers Mahmoud Mossa and Ahmed Rahhal."

        "Content": "Consumers will get stronger protections with a new water watchdog - as trust in water companies takes a record dive. Environment Secretary Steve Reed will announce on Monday that the government will set up the new water ombudsman with legal powers to resolve disputes, rather than the current voluntary system. The watchdog will mean an expansion of the Consumer Council for Water's (CCW) role and will bring the water sector into line with other utilities that have legally binding consumer watchdogs. Consumers will then have a single point of contact for complaints. Politics latest: Labour should let water companies 'go bust', Farage says The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the new watchdog would help \"re-establish partnership\" between water companies and consumers. A survey by the CCW in May found trust in water companies had reached a new low, with fewer than two-thirds of people saying they provided value for money. Just 35% said they thought charges from water companies were fair - even before the impact could be felt from a 26% increase in bills in April.  Mr Reed is planning a \"root and branch reform\" of the water industry - which he branded \"absolutely broken\" - that he will reveal alongside a major review of the sector on Monday. The review is expected to recommend the scrapping of water regulator Ofwat and the creation of a new one, to incorporate the work of the CCW. Read more:Labour will eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decadeUnder-fire water regulator could be scrapped Campaigners and MPs have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain a focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate infrastructure investment. On Sunday, Mr Reed avoided answering whether he would get rid of Ofwat or not when asked on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. He pledged to halve sewage pollution by water companies by 2030 and said Labour would eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decade. Mr Reed announced £104 billion of private investment to help the government do that. Victoria Atkins MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: \"While stronger consumer protections are welcome in principle, they are only one part of the serious long-term reforms the water sector needs. \"We all want the water system to improve, and honesty about the scale of the challenge is essential. Steve Reed must explain that bill payers are paying for the £104 billion investment plan. Ministers must also explain how replacing one quango with another is going to clean up our rivers and lakes. \"Public confidence in the water system will only be rebuilt through transparency, resilience, and delivery.\""

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @kvittozzi\n  A new public inquiry will \"uncover the truth\" behind the so-called \"Battle of Orgreave\", a bloody fight between striking miners and police officers in the 1980s. One hundred and twenty people were injured in the violent confrontation on 18 June 1984, outside a coal processing factory in Orgreave, South Yorkshire. Five thousand miners clashed with an equal number of armed and mounted police during a day of fighting. Police used horse charges, riot shields and batons against the picketers, even as some were retreating. In the aftermath, miners were blamed for the violence in what campaigners believe was an institutional \"frame-up\". \"There were so many lies,\" says Chris Peace, from campaign group Orgreave Truth and Justice, \"and it's a real historic moment to get to this stage.\" \"There's a lot of information already in the public domain,\" she adds, \"but there's still some papers that are embargoed, which will hopefully now be brought to light.\" \n                  Man guilty of murder after driving into 'Good Samaritan' Chris Marriott following wedding brawl in Sheffield\n                 \n                  Two men charged with murder after teenager hit by car in Sheffield\n                 \n                  Teenager killed in Sheffield crash came to UK months ago 'for a better future'\n                 Although dozens of miners were arrested, trials against them all collapsed due to allegations of unreliable police evidence. Campaigners say some involved have been left with \"physical and psychological damage\", but until now, previous governments have refused calls for a public inquiry. Launching the inquiry today, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky Newsi that she wanted to \"make sure\" campaigners now got \"proper answers\". \"We've obviously had unanswered questions about what happened at Orgreave for over 40 years,\" Ms Cooper says, \"and when we were elected to government, we determined to take this forward.\" The inquiry will be a statutory one, meaning that witnesses will be compelled to come and give evidence, and chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, Pete Wilcox. \"I'm really happy,\" says Carl Parkinson, a former miner who was at Orgreave on the day of the clash, \"but why has it took so long?\" \"A lot of those colleagues and close friends have passed away, and they'll never get to see any outcome.\" Mr Parkinson and Chris Skidmore, who was also there that day, were among the group of campaigners informed first-hand by Ms Cooper about the public inquiry at the Orgreave site. \"It wasn't frightening to start off with,\" Mr Skidmore remembers of the day itself, \"but then what I noticed was the amount of police officers who had no identification numbers on. It all felt planned.\" \"And it wasn't just one truncheon,\" says Mr Parkinson, \"there were about 30, or 40. And it was simultaneous, like it was orchestrated - just boom, boom, boom, boom. \"And there's lads with a split down their heads for no good reason, they'd done nothing wrong. We were just there to peacefully picket.\" In the intervening years, South Yorkshire Police have paid more than £400,000 in compensation to affected miners and their families. But no official inquiry has ever looked at the documents surrounding the day's events, the lead-up to it and the aftermath.

        "Content": "By Dan Whitehead, Sky News correspondent  This was the fourth protest in just nine days here - around 500 people gathered outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is believed to house asylum seekers.  There was no sign of far-right or left that had travelled to the Essex town looking for trouble. Instead, it was locals; families sat on the grass, multi-generations of them, kids playing in the sunshine - tradesmen brought their lorries; a large \"Protect Our Kids\" sign fixed on the back. Between the protesters and those housed inside, around 50 police officers in riot gear lined up beside eight riot vans. There were some troublemakers hiding their faces in the crowd - a few brief moments of tension when bottles and firecrackers were thrown at police. There were six arrests, according to Essex Police, with one relating to damage caused to an unmarked police car, and four related to violent disorder at the same location on Thursday night. But overall - this was event on Sunday peaceful. Residents simply angry about events that have unfolded here in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an asylum seeker was arrested and charged with offences against a teenager and an adult in the town, eight days after arriving in the UK via a boat. Hadush Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, denies the allegations - of three counts of sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and one count of harassment without violence - and was remanded in custody. On Thursday, when he appeared in court, it did boil over outside the hotel - eight officers were injured and arrests continue to be made. One man has been charged and is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday. It was calmer on Sunday night. Mother Nicola is here with her two kids. \"I'm sick and tired of working and paying for these people,\" she tells me. \"I've got a young little girl and I want her to be safe. \"By all means come over. Bring into the economy, no disputing that. But you can't just come over and take and expect everything for nothing.\" Aimee Keteca - a Reform councillor in Essex - was in holding a placard \"I'm not far right - I'm worried about my KIDS\". She says: \"I've got a 16-year-old daughter, I worry about her in my local area. It's right on your doorstep, we've got people here and we don't know who they are.\" These protests are just the latest flashpoint of frustration - a physical place for people to vent anger that's been felt for years and continues to build.

Heavy, thundery downpours are forecast to hit parts of the UK today, with an amber weather warning for rain in place until 8am for the east of Northern Ireland. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: \"It looks like Northern Ireland is the place where we could see the most rainfall and certainly the most impactful rainfall. \"They could see 50 to 75mm of rain within 12 to 18 hours.\" The country records an average of 89mm of rain in July, meaning more than half a month's rainfall could hit Northern Ireland in less than a day. Forecasters have warned of a risk of flash flooding in County Antrim, Armagh and Down. It follows a period of already intense rainfall. Saturday's rain brought 47.2mm to Surrey's Charlwood - close to a month's worth. From 5pm on Saturday to 1pm on Sunday, Scotland's Aboyne recorded 47.6mm. Meanwhile, parts of England and Scotland could see 20-40mm of rain in just two hours today. The south and east of England are covered by a yellow thunderstorm warning until 9pm. By 11am the same warning will be in place for the Midlands, northern England and Scotland. More than 20 flood alerts remain active in England and Scotland. \"We could see some locally heavy downpours, 20 to 40mm of rain is possible in a couple of hours,\" Mr Partridge said. \"That is potentially up to around half a month's worth of rain in a couple of hours in some places. \"You will see quite a lot of water on the roads and difficult driving conditions. \"Hopefully nothing more significant than that, it certainly won't be an issue for any of the rivers because they are quite low.\" Low pressure and humid, moist air across the country will cause the heavy, thundery showers, but even within the warning areas some places will stay dry, the Met Office said. Will the warm weather return? This week the weather will remain unsettled, with further thundery downpours across Britain, particularly in the south.

But warmer weather may return as the month wears on. \"There are signs that high pressure to the southwest may try to extend its influence across the UK, which could bring more in the way of dry, settled weather as we head further into August,\" the weather forecaster says. \"Temperatures will likely continue to be near or above average overall, with a continuing chance of some very warm or hot spells, especially in the south and east, if high pressure wins out for a decent stretch of time.\" "

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n As head of football's anti-racism body, there was dread for Sanjay Bhandari watching England's Women's Euros quarter-final with Sweden. But that's, grimly, how it always is. Concerned that black players will be singled out for blame. Not with a legitimate critique of their performances, but with toxicity and racism. And now Kick It Out is working with the Football Association to support Jess Carter after the England defender spoke out over the abuse she has been targeted with throughout the Women's European Championship. The players want social media firms to do more, but Mr Bhandari, the Kick It Out chairman, is concerned by their limited approach to the scourge of online hate. \"The social media companies need to do far more,\" he told Sky News. \"They've actually gone backwards over the last four or five years, not forwards. It's got worse on social media, not better. \"And they need to provide us with the tools to help keep us safe and to remove some of this toxicity from the platforms. They're just not doing enough. \"I would say that X is the worst. It has become no-holds-barred. \"And with Instagram, it is much more in the direct messaging, and I think there needs to be much more done there to protect people from those messages.\" Meta, which owns Instagram, did not reply to a request for comment. There was no response from an email sent to X's press email address.  LinkedIn indicated that X's UK managing director Jonathan Lewis's account had seen a request for comment, but there was no response. On Friday, Mr Lewis and Premier League club Burnley were celebrating a new partnership in an announcement that made no mention of the abuse that many players across the world face on X. The hope is that the Online Safety Act will lead to social media firms implementing the safety tools required of them. Mr Bhandari said: \"They have to be enforced by law enforcement against individual perpetrators, and also the regulatory parts need to be forced against the social media companies to force them to do the things that they need to do.\" Grimly familiar situation The FA reported the abuse suffered by Carter to police, and the hope is for speedy action because this is a grimly familiar situation. After the men's Euros final in 2021, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were racially abused after missing penalties in the shootout defeat to Italy. While players have been taking a knee against racism in men's and women's games, the Lionesses feel that is no longer enough at these Euros. They will stand instead before the semi-final with Italy because they say a new approach is needed to tackle racism.

        "Content": " A brief scuffle broke out at London's Royal Opera House after a performer unfurled a Palestinian flag during a show. The incident took place during a performance of Il Trovatore on Saturday. During the final night of the 11-night run of the show, a performer held up the flag on stage. In video footage, shared online, someone backstage could be seen attempting to take it off the performer. The performer grabs it back following a brief scuffle. A spokesperson for the Royal Ballet and Opera said: \"The display of the flag was an unauthorised action by the artist. \"It was not approved by the Royal Ballet and Opera and is a wholly inappropriate act.\" The reaction to the flag was mixed, with some people heard applauding and cheering, while another audience member was heard saying \"oh my God\". One poster on X, who claimed to have been a member of the audience, said: \"Extraordinary scenes at the Royal Opera House tonight. \"During the curtain call for Il Trovatore one of the background artists came on stage waving a Palestine flag. Just stood there, no bowing or shouting. Someone off stage kept trying to take it off him.

Bob Vylan were widely criticised after leading on-stage chants of \"death to the IDF\" (Israel Defence Forces). The performance was live-streamed by the BBC, sparking a backlash against the broadcaster - which later issued an apology. The investigation into Kneecap was later dropped, with the police saying there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence\".   "

The killings in northern Gaza didn't take place near distribution points associated with the GHF, which began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, after Israel eased its 11-week blockade of aid into the territory.

The military evacuation demand, which could signal an imminent attack on neighbourhoods in Deir al Balah, alarmed the families of Israeli hostages, who fear their relatives are being held there.  Meanwhile, Pope Leo called for an end to the \"barbarity of war\" on Sunday as he spoke of his profound pain over an Israeli strike on the only Catholic church in Gaza on Thursday. The attack killed three people and wounded 10, including the parish priest, Father Gabriel Romanelli, who developed a close friendship with the late Pope Francis, and was back at the Holy Family Catholic Church for Mass on Sunday. The strike drew condemnation from the pope and US President Donald Trump, and prompted statements of regret from Israel, which said it was an accident. Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar, but international mediators say there have been no breakthroughs."

Rachel Booth, 38, from Northwich, Cheshire, was reported missing after being last seen by her family in the Barnton area. She was seen one final further time at around 3.50am, five miles away, at the Sandiway garage on the A556 road. Police believe she may have travelled to the Oakmere area of Delamere, where police officers, underwater search teams and Cheshire Search and Rescue are currently conducting enquiries. A water park in Delamere, less than two miles away from the petrol station, said it was closed on Sunday due to a police investigation in the surrounding area. Ms Booth is described as 5ft 9ins, of a slim build, with blonde hair and is believed to be wearing black leggings and a black top. Superintendent Paul Hughes said: \"We are currently following a number of inquiries to trace Rachel and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare. \"Investigators are following all lines of inquiry and anyone who has seen Rachel since she was reported missing is asked to contact us,\" he added. \"The same goes for anyone who has any information on her whereabouts. \"We would also like to appeal directly to Rachel to get in touch to let us know you are OK.\""

        "Content": "Consumers will get stronger protections with a new water watchdog - as trust in water companies takes a record dive. Environment Secretary Steve Reed will announce on Monday that the government will set up the new water ombudsman with legal powers to resolve disputes, rather than the current voluntary system. The watchdog will mean an expansion of the Consumer Council for Water's (CCW) role and will bring the water sector into line with other utilities that have legally binding consumer watchdogs. Consumers will then have a single point of contact for complaints. Politics latest: Labour should let water companies 'go bust', Farage says The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the new watchdog would help \"re-establish partnership\" between water companies and consumers. A survey by the CCW in May found trust in water companies had reached a new low, with fewer than two-thirds of people saying they provided value for money. Just 35% said they thought charges from water companies were fair - even before the impact could be felt from a 26% increase in bills in April.  Mr Reed is planning a \"root and branch reform\" of the water industry - which he branded \"absolutely broken\" - that he will reveal alongside a major review of the sector on Monday. The review is expected to recommend the scrapping of water regulator Ofwat and the creation of a new one, to incorporate the work of the CCW. Read more:Labour will eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decadeUnder-fire water regulator could be scrapped Campaigners and MPs have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain a focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate infrastructure investment. On Sunday, Mr Reed avoided answering whether he would get rid of Ofwat or not when asked on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. He pledged to halve sewage pollution by water companies by 2030 and said Labour would eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decade. Mr Reed announced £104 billion of private investment to help the government do that. Victoria Atkins MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: \"While stronger consumer protections are welcome in principle, they are only one part of the serious long-term reforms the water sector needs. \"We all want the water system to improve, and honesty about the scale of the challenge is essential. Steve Reed must explain that bill payers are paying for the £104 billion investment plan. Ministers must also explain how replacing one quango with another is going to clean up our rivers and lakes. \"Public confidence in the water system will only be rebuilt through transparency, resilience, and delivery.\""

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @kvittozzi\n  A new public inquiry will \"uncover the truth\" behind the so-called \"Battle of Orgreave\", a bloody fight between striking miners and police officers in the 1980s. One hundred and twenty people were injured in the violent confrontation on 18 June 1984, outside a coal processing factory in Orgreave, South Yorkshire. Five thousand miners clashed with an equal number of armed and mounted police during a day of fighting. Police used horse charges, riot shields and batons against the picketers, even as some were retreating. In the aftermath, miners were blamed for the violence in what campaigners believe was an institutional \"frame-up\". \"There were so many lies,\" says Chris Peace, from campaign group Orgreave Truth and Justice, \"and it's a real historic moment to get to this stage.\" \"There's a lot of information already in the public domain,\" she adds, \"but there's still some papers that are embargoed, which will hopefully now be brought to light.\" \n                  Man guilty of murder after driving into 'Good Samaritan' Chris Marriott following wedding brawl in Sheffield\n                 \n                  Two men charged with murder after teenager hit by car in Sheffield\n                 \n                  Teenager killed in Sheffield crash came to UK months ago 'for a better future'\n                 Although dozens of miners were arrested, trials against them all collapsed due to allegations of unreliable police evidence. Campaigners say some involved have been left with \"physical and psychological damage\", but until now, previous governments have refused calls for a public inquiry. Launching the inquiry today, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky Newsi that she wanted to \"make sure\" campaigners now got \"proper answers\". \"We've obviously had unanswered questions about what happened at Orgreave for over 40 years,\" Ms Cooper says, \"and when we were elected to government, we determined to take this forward.\" The inquiry will be a statutory one, meaning that witnesses will be compelled to come and give evidence, and chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, Pete Wilcox. \"I'm really happy,\" says Carl Parkinson, a former miner who was at Orgreave on the day of the clash, \"but why has it took so long?\" \"A lot of those colleagues and close friends have passed away, and they'll never get to see any outcome.\" Mr Parkinson and Chris Skidmore, who was also there that day, were among the group of campaigners informed first-hand by Ms Cooper about the public inquiry at the Orgreave site. \"It wasn't frightening to start off with,\" Mr Skidmore remembers of the day itself, \"but then what I noticed was the amount of police officers who had no identification numbers on. It all felt planned.\" \"And it wasn't just one truncheon,\" says Mr Parkinson, \"there were about 30, or 40. And it was simultaneous, like it was orchestrated - just boom, boom, boom, boom. \"And there's lads with a split down their heads for no good reason, they'd done nothing wrong. We were just there to peacefully picket.\" In the intervening years, South Yorkshire Police have paid more than £400,000 in compensation to affected miners and their families. But no official inquiry has ever looked at the documents surrounding the day's events, the lead-up to it and the aftermath.

They are in touch with the relevant social media platform, and we are working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.\" The Lionesses said in a statement: \"We stand with Jess and all Lionesses players past and present who have suffered racism. \"No one should have to endure such vile abuse, be that in football or any walk of life.\" They added: \"Those behind this online poison must be held accountable.\" Anger and sadness England teammate Lucy Bronze said there was \"anger\" and \"sadness\" among the squad following the abuse. Bronze said: \"I think we all know that any player of colour that's played for England has probably gone through racist abuse.

The defending champions face Italy on Tuesday night in Geneva in the Euros semi-finals. If they win and reach the final, they will play either Germany or Spain, who face each other on Wednesday.

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n As head of football's anti-racism body, there was dread for Sanjay Bhandari watching England's Women's Euros quarter-final with Sweden. But that's, grimly, how it always is. Concerned that black players will be singled out for blame. Not with a legitimate critique of their performances, but with toxicity and racism. And now Kick It Out is working with the Football Association to support Jess Carter after the England defender spoke out over the abuse she has been targeted with throughout the Women's European Championship. The players want social media firms to do more, but Mr Bhandari, the Kick It Out chairman, is concerned by their limited approach to the scourge of online hate. \"The social media companies need to do far more,\" he told Sky News. \"They've actually gone backwards over the last four or five years, not forwards. It's got worse on social media, not better. \"And they need to provide us with the tools to help keep us safe and to remove some of this toxicity from the platforms. They're just not doing enough. \"I would say that X is the worst. It has become no-holds-barred. \"And with Instagram, it is much more in the direct messaging, and I think there needs to be much more done there to protect people from those messages.\" Meta, which owns Instagram, did not reply to a request for comment. There was no response from an email sent to X's press email address.  LinkedIn indicated that X's UK managing director Jonathan Lewis's account had seen a request for comment, but there was no response. On Friday, Mr Lewis and Premier League club Burnley were celebrating a new partnership in an announcement that made no mention of the abuse that many players across the world face on X. The hope is that the Online Safety Act will lead to social media firms implementing the safety tools required of them. Mr Bhandari said: \"They have to be enforced by law enforcement against individual perpetrators, and also the regulatory parts need to be forced against the social media companies to force them to do the things that they need to do.\" Grimly familiar situation The FA reported the abuse suffered by Carter to police, and the hope is for speedy action because this is a grimly familiar situation. After the men's Euros final in 2021, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were racially abused after missing penalties in the shootout defeat to Italy. While players have been taking a knee against racism in men's and women's games, the Lionesses feel that is no longer enough at these Euros. They will stand instead before the semi-final with Italy because they say a new approach is needed to tackle racism.

All racism is unjustifiable. \"The fact that someone's had a good or bad game in your opinion does not justify that kind of racist abuse.\""

The incident happened at the Leonardo facility in Crewe Road North last Tuesday. The three women - aged 31, 34 and 42 - who were earlier arrested under the Terrorism Act have been charged and are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday. Police Scotland's Counter Terrorism Unit is leading the investigation and enquiries are ongoing. Officers are appealing for information to trace the movements of a blue Ford Transit van in the Gorgie Road area last Monday and prior to the incident last Tuesday. They are also keen to trace the movements of a white Honda CR-Z on those days. It was recovered from a car park in Gorgie Road following the incident. Direct action campaign group Shut Down Leonardo - which said it aims to target aerospace, defence and security company Leonardo's headquarters in Edinburgh - posted a photo of a van. It showed police on the roof of a vehicle, which has a Palestine flag hanging off the back. Shut Down Leonardo claims the factory makes components for Israel's F-35 fighter jets. A Leonardo spokesperson told the PA news agency: \"Leonardo UK is subject to UK government export controls and does not supply equipment direct to Israel. \"The right to peaceful protest is an important principle in our society, however, aggressive and violent activity should have no place in protest. \"The intimidation of our people, who work hard to support the security and defence of the UK, is not acceptable.\""

        "Content": "Underwater search teams have joined the hunt for a missing woman after she was last seen at a petrol station in the early hours of Saturday morning. Rachel Booth, 38, from Northwich, Cheshire, was reported missing after being last seen by her family in the Barnton area. She was seen one final further time at around 3.50am, five miles away, at the Sandiway garage on the A556 road. Police believe she may have travelled to the Oakmere area of Delamere, where police officers, underwater search teams and Cheshire Search and Rescue are currently conducting enquiries. A water park in Delamere, less than two miles away from the petrol station, said it was closed on Sunday due to a police investigation in the surrounding area. Ms Booth is described as 5ft 9ins, of a slim build, with blonde hair and is believed to be wearing black leggings and a black top. Superintendent Paul Hughes said: \"We are currently following a number of inquiries to trace Rachel and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare. \"Investigators are following all lines of inquiry and anyone who has seen Rachel since she was reported missing is asked to contact us,\" he added. \"The same goes for anyone who has any information on her whereabouts. \"We would also like to appeal directly to Rachel to get in touch to let us know you are OK.\""

        "Content": "By Dan Whitehead, Sky News correspondent  This was the fourth protest in just nine days here - around 500 people gathered outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is believed to house asylum seekers.  There was no sign of far-right or left that had travelled to the Essex town looking for trouble. Instead, it was locals; families sat on the grass, multi-generations of them, kids playing in the sunshine - tradesmen brought their lorries; a large \"Protect Our Kids\" sign fixed on the back. Between the protesters and those housed inside, around 50 police officers in riot gear lined up beside eight riot vans. There were some troublemakers hiding their faces in the crowd - a few brief moments of tension when bottles and firecrackers were thrown at police. There were six arrests, according to Essex Police, with one relating to damage caused to an unmarked police car, and four related to violent disorder at the same location on Thursday night. But overall - this was event on Sunday peaceful. Residents simply angry about events that have unfolded here in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an asylum seeker was arrested and charged with offences against a teenager and an adult in the town, eight days after arriving in the UK via a boat. Hadush Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, denies the allegations - of three counts of sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and one count of harassment without violence - and was remanded in custody. On Thursday, when he appeared in court, it did boil over outside the hotel - eight officers were injured and arrests continue to be made. One man has been charged and is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday. It was calmer on Sunday night. Mother Nicola is here with her two kids. \"I'm sick and tired of working and paying for these people,\" she tells me. \"I've got a young little girl and I want her to be safe. \"By all means come over. Bring into the economy, no disputing that. But you can't just come over and take and expect everything for nothing.\" Aimee Keteca - a Reform councillor in Essex - was in holding a placard \"I'm not far right - I'm worried about my KIDS\". She says: \"I've got a 16-year-old daughter, I worry about her in my local area. It's right on your doorstep, we've got people here and we don't know who they are.\" These protests are just the latest flashpoint of frustration - a physical place for people to vent anger that's been felt for years and continues to build.

        "Content": "NHS managers who silence whistleblowers will be banned from working in other senior health service roles, the government has announced. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is bringing forward a raft of proposals it says will ensure those who commit serious misconduct cannot simply work elsewhere in the NHS in senior management positions. Politics latest: Labour should let water companies 'go bust', Farage says It said legislation will be put forward to parliament next year to introduce professional standards and regulation of NHS managers. Currently, there is no regulatory framework for the tens of thousands of clinical and non-clinical NHS managers, as there is for doctors and nurses. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the reforms would \"slam the door in the face of unsuitable managers\". Mr Streeting added: \"I'm determined to create a culture of honesty and openness in the NHS where whistleblowers are protected, and that demands tough enforcement. \"If you silence whistleblowers, you will never work in the NHS again. \"We've got to create the conditions where staff are free to come forward and sound the alarm when things go wrong. Protecting the reputation of the NHS should never be put before protecting patient safety. \"Most NHS leaders are doing a fantastic job, but we need to stop the revolving door that allows managers sacked for misconduct or incompetence to be quietly moved to another well-paid role in another part of the NHS.\" Read more:PM to address postcode lottery  DHSC said a public consultation launched last November received more than 4,900 contributions on ways managers and leaders could be regulated. The system to bar NHS managers will apply to board-level directors and their direct reports within NHS bodies. Further laws will set out new statutory powers for the Health and Care Professions Councils to disbar senior NHS leaders who have committed serious misconduct. Professional standards for NHS England managers will be separately set out to establish a \"consistent, national set of expectations about NHS management and leadership competency and conduct\", DHSC said. Earlier this year, the government announced it is abolishing NHS England, the body that oversees the budget, planning and delivery of healthcare, but this will take two years."

The incident took place during a performance of Il Trovatore on Saturday. During the final night of the 11-night run of the show, a performer held up the flag on stage. In video footage, shared online, someone backstage could be seen attempting to take it off the performer. The performer grabs it back following a brief scuffle. A spokesperson for the Royal Ballet and Opera said: \"The display of the flag was an unauthorised action by the artist. \"It was not approved by the Royal Ballet and Opera and is a wholly inappropriate act.\" The reaction to the flag was mixed, with some people heard applauding and cheering, while another audience member was heard saying \"oh my God\". One poster on X, who claimed to have been a member of the audience, said: \"Extraordinary scenes at the Royal Opera House tonight. \"During the curtain call for Il Trovatore one of the background artists came on stage waving a Palestine flag.

        "Content": "\n          Special correspondent\n              @AlexCrawfordSky\n  The main road entering the besieged Syrian city of Sweida from the west has changed dramatically over 12 hours. A bulldozer, parked on the side of the road, has been used to create several berms to form a sand barrier around 25km (16 miles) from the city centre. Dozens of Syrian security forces were standing in lines in front of the barricades when we arrived, and there were forces further up the road stopping vehicles from going any further. The Arab tribal fighters we'd seen fighting furiously inside the city the day before were now all camped alongside the road. Some were sleeping on the back of their pick-ups. \"We're not giving up,\" one shouted to us as we walked towards the checkpoint. The ceasefire agreement between Druze leaders who are bunkered down inside the city and the Bedouins - and the tribal fighters who have flocked to join them - has frustrated some. Some of them, waiting with guns slung over their backs, are itching to return to battle. But for now, tribal leaders have instructed them to hold fire. \n                  Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria? \n                 \n                  Inside Sweida: The Syrian city ravaged by sectarian violence - where bodies line streets and homes are burned\n                 \n                  Every shop and home burned or ransacked: The Syrian city engulfed in tribal violence\n                 Read more: Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria? How long that will last is probably key to Syria's future and whether it can be a peaceful one. Khalaf al Modhi, the head of a group of tribes called United Tribes, told the group of fighters: \"We are not against the Druze. We are not here to kill the Druze.\" But he spent many minutes castigating the senior Druze cleric inside Sweida whom many of the tribes see as the agitator behind the violent clashes. Hikmat al Hijiri is head of a Druze faction that is deeply suspicious of the new government led by Ahmed al Sharaa and is resisting ceding power to Damascus. The retreat of the Arab tribes from the city centre means the Druze militia under Hijiri's control are now the ones deciding who goes in or out of the city. About 30,000 mostly Druze people are thought to be trapped inside the city and surrounding towns, with no electricity, little internet and dwindling supplies of food and water. The humanitarian situation is dramatically worsening by the day. But at the time of writing, there were still no agreed safe corridors to bring out those pinned inside. On top of this, there are nearly 130,000 people displaced and forced out of their homes because of the fighting, according to UN estimates. Maintaining the ceasefire is key to ensuring solutions are found to help those suffering, and quickly. It's also the most serious challenge facing the new Syrian leader and his interim government. The level of distrust between the Hijiri-led Druze faction and the new government is strong and deep. So much so that the Druze leaders have refused to accept truckloads of aid organised by any of the government outlets. The new Syrian leader has struggled to convince the country's minorities that their safety under his leadership is assured. Druze civilians and human rights activists reported mass killings and executions of Druze by government troops who were sent in last week to quell the latest clashes between the Druze and Arab Bedouins who have been at odds for many years. Read more from Sky News:At least 67 killed while waiting for aid in Gaza, officials sayFourteen people die in South Korea after torrential rain Government forces pulled out of the city only after Israel unleashed a spate of airstrikes, saying they were defending the Druze. The bombings killed hundreds of Syrian troops. But with the withdrawal of the government troops, the Arab Bedouin population said the city's Druze militia embarked on a string of revenge atrocities. That in turn led to thousands of tribal fighters massing from around the country to defend their Arab brethren. When we were inside the city, we saw multiple corpses lying on the streets, and many appeared to have been killed with a shot to the head. Homes and businesses are still burning after mass pillaging as fighters retreated. And now, there is a growing humanitarian disaster unfolding.

        "Content": " Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford is in Sweida in Syria, where she has witnessed mutilated, burned and decomposing bodies after a week of fierce fighting in the region. Government security forces have been redeployed to enforce the first day of a US-brokered ceasefire. Tensions remain high with fears of further violent clashes. Hundreds have died. The clashes involve a religious sect called the Druze and other rivals factions in Syria. Here's what you need to know about the conflict and who's involved. Who are the Druze?  The Druze religious sect is an offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. About half of the roughly one million Druze worldwide live in Syria, with most others in Lebanon and Israel, including the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Druze largely celebrated the downfall of Bashar al Assad in December after an almost 14-year civil war, but were divided over interim president Ahmad al Sharaa, a former militant linked to al Qaeda who led Islamist rebels to overthrow the Syrian autocrat. \n                  Homes still burning after mass pillaging and 30,000 trapped in besieged city - as Syria's fragile ceasefire holds\n                 \n                  Inside Sweida: The Syrian city ravaged by sectarian violence - where bodies line streets and homes are burned\n                 \n                  Every shop and home burned or ransacked: The Syrian city engulfed in tribal violence\n                 A few months after the transition government forces clashed with pro-Assad armed groups on Syria's coast, spurring sectarian attacks that killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority to which the former president belongs. (Assad now reportedly lives in exile in Russia). The violence left other minority groups, including the Druze in the south, and the Kurds in the northeast, increasingly mistrustful of the new Sharaa government and worried whether it would protect them. Multiple Druze militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against ISIS fighters and drug smugglers - and they have been reluctant to lay down their arms. Government supporters often paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, where they are seen as a loyal minority within and often serve in its military.  What are the factions?Diana Darke, an author, Arabist and Middle East cultural writer, told Sky presenter Barbara Serra there are three main Druze factions, two of which are keen to ally with the government, but the third is controlled by anti-government leader Hikmat al Hijri. Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford says that that faction feels vulnerable and mistrusts the government, who they see as Islamic jihadis. Why did the violence break out?  Deadly clashes broke out last Sunday in the southern province surrounding the city of Sweida between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller by members of a Bedouin tribe who set up a checkpoint, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings. Ms Darke says \"horrible outbreaks of sectarian violence\" are inevitable in a civil war-ravaged country with so many groups - and Sharaa doesn't have \"enough manpower\" to prevent it. Who else is involved?  Hijri called for intervention from Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they would help to protect the Druze. Israel bombed key military installations and carried out airstrikes which killed hundreds of Syrian government troops, who were initially sent to restore order before effectively siding with the Bedouins. Thousands of fighters from Arab tribal groups across Syria also flocked to the area to support the Bedouin tribe. \"There has been absolutely brutal mayhem and total anarchy inside the city with mass looting, mass pillaging, and it looks like a substantial number of deaths,\" says Crawford. She says the tribes claim they \"are not against the Druze, that this is not a sectarian fight, although it looks very much like that to outsiders like myself and many others\". They have been directing their anger towards Hijri faction, with Khalaf al Modhi, the head of one group called United Tribe, seen telling followers: \"We aren't here to fight and kill Druze… we are here to stop that criminal Hijri who asked Israel to bomb our country.\"  Has a ceasefire been negotiated? By Wednesday, a truce had been negotiated, allowing Druze factions to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out, although fighting between the Druze and Arab factions continued. Crawford says she's been talking to doctors, engineers, and architects who've travelled from the cities of Aleppo and Damascus with guns on their backs primarily to provide humanitarian aid, but also to fight Hijri, \"who they see as a criminal gang leader who now has the backing of Israel\". The US, another key global player, has indicated its displeasure with the Israeli strikes in Syria and with the government for withdrawing its troops from Sweida. US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack announced a ceasefire had been brokered between Israel and Syria on Saturday, hours before Syria's internal security forces began redeploying to Sweida in a bid to restore order. Syrian leader Sharaa said Sweida \"remains an integral part of the Syrian state, and the Druze constitute a fundamental pillar of the Syrian national fabric,\" vowing to protect all minorities in Syria. What could happen next?  The situation has calmed, but it could go either way, says Crawford, adding: \"I wouldn't describe the ceasefire as anything other than fragile and shaky.\" Afraa Hashem from the Syria Campaign group said the chain of violence \"is not isolated\" and is growing beyond southern Syria. \"It's spreading in northern Syria and dragging Syria towards civil war,\" she told Sky presenter Barbara Serra."

Sharing the news of his death on the platform that found his legions of new fans, 'Story time with Papa Jake', his granddaughter McKaela Larson said he \"went peacefully and was even cracking jokes 'til the very end\". \"I am so thankful to have shared my Papa Jake with you all,\" she continued. \"You meant the world to him. \"When the time is right, I will continue to share Papa Jake's stories and keep his memory alive.

In 1942, four years later, he was sent overseas and was stationed in Northern Ireland. He became operations sergeant and assembled the planning books for the invasion of Normandy. He was among the nearly 160,000 Allied troops who stormed the Normandy shore on D-Day, surviving machine-gun fire when he landed on Omaha Beach. \"We are the lucky ones,\" Larson told The Associated Press (AP) on the 81st anniversary of D-Day in June, speaking amid the immaculate rows of graves at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach. \"We are their family. We have the responsibility to honour these guys who gave us a chance to be alive.\" His service during the war earned him a Bronze Star and a French Legion of Honour award.

The military evacuation demand, which could signal an imminent attack on neighbourhoods in Deir al Balah, alarmed the families of Israeli hostages, who fear their relatives are being held there.  Meanwhile, Pope Leo called for an end to the \"barbarity of war\" on Sunday as he spoke of his profound pain over an Israeli strike on the only Catholic church in Gaza on Thursday. The attack killed three people and wounded 10, including the parish priest, Father Gabriel Romanelli, who developed a close friendship with the late Pope Francis, and was back at the Holy Family Catholic Church for Mass on Sunday. The strike drew condemnation from the pope and US President Donald Trump, and prompted statements of regret from Israel, which said it was an accident. Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar, but international mediators say there have been no breakthroughs."

        "Content": " A man who survived the capsizing of a tour boat in Ha Long Bay has told how he escaped by swimming out through a window underwater.  Dang Anh Tuan, 36, was on holiday with 11 university friends, when the Wonder Sea overturned on a sightseeing tour during a sudden thunderstorm. Only three of his group survived, while the nine others, including a man who was travelling with his wife and three-year-old son, were among at least 38 people killed. Five other people remain missing from the boat, which was carrying 48 passengers and five crew members, all of whom were Vietnamese, according to state media. Mr Tuan said a storm quickly covered the sky, bringing high winds and pouring rain, as the boat embarked on a three-hour trip. He said the passengers asked for the boat to turn back to shore, but the crew reassured them they were almost at their destination and kept moving forward. \"The boat capsized in less than a minute. It rained for about 15 minutes, and then the boat started to shake vigorously, tables and chairs were jostled around and seconds later the boat overturned,\" he said. \n                  Homes still burning after mass pillaging and 30,000 trapped in besieged city - as Syria's fragile ceasefire holds\n                 \n                  Who are the Druze and who are they fighting in Syria? \n                 \n                  D-Day veteran \"Papa Jake\" Larson who became TikTok star dies aged 102\n                 \"Water gushed in and I lost all orientation.

They saved 11 people, including a 14-year-old boy trapped for four hours in the overturned hull, but one survivor died in hospital, according to the VNExpress newspaper. The newspaper said most of the passengers were tourists from Hanoi, including about 20 children, and the boat turned upside down because of strong winds. Mr Tuan escaped with minor cuts, but one of his friends suffered multiple injuries to his head while another cut his tendons as he tried to escape the boat through a broken window. Speaking from her hospital bed, survivor Dang Thuy Linh said her family and friends were still missing. \"There are still my husband, my child(ren), my friend and their family. I hope they will all be rescued soon,\" she said. \"Don't leave anyone in the boat. The air is running thin and hope for surviving is running out.\" A tropical storm is also moving towards the area, with a national weather forecast predicting Storm Wipha will hit Vietnam's northern region next week, including Ha Long Bay's coast. Ha Long Bay is around 125mi (200km) north east of Hanoi and attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year."

        "Content": "US President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, the White House has confirmed. The president, 79, underwent a medical check-up after noticing \"mild swelling\" in his lower legs and was found to have the condition - which is common in older adults and causes blood to pool in the veins. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the diagnosis after concerns had been raised over recent photos, which showed bruising on the back of Mr Trump's hand that had been covered with make-up. Ms Leavitt said it was unrelated to the vein condition and was instead irritation from the president's \"frequent handshaking\" and use of aspirin. Mr Trump is said to take aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Mr Trump once described himself as \"the healthiest president that's ever lived\". The decision to disclose details of his medical check-up was intended to dispel speculation about his health. It comes as former president Joe Biden was repeatedly criticised by Republicans and opponents over his fitness to lead in light of a number of verbal gaffes towards the end of his term. He has since been diagnosed with prostate cancer. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) occurs when little valves inside the veins that normally ensure proper blood flow back to the heart gradually lose the ability to work properly. The valves are especially important in the legs, where gravity works against the upward movement of blood, hence why CVI primarily affects the legs. In a note released to reporters, White House physician Captain Sean Barbabella said the condition is \"benign and common\", particularly in individuals over the age of 70. Symptoms can include varicose veins, pain, cramps, itching, hyperpigmentation, chronic swelling of the legs and ankles, and leg ulcers. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, CVI risks include being overweight, a family history of the condition, and previous leg damage or blood clots. Other causes include standing or sitting for long periods, smoking, and deep vein thrombosis.

Dr Barbabella said after Mr Trump reported \"mild swelling\" in his lower legs, the concern was \"thoroughly evaluated\" by the White House medical unit \"out of an abundance of caution\". In his statement, the physician said the president underwent a \"comprehensive examination\" that revealed CVI, which he described as a \"benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70\". Dr Barbabella noted: \"Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial disease.\" Laboratory testing also showed \"normal cardiac structure and function\". Dr Barbabella said: \"No signs of heart failure, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified.\" The bruising on the back of Mr Trump's hand was said to be \"minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen\". In summary, Dr Barbabella stated: \"President Trump remains in excellent health.\" What can Mr Trump do? Press secretary Ms Leavitt said the condition was not causing the president any discomfort. \"The president remains in excellent health, which I think all of you witness on a daily basis here,\" she told reporters on Thursday. Ms Leavitt would not discuss how Mr Trump was treating the condition and suggested those details would be in the doctor's letter, which was later released to the public. However, the letter was the same as what she had read and failed to include any additional details. Those with CVI are often advised to lose weight, walk for exercise, and elevate their legs periodically. Wearing custom-made, medical-grade compression stockings can also help to manage the condition."

Sharing the news of his death on the platform that found his legions of new fans, 'Story time with Papa Jake', his granddaughter McKaela Larson said he \"went peacefully and was even cracking jokes 'til the very end\". \"I am so thankful to have shared my Papa Jake with you all,\" she continued. \"You meant the world to him. \"When the time is right, I will continue to share Papa Jake's stories and keep his memory alive.

In 1942, four years later, he was sent overseas and was stationed in Northern Ireland. He became operations sergeant and assembled the planning books for the invasion of Normandy. He was among the nearly 160,000 Allied troops who stormed the Normandy shore on D-Day, surviving machine-gun fire when he landed on Omaha Beach. \"We are the lucky ones,\" Larson told The Associated Press (AP) on the 81st anniversary of D-Day in June, speaking amid the immaculate rows of graves at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach. \"We are their family. We have the responsibility to honour these guys who gave us a chance to be alive.\" His service during the war earned him a Bronze Star and a French Legion of Honour award. In his TikTok posts and interviews, Larson combined humorous anecdotes with sombre reminders about the horrors of war. In the wake of his death, small-town museums and groups around Normandy that work to honour D-Day heroes shared tributes to Larson, one of their most loyal visitors.

Sky News understands that Hilco Capital, which was also one of the recent bidders for Poundland, is among the parties expected to submit offers for Claire's in the coming weeks, according to banking sources. Other parties expected to examine offers for Claire's British chain, which trades from about 280 stores, would include Alteri Investors and Modella Capital, which recently bought WH Smith's high street chain. The Telegraph reported earlier this month that Claire's had hired Interpath Advisory to find a buyer for the UK business as it explores options - including bankruptcy - for its US-based operations. Prospective buyers of the business have been told that a sale of the British chain could lead to significant numbers of store closures. One retail industry boss speculated that as many as a third of the UK shops could be axed in a deal to salvage the rest of the chain, potentially putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Claire's has been a fixture in British shopping centres and on high streets for decades. Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank, is advising on the sale of the US arm. Claire's, which is reported to trade from 2,000 stores globally, is owned by former creditors Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital following a previous financial restructuring. Hilco could not be reached for comment on Sunday."

        "Content": "By  looking into how to reform the industry has just been published.  Consumers will get stronger protections with a new water watchdog - as trust in water companies takes a record dive. Environment Secretary Steve Reed will announce on Monday that the government will set up the new water ombudsman with legal powers to resolve disputes, rather than the current voluntary system. The watchdog will mean an expansion of the Consumer Council for Water's (CCW) role and will bring the water sector into line with other utilities that have legally binding consumer watchdogs. Consumers will then have a single point of contact for complaints. Politics latest: Labour should let water companies 'go bust', Farage says The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the new watchdog would help \"re-establish partnership\" between water companies and consumers. A survey by the CCW in May found trust in water companies had reached a new low, with fewer than two-thirds of people saying they provided value for money. Just 35% said they thought charges from water companies were fair - even before the impact could be felt from a 26% increase in bills in April.  Mr Reed is planning a \"root and branch reform\" of the water industry - which he branded \"absolutely broken\" - that he will reveal alongside a major review of the sector on Monday. The review is expected to recommend the scrapping of water regulator Ofwat and the creation of a new one, to incorporate the work of the CCW. Read more:Labour will eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decadeUnder-fire water regulator could be scrapped Campaigners and MPs have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain a focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate infrastructure investment. On Sunday, Mr Reed avoided answering whether he would get rid of Ofwat or not when asked on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. He pledged to halve sewage pollution by water companies by 2030 and said Labour would eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decade. Mr Reed announced £104bn of private investment to help the government do that. Victoria Atkins MP, shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural Affairs, said: \"While stronger consumer protections are welcome in principle, they are only one part of the serious long-term reforms the water sector needs. \"We all want the water system to improve, and honesty about the scale of the challenge is essential. Steve Reed must explain that bill payers are paying for the £104 billion investment plan. Ministers must also explain how replacing one quango with another is going to clean up our rivers and lakes. \"Public confidence in the water system will only be rebuilt through transparency, resilience, and delivery.\""

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the reforms would \"slam the door in the face of unsuitable managers\".

The environment secretary said he understands they were suspended \"not for any one particular issue, there was a pattern of behaviour\". \"I think it is fair that if you're part of a team, you should be required to play the team game,\" he said. \n                  Sir Keir Starmer confirms senior ministers do not have to hand back freebies - as Diane Abbott says donors do not donate 'out of altruism'\n                 \n                  Tories accepted further Frank Hester donation after Diane Abbott racism row\n                 \n                  Diane Abbott to stand for Labour in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, party confirms\n                 \"You can make your views known, but if you go too far outside, you're actually undermining the whole team. We can't allow that.\" He added: \"If people think they're more important than the team, they need to think again.\" Read more:Labour will eliminate sewage spillages in a decadePM to address postcode lottery for only drug available for extreme pregnancy sickness Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott was also suspended this week, pending an investigation, after defending previous comments where she said people of colour have a different experience of racism than white people, such as Jewish, Irish and travellers. It is the second time she has been suspended over the same issue, after she said the same thing last year ahead of the election, but was readmitted after apologising. Mr Reed said he is \"very disappointed\" in Ms Abbott but her suspension is \"out of my hands\". \"I respect Diane, I've known Diane for many, many decades. I think it's a shame she did what she did,\" he added.  Commenting on the suspension, Ms Abbott told Sky News: \"It's obvious this Labour leadership wants me out. My comments in the interview with James Naughtie were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept.\" The clip of the interview was re-posted by Mr Leishman, one of the MPs suspended on Wednesday, who said: \"Diane Abbott has fought against racism her entire life.\""

        "Content": "By  looking into how to reform the industry has just been published.  Consumers will get stronger protections with a new water watchdog - as trust in water companies takes a record dive. Environment Secretary Steve Reed will announce on Monday that the government will set up the new water ombudsman with legal powers to resolve disputes, rather than the current voluntary system. The watchdog will mean an expansion of the Consumer Council for Water's (CCW) role and will bring the water sector into line with other utilities that have legally binding consumer watchdogs. Consumers will then have a single point of contact for complaints. Politics latest: Labour should let water companies 'go bust', Farage says The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the new watchdog would help \"re-establish partnership\" between water companies and consumers. A survey by the CCW in May found trust in water companies had reached a new low, with fewer than two-thirds of people saying they provided value for money. Just 35% said they thought charges from water companies were fair - even before the impact could be felt from a 26% increase in bills in April.  Mr Reed is planning a \"root and branch reform\" of the water industry - which he branded \"absolutely broken\" - that he will reveal alongside a major review of the sector on Monday. The review is expected to recommend the scrapping of water regulator Ofwat and the creation of a new one, to incorporate the work of the CCW. Read more:Labour will eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decadeUnder-fire water regulator could be scrapped Campaigners and MPs have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain a focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate infrastructure investment. On Sunday, Mr Reed avoided answering whether he would get rid of Ofwat or not when asked on Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. He pledged to halve sewage pollution by water companies by 2030 and said Labour would eliminate unauthorised sewage spillages in a decade. Mr Reed announced £104bn of private investment to help the government do that. Victoria Atkins MP, shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural Affairs, said: \"While stronger consumer protections are welcome in principle, they are only one part of the serious long-term reforms the water sector needs. \"We all want the water system to improve, and honesty about the scale of the challenge is essential. Steve Reed must explain that bill payers are paying for the £104 billion investment plan. Ministers must also explain how replacing one quango with another is going to clean up our rivers and lakes. \"Public confidence in the water system will only be rebuilt through transparency, resilience, and delivery.\""
