        "Content": " The UK is set to push for a peace plan for the Middle East at the UN General Assembly after recognising the state of Palestine. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to use the summit to address civilian suffering in war-torn Gaza and aim to strengthen \"the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East\". She will hold bilateral meetings to advance elements of the peace plan, including security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who won't attend the summit, announced on Sunday that the UK recognises Palestine as an independent state, to \"revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution\".  It is a significant moment in the history of Britain's involvement in the region, and comes as the number of people killed during the Gaza conflict continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped become even more desperate. Australia, Canada and Portugal made similar announcements, with France expected to follow suit at the UN on Monday. The move was met with fierce backlash by Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it was \"absurd\" and a \"huge reward to terrorism\". He also vowed that a Palestinian state \"will not happen\". \n                  Gaza latest: Canada and Australia recognise Palestinian state as Netanyahu brands plans 'absurd'\n                 \n                  Could Eurovision boycotts over Israel lead to a competition crisis?\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan calls out Gaza 'genocide', as Starmer 'delays' recognising Palestinian state until end of Trump's state visit\n                 Read more: What recognising a Palestinian state actually means Separately, an Israeli official said the \"full or partial annexation of the West Bank\" is now \"an option under consideration in response\" to the move. US President Donald Trump also addressed the coordinated recognition of the state of Palestine by the UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal, saying \"I'm not in that camp\" because recognising a Palestinian state was \"rewarding Hamas\". The families of hostages held in Gaza called it a \"betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the recognition of the state of Palestine would allow it to \"live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighbourliness\". Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly celebrated the move as a victory for \"the justice of our cause\". But Sir Keir was clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state and confirming plans to ratchet up sanctions on Hamas \"in the coming weeks\". \"Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,\" he added.  The prime minister also repeated his criticism of Israel, which for nearly two years has waged war on the densely populated Gaza Strip. \"The Israeli government's relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable,\" he said.

It must end,\" Sir Keir said. In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK does so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations. It would be led by a \"reformed Palestinian Authority\". The UK also acknowledges \"all legal rights and obligations of statehood\" for Palestine. An updated map on the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office website now has the West Bank and Gaza labelled as 'Palestine' rather than the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'. This change has been rolled out across the website."

Residents of the regional capital of North Darfur are mourning more than 70 people killed in a single drone strike by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a mosque during Friday dawn prayers. It has shaken the spirit of the entire state - it was a serious violation of the rules of war. \"We buried them inside the mosque in a mass grave,\" says Mohamed Hassan Quba of Al Fashir's revolutionary resistance committee, providing a lifeline for civilians. \"An RSF strategic drone monitored us as we worked to bury them - we knew it could be a double strike, but refused to stop. We persisted and they were buried with great sadness. \"Drones have not left the sky of Al Fashir over the last 72 hours.\" RSF drones are striking other targets in Al Daraja neighbourhood in eastern Al Fashir, an area where civilians seek safety and medical treatment. \n                  At least 70 killed in Sudan after paramilitary attack on mosque\n                 \n                  Sudan war: Torture, rape and forced starvation as paramilitaries suffocate besieged city\n                 \n                  More than 1,000 feared dead in Sudan landslide, rebel group says\n                 Since the Al Daraja mosque massacre, drones have dropped bombs on the last standing health facility in the city, the Saudi Hospital, already severely damaged by previous RSF shelling, as well as striking the home of the secretary-general of North Darfur, Mohamed Abdullah Adam, killing him and his wife. These aerial attacks come after 16 months of the RSF starving, shelling and economically paralysing Al Fashir. A final assault on a strangled symbol of regional power to complete their control of western Sudan. But unlike other state capitals and key towns in Darfur where the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have tactically withdrawn, surrendered or deserted civilians, Al Fashir's fighters say they will battle it out until their last breath. Read more from Sky News:Gaza City doctors say hospital at breaking pointIsraeli drone strike in Lebanon 'kills five people' The Joint Task Forces defending the city from capture are made up of former rebels from across Darfur and residents - men and some women - who have taken up arms to defend their homes. 'They will fight until the last bullet' Governor of Darfur and commander of the Joint Task Forces, Arko Mini Minawi, says the fight is existential. \"This is a personal target and an ethnicity target. That is the motivation that makes people withstand this - everyone knows if they surrender, they will be killed, and if they fight, they will survive. It is a matter of survival,\" he says.  The governor adds: \"People are swearing they will fight until the last bullet - whatever the case. Even the civilians, more than 900,000 are still there insisting [on being] there in their own territory regardless of the cost. \"Our people do not fear direct confrontation. The only effective weapons are the sophisticated weapons coming from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - the strategic drones.\" In a statement sent to Sky News, the UAE said it \"categorically rejects any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the onset of the civil war, and condemns atrocities committed by both Post Sudan Authority and RSF.\""

        "Content": "Gatwick's second runway has been given the go-ahead by the government. The northern runway already exists parallel to Gatwick's main one, but cannot be used at the same time, as it is too close. It is currently limited to being a taxiway and is only used for take-offs and landings if the main one has to shut. The £2.2bn expansion project will see it move 12 metres north so both can operate simultaneously, facilitating 100,000 extra flights a year, 14,000 jobs, and £1bn a year for the economy. It would also mean the airport could process 75 million passengers a year by the late 2030s. Gatwick is already the second busiest airport in the UK, and the busiest single runway airport in Europe. No public money is being used for the expansion plan, which airport bosses say could see the new runway operational by 2029. Read more from Sky NewsMinister defends France migrant returns dealLib Dems pledge windfall tax on banks The expansion was initially rejected by the Planning Inspectorate over concerns about its provisions for noise prevention and public transport connections. Campaigners also argued the additional air traffic will be catastrophic for the environment and the local community. A revised plan was published by the planning authority earlier this year, which it said could be approved by the government if all conditions were met. The government says it is now satisfied this is the case, with additions made including Gatwick being able to set its own target for passengers who travel to the airport by public transport - instead of a statutory one. Nearby residents affected by noise will also be able to charge the airport for the cost of triple-glazed windows. And people who live directly under the flight path who choose to sell their homes could have their stamp duty and estate agent fees paid for up to 1% of the purchase price. CAGNE, an aviation and environmental group in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, says it still has concerns about noise, housing provision, and wastewaster treatment. The group says it will lodge a judicial review, which will be funded by local residents and environmental organisations. 'Disaster for the climate crisis' Green Party leader Zack Polanski criticised the second runway decision, posting on X: \"Aviation expansion is a disaster for the climate crisis. \"Anyone who's been paying any attention to this shambles of a Labour Govenrment (sic) knows they don't care about people in poverty, don't care about nature nor for the planet. Just big business & their own interests.\" Friends of the Earth claimed the economic case for the airport expansion has been \"massively overstated\". Head of campaigns Rosie Downes warned: \"If we're to meet our legally-binding climate targets, today's decision also makes it much harder for the government to approve expansion at Heathrow.\" Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden welcomed the decision but said it \"should have been made months ago\", claiming Labour have \"dithered and delayed at every turn\". \"Now that Gatwick's second runway has been approved, it's crucial Labour ensures this infrastructure helps drive the economic growth our country needs,\" he said. A government source told Sky News the second runway is a \"no-brainer for growth\". \"The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off,\" they said. \"It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election. \"Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.\""

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The Duchess of York in recent years has seemed to be back in the royal fold.  She appeared at Sandringham for Christmas and just on Tuesday she was alongside the rest of the Windsors and Prince Andrew, for the Duchess of Kent's funeral. Fast forward to this weekend and she's right at the centre of the latest Jeffrey Epstein scandal, a problem the royals just can't seem to shift. The email that's emerged from Sarah Ferguson is a grovelling apology to the convicted paedophile, another example of the apparent lengths it seems people would go to not to upset Jeffrey Epstein; just think of the recent messages from Peter Mandelson that cost him his job, and the card allegedly written by Donald Trump. Blackmail is the reasoning given by a spokesperson for the Duchess of York writing her email. Epstein was threatening her and she wrote the email to try to prevent him from suing her for defamation. She says she was taken in by his lies and feels nothing but sympathy for the victims. Regret is the overriding tone of her spokesperson's statement.  People often talk about how powerful Jeffrey Epstein was. He knew people's secrets and others had become financially dependent on his support. It came out in March 2011 that he had given Sarah Ferguson £15,000. Of course it's her ex-husband Prince Andrew who in the past has had the most difficult questions to answer regarding his association with Epstein. He has always denied any wrongdoing. Read more:Prince Andrew's lack of royal status 'annoys him'Trump says Virginia Giuffre's death is 'a horrible thing' But there is the threat of more documents being released in America, in which he could be named, and a book written by Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew's accuser, before she died, is also due to be released on the 21 October. The Duke of York was absent from the Trump state visit this week, despite living on the Windsor Estate, but a reminder of Epstein, for Trump and the royals, was still there. With his image projected by protestors on to the side of Windsor Castle, he is an unwelcome spectre that continues to hang over not just Prince Andrew but the entire institution."

        "Content": "By Celine Alkhaldi, Middle East producer  At al Shifa Hospital, the human cost of Gaza's war is laid bare. Six relatives of its director, Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya, including his brother, were among those killed when their home in Gaza City was struck on Saturday. He was on duty when their bodies were brought to the city's largest hospital, a place already overwhelmed by casualties and struggling to function after months of bombardment. Gaza latest: At least 34 killed in overnight strikes Gaza's health authorities say at least 34 people were killed and 200 wounded. Since October 2023, more than 65,000 have died and over 166,000 have been injured, including more than 1,700 doctors, nurses and paramedics, according to the health ministry. Head of the emergency department at al Shifa, Dr Mutaz Harara, told Sky News that fear is driving both patients and staff away. \"People no longer feel that the hospital is a safe place; they have lost trust in it, and so they are heading south,\" said Dr Harara. \"Even the medical teams themselves have begun to flee in search of shelter and homes for their families.\" He described repeated attacks on Gaza's hospitals as part of a broader policy: \"What has happened at al Shifa, targeting doctors and medical teams, has happened more than once. \"Some colleagues remain in Israeli prisons, some tortured, some martyred. Hospitals have been left exposed, without protection from international law.\"  Australian doctor Nada Abu Alrub had been working at al Aqsa hospital, in central Gaza, before moving north to al Shifa. In a video shared online on Friday, she said the transfer showed the scale of displacement and the risks of simply reaching the hospital. What should have been a 20-minute journey took eight hours as her team passed streams of families fleeing south under constant bombardment. \"As soon as we reached, bombing after bombing, with Apache, F-35, F-16... all sorts of weapons attacking us from everywhere around the hospital,\" she said. 'Anyone staying knows they will be killed' Nada Abu Alrub said the belief that international doctors would be protected had proved false. \"We are doing this video because we know we might die at any moment,\" she said, recalling how strikes hit directly outside Shifa's main entrance multiple times in recent days. \"As internationals, we were told we would be given an evacuation order. No evacuation order was given.\" She added: \"Doctors don't come to work because their family members are dead, or they've been told to move south to save themselves. Anyone staying knows they will be killed.\"  Inside, conditions were breaking down to the point of collapse. Staff had almost no equipment left to work with, even basic supplies such as gloves and soap were gone, and doctors were forced to improvise with whatever remained. \"We are hardly surviving. And hardly able to help anyone,\" said the Australian doctor. Shifa's history is one of repeated assault and recovery. After raids and bombardments in late 2023, staff managed to restore some operating rooms, intensive care beds and laboratories. But the World Health Organisation has since described it as \"an empty shell\" - a facility without reliable power, water, supplies or specialist staff. Trauma patients 'treated on the floor' The same pattern has played out at al Quds Hospital in Tel el Hawa, just southwest of Gaza City, where American nurse Andee Vaughn has been volunteering for three months. She told Sky News: \"Ambulances are running out of fuel, trauma cases are treated on the floor, and even those told to evacuate are struck on the road.\" \"It is the same recipe,\" she added. \"The same thing happened to al Quds back in 2023.\" That November, the hospital shut down after being attacked, joining several others across Gaza forced to close by bombardment and shortages. While medics describe collapse, Israel insists its forces are engaged in a major campaign to root out Hamas. Troops are pressing into Gaza City from several directions, with strikes on districts including Sheikh Radwan and Tel el Hawa. Commanders say high-rise buildings and tunnel networks used by militants have been destroyed, weapons depots uncovered and fighters killed.  Read more from Sky News:What recognising a Palestinian state actually meansPalestinian minister says recognition would be 'courageous step' The army says civilians are being urged to move south and that safe routes are provided. Avichay Adraee, the army's Arabic-language spokesperson, said thousands should leave Gaza City to avoid what he called Hamas's attempts to use them as shields. \"For your safety and your loved ones' safety, move south,\" he warned. Hamas rejects that explanation, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting hospitals to dismantle Gaza's health system and force people from their homes. For those still inside al Shifa and al Quds, such arguments feel remote. Doctors and nurses say their reality is of wards emptied by strikes, morgues overfilled, corridors crowded with the wounded, and no prospect of safety beyond the next bombardment."

The 79-year-old, who had Parkinson's disease, died peacefully in hospital this morning. Stapleton appeared on well-known programmes such as Watchdog, Nationwide, Newsnight, Good Morning Britain, Panorama, and GMTV's News Hour. He was also among the first Sky News presenters. Stapleton's agent, Jackie Gill, said his Parkinson's had been \"complicated by pneumonia\". \"His son Nick and daughter-in-law Lisa have been constantly at his side and John died peacefully in hospital this morning,\" she said in a statement. Former colleagues paid tribute to Stapleton's warmth and professionalism. Sky News' Mark Austin posted on X: \"Incredibly sad.

Fellow GMB presenter Susanna Reid said on X that Stapleton was a \"legend in broadcasting\" and \"always good-humoured and gracious to work with\". Kate Garraway shared a photo from their GMTV days and said she was \"absolutely devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and journalistic hero\".

Our thoughts are with John's family and friends at this difficult time.\" Stapleton was born in Oldham and began his career at local papers in Greater Manchester. In a career of over 50 years, he covered many of the biggest news events of the day, interviewing prime ministers and appearing in shows with millions of viewers. He also worked for Sky News on a programme called Newsline in 1989, with Margaret Thatcher among those facing his questions during the channel's launch year. One of Stapleton's highlights was being named Royal Television Society presenter of the year in 2004 for his work on the Iraq War and a series of interviews that included Sir Tony Blair.

And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.\" Stapleton's son, Nick, said on social media that he was \"incredibly blessed to have had two pretty remarkable parents\". He said his father was \"a very loving, unbelievably generous man\" who left on \"his own terms, without suffering\". \"You won't meet anyone with a bad word to say about him.

        "Content": "An Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon has killed five people including three children, the country's health ministry said.  Four of those killed, including the children and their father, held US citizenship, according to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Two others were wounded, including the children's mother. The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hezbollah terrorist who \"operated from within a civilian population\". The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) acknowledged \"several uninvolved civilians\" were killed and said the incident was being reviewed. \"The IDF is operating against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation and will continue to act to remove any threat posed to the state of Israel,\" it said in a statement. Pictures from the scene in Bint Jbeil showed a destroyed Mercedes. Lebanese president Joseph Aoun, who earlier landed in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, condemned the strike and called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop. Mr Aoun, alongside the country's prime minister Nawaf Salam, endorsed an agreement last month that would gradually disarm Hezbollah. \"There is no peace above the blood of our children,\" Mr Aoun said in a statement from his office.

The war between Hezbollah and Israel killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced residents across southern and eastern areas of the country. Under the US-brokered ceasefire, Hezbollah and Israel were supposed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon and halt strikes against each other. Israeli forces have continued to occupy five Lebanese hilltop points by the border. Israel frequently says it is targeting Hezbollah militants or infrastructure in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah has only claimed firing across the border once since the ceasefire, but Israel says the militant group is trying to rebuild its capabilities. Hezbollah officials say the ongoing strikes justify their refusal to give up their arms, and claim that the ceasefire agreement and monitoring mechanism with the US, France, and United Nations peacekeeping forces is ineffective."

Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to use the summit to address civilian suffering in war-torn Gaza and aim to strengthen \"the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East\". She will hold bilateral meetings to advance elements of the peace plan, including security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who won't attend the summit, announced on Sunday that the UK recognises Palestine as an independent state, to \"revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution\".  It is a significant moment in the history of Britain's involvement in the region, and comes as the number of people killed during the Gaza conflict continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped become even more desperate. Australia, Canada and Portugal made similar announcements, with France expected to follow suit at the UN on Monday. The move was met with fierce backlash by Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it was \"absurd\" and a \"huge reward to terrorism\". He also vowed that a Palestinian state \"will not happen\". \n                  Gaza latest: Canada and Australia recognise Palestinian state as Netanyahu brands plans 'absurd'\n                 \n                  Could Eurovision boycotts over Israel lead to a competition crisis?\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan calls out Gaza 'genocide', as Starmer 'delays' recognising Palestinian state until end of Trump's state visit\n                 Read more: What recognising a Palestinian state actually means Separately, an Israeli official said the \"full or partial annexation of the West Bank\" is now \"an option under consideration in response\" to the move. US President Donald Trump also addressed the coordinated recognition of the state of Palestine by the UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal, saying \"I'm not in that camp\" because recognising a Palestinian state was \"rewarding Hamas\". The families of hostages held in Gaza called it a \"betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the recognition of the state of Palestine would allow it to \"live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighbourliness\". Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly celebrated the move as a victory for \"the justice of our cause\". But Sir Keir was clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state and confirming plans to ratchet up sanctions on Hamas \"in the coming weeks\". \"Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,\" he added.  The prime minister also repeated his criticism of Israel, which for nearly two years has waged war on the densely populated Gaza Strip. \"The Israeli government's relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable,\" he said.

It must end,\" Sir Keir said. In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK does so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations. It would be led by a \"reformed Palestinian Authority\". The UK also acknowledges \"all legal rights and obligations of statehood\" for Palestine. An updated map on the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office website now has the West Bank and Gaza labelled as 'Palestine' rather than the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'. This change has been rolled out across the website."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n Today, Sir Keir Starmer has delivered on his pledge to recognise a Palestinian state - after setting out a series of conditions in July which there was little prospect Israel could meet, including agreeing a ceasefire with Hamas.  The prime minister has said it recognises the \"inalienable right\" of the Palestinian people and what he feels is a moral responsibility to keep a two-state solution alive, amid the devastation of the war and concern about settlement expansion in the West Bank. Politics latest: Davey brands Elon Musk a criminal This will be formally put forward by the British government at a conference of the UN General Assembly in New York this week, after a diplomatic push led by Emmanuel Macron. Canada and Australia are also expected to recognise it, although may call for Hamas to disarm. But Labour has always said it's a move they would make as part of a peace process, which looks further away than ever. What does it mean? The move has been heavily criticised and leaves a number of questions not only about what it will achieve - but about whether it will have the opposite effect on the conflict. David Lammy as foreign secretary conceded when the pledge was announced that \"it will not change the position on the ground\" which can only come through negotiations. After all, 147 of the 193 member states of the United Nations recognise it already. Palestine has permanent observer status at the UN - speaking rights, but not voting rights - where it's represented by the Palestinian Authority. Any move to full status would have to be agreed by the Security Council where the US has a veto. Sir Keir has made clear he doesn't accept Hamas - which he calls a \"brutal terrorist organisation\" - as a government in Gaza. The borders of such a state, wrangled over for decades during multiple rounds of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, are also not agreed. Read more about what the decision means Criticism Recognition is opposed by the Trump administration, as the US president made clear in London last week. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said it would \"embolden Hamas\" and be symbolic only. In Britain there is cynicism too. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has accused the prime minister of a \"desperate and insincere attempt to placate his backbenchers\". He heads to the party's conference in Liverpool next week with a further slump in his approval ratings to -42%, around where Rishi Sunak's was after his D-Day blunder.  Over a third of Labour MPs wrote to Sir Keir before his pledge in July, calling for recognition of a Palestinian state. It is not clear this symbolic move will placate them, with some already calling for tougher measures including on arms sales to Israel - especially after a UN Commission of Inquiry claimed Israel had committed genocide.  Other Labour MPs oppose the recognition move. The Labour Friends of Israel group has said: \"It is important to recognise that Israel is not the only party to this conflict... Hamas could end this conflict tomorrow by releasing the hostages and laying down its arms.\" The move is also opposed by the families of the hostages in Gaza, of which 20 are believed to be alive - for not imposing their release as a condition on Hamas. Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, who recently appeared emaciated in a Hamas video, said: \"We want to meet with Starmer but he refuses to meet with us… Giving this recognition is like saying to Hamas: 'It is OK you can keep starving the hostages, you can keep using them as human shields'. This kind of recognition gives Hamas power to be stubborn in negotiations. That is the last thing we need right now.\" Sir Ephraim Mirvis, the UK's Chief Rabbi has said the \"unconditional\" recognition of the state \"is not contingent upon a functioning or democratic Palestinian government, nor even upon the most basic commitment to a peaceful future\". Read more:Lib Dems toughen up immigration rhetoric'Diplomatic efforts' under way to resolve Your Party row What happens next? Sir Keir met 89-year-old Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, in London this month and they agreed Hamas should not be involved in the governance of Gaza. Efforts to set up a transitional government have been discussed between the US and Gulf states. But Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, said last week there was nothing \"ready for signature\". The UK government is expected to announce further sanctions on Hamas figures this week. But the Israeli government has already responded with fury to the prospect of recognition and it's reported that retaliation could include further annexations in the West Bank. The UK government sees this as an important diplomatic move with allies, when nothing else is moving the dial. But it can only be made once, and even supporters in government acknowledge that on the ground in Gaza it won't immediately change very much."

        "Content": "Gatwick's second runway has been given the go-ahead by the government. The northern runway already exists parallel to Gatwick's main one, but cannot be used at the same time, as it is too close. It is currently limited to being a taxiway and is only used for take-offs and landings if the main one has to shut. The £2.2bn expansion project will see it move 12 metres north so both can operate simultaneously, facilitating 100,000 extra flights a year, 14,000 jobs, and £1bn a year for the economy. It would also mean the airport could process 75 million passengers a year by the late 2030s. Gatwick is already the second busiest airport in the UK, and the busiest single runway airport in Europe. No public money is being used for the expansion plan, which airport bosses say could see the new runway operational by 2029. Read more from Sky NewsMinister defends France migrant returns dealLib Dems pledge windfall tax on banks The expansion was initially rejected by the Planning Inspectorate over concerns about its provisions for noise prevention and public transport connections. Campaigners also argued the additional air traffic will be catastrophic for the environment and the local community. A revised plan was published by the planning authority earlier this year, which it said could be approved by the government if all conditions were met. The government says it is now satisfied this is the case, with additions made including Gatwick being able to set its own target for passengers who travel to the airport by public transport - instead of a statutory one. Nearby residents affected by noise will also be able to charge the airport for the cost of triple-glazed windows. And people who live directly under the flight path who choose to sell their homes could have their stamp duty and estate agent fees paid for up to 1% of the purchase price. CAGNE, an aviation and environmental group in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, says it still has concerns about noise, housing provision, and wastewaster treatment. The group says it will lodge a judicial review, which will be funded by local residents and environmental organisations. 'Disaster for the climate crisis' Green Party leader Zack Polanski criticised the second runway decision, posting on X: \"Aviation expansion is a disaster for the climate crisis. \"Anyone who's been paying any attention to this shambles of a Labour Govenrment (sic) knows they don't care about people in poverty, don't care about nature nor for the planet. Just big business & their own interests.\" Friends of the Earth claimed the economic case for the airport expansion has been \"massively overstated\". Head of campaigns Rosie Downes warned: \"If we're to meet our legally-binding climate targets, today's decision also makes it much harder for the government to approve expansion at Heathrow.\" Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden welcomed the decision but said it \"should have been made months ago\", claiming Labour have \"dithered and delayed at every turn\". \"Now that Gatwick's second runway has been approved, it's crucial Labour ensures this infrastructure helps drive the economic growth our country needs,\" he said. A government source told Sky News the second runway is a \"no-brainer for growth\". \"The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off,\" they said. \"It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election. \"Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.\""

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The Duchess of York in recent years has seemed to be back in the royal fold.  She appeared at Sandringham for Christmas and just on Tuesday she was alongside the rest of the Windsors and Prince Andrew, for the Duchess of Kent's funeral. Fast forward to this weekend and she's right at the centre of the latest Jeffrey Epstein scandal, a problem the royals just can't seem to shift. The email that's emerged from Sarah Ferguson is a grovelling apology to the convicted paedophile, another example of the apparent lengths it seems people would go to not to upset Jeffrey Epstein; just think of the recent messages from Peter Mandelson that cost him his job, and the card allegedly written by Donald Trump. Blackmail is the reasoning given by a spokesperson for the Duchess of York writing her email. Epstein was threatening her and she wrote the email to try to prevent him from suing her for defamation. She says she was taken in by his lies and feels nothing but sympathy for the victims. Regret is the overriding tone of her spokesperson's statement.  People often talk about how powerful Jeffrey Epstein was. He knew people's secrets and others had become financially dependent on his support. It came out in March 2011 that he had given Sarah Ferguson £15,000. Of course it's her ex-husband Prince Andrew who in the past has had the most difficult questions to answer regarding his association with Epstein. He has always denied any wrongdoing.

The Duke of York was absent from the Trump state visit this week, despite living on the Windsor Estate, but a reminder of Epstein, for Trump and the royals, was still there. With his image projected by protestors on to the side of Windsor Castle, he is an unwelcome spectre that continues to hang over not just Prince Andrew but the entire institution."

One of Stapleton's highlights was being named Royal Television Society presenter of the year in 2004 for his work on the Iraq War and a series of interviews that included Sir Tony Blair.

In October last year, Stapleton opened up about his Parkinson's diagnosis, a condition his mother also had. \"I am fairly pragmatic about the prospect of this getting worse,\" he said. \"I try to remain positive, because what's the point of not being?\" \"Speaking is how I've earned my living for the best part of 50 years,\" he said in the BBC interview. \"It's very frustrating sometimes, particularly (when) people are constantly saying to you, 'sorry, what did you say?' And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.\" Stapleton's son, Nick, said on social media that he was \"incredibly blessed to have had two pretty remarkable parents\". He said his father was \"a very loving, unbelievably generous man\" who left on \"his own terms, without suffering\". \"You won't meet anyone with a bad word to say about him. And you can't do much better than that,\" he added."

Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to use the summit to address civilian suffering in war-torn Gaza and aim to strengthen \"the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East\". She will hold bilateral meetings to advance elements of the peace plan, including security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who won't attend the summit, announced on Sunday that the UK recognises Palestine as an independent state, to \"revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution\".  It is a significant moment in the history of Britain's involvement in the region, and comes as the number of people killed during the Gaza conflict continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped become even more desperate.

US President Donald Trump also addressed the coordinated recognition of the state of Palestine by the UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal, saying \"I'm not in that camp\" because recognising a Palestinian state was \"rewarding Hamas\". The families of hostages held in Gaza called it a \"betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the recognition of the state of Palestine would allow it to \"live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighbourliness\". Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly celebrated the move as a victory for \"the justice of our cause\". But Sir Keir was clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state and confirming plans to ratchet up sanctions on Hamas \"in the coming weeks\". \"Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,\" he added.

Pain that strikes deep in people's hearts across Israel and here in the United Kingdom. \"The hostages must be released immediately and we will keep fighting to bring them home.\" Sir Keir was also clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying that the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state. \"I have directed work to sanction other Hamas figures in the coming weeks,\" he added.

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n  No, nothing will change on the ground, and yes, Britain's decision to recognise the state of Palestine is mainly a symbolic exercise. But in the Middle East, symbolism can count for a lot. In the streets of the West Bank, there are plenty who think it is proof that their problems have been seen and, in the future, they will get more help. \"Better late than never,\" was the pithy analysis of Varsen Aghabekian, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, when we met in Ramallah. Follow latest: Palestine recognised as a state by three countries \"Britain, with its weight, can influence other countries to come forward and recognise, because that is the right thing to do.\" Palestinian politicians hope this will help to usher in a new era - that they will end up with more diplomatic heft, Israel will face greater restraint, and more and more countries will follow suit.  After all, it is not just the UK that is recognising a state of Palestine, but also France, another member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as big economic powers such as Canada and Australia. But expanding diplomatic heft will only take you so far. The Palestinians may dream of suffocating global pressure being placed on Israel, but they know that will not happen, certainly as long as Donald Trump is in the White House. America's criticism has so far been feather-light, while its support is weighty. Not only will the White House not recognise Palestine, it will actively condemn those who do, and, almost certainly, oppose any UN motions that condemn the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.  In fact, Britain's recognition of Palestine was one of the few public disagreements between Trump and Sir Keir Starmer during the state visit. In the minds of America's diplomats, recognition is tantamount to a reward for Hamas terrorism - a conclusion that Israel has echoed and will now say much more stridently. Read more:Gaza City doctors say hospital at breaking pointWhy Starmer's move to recognise Palestine is a major shift According to this version, Hamas will feel emboldened by this form of recognition, and will decide that, rather than compromising by releasing hostages, it should carry on, extending the conflict to win further global sympathy. And it is a version that attracts widespread support, even among political opponents. The forum that unites the hostage families, for instance, agrees with the prime minister's analysis, even though it has often been a focal point to direct anger against him.  'Who does Starmer think he is?' There was support, too, from Naftali Bennett, widely predicted to replace Netanyahu when elections are held next year. \"I don't think the United Kingdom is in a place to give us conditions. Who does Starmer think he is? There's no longer a British mandate and friends don't set conditions one for another. \"We're a sovereign state. He's not going to give us conditions and certainly not tell us 'if you don't surrender to Hamas, we're going to accept a Palestinian state'. \"And that's exactly what he did, and he knows it and he's doing it for political reasons.\" One source, close to the Israeli government, told me privately: \"Starmer accuses Netanyahu of prolonging the war for domestic gain, and then makes a decision like this that will certainly prolong the war, for his own domestic gain. \"I am angry because I expect better from the UK.\" So does this matter? Yes, it does, even if it is symbolic. Because the symbolism feels desperately important to both Palestinians and Israelis."

Residents of the regional capital of North Darfur are mourning more than 70 people killed in a single drone strike by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a mosque during Friday dawn prayers. It has shaken the spirit of the entire state - it was a serious violation of the rules of war. \"We buried them inside the mosque in a mass grave,\" says Mohamed Hassan Quba of Al Fashir's revolutionary resistance committee, providing a lifeline for civilians. \"An RSF strategic drone monitored us as we worked to bury them - we knew it could be a double strike, but refused to stop. We persisted and they were buried with great sadness. \"Drones have not left the sky of Al Fashir over the last 72 hours.\" RSF drones are striking other targets in Al Daraja neighbourhood in eastern Al Fashir, an area where civilians seek safety and medical treatment. \n                  At least 70 killed in Sudan after paramilitary attack on mosque\n                 \n                  Sudan war: Torture, rape and forced starvation as paramilitaries suffocate besieged city\n                 \n                  More than 1,000 feared dead in Sudan landslide, rebel group says\n                 Since the Al Daraja mosque massacre, drones have dropped bombs on the last standing health facility in the city, the Saudi Hospital, already severely damaged by previous RSF shelling, as well as striking the home of the secretary-general of North Darfur, Mohamed Abdullah Adam, killing him and his wife. These aerial attacks come after 16 months of the RSF starving, shelling and economically paralysing Al Fashir. A final assault on a strangled symbol of regional power to complete their control of western Sudan. But unlike other state capitals and key towns in Darfur where the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have tactically withdrawn, surrendered or deserted civilians, Al Fashir's fighters say they will battle it out until their last breath. Read more from Sky News:Gaza City doctors say hospital at breaking pointIsraeli drone strike in Lebanon 'kills five people' The Joint Task Forces defending the city from capture are made up of former rebels from across Darfur and residents - men and some women - who have taken up arms to defend their homes.

That is the motivation that makes people withstand this - everyone knows if they surrender, they will be killed, and if they fight, they will survive. It is a matter of survival,\" he says.  The governor adds: \"People are swearing they will fight until the last bullet - whatever the case. Even the civilians, more than 900,000 are still there insisting [on being] there in their own territory regardless of the cost. \"Our people do not fear direct confrontation. The only effective weapons are the sophisticated weapons coming from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - the strategic drones.\" In a statement sent to Sky News, the UAE said it \"categorically rejects any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the onset of the civil war, and condemns atrocities committed by both Post Sudan Authority and RSF.\""

        "Content": "By Celine Alkhaldi, Middle East producer  At al Shifa Hospital, the human cost of Gaza's war is laid bare. Six relatives of its director, Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya, including his brother, were among those killed when their home in Gaza City was struck on Saturday. He was on duty when their bodies were brought to the city's largest hospital, a place already overwhelmed by casualties and struggling to function after months of bombardment. Gaza latest: At least 34 killed in overnight strikes Gaza's health authorities say at least 34 people were killed and 200 wounded. Since October 2023, more than 65,000 have died and over 166,000 have been injured, including more than 1,700 doctors, nurses and paramedics, according to the health ministry. Head of the emergency department at al Shifa, Dr Mutaz Harara, told Sky News that fear is driving both patients and staff away. \"People no longer feel that the hospital is a safe place; they have lost trust in it, and so they are heading south,\" said Dr Harara. \"Even the medical teams themselves have begun to flee in search of shelter and homes for their families.\" He described repeated attacks on Gaza's hospitals as part of a broader policy: \"What has happened at al Shifa, targeting doctors and medical teams, has happened more than once. \"Some colleagues remain in Israeli prisons, some tortured, some martyred. Hospitals have been left exposed, without protection from international law.\"  Australian doctor Nada Abu Alrub had been working at al Aqsa hospital, in central Gaza, before moving north to al Shifa. In a video shared online on Friday, she said the transfer showed the scale of displacement and the risks of simply reaching the hospital. What should have been a 20-minute journey took eight hours as her team passed streams of families fleeing south under constant bombardment. \"As soon as we reached, bombing after bombing, with Apache, F-35, F-16... all sorts of weapons attacking us from everywhere around the hospital,\" she said. 'Anyone staying knows they will be killed' Nada Abu Alrub said the belief that international doctors would be protected had proved false. \"We are doing this video because we know we might die at any moment,\" she said, recalling how strikes hit directly outside Shifa's main entrance multiple times in recent days. \"As internationals, we were told we would be given an evacuation order. No evacuation order was given.\" She added: \"Doctors don't come to work because their family members are dead, or they've been told to move south to save themselves. Anyone staying knows they will be killed.\"  Inside, conditions were breaking down to the point of collapse. Staff had almost no equipment left to work with, even basic supplies such as gloves and soap were gone, and doctors were forced to improvise with whatever remained. \"We are hardly surviving. And hardly able to help anyone,\" said the Australian doctor. Shifa's history is one of repeated assault and recovery. After raids and bombardments in late 2023, staff managed to restore some operating rooms, intensive care beds and laboratories. But the World Health Organisation has since described it as \"an empty shell\" - a facility without reliable power, water, supplies or specialist staff. Trauma patients 'treated on the floor' The same pattern has played out at al Quds Hospital in Tel el Hawa, just southwest of Gaza City, where American nurse Andee Vaughn has been volunteering for three months. She told Sky News: \"Ambulances are running out of fuel, trauma cases are treated on the floor, and even those told to evacuate are struck on the road.\" \"It is the same recipe,\" she added. \"The same thing happened to al Quds back in 2023.\" That November, the hospital shut down after being attacked, joining several others across Gaza forced to close by bombardment and shortages. While medics describe collapse, Israel insists its forces are engaged in a major campaign to root out Hamas. Troops are pressing into Gaza City from several directions, with strikes on districts including Sheikh Radwan and Tel el Hawa. Commanders say high-rise buildings and tunnel networks used by militants have been destroyed, weapons depots uncovered and fighters killed.  Read more from Sky News:What recognising a Palestinian state actually meansPalestinian minister says recognition would be 'courageous step' The army says civilians are being urged to move south and that safe routes are provided. Avichay Adraee, the army's Arabic-language spokesperson, said thousands should leave Gaza City to avoid what he called Hamas's attempts to use them as shields. \"For your safety and your loved ones' safety, move south,\" he warned. Hamas rejects that explanation, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting hospitals to dismantle Gaza's health system and force people from their homes. For those still inside al Shifa and al Quds, such arguments feel remote. Doctors and nurses say their reality is of wards emptied by strikes, morgues overfilled, corridors crowded with the wounded, and no prospect of safety beyond the next bombardment."

Lebanese president Joseph Aoun, who earlier landed in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, condemned the strike and called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop.

The war between Hezbollah and Israel killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced residents across southern and eastern areas of the country. Under the US-brokered ceasefire, Hezbollah and Israel were supposed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon and halt strikes against each other. Israeli forces have continued to occupy five Lebanese hilltop points by the border. Israel frequently says it is targeting Hezbollah militants or infrastructure in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah has only claimed firing across the border once since the ceasefire, but Israel says the militant group is trying to rebuild its capabilities. Hezbollah officials say the ongoing strikes justify their refusal to give up their arms, and claim that the ceasefire agreement and monitoring mechanism with the US, France, and United Nations peacekeeping forces is ineffective."

        "Content": "The producer of Charlie Kirk's podcast has claimed that a \"miracle\" stopped more people being killed by the bullet that hit the right-wing influencer. Andrew Kolvet claimed to have spoken to a surgeon that tried to save Mr Kirk's life, and posted on social media to discuss the apparent lack of an exit wound. A prominent right-wing figure in the US, Mr Kirk was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and was known for his conservative viewpoints on abortion, religion and LGBT issues. The 31-year-old was shot dead while speaking at a university event in Utah last week. Mr Trump and other public figures are expected to be in Arizona on Sunday for a memorial service for Mr Kirk which is expected to draw 100,000 people.  Mr Kolvet, executive producer of the Charlie Kirk Show, apologised for the \"somewhat graphic\" nature of his post on X. In it, he discussed what he said was a lack of an exit wound from the bullet, despite it being \"a high powered, high velocity round\". Mr Kolvet included what he said were quotes from a surgeon who operated on Mr Kirk. \"It was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed,\" Mr Kolvet quoted the surgeon as saying. \"His bone was so healthy and the density was so so impressive that he's like the man of steel. It should have just gone through and through. It likely would have killed those standing behind him too.\" Mr Kolvet said what happened was \"remarkable\" and \"miraculous\".

It will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team, amid a heavy law enforcement presence. President Trump has blamed the \"radical left\" for the death of Mr Kirk, whom he credited for helping him win the 2024 presidential election. It comes as the death of Mr Kirk has turned into a debate over the First Amendment. While they have repeatedly criticised what they claim are assaults on free speech, members of the MAGA movement appear to be taking a different stance when the subject is one of their own, launching attacks on people they deem to be making disparaging comments about Mr Kirk. Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, have already lost their jobs for allegedly making offensive comments about the podcaster. Late-night chat show host Jimmy Kimmel was pulled from the air indefinitely by ABC following a backlash from the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian's remarks about Mr Kirk. The State Department also has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated his assassination."

Reporters' access to the iconic building, the headquarters of the US defence department, is also being curtailed. Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, posted on X: \"The 'press' does not run the Pentagon - the people do. \"The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules - or go home.\" A memo announcing the changes was sent to reporters on Friday, informing them \"information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified\". They must sign an agreement agreeing to the new rules or face having their press pass revoked. Journalists' groups said it was a dangerous move that would seriously restrict their ability to hold defence officials to account. The National Press Club called it \"a direct assault on independent journalism at the very place where independent scrutiny matters most: the US military\". The Society of Professional Journalists said it \"would deny the American people the transparency and accountability they deserve\". \"This policy reeks of prior restraint - the most egregious violation of press freedom under the First Amendment - and is a dangerous step toward government censorship,\" it said. \"Attempts to silence the press under the guise of 'security' are part of a disturbing pattern of growing government hostility toward transparency and democratic norms.\" The defence department - which recently rebranded itself as the Department of War - said it \"remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust\".

The Pentagon said no classified information had been shared but opponents said it showed a worryingly lax approach that could endanger US troops. Doubts were also raised about America's bombing of Iran's nuclear sites earlier this year after a leaked intelligence report suggested the attack had only set the regime back \"by months\".

The northern runway already exists parallel to Gatwick's main one, but cannot be used at the same time, as it is too close. It is currently limited to being a taxiway and is only used for take-offs and landings if the main one has to shut.

It would also mean the airport could process 75 million passengers a year by the late 2030s. Gatwick is already the second busiest airport in the UK, and the busiest single runway airport in Europe. No public money is being used for the expansion plan, which airport bosses say could see the new runway operational by 2029. Read more from Sky NewsMinister defends France migrant returns dealLib Dems pledge windfall tax on banks The expansion was initially rejected by the Planning Inspectorate over concerns about its provisions for noise prevention and public transport connections. Campaigners also argued the additional air traffic will be catastrophic for the environment and the local community. A revised plan was published by the planning authority earlier this year, which it said could be approved by the government if all conditions were met. The government says it is now satisfied this is the case, with additions made including Gatwick being able to set its own target for passengers who travel to the airport by public transport - instead of a statutory one. Nearby residents affected by noise will also be able to charge the airport for the cost of triple-glazed windows. And people who live directly under the flight path who choose to sell their homes could have their stamp duty and estate agent fees paid for up to 1% of the purchase price. CAGNE, an aviation and environmental group in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, says it still has concerns about noise, housing provision, and wastewaster treatment. The group says it will lodge a judicial review, which will be funded by local residents and environmental organisations. 'Disaster for the climate crisis' Green Party leader Zack Polanski criticised the second runway decision, posting on X: \"Aviation expansion is a disaster for the climate crisis. \"Anyone who's been paying any attention to this shambles of a Labour Govenrment (sic) knows they don't care about people in poverty, don't care about nature nor for the planet. Just big business & their own interests.\" Friends of the Earth claimed the economic case for the airport expansion has been \"massively overstated\". Head of campaigns Rosie Downes warned: \"If we're to meet our legally-binding climate targets, today's decision also makes it much harder for the government to approve expansion at Heathrow.\" Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden welcomed the decision but said it \"should have been made months ago\", claiming Labour have \"dithered and delayed at every turn\". \"Now that Gatwick's second runway has been approved, it's crucial Labour ensures this infrastructure helps drive the economic growth our country needs,\" he said. A government source told Sky News the second runway is a \"no-brainer for growth\". \"The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off,\" they said. \"It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election. \"Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.\""

Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to use the summit to address civilian suffering in war-torn Gaza and aim to strengthen \"the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East\". She will hold bilateral meetings to advance elements of the peace plan, including security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who won't attend the summit, announced on Sunday that the UK recognises Palestine as an independent state, to \"revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution\".  It is a significant moment in the history of Britain's involvement in the region, and comes as the number of people killed during the Gaza conflict continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped become even more desperate. Australia, Canada and Portugal made similar announcements, with France expected to follow suit at the UN on Monday.

The families of hostages held in Gaza called it a \"betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the recognition of the state of Palestine would allow it to \"live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighbourliness\". Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly celebrated the move as a victory for \"the justice of our cause\". But Sir Keir was clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state and confirming plans to ratchet up sanctions on Hamas \"in the coming weeks\". \"Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,\" he added.  The prime minister also repeated his criticism of Israel, which for nearly two years has waged war on the densely populated Gaza Strip. \"The Israeli government's relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable,\" he said.

It must end,\" Sir Keir said. In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK does so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations. It would be led by a \"reformed Palestinian Authority\". The UK also acknowledges \"all legal rights and obligations of statehood\" for Palestine. An updated map on the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office website now has the West Bank and Gaza labelled as 'Palestine' rather than the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n Today, Sir Keir Starmer has delivered on his pledge to recognise a Palestinian state - after setting out a series of conditions in July which there was little prospect Israel could meet, including agreeing a ceasefire with Hamas.  The prime minister has said it recognises the \"inalienable right\" of the Palestinian people and what he feels is a moral responsibility to keep a two-state solution alive, amid the devastation of the war and concern about settlement expansion in the West Bank. Politics latest: Davey brands Elon Musk a criminal This will be formally put forward by the British government at a conference of the UN General Assembly in New York this week, after a diplomatic push led by Emmanuel Macron. Canada and Australia are also expected to recognise it, although may call for Hamas to disarm. But Labour has always said it's a move they would make as part of a peace process, which looks further away than ever. What does it mean? The move has been heavily criticised and leaves a number of questions not only about what it will achieve - but about whether it will have the opposite effect on the conflict. David Lammy as foreign secretary conceded when the pledge was announced that \"it will not change the position on the ground\" which can only come through negotiations. After all, 147 of the 193 member states of the United Nations recognise it already. Palestine has permanent observer status at the UN - speaking rights, but not voting rights - where it's represented by the Palestinian Authority. Any move to full status would have to be agreed by the Security Council where the US has a veto. Sir Keir has made clear he doesn't accept Hamas - which he calls a \"brutal terrorist organisation\" - as a government in Gaza. The borders of such a state, wrangled over for decades during multiple rounds of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, are also not agreed. Read more about what the decision means Criticism Recognition is opposed by the Trump administration, as the US president made clear in London last week. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said it would \"embolden Hamas\" and be symbolic only. In Britain there is cynicism too. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has accused the prime minister of a \"desperate and insincere attempt to placate his backbenchers\". He heads to the party's conference in Liverpool next week with a further slump in his approval ratings to -42%, around where Rishi Sunak's was after his D-Day blunder.  Over a third of Labour MPs wrote to Sir Keir before his pledge in July, calling for recognition of a Palestinian state. It is not clear this symbolic move will placate them, with some already calling for tougher measures including on arms sales to Israel - especially after a UN Commission of Inquiry claimed Israel had committed genocide.  Other Labour MPs oppose the recognition move. The Labour Friends of Israel group has said: \"It is important to recognise that Israel is not the only party to this conflict... Hamas could end this conflict tomorrow by releasing the hostages and laying down its arms.\" The move is also opposed by the families of the hostages in Gaza, of which 20 are believed to be alive - for not imposing their release as a condition on Hamas. Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, who recently appeared emaciated in a Hamas video, said: \"We want to meet with Starmer but he refuses to meet with us… Giving this recognition is like saying to Hamas: 'It is OK you can keep starving the hostages, you can keep using them as human shields'. This kind of recognition gives Hamas power to be stubborn in negotiations. That is the last thing we need right now.\" Sir Ephraim Mirvis, the UK's Chief Rabbi has said the \"unconditional\" recognition of the state \"is not contingent upon a functioning or democratic Palestinian government, nor even upon the most basic commitment to a peaceful future\". Read more:Lib Dems toughen up immigration rhetoric'Diplomatic efforts' under way to resolve Your Party row What happens next? Sir Keir met 89-year-old Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, in London this month and they agreed Hamas should not be involved in the governance of Gaza. Efforts to set up a transitional government have been discussed between the US and Gulf states. But Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, said last week there was nothing \"ready for signature\". The UK government is expected to announce further sanctions on Hamas figures this week. But the Israeli government has already responded with fury to the prospect of recognition and it's reported that retaliation could include further annexations in the West Bank. The UK government sees this as an important diplomatic move with allies, when nothing else is moving the dial. But it can only be made once, and even supporters in government acknowledge that on the ground in Gaza it won't immediately change very much."

And people who live directly under the flight path who choose to sell their homes could have their stamp duty and estate agent fees paid for up to 1% of the purchase price. CAGNE, an aviation and environmental group in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, says it still has concerns about noise, housing provision, and wastewaster treatment. The group says it will lodge a judicial review, which will be funded by local residents and environmental organisations. 'Disaster for the climate crisis' Green Party leader Zack Polanski criticised the second runway decision, posting on X: \"Aviation expansion is a disaster for the climate crisis. \"Anyone who's been paying any attention to this shambles of a Labour Govenrment (sic) knows they don't care about people in poverty, don't care about nature nor for the planet. Just big business & their own interests.\" Friends of the Earth claimed the economic case for the airport expansion has been \"massively overstated\". Head of campaigns Rosie Downes warned: \"If we're to meet our legally-binding climate targets, today's decision also makes it much harder for the government to approve expansion at Heathrow.\" Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden welcomed the decision but said it \"should have been made months ago\", claiming Labour have \"dithered and delayed at every turn\". \"Now that Gatwick's second runway has been approved, it's crucial Labour ensures this infrastructure helps drive the economic growth our country needs,\" he said. A government source told Sky News the second runway is a \"no-brainer for growth\". \"The transport secretary has cleared Gatwick expansion for take-off,\" they said. \"It is possible that planes could be taking off from a new full runway at Gatwick before the next general election. \"Any airport expansion must be delivered in line with our legally binding climate change commitments and meet strict environmental requirements.\""

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has announced the UK has officially recognised Palestine as a state. \"Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,\" the prime minister said on X, alongside a longer video statement. \"In the face of the growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution. \"That means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment, we have neither.\" Follow latest: Palestine recognised as a state by three countries Sir Keir said in July that the government would recognise Palestine unless Israel met certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing the UN to restart the supply of aid. In recognising Palestine as a state, the UK does so based on 1967 borders to be finalised as part of future negotiations. It would be led by a \"reformed Palestinian Authority\". The UK also acknowledges \"all legal rights and obligations of statehood\" for Palestine. An updated map on the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office website now has the West Bank and Gaza labelled as 'Palestine' rather than the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'. This change has been rolled out across the website. Canada, Australia and Portugal also officially recognised Palestinian statehood on Sunday, ahead of a conference of the UN General Assembly in New York this week. It is a significant moment in the history of Britain's involvement in the region, and comes as the death toll from the Israeli war on Gaza continues to rise and conditions for the people trapped become even more desperate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that a Palestinian state \"will not happen\" and claimed the move \"endangers our existence and constitutes an absurd reward for terrorism\". \"The international community will hear from us on this matter in the coming days,\" he added in a statement. Separately, an Israeli official said the \"full or partial annexation of the West Bank\" is now \"an option under consideration in response\" to the move. Party leaders accuse PM of 'rewarding terrorism' Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch responded by describing the move as \"absolutely disastrous\", claiming it \"rewards terrorism with no conditions whatsoever put in place for Hamas\". \"It leaves hostages languishing in Gaza and does nothing to stop the suffering of innocent people caught in this war,\" she added. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage also criticised the decision, saying it \"rewards Hamas terrorists\" and will \"do nothing to bring about peace\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"long overdue\" and a \"welcome step\". \"It must be the start, not the end,\" he added. \"We need a ceasefire, an end to the cycle of violence and real progress towards a two-state solution\". Sir Keir calls on Hamas to release the hostages The prime minister also repeated his calls for the Israeli hostages - held in captivity since the brutal attacks on Israel on 7 October, 2023 - to be released by Hamas. \"I have met British families of the hostages. I see the torture that they endure each and every day. Pain that strikes deep in people's hearts across Israel and here in the United Kingdom. \"The hostages must be released immediately and we will keep fighting to bring them home.\" Sir Keir was also clear to emphasise that recognition of Palestine was \"not a reward for Hamas\", saying that the terror group \"can have no future, no role in government, no role in security\" in a future state. \"I have directed work to sanction other Hamas figures in the coming weeks,\" he added. Read more:Gaza City doctors say hospital at breaking pointWhy Starmer's move to recognise Palestine is a major shift Starmer calls on Israel to end Gaza offensives The prime minister also repeated his criticism of Israel, which for nearly two years has waged a brutal war on the densely populated Gaza Strip. \"The Israeli government's relentless and increasing bombardment of Gaza, the offensive of recent weeks, the starvation and devastation are utterly intolerable.\" The death toll in Gaza since the IDF launched its offensive following the 7 October attacks has now risen above 65,000 people, according to Hamas-run health authorities. \"This death and destruction horrifies all of us. It must end,\" he said. British people 'desperately want to see' peace Sir Keir also said: \"Ordinary people, Israeli and Palestinian, deserve to live in peace. To try to rebuild their lives free from violence and suffering. That's what the British people desperately want to see.\" But he warned that the possibility of a Palestinian state was in danger of vanishing forever. \"With the actions of Hamas, the Israeli government escalating the conflict, and settlement building being accelerated in the West Bank, the hope of a two-state solution is fading, but we cannot let that light go out. \"That is why we are building consensus with leaders in the region and beyond, around our framework for peace.\"  Sir Keir said this is a \"practical plan\" to bring people together behind a \"common vision\" that moves from a ceasefire in Gaza to negotiations on a two-state solution. \"We will keep driving this forward,\" he pledged."

        "Content": "The Liberal Democrats have vowed to tax banks to raise money that could help people lower their energy bills.  Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dems' deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson, said the party would impose a windfall tax on banks that would fund a new energy security bank that would offer loans to those wishing to make their homes more efficient. Politics latest: Starmer set to recognise Palestine as a state today Speaking at the party's conference in Bournemouth, Ms Cooper said: \"Conference, you will remember that we were the first party to call for a windfall tax on the big oil and gas companies when they made profits they weren't expecting due to Putin's illegal full invasion of Ukraine. \"Well now conference, the big banks are making similar windfall profits too, due to an unintended consequence of the quantitative easing programme that was more than a decade ago.\" She said taxpayers were \"shelling out billions of pounds to the shareholders of the big banks simply because interest rates have remained so high for so long\". \"Banks never expected to receive this windfall,\" she added. \"They never relied on this windfall, and they never took on any risk to reap this windfall. \"So today conference, I can announce that we Liberal Democrats will raise the capital to underwrite our new energy security bank through a new time limited windfall tax on the big banks.\" The energy security bank would use one-off initial £2bn in capital, raised through the bank windfall tax, to create affordable loans of up to £20,000 for homeowners and £50,000 for small businesses and community energy groups, the party said. Those loans could be used to pay for items that boost energy efficiency such as solar panels and insulation. The party believes its new energy bank could cut energy bills for a typical household by around £500 a year. Read more from Sky News:What will the UK's recognition of Palestine achieve?What we know about row between Corbyn and Sultana Asked what impetus there is for people to take up the proposed loan, Ms Cooper told Sky News: \"The number of people who write to me, they want to do the right thing, they want to bring their energy bills down permanently, they want to provide their own energy so they have energy security. \"They don't want to have their energy bills going up and down all the time. \"People want to take this action. I think that when I hear from households, from families, from small businesses, they are hungry to take action on this issue. They just need the means to be able to do so.\" The proposed tax on the banks would be time-limited and targeted specifically at the unexpected interest payments received by the big banks due to Quantitative Easing. It would not require the Bank of England to make any changes. The Lib Dem conference began on Saturday and will run until Tuesday. The party's leader, Sir Ed Davey, has already called for Elon Musk to be prosecuted for \"allowing online harm to children\" on his social media platform X. He branded Mr Musk, the owner of electric car-maker Tesla, a \"criminal\" and said he could be prosecuted under the Online Safety Act, under which social media companies have a legal duty to protect children from harmful content and their directors are liable for criminal prosecution for breaching it."

        "Content": " Broadcaster John Stapleton - a familiar face on news and current affairs shows for decades - has died. The 79-year-old, who had Parkinson's disease, died peacefully in hospital this morning. Stapleton appeared on well-known programmes such as Watchdog, Nationwide, Newsnight, Good Morning Britain, Panorama, and GMTV's News Hour. He was also among the first Sky News presenters. Stapleton's agent, Jackie Gill, said his Parkinson's had been \"complicated by pneumonia\". \"His son Nick and daughter-in-law Lisa have been constantly at his side and John died peacefully in hospital this morning,\" she said in a statement. Former colleagues paid tribute to Stapleton's warmth and professionalism. Sky News' Mark Austin posted on X: \"Incredibly sad. A good man and top presenter who could turn his hand to anything.\" Good Morning Britain's Charlotte Hawkins called him a \"brilliant broadcaster\" and a \"genuinely lovely man\". Fellow GMB presenter Susanna Reid said on X that Stapleton was a \"legend in broadcasting\" and \"always good-humoured and gracious to work with\". Kate Garraway shared a photo from their GMTV days and said she was \"absolutely devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and journalistic hero\". LBC's Iain Dale called him a \"great interviewer\" with \"a real instinct for the mood of a nation\". \"He was a good friend, a kind, wise and very funny man and he was a broadcasting giant,\" added the BBC's Nicky Campbell. \"Effortless, relaxed and incisive. A steel hand in a velvet glove. My condolences to all who loved him. There are many. Rest in peace my friend.\" As a life-long Manchester City fan, the club also posted a tribute on X. \"John was a passionate City supporter and a regular at the Etihad Stadium,\" it said. \"He will be missed. Our thoughts are with John's family and friends at this difficult time.\" Stapleton was born in Oldham and began his career at local papers in Greater Manchester. In a career of over 50 years, he covered many of the biggest news events of the day, interviewing prime ministers and appearing in shows with millions of viewers. He also worked for Sky News on a programme called Newsline in 1989, with Margaret Thatcher among those facing his questions during the channel's launch year. One of Stapleton's highlights was being named Royal Television Society presenter of the year in 2004 for his work on the Iraq War and a series of interviews that included Sir Tony Blair.

In October last year, Stapleton opened up about his Parkinson's diagnosis, a condition his mother also had. \"I am fairly pragmatic about the prospect of this getting worse,\" he said. \"I try to remain positive, because what's the point of not being?\" \"Speaking is how I've earned my living for the best part of 50 years,\" he said in the BBC interview. \"It's very frustrating sometimes, particularly (when) people are constantly saying to you, 'sorry, what did you say?' And you have to repeat yourself, time and time again.\" Stapleton's son, Nick, said on social media that he was \"incredibly blessed to have had two pretty remarkable parents\". He said his father was \"a very loving, unbelievably generous man\" who left on \"his own terms, without suffering\". \"You won't meet anyone with a bad word to say about him. And you can't do much better than that,\" he added."
