        "Content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for crucial talks with Donald Trump later today to once again try to bring to an end Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting between the two presidents will take place after hours of air attacks by Russia on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Saturday. At least two people died and more than 30 others were injured, according to authorities. Mr Zelenskyy has held discussions with Mr Trump several times this year, most recently at the White House in October, as the US leads the diplomatic push to end the war that has been raging for almost four years. This time, they will meet in Florida to discuss several issues, including territory, security guarantees and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the Ukrainian leader has said. Afterwards, he will hold further talks with European leaders. Mr Zelenskyy said he hopes the \"very important\" meeting with Mr Trump will be \"very constructive\". A 20-point peace framework and security guarantee deal to be discussed \"is about 90% ready\" and \"a lot can be decided before the New Year\", he said. Ahead of the discussions with the US leader, the Ukrainian president made a pit-stop in Canada to meet the country's prime minister, Mark Carney. Mr Carney announced an additional $2.5 ​billion ​of economic ‍aid for Ukraine - and condemned Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv as acts of \"barbarism\". Explosions boomed across the Ukrainian capital for hours early on Saturday as ballistic missiles and drones hit the city. In a post on Telegram, Mr Zelenskyy said Russia targeted Ukraine with almost 500 drones and 40 missiles of various types. \"There have been many questions these days,\" he wrote. \"Where is the Russian response to the proposals to end the war, which were made by the United States and the world?\" The strikes left at least a third of the city without power, with private electricity company DTEK reporting around 500,000 families were without power at one point.

But several residential buildings were also hit, according to Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko. Russia said the strike came in response to Ukraine's attacks on \"civilian objects\" in Russia. Earlier on Saturday, its defence ministry said it had shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight. On Saturday afternoon, the ministry said 147 more drones were shot down over a number of Russian regions. Poland said it scrambled fighter jets and temporarily closed two of its airports in the east of the country in response to Russia's attack. There was no violation of Polish airspace, the country's armed forces command said on X. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on Saturday that Russian forces had captured one town in the Donetsk region and one in Zaporizhzhia. Both areas are heavily contested and key to Russia's territorial ambitions in the east of Ukraine. Sky News could not independently verify the battlefield reports."

A five-month-old infant was wrapped in a small shroud of white tarp after an Israeli strike on a school shelter in the designated green zone (under Israeli military control). A 29-day-old baby was declared dead on the cold stainless steel of a table in a morgue after suffering hypothermia in his family's tent. Children as young as 8 years old are called \"suspects\" by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and killed for venturing close to the shifting yellow line demarcating their control. These are the scenes of devastation and despair during what is called a ceasefire in Gaza. International journalists have been barred from independently reporting from the strip for more than two years. The drone footage of vast areas of ashen rubble is still shocking through a screen. \n                  Volodymyr Zelenskyy gets ready for 'very important' peace talks with Donald Trump in Florida\n                 \n                  Ukraine peace talks: What are the major issues remaining as Zelenskyy prepares to meet Trump?\n                 \n                  Israel criticised after becoming first country to formally recognise Somaliland as independent nation\n                 \"It is one of the most devastated places on earth to date,\" says Alessandro Mrakic, the head of the United Nations Development Programme's Gaza office. \"85% of the buildings have been, either partially or totally damaged, with almost 2 million people being currently displaced.\" Israel does not permit the entry of reconstruction material and heavy machinery required to rebuild homes in the current phase of the US-led peace plan. The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit told Sky News that \"at this stage, and in line with the agreement, no reconstruction materials are being transferred into Gaza.\" For Alessandro's team, rebuilding Gaza will be a mammoth effort even if Israel permits the entry of construction materials and equipment. \"In a best-case scenario, if we are equipped with the proper human resources, with the proper machinery; the very initial preliminary calculation, just to remove the volume around 60 million tons - it will take seven years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will soon meet with US President Donald Trump in Florida to discuss the second phase of his Gaza peace plan, as well as the future of Israel's warfronts with Iran and Lebanon. In the lead-up to the meeting, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz made it clear that the IDF will not be leaving Gaza. \"We are deep inside Gaza and we will never leave Gaza, there will be no such thing. We're there to defend, to prevent what happened in the past.\" He was referring to the October 7th attack in 2023, where Hamas militants bulldozed the Gaza border wall and entered Israel. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and more than 250 were taken hostage by Hamas. Health officials say over 71,200 Palestinians, including at least 20,000 children, have been killed in Israel's ensuing military assault on Gaza. IDF operations are ongoing during the ceasefire period, and satellite images show new military outposts to the east of the yellow line demarcating Israeli control as part of phase one of Trump's peace plan. The Sky News Data & Forensics team analysed satellite imagery, which shows that yellow blocks positioned by the IDF troops on the ground to mark their territory are 390 - 490 metres deeper into Gaza than mapped on official IDF channels. \"It basically swallows more than half of the area of the Gaza strip but since the ceasefire agreement, it has continuously changed. \"Every day it is changing, every day the yellow line swallows more land and we have so far documented that the yellow line has swallowed 53 - 54% of Gaza's land,\" says Maha Hussein, the Gaza-based Strategy Director of the Euro-Med human rights monitor. \"Where they have expanded the yellow line, many people are getting killed, injured and targeted by Israeli snipers, quadcopters, even artillery shelling and also airstrikes. We have documented dozens of cases of people, including children, among the victims.\" One of them is 16-year-old Zahir Nasser Shamia. A video shared by his friends shows them walking near the yellow blocks when a gunshot is fired. Another shows them running across the rubble yelling out his name. Eyewitnesses say Zahir was shot in the head by Israeli forces and then run over by a bulldozer. Read more from Sky News:Gaza ceasefire negotiations at 'critical moment'Gaza City hit by floods The IDF acknowledged shooting Zahir and shared this response regarding the incident: \"IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip identified two terrorists who crossed the yellow line and approached the troops, posing an immediate threat to them. \"Following the identification, the troops eliminated one of the terrorists in order to remove the threat. IDF troops in the southern command remain deployed in the area in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and will continue to operate to remove any immediate threat.\" The IDF did not present evidence that Zahir was involved in terrorist activity. The Gaza Health Ministry says that at least 406 people have been killed and 1000 injured since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October. In another incident in an area designated as a green zone, the Gaza Martyrs School-turned-shelter was hit by Israeli shelling. At least six people were killed, including a five-month-old baby, in an incident the IDF said involved its troops targeting suspects to the west of the yellow line, beyond their territory. \"I don't know why they do this,\" says Jamal Ahmed Mohamed, a surviving relative of the family killed in the shelter. Why would the Israelis target a building full of displaced people - with no water, no clothes and no food?\""

        "Content": "A powerful winter storm has disrupted one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in New York City and northeastern US. Forecasters had predicted up to 11in of snow by 1pm Saturday, with the heaviest accumulation expected in the northern parts of the New York City and New Jersey metro areas. By Saturday morning, New York City had received around four inches of snow - slightly below expectations - and the skies were beginning to clear. Still, the storm has already caused significant disruptions to holiday travel, with at least 1,500 flights canceled since Friday night, according to the flight-tracking service FlightAware. John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, and LaGuardia Airports issued snow warnings on social media, cautioning that weather conditions could lead to further flight disruptions.

We're ready for however much we get.\" He later shared a post showing the salt spreaders and snowploughs out in force, treating the city streets. The last time the Big Apple experienced heavy snowfall was in 2022, when 8in of snow fell in Central Park. New York governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement on Friday: \"I encourage everyone to monitor local forecasts and avoid unnecessary travel. If you have to travel, plan ahead, take it slow, and leave plenty of time to get to where you need to go safely.\" New Jersey governor Tahesha Way wrote on X on Friday: \"Due to the severe snowstorm, with the potential of icy and slippery conditions, I have declared a State of Emergency across the state, beginning this afternoon. \"Please monitor official updates and remain off the roads unless necessary. Stay safe, New Jersey!\" The New York City area was expected to see between 2in and 5in of snow, with some areas seeing 6in towards the north, according to the National Weather Service. Six to 11in of snow was predicted from upstate New York to Long Island, with 12in possible, the National Weather Service had said. New York's Department of Sanitation has prepared 700 million pounds of salt to treat icy roads. The impact of the cold snap has been felt at airports across the country. San Francisco and Orlando experienced travel delays, as snow began falling on Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport. Airports in Florida have also seen hundreds of delayed flights, according to Sky's US partner NBC News. At Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, a resort southeast of Yosemite National Park, two ski patrollers were injured Friday morning in an avalanche and taken to a hospital, a resort official said. The resort has seen more than 5ft (1.5m) of snow since Tuesday. As much as 2ins (5cm) of snowfall an hour was expected in the Sierra Nevada, making mountain pass travel treacherous. Local officials rescued a backcountry skier who was buried in an avalanche Thursday near the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno."

The players were led out by Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk to applause from fans on both sides. Jota had a successful spell at Wolves before he joined Liverpool in 2020. The Portugal forward was tragically killed, along with his brother Andre Silva, on 3 July in a car crash in Spain. On Boxing Day night, Wolves attended tributes to the late footballer outside Anfield, laying down floral tributes to the star. Liverpool boss Arne Slot turned his attention towards the footballer's family ahead of the game. Writing in his matchday programme notes, Slot reflected on the past 12 months, which the Dutchman admitted \"ignites a roller coaster of emotions\" as he reflected on everything that has happened. Slot said: \"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him. \"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort - if that is even possible - but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace. \"The sense of loss will be particularly strong on Saturday, of course, as it will be the first time that Diogo's two English teams will meet since his tragic passing. \"Like us, Wolves were clearly very affected by the loss of such a special player and person so my thoughts continue to be with them also.\" Read more from Sky News:England end 15-year wait for away Ashes Test victoryUK pension funds eye stake in £4.5bn holiday giant Center Parcs Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp also paid tribute to Jota ahead of the game.

Of course, he was a top footballer; we all saw that at Wolves. \"His movement, his finishing, his intelligence, his work-rate was elite. But what really caught my eye was the hunger, the humility. \"He didn't need to announce himself. He just worked. He listened. He tried to make the team better. \"And when I looked at Liverpool in 2020, I thought﻿: ﻿'We need this guy.﻿' Not only for his football, but for his character.\""

        "Content": "Israel has been criticised after it became the first country to formally recognise Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent nation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would seek immediate cooperation with the Republic of Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. On Friday he said the declaration \"is in the spirit of the Abraham Accords, signed at the initiative of President Trump,\" a reference to an initiative begun in 2020 which established diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations. However, Somalia's government condemned Israel's move as an \"unlawful step\" and a \"deliberate attack\" on its sovereignty, with the prime minister's office rejecting any recognition of Somaliland. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said that Mr Netanyahu's recognition of the territory was \"illegal aggression\" and \"contrary to established legal and diplomatic rules.\" The European Union also called for respect for Somalia's unity and \"meaningful dialogue\" between Mogadishu and Somaliland to resolve their differences. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared independence from Somalia when the country descended into civil war in 1991 and has enjoyed effective autonomy, as well as relative peace and stability, since then.

        "Content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday for further talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader has said he and the US president will discuss several issues, including land and security guarantees. Here, Sky News looks at the major issues they are likely to discuss as a 20-point peace framework and security guarantee deal appear to be close. Ukraine war latest: Zelenskyy hoping for 'very constructive' talks What can we expect from the talks? Mr Zelenskyy has said the 20-point plan to be discussed \"is about 90% ready\" and that \"a lot can be decided before the New Year\". He said security guarantees and an \"economic agreement\" will also be discussed, but he did not say \"whether anything will be finalised by the end\". Ukraine will also raise \"territorial issues\", he added. What security guarantees could be agreed? Mr Zelenskyy has said he will prioritise discussing security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that these depend on Mr Trump and \"what he is ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long\". Earlier this week, he told Axios the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to help guard against future Russian aggression. Mr Trump has said the United States is the driving force behind the process and told Politico: \"He doesn't have anything until I approve it. So we'll see what he's got.\" Mr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine and the US had a \"common vision\" for co-operation on Ukraine's post-war recovery, which included the creation of several investment funds. The US has committed to providing guarantees mirroring NATO's Article 5, which means an attack on Ukraine would trigger a collective military response from the US and its allies - but key details remain. Why is territory a major sticking point? Territorial issues remain a major sticking point in the negotiations. Mr Zelenskyy has said he will discuss both Donbas and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the talks, but stressed Ukraine would never recognise any territory as Russian \"under any circumstances\". Moscow has demanded Ukraine withdraw from parts of the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian troops have failed to occupy during almost four years of war, as it seeks to gain full control of the Donbas, which comprises the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, Kyiv has argued the fighting should be halted along the current frontlines. Seeking a compromise, the US has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves parts of the Donetsk region - but the proposal gives no details on how such a zone would function. Axios cited Mr Zelenskyy saying if he is not able to push the US to back Ukraine's \"strong\" position on the issue of land, he is willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and then hold the vote. According to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Mr Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine, but he wanted the whole of the Donbas in exchange. Nuclear power plant issue remains unresolved Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Although almost all countries consider that the plant, Europe's largest, belongs to Ukraine, Moscow claims it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs it. Mr Zelenskyy has said the US side has proposed joint trilateral operation of the plant between the US, Ukraine and Russia. But he said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the US determining how to use 50% of the energy produced. Oleksandr Kharchenko, the director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intends to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in Russia's south. He said it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the plant. What has Russia said? Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Moscow can see Kyiv is in no hurry to end the conflict by peaceful means, according to the Interfax news agency. Mr Putin said if Ukraine does not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, then Russia will accomplish all goals of its \"special military operation\" by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported. It came after Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, which Mr Zelenskyy said demonstrated Moscow wanted to continue the war while Kyiv wanted peace. Mr Trump has said he believes the meeting on Sunday will go well, and he also expects to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"soon, as much as I want\"."

The Portugal forward was tragically killed, along with his brother Andre Silva, on 3 July in a car crash in Spain. On Boxing Day night, Wolves attended tributes to the late footballer outside Anfield, laying down floral tributes to the star. Liverpool boss Arne Slot turned his attention towards the footballer's family ahead of the game. Writing in his matchday programme notes, Slot reflected on the past 12 months, which the Dutchman admitted \"ignites a roller coaster of emotions\" as he reflected on everything that has happened. Slot said: \"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him. \"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort - if that is even possible - but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace. \"The sense of loss will be particularly strong on Saturday, of course, as it will be the first time that Diogo's two English teams will meet since his tragic passing. \"Like us, Wolves were clearly very affected by the loss of such a special player and person so my thoughts continue to be with them also.\" Read more from Sky News:England end 15-year wait for away Ashes Test victoryUK pension funds eye stake in £4.5bn holiday giant Center Parcs Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp also paid tribute to Jota ahead of the game.

The Treasury will back the cover for the priceless artefact under the Government Indemnity Scheme - an alternative to commercial insurance that allows art and cultural objects to be shown in the UK. Indirectly backed by the British taxpayer, the indemnity will cover it for damage or loss during its transfer from France and while it is on display. The 70m fabric depiction of the 1066 Norman invasion and Battle of Hastings is not far off 1,000 years old. It depicts the battle which saw William the Conqueror take the English throne from Harold Godwinson and become the first Norman king of England. It's understood the tapestry will be displayed behind a protective screen while on show. In Normandy, it's been displayed behind a bespoke glass case. The Financial Times reported the Treasury had provisionally approved an estimated valuation of around £800m for the tapestry. \n                  Fired British Museum worker arrested after 'shutting down' museum computer systems\n                 \n                  Elgin Marbles: High level 'private meetings' ahead of Greek PM visit, source says \n                 \n                  Man jailed after being caught upskirting woman at British Museum by off-duty police officer\n                 Most recently housed at the Bayeux Tapestry Museum in Normandy, it will be loaned to the British Museum next year while the French museum closes for renovation. Its reopening is scheduled for October 2027. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"The Government Indemnity Scheme is a long-standing scheme that allows museums and galleries to borrow high-value works for major exhibitions, increasing visitor numbers and providing public benefits. \"Without this cover, public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost-effective.\" The scheme is estimated to have saved UK museums and galleries £81m compared to commercial insurance. It is part of a cultural exchange that will see the British Museum loan the Sutton Hoo collection, the Lewis Chessmen and other items to France in return for the tapestry. Former chancellor and chair of the British Museum George Osborne has said he expects the tapestry exhibition to be \"the blockbuster show of our generation\". Meanwhile, in France, dissenting voices from the art and conservation fields have called on President Emmanuel Macron to abandon the project over concerns transportation would cause irreparable damage to the tapestry. A detailed agreement between the British and French ministries sets out transfer plans, which include the use of a special crate and a test run with a facsimile of the tapestry ahead of transporting the real thing. The UK has seen a spate of activist attacks on works of art and artefacts in recent years. Incidents include protesters glueing themselves to the frame of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery in 2022, and tomato soup being thrown at Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at the National Gallery in 2022 and again in 2024. Earlier this month, crumble and custard was thrown at the State Crown display case in the Tower of London. The Bayeux Tapestry will be on show at the British Museum from September 2026 to July 2027."

A five-month-old infant was wrapped in a small shroud of white tarp after an Israeli strike on a school shelter in the designated green zone (under Israeli military control). A 29-day-old baby was declared dead on the cold stainless steel of a table in a morgue after suffering hypothermia in his family's tent. Children as young as 8 years old are called \"suspects\" by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and killed for venturing close to the shifting yellow line demarcating their control. These are the scenes of devastation and despair during what is called a ceasefire in Gaza. International journalists have been barred from independently reporting from the strip for more than two years. The drone footage of vast areas of ashen rubble is still shocking through a screen. \n                  Volodymyr Zelenskyy gets ready for 'very important' peace talks with Donald Trump in Florida\n                 \n                  Ukraine peace talks: What are the major issues remaining as Zelenskyy prepares to meet Trump?\n                 \n                  Israel criticised after becoming first country to formally recognise Somaliland as independent nation\n                 \"It is one of the most devastated places on earth to date,\" says Alessandro Mrakic, the head of the United Nations Development Programme's Gaza office. \"85% of the buildings have been, either partially or totally damaged, with almost 2 million people being currently displaced.\" Israel does not permit the entry of reconstruction material and heavy machinery required to rebuild homes in the current phase of the US-led peace plan. The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit told Sky News that \"at this stage, and in line with the agreement, no reconstruction materials are being transferred into Gaza.\" For Alessandro's team, rebuilding Gaza will be a mammoth effort even if Israel permits the entry of construction materials and equipment. \"In a best-case scenario, if we are equipped with the proper human resources, with the proper machinery; the very initial preliminary calculation, just to remove the volume around 60 million tons - it will take seven years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will soon meet with US President Donald Trump in Florida to discuss the second phase of his Gaza peace plan, as well as the future of Israel's warfronts with Iran and Lebanon. In the lead-up to the meeting, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz made it clear that the IDF will not be leaving Gaza. \"We are deep inside Gaza and we will never leave Gaza, there will be no such thing. We're there to defend, to prevent what happened in the past.\" He was referring to the October 7th attack in 2023, where Hamas militants bulldozed the Gaza border wall and entered Israel. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and more than 250 were taken hostage by Hamas. Health officials say over 71,200 Palestinians, including at least 20,000 children, have been killed in Israel's ensuing military assault on Gaza. IDF operations are ongoing during the ceasefire period, and satellite images show new military outposts to the east of the yellow line demarcating Israeli control as part of phase one of Trump's peace plan. The Sky News Data & Forensics team analysed satellite imagery, which shows that yellow blocks positioned by the IDF troops on the ground to mark their territory are 390 - 490 metres deeper into Gaza than mapped on official IDF channels. \"It basically swallows more than half of the area of the Gaza strip but since the ceasefire agreement, it has continuously changed. \"Every day it is changing, every day the yellow line swallows more land and we have so far documented that the yellow line has swallowed 53 - 54% of Gaza's land,\" says Maha Hussein, the Gaza-based Strategy Director of the Euro-Med human rights monitor. \"Where they have expanded the yellow line, many people are getting killed, injured and targeted by Israeli snipers, quadcopters, even artillery shelling and also airstrikes. We have documented dozens of cases of people, including children, among the victims.\" One of them is 16-year-old Zahir Nasser Shamia. A video shared by his friends shows them walking near the yellow blocks when a gunshot is fired. Another shows them running across the rubble yelling out his name. Eyewitnesses say Zahir was shot in the head by Israeli forces and then run over by a bulldozer. Read more from Sky News:Gaza ceasefire negotiations at 'critical moment'Gaza City hit by floods The IDF acknowledged shooting Zahir and shared this response regarding the incident: \"IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip identified two terrorists who crossed the yellow line and approached the troops, posing an immediate threat to them. \"Following the identification, the troops eliminated one of the terrorists in order to remove the threat. IDF troops in the southern command remain deployed in the area in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and will continue to operate to remove any immediate threat.\" The IDF did not present evidence that Zahir was involved in terrorist activity. The Gaza Health Ministry says that at least 406 people have been killed and 1000 injured since the start of the ceasefire on 10 October. In another incident in an area designated as a green zone, the Gaza Martyrs School-turned-shelter was hit by Israeli shelling. At least six people were killed, including a five-month-old baby, in an incident the IDF said involved its troops targeting suspects to the west of the yellow line, beyond their territory. \"I don't know why they do this,\" says Jamal Ahmed Mohamed, a surviving relative of the family killed in the shelter. Why would the Israelis target a building full of displaced people - with no water, no clothes and no food?\""

        "Content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for crucial talks with Donald Trump later today to once again try to bring to an end Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting between the two presidents will take place after hours of air attacks by Russia on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Saturday. At least two people died and more than 30 others were injured, according to authorities. Mr Zelenskyy has held discussions with Mr Trump several times this year, most recently at the White House in October, as the US leads the diplomatic push to end the war that has been raging for almost four years. This time, they will meet in Florida to discuss several issues, including territory, security guarantees and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the Ukrainian leader has said. Afterwards, he will hold further talks with European leaders. Mr Zelenskyy said he hopes the \"very important\" meeting with Mr Trump will be \"very constructive\". A 20-point peace framework and security guarantee deal to be discussed \"is about 90% ready\" and \"a lot can be decided before the New Year\", he said. Ahead of the discussions with the US leader, the Ukrainian president made a pit-stop in Canada to meet the country's prime minister, Mark Carney. Mr Carney announced an additional $2.5 ​billion ​of economic ‍aid for Ukraine - and condemned Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv as acts of \"barbarism\". Explosions boomed across the Ukrainian capital for hours early on Saturday as ballistic missiles and drones hit the city. In a post on Telegram, Mr Zelenskyy said Russia targeted Ukraine with almost 500 drones and 40 missiles of various types. \"There have been many questions these days,\" he wrote. \"Where is the Russian response to the proposals to end the war, which were made by the United States and the world?\" The strikes left at least a third of the city without power, with private electricity company DTEK reporting around 500,000 families were without power at one point. Read more:Peace talks: What are the main issues remaining?Analysis: How Trump has supercharged the new world dis-order The Russian defence ministry said it carried out a \"massive strike\" overnight, using \"long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air, and sea\", as well as drones, on energy infrastructure facilities \"used by the Ukrainian armed forces\" and \"Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises\". But several residential buildings were also hit, according to Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko. Russia said the strike came in response to Ukraine's attacks on \"civilian objects\" in Russia. Earlier on Saturday, its defence ministry said it had shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight. On Saturday afternoon, the ministry said 147 more drones were shot down over a number of Russian regions. Poland said it scrambled fighter jets and temporarily closed two of its airports in the east of the country in response to Russia's attack. There was no violation of Polish airspace, the country's armed forces command said on X. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on Saturday that Russian forces had captured one town in the Donetsk region and one in Zaporizhzhia. Both areas are heavily contested and key to Russia's territorial ambitions in the east of Ukraine. Sky News could not independently verify the battlefield reports."

        "Content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday for further talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader has said he and the US president will discuss several issues, including land and security guarantees. Here, Sky News looks at the major issues they are likely to discuss as a 20-point peace framework and security guarantee deal appear to be close. Ukraine war latest: Zelenskyy hoping for 'very constructive' talks What can we expect from the talks? Mr Zelenskyy has said the 20-point plan to be discussed \"is about 90% ready\" and that \"a lot can be decided before the New Year\". He said security guarantees and an \"economic agreement\" will also be discussed, but he did not say \"whether anything will be finalised by the end\". Ukraine will also raise \"territorial issues\", he added. What security guarantees could be agreed? Mr Zelenskyy has said he will prioritise discussing security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that these depend on Mr Trump and \"what he is ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long\". Earlier this week, he told Axios the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to help guard against future Russian aggression. Mr Trump has said the United States is the driving force behind the process and told Politico: \"He doesn't have anything until I approve it. So we'll see what he's got.\" Mr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine and the US had a \"common vision\" for co-operation on Ukraine's post-war recovery, which included the creation of several investment funds. The US has committed to providing guarantees mirroring NATO's Article 5, which means an attack on Ukraine would trigger a collective military response from the US and its allies - but key details remain. Why is territory a major sticking point? Territorial issues remain a major sticking point in the negotiations. Mr Zelenskyy has said he will discuss both Donbas and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the talks, but stressed Ukraine would never recognise any territory as Russian \"under any circumstances\". Moscow has demanded Ukraine withdraw from parts of the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian troops have failed to occupy during almost four years of war, as it seeks to gain full control of the Donbas, which comprises the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, Kyiv has argued the fighting should be halted along the current frontlines. Seeking a compromise, the US has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves parts of the Donetsk region - but the proposal gives no details on how such a zone would function. Axios cited Mr Zelenskyy saying if he is not able to push the US to back Ukraine's \"strong\" position on the issue of land, he is willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and then hold the vote. According to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Mr Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine, but he wanted the whole of the Donbas in exchange. Nuclear power plant issue remains unresolved Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Although almost all countries consider that the plant, Europe's largest, belongs to Ukraine, Moscow claims it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs it. Mr Zelenskyy has said the US side has proposed joint trilateral operation of the plant between the US, Ukraine and Russia. But he said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the US determining how to use 50% of the energy produced. Oleksandr Kharchenko, the director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intends to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in Russia's south. He said it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the plant. What has Russia said? Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Moscow can see Kyiv is in no hurry to end the conflict by peaceful means, according to the Interfax news agency. Mr Putin said if Ukraine does not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, then Russia will accomplish all goals of its \"special military operation\" by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported. It came after Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, which Mr Zelenskyy said demonstrated Moscow wanted to continue the war while Kyiv wanted peace. Mr Trump has said he believes the meeting on Sunday will go well, and he also expects to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"soon, as much as I want\"."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would seek immediate cooperation with the Republic of Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. On Friday he said the declaration \"is in the spirit of the Abraham Accords, signed at the initiative of President Trump,\" a reference to an initiative begun in 2020 which established diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations. However, Somalia's government condemned Israel's move as an \"unlawful step\" and a \"deliberate attack\" on its sovereignty, with the prime minister's office rejecting any recognition of Somaliland. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said that Mr Netanyahu's recognition of the territory was \"illegal aggression\" and \"contrary to established legal and diplomatic rules.\" The European Union also called for respect for Somalia's unity and \"meaningful dialogue\" between Mogadishu and Somaliland to resolve their differences. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared independence from Somalia when the country descended into civil war in 1991 and has enjoyed effective autonomy, as well as relative peace and stability, since then. The US State Department said it continued to recognise the territorial integrity of Somalia, \"which includes the territory of Somaliland\".

        "Content": "Thailand and Cambodia have signed a ceasefire agreement to end weeks of armed combat along their border over competing claims to territory. It took effect at noon local time. As well as an end to the fighting, the agreement also calls for no further military movements by either side, and no violations of either side's airspace for military purposes. The ceasefire was holding, Thai defence ministry spokesperson Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri told Reuters - around two hours after it went into effect at noon (5am GMT). Cambodia's Ministry of National Defence did not report any clashes after what it said had been a Thai airstrike early on Saturday before the ceasefire announcement. The deal also calls for Thailand, after the ceasefire has held for 72 hours, to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side. The agreement was signed by the two countries' defence ministers, Cambodia's Tea Seiha and Thailand's Nattaphon Narkphanit, at a checkpoint on their border after lower-level talks by military officials for three days as part of the already-established General Border Committee. For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817km land border - a dispute that has occasionally exploded into skirmishes and fighting. The fragility of the new agreement was underlined by Thailand's defence ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri. He said after Saturday's signing that the 72-hour initial ceasefire is \"not an act of trust nor unconditional acceptance but a time frame to tangibly prove whether Cambodia can truly cease the use of weapons, provocations and threats in the area\". Read more from Sky News:Kyiv bombarded - despite key peace talks this weekendHimmler's grandson reveals what he thinks of Holocaust architect The original July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through after pressure from US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalised in more detail at a regional meeting in Malaysia in October that Mr Trump attended. Despite those deals, the two nations carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued, escalating to widespread heavy fighting in early December. Thailand has lost 26 soldiers and one civilian as a direct result of the conflict since 7 December, according to officials. Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths from collateral effects. Cambodia hasn't issued an official figure on military casualties, but says 30 civilians have been killed and 90 injured. Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated from areas affected on both sides of the border. The two sides traded blame for starting the fighting and claimed to be acting in self-defence. The agreement also calls on both countries to adhere to international agreements against deploying landmines - a major concern of Thailand. The new ceasefire will be monitored by an observer team from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc, as well as direct coordination between both nations, Mr Narkphanit said. \"At the same time, at the policy level, there will be direct communication between the minister of defence and chief of the armed forces of both sides,\" he told reporters."

        "Content": "White House officials wanted Bill Clinton to avoid shaking Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' hand in front of cameras during his historic visit to Ireland in 1995, newly released records show. Mr Clinton visited Northern Ireland in November 1995, becoming the first serving US president to make the trip. Mr Adams was president of Sinn Fein, regarded as the political wing of the IRA paramilitary group, between 1983 and 2018, but has always denied being a member of the IRA. Mr Clinton and Gerry Adams famously shook hands on the Falls Road in Belfast on the morning of 30 November, but official documents which have been declassified show that the White House had wanted to avoid a handshake being seen by the public. A letter written by the Irish government official David Donoghue ahead of the presidential visit detailed how \"the Americans would prefer to avoid a handshake photograph between the president and Adams\". Mr Clinton would later say the handshake was a \"big deal\" and that it felt at the time as though \"the pavement was about to crack open\". The pair had met for the first time in the White House earlier that year, but only shook hands after photographers left the room. \n                  Trump 'hated' to see Bill Clinton photos in Epstein files\n                 \n                  Epstein's 'birthday book' - by Clinton, Mandelson, and Trump\n                 \n                  Ukrainian diplomat involved in 90s nuclear deal with Russia warns Trump about 'very big mistake' with Putin\n                 Mr Clinton was reportedly put under pressure at the time from then British prime minister John Major not to give Mr Adams a warm reception, according to the New York Times. Clinton's ancestral links to Co Fermanagh 'largely fantasy' The documents from the National Archives of Ireland also included the findings of a genealogy expert researching Mr Clinton's ancestry, as there had long been claims that he had Cassidy ancestors on his mother's side who were from Co Fermanagh. Genealogist Sean Murphy wanted to trace the president's ancestry after \"media dissemination of claims concerning the president's Irish ancestry which proved to be baseless, yet were left un-contradicted by any authoritative source\". He told the Taoiseach's office that his links to Co Fermanagh in northern Ireland were \"based largely on fantasy\". He said the earliest trace of the president's maternal ancestors of his mother's line was \"probably\" Zachariah Cassidy, born in about 1750-60 in South Carolina, and his son Levi. \"The Cassidy 'clan' claim that the earliest ancestor was a Luke or Lucas Cassidy of Roslea, Co Fermanagh, appears to be based largely on fantasy,\" he wrote.

The National Archives of Ireland releases batches of declassified government files annually, with information typically relating to events 30 years before. Last year, it was revealed former US attorney general Janet Reno had strongly advised Mr Clinton not to give Mr Adams a temporary visa in 1995, as there was no evidence that suggested \"progress has been made towards the disarmament and demobilisation of the IRA\". The visa included permission for fundraising in the US."

        "Content": "A powerful winter storm has disrupted one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in New York City and northeastern US. Forecasters had predicted up to 11in of snow by 1pm Saturday, with the heaviest accumulation expected in the northern parts of the New York City and New Jersey metro areas. By Saturday morning, New York City had received around four inches of snow - slightly below expectations - and the skies were beginning to clear. Still, the storm has already caused significant disruptions to holiday travel, with at least 1,500 flights canceled since Friday night, according to the flight-tracking service FlightAware. John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, and LaGuardia Airports issued snow warnings on social media, cautioning that weather conditions could lead to further flight disruptions.

The last time the Big Apple experienced heavy snowfall was in 2022, when 8in of snow fell in Central Park. New York governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement on Friday: \"I encourage everyone to monitor local forecasts and avoid unnecessary travel. If you have to travel, plan ahead, take it slow, and leave plenty of time to get to where you need to go safely.\" New Jersey governor Tahesha Way wrote on X on Friday: \"Due to the severe snowstorm, with the potential of icy and slippery conditions, I have declared a State of Emergency across the state, beginning this afternoon. \"Please monitor official updates and remain off the roads unless necessary. Stay safe, New Jersey!\" The New York City area was expected to see between 2in and 5in of snow, with some areas seeing 6in towards the north, according to the National Weather Service. Six to 11in of snow was predicted from upstate New York to Long Island, with 12in possible, the National Weather Service had said. New York's Department of Sanitation has prepared 700 million pounds of salt to treat icy roads. The impact of the cold snap has been felt at airports across the country. San Francisco and Orlando experienced travel delays, as snow began falling on Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport. Airports in Florida have also seen hundreds of delayed flights, according to Sky's US partner NBC News. At Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, a resort southeast of Yosemite National Park, two ski patrollers were injured Friday morning in an avalanche and taken to a hospital, a resort official said. The resort has seen more than 5ft (1.5m) of snow since Tuesday. As much as 2ins (5cm) of snowfall an hour was expected in the Sierra Nevada, making mountain pass travel treacherous. Local officials rescued a backcountry skier who was buried in an avalanche Thursday near the Mount Rose ski resort on the edge of Reno."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Some of Britain's biggest public sector pension schemes are in talks to take a stake in Center Parcs as its Canadian owner finalises a recapitalisation of the holiday parks giant. Sky News has learnt that bodies including the Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF), the London-based Local Pension Partnership (LPPI) and the Edinburgh-based Lothian Pension Scheme are among those which have been in negotiations about buying between 15% and 20% of the company. The GMPF, which is part of the Northern LGPS, is the UK's single-biggest biggest local government pension scheme, with well over £30bn under management and responsibility for the retirement savings of more than 430,000 members. City sources said this weekend that the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which manages the pensions of university lecturers, had also been involved in the discussions, although it was unclear whether it would be part of the final syndicate of backers. Center Parcs will be valued at approximately £4.5bn as part of the process, which is expected to conclude during the first quarter of 2026. A deal has not yet been finalised, and some of the pension funds which have been exploring a deal may decide not to participate, according to sources. The Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, which is already a shareholder in Center Parcs, may invest more capital into the leisure group, according to insiders. \n                  High street banking giants vie for £2.5bn wealth manager Evelyn \n                 \n                  The UK's worst Christmas gifts: Rotten fruit, used pyjamas and a Spurs book for a Chelsea fan \n                 \n                  Reeves's budget tax rises 'a pub destroyer', say landlords\n                 The process, which has been initiated by Center Parcs' Canadian owner, Brookfield Asset Management, would reflect a push by the Treasury to see more of British pension funds' capital invested in UK assets. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, claimed in May that the Mansion House Accord would unlock £50bn from 17 major workplace pension providers to invest in UK-based assets. Brookfield is expected to remain the majority owner after the Center Parcs refinancing process has been completed. Center Parcs has enjoyed strong trading since the lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and boasts one of the British leisure industry's best-known brands. Its resorts draw millions of visitors annually to its five UK sites and the latest addition to its portfolio, at Longford Forest in Ireland. The company recently won planning permission to build a new £450m site in the Scottish Borders. Its locations offer a mixture of adventure and leisure activities for families, such as watersports and horse riding, as well as upmarket spa packages which have become an increasing focus for its management. The company opened its first site in the UK in 1987 at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. Center Parcs has been a public company in the past, floating on London's junior AIM market in 2003 before moving to a main market listing two years later. It was then taken over by Blackstone, the private equity firm, in 2006, before being sold to Brookfield in 2015 in a deal reported to have been worth £2.4bn. Center Parcs' UK and Ireland operations are owned separately to the European business that also trades under the brand. The Center Parcs name dates back to 1968, when the first village opened in The Netherlands. Run by chief executive Colin McKinlay, Center Parcs' shareholders have received hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends since Brookfield bought the business. It owns resorts in Cumbria, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire, Suffolk and Bedfordshire, as well as the Longford Forest site in Ballymahon, Ireland. A previous attempt by Brookfield to sell the company stalled in 2023. Center Parcs' recapitalisation process is being managed by bankers at Bank of America, Barclays and Eastdil. Brookfield and USS declined to comment, while none of the other pension funds which have held talks about a deal could be reached for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n The Bayeux Tapestry will be insured for around £800m when it comes to the UK next year. The Treasury will back the cover for the priceless artefact under the Government Indemnity Scheme - an alternative to commercial insurance that allows art and cultural objects to be shown in the UK. Indirectly backed by the British taxpayer, the indemnity will cover it for damage or loss during its transfer from France and while it is on display. The 70m fabric depiction of the 1066 Norman invasion and Battle of Hastings is not far off 1,000 years old. It depicts the battle which saw William the Conqueror take the English throne from Harold Godwinson and become the first Norman king of England. It's understood the tapestry will be displayed behind a protective screen while on show. In Normandy, it's been displayed behind a bespoke glass case. The Financial Times reported the Treasury had provisionally approved an estimated valuation of around £800m for the tapestry. \n                  Fired British Museum worker arrested after 'shutting down' museum computer systems\n                 \n                  Elgin Marbles: High level 'private meetings' ahead of Greek PM visit, source says \n                 \n                  Man jailed after being caught upskirting woman at British Museum by off-duty police officer\n                 Most recently housed at the Bayeux Tapestry Museum in Normandy, it will be loaned to the British Museum next year while the French museum closes for renovation. Its reopening is scheduled for October 2027. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"The Government Indemnity Scheme is a long-standing scheme that allows museums and galleries to borrow high-value works for major exhibitions, increasing visitor numbers and providing public benefits. \"Without this cover, public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost-effective.\" The scheme is estimated to have saved UK museums and galleries £81m compared to commercial insurance. It is part of a cultural exchange that will see the British Museum loan the Sutton Hoo collection, the Lewis Chessmen and other items to France in return for the tapestry. Former chancellor and chair of the British Museum George Osborne has said he expects the tapestry exhibition to be \"the blockbuster show of our generation\". Meanwhile, in France, dissenting voices from the art and conservation fields have called on President Emmanuel Macron to abandon the project over concerns transportation would cause irreparable damage to the tapestry. A detailed agreement between the British and French ministries sets out transfer plans, which include the use of a special crate and a test run with a facsimile of the tapestry ahead of transporting the real thing. The UK has seen a spate of activist attacks on works of art and artefacts in recent years. Incidents include protesters glueing themselves to the frame of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery in 2022, and tomato soup being thrown at Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at the National Gallery in 2022 and again in 2024. Earlier this month, crumble and custard was thrown at the State Crown display case in the Tower of London. The Bayeux Tapestry will be on show at the British Museum from September 2026 to July 2027."
