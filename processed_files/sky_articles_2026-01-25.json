        "Headline": "The prime minister voted personally to stop his potential rival's bid to return to Westminster and Mr Burnham will remain as Manchester mayor.",
        "Content": "Andy Burnham has said he is \"disappointed\" after Labour's governing body blocked him from standing as an MP at the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election. Mr Burnham formally requested permission on Saturday to stand for the contest. As mayor of Greater Manchester, he needed approval to contest a different political election. Mr Burnham's return to Westminster was seen by many as a potential challenge to Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) voted to block the mayor's request on Sunday. Sky News understands the 10-person panel voted eight to one to block Mr Burnham's bid, with only deputy leader Lucy Powell backing him. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, chair of the NEC - Labour's governing body - abstained. The prime minister was among those who voted against Mr Burnham, along with union figures and other Labour Party representatives. Mr Burnham said he was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"concerned about its potential impact on the important elections ahead of us\". \"To whoever is Labour's candidate and to our members in Manchester and Tameside: you will have my full support and I will be there whenever you need me,\" added the mayor. He said he would \"return with full focus\" to his current role after offering to stand as MP to help beat Reform, writing on X: \"We are stronger together and let's stay that way.\" In another post, Mr Burnham criticised the Labour leadership. \"The fact that the media was informed of the NEC decision before I was tells you everything you need to know about the way the Labour Party is being run these days,\" he wrote. \"You would think that over 30 years of service would count for something but sadly not.\" However, a Labour source told Sky News' Beth Rigby this was \"categorically untrue\". \"Am told the party attempted to contact Andy shortly after the meeting had concluded over the phone and then contacted him via email,\" she posted on X. Political editor It has been a frenzied 48 hours of Labour leadership speculation after Andy Burnham tried to throw his hat in the ring for a return to parliament. On Sunday, Starmer's allies emphatically tried to shut that down, as the NEC's panel voted 8-1 to block the Manchester mayor's bid. Only the deputy Labour leader and Greater Manchester MP Lucy Powell supported Burnham, with the chair, home secretary Shabana Mahmood, abstaining (as is custom). The reasons cited were concerns over the unnecessary costs of having to hold an election for the Manchester metro mayor during important local, Welsh and Scottish elections, and the prospect of Reform running a divisive campaign in the city and greater Manchester region. Polling suggests that Reform would have a real prospect of taking the region in what would have become a hugely symbolic battle - rather like the fight for the West Midlands mayor which Labour won from the Conservatives ahead of the 2024 election. But there is also bucketloads of politics in this, as the frenzy over a possible return of Burnham to parliament has shown. In blocking Burnham, the PM and his team have decided it's better they take the short-term pain and inevitable backlash than allow the psychodrama of the Starmer-Burnham leadership battle to run for weeks in the May elections, drowning out policy discussions and making the party look divided. Read the full analysis here A party statement said the reason behind the decision was the cost of running the campaigns for both a parliamentary seat and a Manchester mayoralty by-election. \"Although the party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour's control of Greater Manchester at any risk, the statement said. \"Andy Burnham is doing a great job as mayor of Greater Manchester,\" it added. \"We believe it is in the best interests of the party to avoid an unnecessary mayoral election which would use substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and resources that are better spent tackling the cost of living crisis. \"We look forward to fighting and winning the upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton and the positive campaign ahead which will be firmly focused on tackling the cost of living and bringing investment to the local area.\" Read more:Why it's a make-or-break year for Keir StarmerCrisis close to home could decide PM's fate Starmer told move will 'hasten demise'  Despite anger on the left of the party, MPs loyal to Mr Starmer have backed the decision. Bolton West's Phil Brickell said recent speculation had \"seen the Labour Party quickly turn inward... undermining the PM's efforts at home and abroad\". Rugby MP John Slinger said the \"quick and clear decision\" meant Labour could \"move on from the damaging, introspection and psychodrama\" and \"pull together\" behind the eventual by-election candidate. However, Poole MP Neil Duncan-Jordan was scathing in calling the decision a \"stitch-up\" that \"puts control before country\". \"Those who have orchestrated this outcome are happy to destroy the Labour Party because of their deep seated factionalism,\" he said. \"We've seen this before when some individuals were actively working against us winning. We're rapidly losing all sense of reason.\" Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned the prime minister: \"If you think it strengthens you I tell you it will simply hasten your demise. \"You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" Nadia Whittome, MP for Nottingham East, also criticised the Labour leadership, who she said \"care more about settling personal scores than winning elections\". Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, said: \"The leadership should not feel threatened by having one of the most popular politicians in the country as part of the national team. \"It's not too late to change course and make the right decision. Otherwise I think we'll all come to regret this.\""

In blocking Burnham, the PM and his team have decided it's better they take the short-term pain and inevitable backlash than allow the psychodrama of the Starmer-Burnham leadership battle to run for weeks in the May elections, drowning out policy discussions and making the party look divided. That backlash was already under way on Sunday as MPs on the left of the party took to X to vent their frustration. Jon Trickett posted on X: \"Strong leaders don't hide from talent, they make common cause.\" Neil Duncan-Jordan MP said the \"authoritarian factionalism of the Labour right is tearing us apart\" and \"this stitch-up puts control before country\". \n                  Andy Burnham 'disappointed' after bid to return as MP blocked by Labour's governing body\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham opens door to Commons return and will seek to stand in by-election\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham facing 24-hour ultimatum over his Labour future\n                 John McDonnell wrote this: \"Do not underestimate the depth of anger people will feel about this disgusting decision? If you think it strengthens you, I tell you it will simply strengthen your demise. You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" All of that landed less than 40 minutes after the decision was announced. It gives you a sense of the divisions and anger in the party. Because both options were awful. Allow Burnham to run and amplify the drumbeat of a leadership challenge that is already constant around Westminster, making it impossible for Starmer to make his case to the country in the run-up to the May elections (already hard given the constant Trump crises that pull him into international affairs) or block him and face the fury of the left, further eroding party discipline, while making Burnham a martyr. It is likely that this decision will only harden opposition against Starmer and make his job even more difficult in the coming months as he grapples with a pile of difficult issues - the social media ban for under-16s, jury trials, ground rents - with an increasingly ungovernable party. Until this moment, the prime minister has been benefitting from the support of the soft left in the party - see Lucy Powell's interview with me last week in which she urged colleagues not to undermine Sir Keir - as MPs rowed in behind the prime minister because the alternative, Wes Streeting, would, from their perspective, be worse. In blocking the return of their man to parliament, the PM could now lose that support. It would be a very lonely place indeed, as Streeting allies on the centre-right of the party continue to mobilise and agitate. As one anti-Streeting MP put it to me: \"It's not Burnham who has been causing the leadership speculation - that has been coming from Streeting's side. Now those on that wing of the party have got Burnham out of the way - useful for Wes, and the kickback for that will land on Starmer. Streeting allies believe this \"will finish Keir off\" over time as the prime minister finds himself increasingly isolated by a party that has lost faith in his leadership. \"He's just so unpopular with MPs,\" one Streeting backer told me. \"Funnily enough it's the soft left keeping him alive because they don't want Wes, but blocking Andy will majorly piss them off.\" Read more from Sky News:US winter storm leaves 140,000 without power'Strong case' for social media ban on children, home secretary says For the PM's allies, the alternative was worse. They clearly concluded that Burnham would likely mount a challenge after May should Labour do, as expected, terribly in the local, Scottish and Welsh elections. There are those around Burnham who tell me that wasn't the case, and that what he said in his letter about not seeking to undermined the PM was true. But there is no trust between these politicians, and the Starmer team clearly didn't believe that. Burnham's backers can shout and scream all they like, but blocking this key rival means that a candidate that would surely storm it home with the membership against Starmer can take a shot. To my mind, any hope that Starmer has of surviving as prime minister meant shutting Burnham out. But what the prime minister and his team can't know is what that gamble unleashes now."

The force said officers had been called to Exmouth Beach at 3pm today after reports of a body near the shore. The body of a 47-year-old who went missing from Budleigh Salterton at the same time as Mr Upham is believed to have been found on Wednesday. Mr Upham, an antiques dealer, was reported to be an experienced sea swimmer.

At least 180 million people in 37 states - more than half America's population - are affected, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared an emergency, with rescue teams and supplies on standby. Parts of the northeast could get as much as 2ft (60cm) of snow overnight into Monday, said the NWS. The forecaster also warned of freezing rain and \"catastrophic ice accumulation\" in areas that avoid the snow and \"dangerously cold wind chills\" for tens of millions. Josh Weiss, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the storm was \"unique\" due to its broad spread, covering 2,000 miles, and the extreme cold it's forecast to leave behind over the next week. More than 14,400 flights have been cancelled on Sunday and another 8,000 delayed, according to tracking website FlightAware. The cancellations are the most on any day since the COVID pandemic, said aviation analytics firm Cirium. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem urged people to \"stay home\" due to \"very, very cold\" temperatures. Thousands of refuse lorries have been fitted with snow ploughs in New York City, said mayor Zohran Mamdani, who warned of the coldest temperatures for eight years.

The painted image features damaged planes on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier with the slogan: \"If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,\" in Farsi and English. The unveiling of the picture in Enghelab Square comes after a senior Iranian official said any attack will be treated \"as an all-out war against us\" ahead of the arrival of a US aircraft carrier and other warships to the region. The square is used for gatherings called by the state, and authorities change its mural based on national occasions.

The US military has periodically sent extra forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tension in moves which have often been seen as defensive.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n I feel like I've seen this horror movie before.  Having grown up in Northern Ireland and reported from there for 30 years, reporting the United States now triggers déjà vu. Minnesota is not Belfast and the United States is not Northern Ireland in 1972, but history does not need to repeat itself exactly to rhyme. During the 30 years of conflict, commonly known as \"The Troubles\", Northern Ireland demonstrated a brutal truth. When the state increasingly relies on armed presence to manage social and political conflict, it rarely restores order. There were British soldiers who served with distinction on the streets of Northern Ireland - 722 of them gave their lives there. It is equally true that British soldiers were responsible for the murders of innocent people, most notably in Derry/Londonderry. Bloody Sunday, when 13 people were shot dead and a 14th fatally wounded by the Parachute Regiment, became the IRA's greatest recruitment sergeant. \n                  'The normal rules of engagement have been thrown out - Alex Pretti was on his knees when first shot was fired'\n                 \n                  Alex Pretti protested for Renee Good. Weeks later he suffered her fate\n                 \n                  'Get the truth out about our son,' say family of man shot dead by federal officer in Minneapolis\n                 An eyewitness to the horror that day once told me: \"Men queued around the block to sign up for the Provos before sunset.\" The deployment of British soldiers to a place on the brink of anarchy was, understandably, framed as a stabilising measure. But their visibility - rifles slung over their shoulders, checkpoints on street corners - transformed everyday life into a constant reminder of threat. For many residents, especially in nationalist communities, armed policing did not feel protective; it felt invasive. It was this perception that drove young men toward paramilitary groups, who armed themselves in response. The state, seeing more guns on the streets, escalated its own force and thus the loop closed: guns beget guns. The Minnesota ICE killings sit uncomfortably within that same logic - federal immigration enforcement by armed agents in residential neighbourhoods. It sends a signal, intentional or not, that coercion is the governing language and when lethal force is used, that signal becomes unmistakable. And it becomes a deadly cycle - deaths become flashpoints, communities respond with protest, authorities respond with heightened security. Read more:Alex Pretti 'on his knees when first shot was fired''Get the truth out about our son,' say Pretti's family The question quietly shifts from \"why are there guns here?\" to \"who gets to carry them?\" as politics cedes ground to force. Northern Ireland eventually learned - at the cost of 3,500 lives - that peace comes from taking the guns out of government. Minnesota is nowhere near that precipice yet, but the warning signs are there, in an environment where violence becomes more likely, not less."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n When Cameron Crawford saw the news that police had misidentified two teenagers after a fatal road accident, the memories came flooding back. The independent police watchdog is investigating how South Yorkshire Police mixed up the identities of 17-year-old Trevor Wynn and 18-year-old Joshua Johnson after a crash in Rotherham in December. For three weeks Trevor's family believed he had died, while Joshua's sat by the bedside of the injured victim in hospital. When he regained consciousness, the truth became clear. \"It's hard to imagine what these families have been through in the past few weeks,\" said Emily Barry, the director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct. \"It is clear something has gone very wrong with awful consequences for them.\" But it turns out the case is far from unusual. George Crawford had picked up the wallet his friend had left behind in a takeaway on a night out in October 2018. When 20-year-old George was hit by a car in the early hours, police identified him through that friend's ID and the wrong family was summoned to the hospital. By the time the mistake was uncovered, it meant George's family were not with him when he died. \"We could have been at the bedside of our son to say goodbye and we had that removed because somebody did not do their job correctly,\" said George's father Cameron. Choking back tears, he added: \"To see it happening again, my heart bled for both of sets of families.\" More details have emerged about how the Rotherham case unfolded. At the scene, police found a phone in a case which also contained Joshua's driving licence. A second phone nearby showed some medical ID information and was in the name of Trevor. An officer spoke to Trevor's mother, who provided his college ID and a description of his build and footwear. The officer compared that to the body in the mortuary and \"was satisfied that this was\" Trevor. A second officer in the ambulance with the surviving teenager had been told by other officers it was Joshua. Looking at the photo on his driving licence, with medical staff, they agreed it was him. But when that injured teenager regained consciousness, Joshua's father alerted the police to the misidentification. Misidentification 'incredibly easy' Lucy Easthope is one of the country's leading disaster recovery experts and has long campaigned for more attention to be given to avoiding misidentification. She said the Rotherham incident should be a \"stop and think\" moment for authorities.

        "Content": "The Met Office has issued a series of yellow warnings for heavy rain covering Monday and Tuesday. The first one is for central and southern parts of Northern Ireland, affecting areas including Enniskillen, Omagh and Newry. It begins at midday on Monday and continues until 6pm. Forecasters say torrential downpours are likely to cause disruption to public transport and flooding in places. Journey times could be longer, bus and train services may be affected, and some homes and businesses could be flooded. The second yellow warning for rain begins at 3pm on Monday and continues until midday on Tuesday. This one affects the south west of England and areas further east, almost reaching Portsmouth and extending as far north as Oxford. It covers Wales, too, except the north and the west coast. There is a warning that some communities could be cut off by flooded roads, while power cuts are possible. Tuesday brings two additional yellow warnings. One for rain covers the south of England, east of Oxford and Portsmouth, and also the whole of Kent. That begins at midnight and runs until midday on Tuesday. A yellow warning has also been issued for rain and wind for Northern Ireland, beginning at 2am on Tuesday and continuing until 9pm. Met Office chief forecaster Steve Willington, said: \"Unsettled conditions will continue through the week, with a combination of rain, brisk winds and some further hill snow, particularly in northern areas where colder air remains in place. \"While many areas will see typical late January conditions, there is enhanced potential for some impactful weather on Monday night into Tuesday. \"We encourage people to keep up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings as details evolve.\" Sky News weather producer Dr Chris England said said 30mm to 80mm of rainfall was expected in areas over the next few days.

        "Headline": "The prime minister voted personally to stop his potential rival's bid to return to Westminster and Mr Burnham will remain as Manchester mayor.",
        "Content": "Andy Burnham has said he is \"disappointed\" after Labour's governing body blocked him from standing as an MP at the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election. Mr Burnham formally requested permission on Saturday to stand for the contest. As mayor of Greater Manchester, he needed approval to contest a different political election. Mr Burnham's return to Westminster was seen by many as a potential challenge to Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) voted to block the mayor's request on Sunday. Sky News understands the 10-person panel voted eight to one to block Mr Burnham's bid, with only deputy leader Lucy Powell backing him. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, chair of the NEC - Labour's governing body - abstained. The prime minister was among those who voted against Mr Burnham, along with union figures and other Labour Party representatives. Mr Burnham said he was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"concerned about its potential impact on the important elections ahead of us\". \"To whoever is Labour's candidate and to our members in Manchester and Tameside: you will have my full support and I will be there whenever you need me,\" added the mayor. He said he would \"return with full focus\" to his current role after offering to stand as MP to help beat Reform, writing on X: \"We are stronger together and let's stay that way.\" In another post, Mr Burnham criticised the Labour leadership. \"The fact that the media was informed of the NEC decision before I was tells you everything you need to know about the way the Labour Party is being run these days,\" he wrote. \"You would think that over 30 years of service would count for something but sadly not.\" However, a Labour source told Sky News' Beth Rigby this was \"categorically untrue\". \"Am told the party attempted to contact Andy shortly after the meeting had concluded over the phone and then contacted him via email,\" she posted on X. Political editor It has been a frenzied 48 hours of Labour leadership speculation after Andy Burnham tried to throw his hat in the ring for a return to parliament. On Sunday, Starmer's allies emphatically tried to shut that down, as the NEC's panel voted 8-1 to block the Manchester mayor's bid. Only the deputy Labour leader and Greater Manchester MP Lucy Powell supported Burnham, with the chair, home secretary Shabana Mahmood, abstaining (as is custom). The reasons cited were concerns over the unnecessary costs of having to hold an election for the Manchester metro mayor during important local, Welsh and Scottish elections, and the prospect of Reform running a divisive campaign in the city and greater Manchester region. Polling suggests that Reform would have a real prospect of taking the region in what would have become a hugely symbolic battle - rather like the fight for the West Midlands mayor which Labour won from the Conservatives ahead of the 2024 election. But there is also bucketloads of politics in this, as the frenzy over a possible return of Burnham to parliament has shown. In blocking Burnham, the PM and his team have decided it's better they take the short-term pain and inevitable backlash than allow the psychodrama of the Starmer-Burnham leadership battle to run for weeks in the May elections, drowning out policy discussions and making the party look divided. Read the full analysis here A party statement said the reason behind the decision was the cost of running the campaigns for both a parliamentary seat and a Manchester mayoralty by-election. \"Although the party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour's control of Greater Manchester at any risk, the statement said. \"Andy Burnham is doing a great job as mayor of Greater Manchester,\" it added. \"We believe it is in the best interests of the party to avoid an unnecessary mayoral election which would use substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and resources that are better spent tackling the cost of living crisis. \"We look forward to fighting and winning the upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton and the positive campaign ahead which will be firmly focused on tackling the cost of living and bringing investment to the local area.\" Read more:Why it's a make-or-break year for Keir StarmerCrisis close to home could decide PM's fate Starmer told move will 'hasten demise'  Despite anger on the left of the party, MPs loyal to Mr Starmer have backed the decision. Bolton West's Phil Brickell said recent speculation had \"seen the Labour Party quickly turn inward... undermining the PM's efforts at home and abroad\". Rugby MP John Slinger said the \"quick and clear decision\" meant Labour could \"move on from the damaging, introspection and psychodrama\" and \"pull together\" behind the eventual by-election candidate. However, Poole MP Neil Duncan-Jordan was scathing in calling the decision a \"stitch-up\" that \"puts control before country\". \"Those who have orchestrated this outcome are happy to destroy the Labour Party because of their deep seated factionalism,\" he said. \"We've seen this before when some individuals were actively working against us winning. We're rapidly losing all sense of reason.\" Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned the prime minister: \"If you think it strengthens you I tell you it will simply hasten your demise. \"You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" Nadia Whittome, MP for Nottingham East, also criticised the Labour leadership, who she said \"care more about settling personal scores than winning elections\". Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, said: \"The leadership should not feel threatened by having one of the most popular politicians in the country as part of the national team. \"It's not too late to change course and make the right decision. Otherwise I think we'll all come to regret this.\""

That backlash was already under way on Sunday as MPs on the left of the party took to X to vent their frustration. Jon Trickett posted on X: \"Strong leaders don't hide from talent, they make common cause.\" Neil Duncan-Jordan MP said the \"authoritarian factionalism of the Labour right is tearing us apart\" and \"this stitch-up puts control before country\". \n                  Andy Burnham 'disappointed' after bid to return as MP blocked by Labour's governing body\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham opens door to Commons return and will seek to stand in by-election\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham facing 24-hour ultimatum over his Labour future\n                 John McDonnell wrote this: \"Do not underestimate the depth of anger people will feel about this disgusting decision? If you think it strengthens you, I tell you it will simply strengthen your demise. You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" All of that landed less than 40 minutes after the decision was announced. It gives you a sense of the divisions and anger in the party. Because both options were awful. Allow Burnham to run and amplify the drumbeat of a leadership challenge that is already constant around Westminster, making it impossible for Starmer to make his case to the country in the run-up to the May elections (already hard given the constant Trump crises that pull him into international affairs) or block him and face the fury of the left, further eroding party discipline, while making Burnham a martyr. It is likely that this decision will only harden opposition against Starmer and make his job even more difficult in the coming months as he grapples with a pile of difficult issues - the social media ban for under-16s, jury trials, ground rents - with an increasingly ungovernable party. Until this moment, the prime minister has been benefitting from the support of the soft left in the party - see Lucy Powell's interview with me last week in which she urged colleagues not to undermine Sir Keir - as MPs rowed in behind the prime minister because the alternative, Wes Streeting, would, from their perspective, be worse. In blocking the return of their man to parliament, the PM could now lose that support. It would be a very lonely place indeed, as Streeting allies on the centre-right of the party continue to mobilise and agitate. As one anti-Streeting MP put it to me: \"It's not Burnham who has been causing the leadership speculation - that has been coming from Streeting's side. Now those on that wing of the party have got Burnham out of the way - useful for Wes, and the kickback for that will land on Starmer. Streeting allies believe this \"will finish Keir off\" over time as the prime minister finds himself increasingly isolated by a party that has lost faith in his leadership. \"He's just so unpopular with MPs,\" one Streeting backer told me. \"Funnily enough it's the soft left keeping him alive because they don't want Wes, but blocking Andy will majorly piss them off.\" Read more from Sky News:US winter storm leaves 140,000 without power'Strong case' for social media ban on children, home secretary says For the PM's allies, the alternative was worse. They clearly concluded that Burnham would likely mount a challenge after May should Labour do, as expected, terribly in the local, Scottish and Welsh elections. There are those around Burnham who tell me that wasn't the case, and that what he said in his letter about not seeking to undermined the PM was true. But there is no trust between these politicians, and the Starmer team clearly didn't believe that. Burnham's backers can shout and scream all they like, but blocking this key rival means that a candidate that would surely storm it home with the membership against Starmer can take a shot. To my mind, any hope that Starmer has of surviving as prime minister meant shutting Burnham out. But what the prime minister and his team can't know is what that gamble unleashes now."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n When Cameron Crawford saw the news that police had misidentified two teenagers after a fatal road accident, the memories came flooding back. The independent police watchdog is investigating how South Yorkshire Police mixed up the identities of 17-year-old Trevor Wynn and 18-year-old Joshua Johnson after a crash in Rotherham in December. For three weeks Trevor's family believed he had died, while Joshua's sat by the bedside of the injured victim in hospital. When he regained consciousness, the truth became clear. \"It's hard to imagine what these families have been through in the past few weeks,\" said Emily Barry, the director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct. \"It is clear something has gone very wrong with awful consequences for them.\" But it turns out the case is far from unusual. George Crawford had picked up the wallet his friend had left behind in a takeaway on a night out in October 2018. When 20-year-old George was hit by a car in the early hours, police identified him through that friend's ID and the wrong family was summoned to the hospital. By the time the mistake was uncovered, it meant George's family were not with him when he died. \"We could have been at the bedside of our son to say goodbye and we had that removed because somebody did not do their job correctly,\" said George's father Cameron. Choking back tears, he added: \"To see it happening again, my heart bled for both of sets of families.\" More details have emerged about how the Rotherham case unfolded. At the scene, police found a phone in a case which also contained Joshua's driving licence. A second phone nearby showed some medical ID information and was in the name of Trevor. An officer spoke to Trevor's mother, who provided his college ID and a description of his build and footwear. The officer compared that to the body in the mortuary and \"was satisfied that this was\" Trevor. A second officer in the ambulance with the surviving teenager had been told by other officers it was Joshua. Looking at the photo on his driving licence, with medical staff, they agreed it was him. But when that injured teenager regained consciousness, Joshua's father alerted the police to the misidentification. Misidentification 'incredibly easy' Lucy Easthope is one of the country's leading disaster recovery experts and has long campaigned for more attention to be given to avoiding misidentification. She said the Rotherham incident should be a \"stop and think\" moment for authorities. A professor at the University of Bath's Centre for Death and Society, she said she has been present at incidents when a mistake has been spotted. \"The world just falls out from beneath your feet,\" she said. \"I think we think that the worst thing that could've happened is the thing that happens, but actually we can continue to do even more harms as responders, and not returning the right person to the right family is one of those additional harms.\" Read more from Sky News:Police chief referred to watchdog over Israeli fan ban'A 14-year-old is with a man in a hotel' - here's what police did next Prof Easthope said she hears from police officers who feel pressured to make an identification through documents found at the scene that should not be accepted. \"The living person has woken up and that should not be the safeguard,\" she said. \"It's actually incredibly easy for misidentification to occur.

        "Content": "The Met Office has issued a series of yellow warnings for heavy rain covering Monday and Tuesday. The first one is for central and southern parts of Northern Ireland, affecting areas including Enniskillen, Omagh and Newry. It begins at midday on Monday and continues until 6pm. Forecasters say torrential downpours are likely to cause disruption to public transport and flooding in places. Journey times could be longer, bus and train services may be affected, and some homes and businesses could be flooded. The second yellow warning for rain begins at 3pm on Monday and continues until midday on Tuesday. This one affects the south west of England and areas further east, almost reaching Portsmouth and extending as far north as Oxford. It covers Wales, too, except the north and the west coast. There is a warning that some communities could be cut off by flooded roads, while power cuts are possible. Tuesday brings two additional yellow warnings. One for rain covers the south of England, east of Oxford and Portsmouth, and also the whole of Kent. That begins at midnight and runs until midday on Tuesday. A yellow warning has also been issued for rain and wind for Northern Ireland, beginning at 2am on Tuesday and continuing until 9pm. Met Office chief forecaster Steve Willington, said: \"Unsettled conditions will continue through the week, with a combination of rain, brisk winds and some further hill snow, particularly in northern areas where colder air remains in place. \"While many areas will see typical late January conditions, there is enhanced potential for some impactful weather on Monday night into Tuesday. \"We encourage people to keep up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings as details evolve.\" Sky News weather producer Dr Chris England said said 30mm to 80mm of rainfall was expected in areas over the next few days.

While the government does not yet have an official position on an Australian-style ban on children accessing the platforms, Ms Mahmood's intervention makes it more likely. However, as the minister responsible for policing, the home secretary rejected the idea that officers would be used to regulate any ban. Politics live: Burnham-blocking shortlist not ruled out A consultation has been launched by the government on the use of social media by young people, and is expected to report back later this year with recommendations. The Lords this week passed an amendment calling for a ban, which may be tricky for the Commons to defeat depending on the mood within the Parliamentary Labour Party. On Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Ms Mahmood was asked if officers would start policing teenagers' bedrooms. She told Sky News: \"The government's position is there's going to be a genuine open consultation. \"And of course, the Australians have moved to a ban. \"I think there is a strong case for a ban, by the way, because I think that social media environment poses huge dangers for our young people at a time when their characters, their personalities, their minds are forming. \"I think we should take a second look at the sort of environment that we let our children grow up in. \"That is the nation's business.\" Ms Mahmood will on Monday unveil a set of proposals to overhaul policing in the UK. As she made the case for the reforms, the home secretary indicated she did not want to see police officers getting involved in complaints around social media posts. 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app👈 She told Sky News: \"I will be saying more about that in the coming days. \"But I've been very clear that perfectly legal tweets, policing the so-called culture war, is not what our police are for. \"They are here to go after criminals, to catch criminals, to bring them to justice, to help prevent crime, and to deter crime by having a visible presence in all of our communities. \"And all of these reforms taken together are about visible neighbourhood policing and making sure that people in our communities feel safe.\" Read more:'Shambles' social media plan won't be fixed by banHow quickly could the UK ban teenagers from social media?

The painted image features damaged planes on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier with the slogan: \"If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,\" in Farsi and English. The unveiling of the picture in Enghelab Square comes after a senior Iranian official said any attack will be treated \"as an all-out war against us\" ahead of the arrival of a US aircraft carrier and other warships to the region. The square is used for gatherings called by the state, and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. Donald Trump has said the assets are being moved \"just in case\" he decides to take action. \"We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won't have to use it,\" the US president said on Thursday.

The US military has periodically sent extra forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tension in moves which have often been seen as defensive. But a major build-up last year came ahead of its launching airstrikes against Iran's nuclear programme."

Cheers erupted from the crowd gathered on the street below as Honnold reached the top of the 508m (1,667ft) tower, which upon completion in 2004 became the first skyscraper to exceed half a kilometre in height. The climb, originally scheduled for Saturday, had been delayed for 24 hours due to rain. \"What a view, it's incredible, what a beautiful day,\" Honnold said after completing the ascent. \"It was very windy, so I was like, don't fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.\" Honnold rose to prominence in 2017 when he became the first person to free solo a full route on Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, a feat that became the denouement of the Oscar-winning 2018 documentary Free Solo. The Tapei 101 skyscraper, as its name suggests, has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section - the \"bamboo boxes\" that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment of the structure has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where Honnold took short rests as he made his way up. He climbed up one corner of the building using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds, and had to periodically manoeuvre around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower.

I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.\" Honnold is not the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he is the first to do so without a rope.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n The road where Alex Pretti was killed by a federal immigration agent is known in Minneapolis as \"Eat Street\" because it's lined with restaurants and cafes. A place where people usually come to enjoy themselves is now a focus for a community's grief and anger. It's cordoned off to traffic, and a steady stream of people arrive to place candles and flowers, trying to come to terms with what happened here. I've now seen four angles of this shooting - four different videos which show the fatal shots, the moments before and the moments after. They offer a window into how this horror unfolded, second by second. Obviously, there's a lot we can't see, particularly given the crush of federal agents surrounding Alex Pretti in the final seconds of his life. Follow live - Man shot dead by federal agent, as family hit out at 'sickening lies' There's a lot we don't know about the perspectives of the protagonists and what they were thinking. It's noisy, it's chaotic, and several people in the videos are wearing very similar clothing. But to be crystal clear - at no point is there any obvious evidence, even a hint, that Mr Pretti was intent on massacring a group of immigration agents in broad daylight, as the Department of Homeland Security is claiming. At no point is there any sign that this situation will escalate to the point where a man will be shot dead. 'He is on his knees when first shot is fired' A video filmed by a bystander on the pavement, yards from the incident, shows Mr Pretti filming the immigration officers on his mobile phone. In recent weeks, many people in Minneapolis have been following federal immigration agents around the city and recording their activities, amid allegations they are abusing their power in a furious drive to enforce US President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown. It is not a crime to follow and record federal agents. Some of the people who have done this told me that not only is it their First Amendment right to do so, but that they feel it is their civic duty. In the videos of the shooting of Mr Pretti, you can see and hear people blowing whistles. Again, many people in Minneapolis have been blowing whistles and beeping car horns to warn their neighbours that immigration officers are active in the area. It is not a crime to do that either. At one point, Mr Pretti appears to be trying to direct traffic down the road, waving at a car to go around him. If he was intent on a massacre, he had plenty of opportunity to open fire as ICE officers had their backs turned to him. A few seconds later, an officer seems to push a woman and Mr Pretti intervenes. He is pepper-sprayed and goes to the ground. It's not clear why officers used the pepper spray or if they warned him first. He is on his knees when the first shot is fired and seems to be motionless when at least nine more shots are fired. At no point does he appear to be holding a firearm, and certainly not pointing it at anyone. 'Situations can quickly escalate' I'm not particularly surprised something like this has happened again, just over two weeks after the killing of Renee Nicole Good. I've been to Minneapolis on three separate occasions this month and each time have seen how situations involving federal immigration agents can quickly escalate. I was a passenger in a car with a woman \"observing\" ICE officers, not dissimilar to what both Mr Pretti and Ms Good seemed to be doing. Their first interaction with her was to bang on her windows and threaten to smash them. They then threatened to throw her in jail but did not say what crime she was suspected of. All of this was before they even asked her name. The normal rules of engagement have been thrown out of the window here. I've also seen how the Trump administration has jumped to conclusions and demonised victims caught up in protests against ICE. Last week, protests erupted following the shooting of a Venezuelan man by an ICE agent in northeast Minneapolis. I was there as law enforcement fired tear gas at the crowd of protesters who gathered late into the evening. Read more from Sky News:Trump praises 'very brave' UK soldiers after backlashNew 'British FBI' to fight serious crime Another 'terrifying ordeal' I then interviewed a very distressed father, Shawn Jackson. He had been returning from watching a basketball game with his six children, ranging in age between six months and 11 years. They had become enveloped in the protests, and a law enforcement officer threw a tear gas canister under their car. It exploded, mimicking a crash, meaning the airbags inside the SUV inflated and it quickly filled with tear gas. Mr Jackson told me everyone in the car was gasping for breath, that his six-month-old had completely stopped breathing, and all of his children were taken to hospital. They are thankfully physically okay, but it was a terrifying ordeal. The Department of Homeland Security posted a link on X to an interview with Mr Jackson discussing this awful situation and added the comment: \"It is horrific to see radical agitators bring children to their violent riots. PLEASE STOP ENDANGERING YOUR CHILDREN.\" They later deleted the comment, presumably after discovering the reality of the circumstances. But it was a reminder of how dangerous it is to leap to conclusions. And with the death of Mr Pretti, once again an investigation into a shooting by a federal immigration agent here is being predetermined by the White House."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n I feel like I've seen this horror movie before.  Having grown up in Northern Ireland and reported from there for 30 years, reporting the United States now triggers déjà vu. Minnesota is not Belfast and the United States is not Northern Ireland in 1972, but history does not need to repeat itself exactly to rhyme. During the 30 years of conflict, commonly known as \"The Troubles\", Northern Ireland demonstrated a brutal truth. When the state increasingly relies on armed presence to manage social and political conflict, it rarely restores order. There were British soldiers who served with distinction on the streets of Northern Ireland - 722 of them gave their lives there. It is equally true that British soldiers were responsible for the murders of innocent people, most notably in Derry/Londonderry. Bloody Sunday, when 13 people were shot dead and a 14th fatally wounded by the Parachute Regiment, became the IRA's greatest recruitment sergeant. \n                  'The normal rules of engagement have been thrown out - Alex Pretti was on his knees when first shot was fired'\n                 \n                  Alex Pretti protested for Renee Good. Weeks later he suffered her fate\n                 \n                  'Get the truth out about our son,' say family of man shot dead by federal officer in Minneapolis\n                 An eyewitness to the horror that day once told me: \"Men queued around the block to sign up for the Provos before sunset.\" The deployment of British soldiers to a place on the brink of anarchy was, understandably, framed as a stabilising measure. But their visibility - rifles slung over their shoulders, checkpoints on street corners - transformed everyday life into a constant reminder of threat. For many residents, especially in nationalist communities, armed policing did not feel protective; it felt invasive. It was this perception that drove young men toward paramilitary groups, who armed themselves in response. The state, seeing more guns on the streets, escalated its own force and thus the loop closed: guns beget guns. The Minnesota ICE killings sit uncomfortably within that same logic - federal immigration enforcement by armed agents in residential neighbourhoods. It sends a signal, intentional or not, that coercion is the governing language and when lethal force is used, that signal becomes unmistakable. And it becomes a deadly cycle - deaths become flashpoints, communities respond with protest, authorities respond with heightened security. Read more:Alex Pretti 'on his knees when first shot was fired''Get the truth out about our son,' say Pretti's family The question quietly shifts from \"why are there guns here?\" to \"who gets to carry them?\" as politics cedes ground to force. Northern Ireland eventually learned - at the cost of 3,500 lives - that peace comes from taking the guns out of government. Minnesota is nowhere near that precipice yet, but the warning signs are there, in an environment where violence becomes more likely, not less."

        "Content": "The family of a 37-year-old US citizen shot dead by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis have lashed out at \"sickening lies told about our son by the [Trump] administration\". Warning: Some readers may find the content in this article distressing Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was sprayed with irritants before being shot at least 10 times in just five seconds on Saturday. In a statement, Mr Pretti's family said the nurse, who cared for US veterans at the Minneapolis VA hospital, was a \"kind-hearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends\". Follow live - Man shot dead by federal agent, as family hit out at 'sickening lies' They added: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs.\" Instead, they say both his hands were visible and that he had been trying to protect a woman who had been pushed by federal officers. However, those claims have been contested by key figures of Donald Trump's administration. Hundreds of demonstrators have gathered for a vigil despite freezing conditions in Minneapolis after the shooting. Tensions had already been riding high in Minneapolis over the presence of immigration and customs officers following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in the city weeks earlier. After the shooting of Mr Pretti, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs. Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said - but politicians and officials are already visibly polarised over this latest fatal incident. The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Minnesota governor Tim Walz, officials said. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has asked for National Guard troops to work with police, but has said they will wear reflective vests to \"distinguish them from other agencies\". Governor Walz called on Mr Trump to \"pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now\". \"Minnesota has had it,\" he added and described the situation as \"sickening\". However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Mr Pretti was carrying a semi-automatic handgun and two magazines of ammunition, and implied he \"wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\". In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Mr Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand, but no footage appears to show him holding a visible weapon. Mr O'Hara said police believe the man was a \"lawful gun owner with a permit to carry\". Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said at a news conference that federal law enforcement had been under \"constant attack\" in Minneapolis for weeks. In an X post that was reposted by Mr Trump, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed that a protester in Minneapolis had allegedly \"bit off\" an officer's finger. The post included graphic images of what appear to be the bloody wound. Attorney general Pam Bondi said a suspect had been arrested and was in custody over the incident. Mr Trump also shared an image on social media of the gun immigration officials said was recovered and described Mr Pretti as a gunman. Writing online, he said: \"This is the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go - What is that all about?\". DHS secretary Kristi Noem also questioned why Mr Pretti was armed in a news conference but did not say that he had drawn his weapon or brandished it at officers. Read more from Sky News:Trump praises 'very brave' UK soldiers after backlashNew 'British FBI' to fight serious crime Robert Alver, who worked with Mr Pretti in a university science lab almost 17 years ago, described him as \"everything you would want in a colleague and a friend\". Fighting back tears, Mr Alver criticised Ms Noem's comments, saying: \"There is no way on God's green Earth that he would ever be going anywhere to hurt somebody. He would had to have had a complete personality transplant.\" Mr Trump has accused the city's Democratic governor and mayor of \"inciting insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric\". Mr Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an immigration federal officer shot and killed Ms Good on 7 January, an incident which sparked widespread protests."

        "Content": "Alex Pretti was 37 years old when his life ended. He died after he was shot by a federal officer at least 10 times within 5 seconds. His killing has sparked protests, debate and renewed a heated argument over the widespread deployment of thousands of federal agents in an immigration crackdown. Follow live - Man shot dead by federal agent, as family hit out at 'sickening lies' But who was he? Mr Pretti was a US citizen who was born in Illinois. He grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran for Preble High School. He was an avid outdoorsman, perhaps stemming from the fact that he used to be a boy scout. Mr Pretti was also musical when growing up, singing in the Green Bay Boy Choir. After leaving school, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse. He worked as an ICU nurse at the Veterans Administration in Minneapolis, with his family saying he cared deeply about people. Before his dog's recent death, Mr Pretti loved getting into adventures with Joule, his Catahoula Leopard dog. Michael Pretti, Alex's father, said his son \"cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the US with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\". He added that his son felt that protesting was a way in which he could express his care for others. He had participated in protests following the killing of Ms Good by a US ICE officer earlier this month. She died less than a mile from where he would be killed. Like Ms Good, who was also 37 years old when she was killed, court records show Mr Pretti didn't have any criminal record. His family said he hadn't had any interaction with police, except for a couple of traffic tickets. Family members said Mr Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota. Owning a gun is not hugely unusual in Minnesota. Data from Minnesota law enforcement agencies shows that over 65,000 handgun carry permits were approved in both 2022 and 2023. But while Mr Pretti owned a gun, his family had never known him to carry it. His ex-wife told the AP news agency he obtained a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated, over two years ago. She added that she had never known him to be physically confrontational, despite having been involved in previous protests - like those following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Neighbours described him as quiet and warm-hearted. Read more from Sky News:What we know about 'life-threatening' US stormTrump praises 'very brave' UK soldiers after backlash \"He's a wonderful person,\" said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Mr Pretti. She painted a rosy picture of her neighbour, who she said moved into the building about three years ago. If there was something suspicious going on in the neighbourhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help, she told AP. Despite working long hours as a nurse, Mr Pretti was not a loner and would sometimes have friends over, according to his neighbours. In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who still live in Wisconsin, told him to be careful when protesting. His father said Alex told him: \"He knows that, he knew that.\" A few weeks later, his family found out about the shooting that killed Mr Pretti through a phone call from a reporter."

        "Content": "American climber Alex Honnold ascended one of the world's tallest buildings on Sunday without a rope or protective equipment.  The 40-year-old free solo climber - a term used to describe those who tackle ascents without ropes - took just over 90 minutes to scale the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan, at one time the tallest building in the world. Cheers erupted from the crowd gathered on the street below as Honnold reached the top of the 508m (1,667ft) tower, which upon completion in 2004 became the first skyscraper to exceed half a kilometre in height. The climb, originally scheduled for Saturday, had been delayed for 24 hours due to rain. \"What a view, it's incredible, what a beautiful day,\" Honnold said after completing the ascent. \"It was very windy, so I was like, don't fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.\" Honnold rose to prominence in 2017 when he became the first person to free solo a full route on Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, a feat that became the denouement of the Oscar-winning 2018 documentary Free Solo. The Tapei 101 skyscraper, as its name suggests, has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section - the \"bamboo boxes\" that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment of the structure has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where Honnold took short rests as he made his way up. He climbed up one corner of the building using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds, and had to periodically manoeuvre around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower.

I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.\" Honnold is not the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he is the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building in four hours on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of its grand opening."

Sky News has learnt that Beauty Bay, which is based in Manchester, has appointed advisers to undertake a strategic review. Sources said a process to seek new investment was likely to kick off this week. Beauty Bay sells more than 200 brands on its platform, including Ariana Grande, Clinique and MAC. It also has an own-brand product range. The company is owned by brothers Arron and David Gabbie, who founded it under the name Fragrance Bay in 1999. The strategic review comes during a period in which challenging market conditions, including inflationary pressures and fragile consumer confidence, are impacting numerous retailers. \n                  Behind the scenes with a cheap holiday travel influencer | New Money\n                 \n                  The 10-year passport rule that's seen Britons turned away from flights | Money newsletter\n                 \n                  CVC-backed Global Sport Group adds to stable with $300m Equine Network deal\n                 A source said Beauty Bay was seeking a buyer or investment partner to help stabilise and drive the business forward as it looked to grow and expand its 'By Beauty Bay' own-label product offering.

        "Content": "Andy Burnham has said he is \"disappointed\" after Labour's governing body blocked him from standing as an MP at the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election. Mr Burnham formally requested permission on Saturday to stand for the contest. As mayor of Greater Manchester, he needed approval to contest a different political election. Mr Burnham's return to Westminster was seen by many as a potential challenge to Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) voted to block the mayor's request on Sunday. Sky News understands the 10-person panel voted eight to one to block Mr Burnham's bid, with only deputy leader Lucy Powell backing him. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, chair of the NEC - Labour's governing body - abstained. The prime minister was among those who voted against Mr Burnham, along with union figures and other Labour Party representatives. Mr Burnham said he was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"concerned about its potential impact on the important elections ahead of us\". \"To whoever is Labour's candidate and to our members in Manchester and Tameside: you will have my full support and I will be there whenever you need me,\" added the mayor. He said he would \"return with full focus\" to his current role after offering to stand as MP to help beat Reform, writing on X: \"We are stronger together and let's stay that way.\" In another post, Mr Burnham criticised the Labour leadership. \"The fact that the media was informed of the NEC decision before I was tells you everything you need to know about the way the Labour Party is being run these days,\" he wrote. \"You would think that over 30 years of service would count for something but sadly not.\" However, a Labour source told Sky News' Beth Rigby this was \"categorically untrue\". \"Am told the party attempted to contact Andy shortly after the meeting had concluded over the phone and then contacted him via email,\" she posted on X. Political editor It has been a frenzied 48 hours of Labour leadership speculation after Andy Burnham tried to throw his hat in the ring for a return to parliament. On Sunday, Starmer's allies emphatically tried to shut that down, as the NEC's panel voted 8-1 to block the Manchester mayor's bid. Only the deputy Labour leader and Greater Manchester MP Lucy Powell supported Burnham, with the chair, home secretary Shabana Mahmood, abstaining (as is custom). The reasons cited were concerns over the unnecessary costs of having to hold an election for the Manchester metro mayor during important local, Welsh and Scottish elections, and the prospect of Reform running a divisive campaign in the city and greater Manchester region. Polling suggests that Reform would have a real prospect of taking the region in what would have become a hugely symbolic battle - rather like the fight for the West Midlands mayor which Labour won from the Conservatives ahead of the 2024 election. But there is also bucketloads of politics in this, as the frenzy over a possible return of Burnham to parliament has shown. In blocking Burnham, the PM and his team have decided it's better they take the short-term pain and inevitable backlash than allow the psychodrama of the Starmer-Burnham leadership battle to run for weeks in the May elections, drowning out policy discussions and making the party look divided. Read the full analysis here A party statement said the reason behind the decision was the cost of running the campaigns for both a parliamentary seat and a Manchester mayoralty by-election. \"Although the party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour's control of Greater Manchester at any risk, the statement said. \"Andy Burnham is doing a great job as mayor of Greater Manchester,\" it added. \"We believe it is in the best interests of the party to avoid an unnecessary mayoral election which would use substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and resources that are better spent tackling the cost of living crisis. \"We look forward to fighting and winning the upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton and the positive campaign ahead which will be firmly focused on tackling the cost of living and bringing investment to the local area.\" Read more:Why it's a make-or-break year for Keir StarmerCrisis close to home could decide PM's fate Starmer told move will 'hasten demise'  Despite anger on the left of the party, MPs loyal to Mr Starmer have backed the decision. Bolton West's Phil Brickell said recent speculation had \"seen the Labour Party quickly turn inward... undermining the PM's efforts at home and abroad\". Rugby MP John Slinger said the \"quick and clear decision\" meant Labour could \"move on from the damaging, introspection and psychodrama\" and \"pull together\" behind the eventual by-election candidate. However, Poole MP Neil Duncan-Jordan was scathing in calling the decision a \"stitch-up\" that \"puts control before country\". \"Those who have orchestrated this outcome are happy to destroy the Labour Party because of their deep seated factionalism,\" he said. \"We've seen this before when some individuals were actively working against us winning. We're rapidly losing all sense of reason.\" Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned the prime minister: \"If you think it strengthens you I tell you it will simply hasten your demise. \"You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" Nadia Whittome, MP for Nottingham East, also criticised the Labour leadership, who she said \"care more about settling personal scores than winning elections\". Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, said: \"The leadership should not feel threatened by having one of the most popular politicians in the country as part of the national team. \"It's not too late to change course and make the right decision. Otherwise I think we'll all come to regret this.\""

That backlash was already under way on Sunday as MPs on the left of the party took to X to vent their frustration. Jon Trickett posted on X: \"Strong leaders don't hide from talent, they make common cause.\" Neil Duncan-Jordan MP said the \"authoritarian factionalism of the Labour right is tearing us apart\" and \"this stitch-up puts control before country\". \n                  Andy Burnham 'disappointed' after bid to return as MP blocked by Labour's governing body\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham opens door to Commons return and will seek to stand in by-election\n                 \n                  Andy Burnham facing 24-hour ultimatum over his Labour future\n                 John McDonnell wrote this: \"Do not underestimate the depth of anger people will feel about this disgusting decision? If you think it strengthens you, I tell you it will simply strengthen your demise. You could have shown magnanimous leadership but instead it's cowardice.\" All of that landed less than 40 minutes after the decision was announced. It gives you a sense of the divisions and anger in the party. Because both options were awful. Allow Burnham to run and amplify the drumbeat of a leadership challenge that is already constant around Westminster, making it impossible for Starmer to make his case to the country in the run-up to the May elections (already hard given the constant Trump crises that pull him into international affairs) or block him and face the fury of the left, further eroding party discipline, while making Burnham a martyr. It is likely that this decision will only harden opposition against Starmer and make his job even more difficult in the coming months as he grapples with a pile of difficult issues - the social media ban for under-16s, jury trials, ground rents - with an increasingly ungovernable party. Until this moment, the prime minister has been benefitting from the support of the soft left in the party - see Lucy Powell's interview with me last week in which she urged colleagues not to undermine Sir Keir - as MPs rowed in behind the prime minister because the alternative, Wes Streeting, would, from their perspective, be worse. In blocking the return of their man to parliament, the PM could now lose that support. It would be a very lonely place indeed, as Streeting allies on the centre-right of the party continue to mobilise and agitate. As one anti-Streeting MP put it to me: \"It's not Burnham who has been causing the leadership speculation - that has been coming from Streeting's side. Now those on that wing of the party have got Burnham out of the way - useful for Wes, and the kickback for that will land on Starmer. Streeting allies believe this \"will finish Keir off\" over time as the prime minister finds himself increasingly isolated by a party that has lost faith in his leadership. \"He's just so unpopular with MPs,\" one Streeting backer told me. \"Funnily enough it's the soft left keeping him alive because they don't want Wes, but blocking Andy will majorly piss them off.\" Read more from Sky News:US winter storm leaves 140,000 without power'Strong case' for social media ban on children, home secretary says For the PM's allies, the alternative was worse. They clearly concluded that Burnham would likely mount a challenge after May should Labour do, as expected, terribly in the local, Scottish and Welsh elections. There are those around Burnham who tell me that wasn't the case, and that what he said in his letter about not seeking to undermined the PM was true. But there is no trust between these politicians, and the Starmer team clearly didn't believe that. Burnham's backers can shout and scream all they like, but blocking this key rival means that a candidate that would surely storm it home with the membership against Starmer can take a shot. To my mind, any hope that Starmer has of surviving as prime minister meant shutting Burnham out. But what the prime minister and his team can't know is what that gamble unleashes now."

She told Sky News: \"The government's position is there's going to be a genuine open consultation. \"And of course, the Australians have moved to a ban. \"I think there is a strong case for a ban, by the way, because I think that social media environment poses huge dangers for our young people at a time when their characters, their personalities, their minds are forming. \"I think we should take a second look at the sort of environment that we let our children grow up in. \"That is the nation's business.\" Ms Mahmood will on Monday unveil a set of proposals to overhaul policing in the UK. As she made the case for the reforms, the home secretary indicated she did not want to see police officers getting involved in complaints around social media posts. 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app👈 She told Sky News: \"I will be saying more about that in the coming days. \"But I've been very clear that perfectly legal tweets, policing the so-called culture war, is not what our police are for. \"They are here to go after criminals, to catch criminals, to bring them to justice, to help prevent crime, and to deter crime by having a visible presence in all of our communities. \"And all of these reforms taken together are about visible neighbourhood policing and making sure that people in our communities feel safe.\" Read more:'Shambles' social media plan won't be fixed by banHow quickly could the UK ban teenagers from social media?

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n There's a lot in the announcement, though none of the proposals are exactly new. There have been calls for merging our 43 local police forces into bigger regional constabularies for two decades at least, almost as long as I've been a crime reporter. The government argument - difficult to counter - is that it's a waste of money to have so many police fiefdoms with their own headquarters and management teams and different methods of procuring technology and equipment. Some of those local forces have long been forced to combine resources on major investigations that cross their county boundaries. And how often do we hear those forces having to call for reinforcements or specialist help when they cannot cope alone with major incidents? Shabana Mahmood is a self-styled reforming home secretary, and she's been hinting she would bring in major change. It's a huge shake-up of policing in England and Wales, which she believes will put the right police officers in the right places to better tackle crime on its various levels. Big regional forces will tackle major crime such as murder, rape, county lines drug dealers, but within them will be a neighbourhood policing set-up to deal with shoplifting, muggings and anti-social behaviour - a rising scourge, the home secretary believes, that seemingly goes unpunished. And an FBI-style National Police Service that will be newly in charge of counter-terror policing and fraud, as well as continuing its focus of tackling international organised criminals involved in people and drug trafficking. These are long term changes, and they've not been universally welcomed. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners - all of whom are being replaced in another government plan - said that combining functions and disrupting local policing will damage recruitment and procurement of resources. And a similar merging of eight local Scottish forces into Police Scotland in 2013 has had mixed results, with a crime reduction but fewer officers. Read more:New 'British FBI' to be created to fight serious crimeOut of date policing needs 'overdue' shake-up, says Met Police chief The proposed changes in England and Wales reflect the government's manifesto commitment to make public services work better. Many crime rates have fallen in recent years, but the public sometimes has a disproportionate fear of crime. And confidence in the police is low. It will take time to judge whether the reforms leave people feeling better protected, which is the core function of policing."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n Paris Hilton says the \"pain and abuse\" she faced as a teenager at so-called behaviour camps paved the way for her to find the \"most meaningful work\" of her life. In 2020, the hotel heiress released a documentary, This Is Paris, which detailed the treatment she and other victims endured at tough love camps in the US. The socialite said she was subjected to \"a parent-approved kidnapping\" at four different youth facilities, was \"force-fed medications and sexually abused by staff\". The entrepreneur tells Sky News that speaking up was extremely difficult. \"These places, they really instil that shame in you where you are so ashamed that you don't even want to speak about or talk about or think about it, and that's such a powerful muzzle for abusers. \"I had no idea how the world would react but it was just like this outpouring of love and tens of thousands of survivors reaching out to me, coming up to me on the street and just saying, 'Thank you so much for telling your story. No one has ever believed me, I haven't spoken to my family in this many years and you know it's just affected my whole life and now since you told your story, now my family believes me'. \"It just showed me the power in being vulnerable and real, even when it's scary, even when it hurts, that if I can tell my story and make a difference in other people's lives and make them feel safe to be able to come and tell their story.\" \n                  Paris Hilton, Beyonce and other stars donate and help out those affected by LA fires\n                 \n                  LA fires: 'Nothing left' of Mel Gibson's house as he urges California governor to 'spend less on hair gel'\n                 \n                  Paris Hilton and CNN among accounts targeted in TikTok cyber attack\n                 Since her documentary aired on YouTube, the 44-year-old has testified numerous times before Congress and has been a leading advocate against the \"troubled teen industry\". \"I've now changed 15 state laws and passed two federal bills to protect children so they don't have to go through the pain and abuse that myself and so many others have, and that is the most meaningful work of my life. I'm so extremely proud of that work.\" She says this advocacy work has become a \"huge focus\" for her and that she wants to \"continue on the fight because this is not only happening in the States, it's happening all around the world\". Hilton was the leader of \"It girls\" in 2000s Hollywood, which included Kim Kardashian and Nicole Richie, and was one of the most photographed people of that time.

Her new documentary film, Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir, takes a look back through her life and career in the spotlight as she prepares to return with new music. \"It's been so fun just to look back on everything and just see in my career how I've always been so ahead of my time, even through fashion, reality shows, through all of it, how there were so many things that I did first and now seeing so many people inspired to this day.\" Large elements of the film, however, were deeply impacted by the LA fires last year in which her Malibu beach house burnt down. It features Paris performing her songs on stage, including her 2006 debut single Stars Are Blind. Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir is in cinemas on 30 January."

        "Content": "American climber Alex Honnold ascended one of the world's tallest buildings on Sunday without a rope or protective equipment.  The 40-year-old free solo climber - a term used to describe those who tackle ascents without ropes - took just over 90 minutes to scale the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan, at one time the tallest building in the world. Cheers erupted from the crowd gathered on the street below as Honnold reached the top of the 508m (1,667ft) tower, which upon completion in 2004 became the first skyscraper to exceed half a kilometre in height. The climb, originally scheduled for Saturday, had been delayed for 24 hours due to rain. \"What a view, it's incredible, what a beautiful day,\" Honnold said after completing the ascent. \"It was very windy, so I was like, don't fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.\" Honnold rose to prominence in 2017 when he became the first person to free solo a full route on Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, a feat that became the denouement of the Oscar-winning 2018 documentary Free Solo. The Tapei 101 skyscraper, as its name suggests, has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section - the \"bamboo boxes\" that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment of the structure has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where Honnold took short rests as he made his way up. He climbed up one corner of the building using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds, and had to periodically manoeuvre around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower.

I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.\" Honnold is not the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he is the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building in four hours on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of its grand opening."
