        "Content": "The head of the UN has said Israel has only authorised for Gaza what amounts to a \"teaspoon\" of aid after at least 60 people died in overnight airstrikes. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said on Friday the supplies approved so far \"amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required,\" adding \"the needs are massive and the obstacles are staggering\". He warned that more people will die unless there is \"rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access\".  Israel says around 300 aid trucks have been allowed through since it lifted an 11-week blockade on Monday, but according to Mr Guterres, only about a third have been transported to warehouses within Gaza due to insecurity. The IDF said 107 vehicles carrying flour, food, medical equipment and drugs were allowed through on Thursday. Many of Gaza's two million residents are at high risk of famine, experts have warned.

The leaders of the UK, France and Canada are \"on the wrong side of humanity and (...) history\", he said, after they threatened \"concrete action\" against Israel this week if it continues its \"egregious\" military operations in Gaza. Mr Netanyahu also accused Sir Keir, Mr Macron and Mr Carney of siding with \"mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers\". But UK government minister Luke Pollard told Sky News on Friday morning he \"doesn't recognise\" Mr Netanyahu's accusation. Earlier this week, Mr Netanyahu said he was recalling negotiators from the Qatari capital, Doha, after a week of ceasefire talks failed to bring results. A working team will remain. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 251 others.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n Russian forces are reportedly gathering across the border from Ukraine's \"fortress city\" - but why? After pushing Ukrainian troops out of Kursk, the Russian region they had occupied parts of for many months, what's left of the 50,000-strong Russian force is positioned just across the border from Kharkiv. Ukraine war's largest prisoner swap - latest updates A major push along all or part of the frontline by Moscow's troops has been expected for some time but has not yet fully materialised, analysts say. It's believed Russia has a \"four-month window\" to break through Ukrainian forces before the weather begins to turn and dwindling stocks of Soviet tanks possibly start to run low. Where are the massing Russian troops - and are elite soldiers among them? Kremlin troops have been gathering on the other side of the border near Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine, according to a senior Ukrainian military figure. \"The enemy is trying to pull its personnel closer to the line of combat contact and conduct at least some assault actions,\" Andriy Pomahaibus, chief of staff of the 13th Operational Brigade, said this week. \"In general, they are not succeeding.\" Nonetheless, he said there is \"clear preparation for active assault actions by the enemy\".  Sky News military analyst Michael Clarke says the accumulation of troops comes off the back of the Russian operation to push Ukraine out of the pocket of the Kursk region they had occupied, which is not far from Kharkiv. \"Now they have Kursk back the argument is: will they keep going?\" Some of Russia's most experienced soldiers - including from the elite VDV airborne unit - were moved to reinforce the Kursk campaign, and could still be among the gathered troops. Prof Clarke adds: \"If they have left those units there, that would suggest they want them to spearhead something else. \"If those units turn up back around Pokrovsk (in Donetsk) that would then mean they are not about to build up a major strategic attack near Kharkiv.\" Read more:Ex-Ukrainian politician shot dead on school runRussia launches 'heaviest drone attack' since start of war Is Russia preparing to attack Kharkiv? Prof Clarke says it's possible Russia is preparing for a big push near the border cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. This could either be a direct attack on one of the cities - a tough task given how well defended they are - or an attempt to capture much of the surrounding area Ukraine liberated in Autumn 2022. Located just 20 miles from the border with Russia, Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city with a pre-2022 population of more than a million. It is regarded as a \"fortress\" and was awarded the distinction Hero City of Ukraine for its resistance during the opening months of the 2022 invasion. However, Prof Clarke doesn't think Russia has the resources for a big push at Kharkiv or Sumy this summer, after the Kremlin instead opted to try to attack along wide stretches of the frontline. \"I think the Russians basically used up the forces they might have otherwise used up for a strategic offensive,\" he says. This, he says, caused Ukraine to use up its reserves to counter the Russian attacks. \"Both sides have sacrificed the possibility of a strategic offensive for this ongoing battle of attrition.\" 'Four-month window' for Russia to make a breakthrough Dr Jack Watling, a military expert from the RUSI thinktank, argues Russia will likely \"soft launch\" its offensive rather than going for a rapid manoeuvre by large mechanised units. \"The Russians lack the force quality to operate in this way,\" he says. Instead, the summer offensive will likely see a \"steady increase in the number and scale of assaults across a broadening area\", he added. \"Indeed, there are indications this process has already started.\"  Prof Clarke says Russia has a \"four-month window\" to make a breakthrough in Ukraine this year. \"I think they must know this is their last year of build-up before they reach a plateau,\" he adds, referring to Russia's issues with tank production. Thus far Russia has been using its vast stocks of vehicles left over from the Soviet era, with only about 25% of its armour coming from new production. Dr Watling agrees: \"Russian stockpiles of legacy Soviet equipment, from tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, to artillery pieces, will be running out between now and mid-autumn, such that Russia's ability to replace losses will be entirely dependent on what it can produce from scratch.\" This, he added, makes the prospect of fresh sanctions from Europe and possibly America particularly timely."

        "Content": "Football pundit Gary Neville is to miss coverage of the Premier League finale on Sunday after being banned by Nottingham Forest, whose owner he recently criticised. Neville had been due to commentate on Forest's game against Chelsea on Sky Sports, which is being billed as a Champions League qualification shoot-out with both teams aiming for a top five finish. But posting on Instagram, the former Manchester United and England defender said the broadcaster told him on Thursday that Forest \"would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator\". \"I've had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage,\" he added. \"I've dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action.\" Sky backs Neville's decision Neville said while Forest \"have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium\", it was \"disappointing that a great club [â¦] have been reduced to making such a decision\". He said \"it's symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club\". Sky Sports described Forest's move as \"an unprecedented and unwelcome step\" and said it has decided \"to present the game from Sky Studios in west London. \"As he was no longer able to commentate from the ground, Gary has chosen to not be part of the coverage on Sunday - a decision fully supported by Sky.\" Read more from Sky News:Kardashian robbers jailedKneecap release new single Neville has been highly critical of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis. He described Marinakis walking on to the pitch and exchanging words with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after the club's draw with Leicester earlier this month as \"scandalous\". Neville urged Nuno to quit the club and his social media post further enraged Marinakis, who had threatened Sky with legal action over comments made by the pundit earlier in the season. After Forest's 2-0 defeat at Everton last year, the club issued a statement on social media questioning the integrity of video assistant referee Stuart Atwell after claiming they had been denied three penalties. Neville's response to that, comparing Forest's actions to those of a \"mafia gang\", prompted an apology from Sky after they had been contacted by Marinakis' lawyers."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @ShingiMararike\n  In the dozens of framed images and newspaper clippings covering the walls of his office in downtown New York City, Al Sharpton is pictured alongside presidents and leading protests. He has spent decades campaigning and is perhaps the most famous civil rights activist in the US today. Many of those clippings on the wall relate to one moment in May 2020 - the murder of George Floyd. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the five-year anniversary of that moment, Mr Sharpton remembered the combination of \"humiliation and deep anger\" he felt seeing the footage of Mr Floyd's death that swept the world. \"The more I watched, the more angry I felt,\" he said. Mr Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis by Derek Chauvin, a 44-year-old white police officer. Mr Floyd had been arrested after a store clerk reported he had made a purchase using counterfeit money. Chauvin knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, while he was handcuffed and lying face down in the street. 'A seismic moment' For Mr Sharpton, who has marched with countless other families, this felt different because it was \"graphic and unnecessary\". \"What kind of person would hear somebody begging for their life and ignore them?\" he said. \"I had no idea this would become a seismic moment,\" he continued. \"I think people would accuse civil rights leaders, activists like me of being opportunistic, but we don't know if one call from the next one is going to be big, all we know is we have to answer to the call.\"  Trump 'pouring salt on the wounds' Mr Floyd's death took place during Donald Trump's first term in the White House. During Trump's second term, his administration has moved to repeal federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department - a move originally supported by Joe Biden's administration. Mr Sharpton believes Mr Trump and the Department of Justice have purposely timed this for the 5th Anniversary of Mr Floyd's Death. \"It's pouring salt on the wounds of those that were killed, and those that fought,\" he said. \"I think Donald Trump and his administration is actively trying to reverse and revoke changes and progress made with policing based on the movement we created after George Floyd's death, worldwide.\" Read more from Sky News:'Grandpa robbers' guilty over Kim Kardashian heistTrain station stabbing in Germany Mr Sharpton still supports George Floyd's family and will be with them this weekend in Houston, Texas, where many of them will mark the anniversary. He said the legacy of Mr Floyd's death is still being written. Evoking the civil rights movement of the 1960s he said: \"The challenge is we must turn those moments into permanent movements, it took nine years from 1955 to 1964 for Dr [Martin Luther] King in that movement to get a Civil Rights Act after Rosa Parks sat in the front of a bus in Montgomery. \"We're five years out of George Floyd, we've got to change the laws. \"We can do it in under nine years, but we can't do it if we take our eye off the prize.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  Scientists from Kew Gardens are using a new study to track which trees bees prefer to try to stem the decline in our vital pollinators. Bee populations are falling all over the world due to a mixture of habitat loss, climate change, and the use of pesticides, with a devastating impact on our biodiversity and food production. But it's feared that not enough comprehensive, global research is being done to understand the issue or find solutions. UK becoming a no-fly zone Researchers based at Wakehurst in Sussex, known as Kew's \"Wild Botanic Garden\", have begun placing advanced bio-acoustics sensors in some of their trees to track which ones bees favour. They hope it'll help urban planners know which trees to plant in built-up areas, as a way of combating the worrying decline in bee numbers. Pollination research lead Dr Janine Griffiths-Lee said: \"Nearly 90% of our flowering plants depend on the contribution of pollinators, but in the UK the population of flying insects in the last 20 years has decreased by around 60%. \"It's really hard to be able to put a figure on the decline of our pollinators, but we do know that globally the number is declining. \"And with that comes crop yield instability and the loss of an essential ecosystem service.\" Their new, non-invasive monitors listen for the buzz created by bees' wing beats, building up heat maps of the most popular spots. Read more from Sky News:'Grandpa robbers' guilty over Kim Kardashian heistTrain station stabbing in Germany 'We're facing twin crises' Dr Griffiths-Lee said: \"If you think about the tree's footprint, it's very small, but they're huge 3D structures covered in pollen and nectar, which are essential resources of pollinators. \"So we really wanted to think about which are the best trees for bees for us to plant, and that can inform landscape planners, urban architects.\" Eight different species of tree were chosen for the study, including horse chestnut and lime trees, with a mixture of native and non-native species. The scientists have also been gathering DNA from pollen, which also helps them to map which plants and flowers the insects prefer. Wakehurst's director, Susan Raikes, calls the 535-acre estate a \"living laboratory\", and said the project's all about searching for nature-based solutions to the impacts of climate change. \"The stakes couldn't be higher, really. We know that we're facing these twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change,\" she added. \"We need to be able to understand, as the climate changes, which plants from warmer climes will be good here in the UK for pollinators in the future. \"If all of our native plants are struggling, then we need to find new sources of pollen - for us all to survive.\""

What it means to a club, a community and a fan base starved of silverware. More than 100,00 fans turned out on a Friday afternoon to welcome back a team with the Europa League trophy. For some clubs, 17 years might not seem a long time without a title. But Tottenham have endured so much frustration and ridicule - competing for much of the last decade in the upper reaches of the Premier League without any prize to show for it. And their last four cup finals have been lost. A punch line to savour No wonder pundits doubted whether head coach Ange Postecoglou could continue his record of always winning a trophy by the second season at his clubs. Now was the moment, at the end of the parade in front of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, to savour the success he promised to deliver. \"I told them, and they laughed,\" he told the crowd. \"I told them, and they didn't believe.\" Then came the punch line. \"I'll leave you with this,\" the Australian-Greek former Celtic manager said. \"All the best television series, season three is better than season two.\" Domestic woes forgotten - for now Whether he will be back for season three has been the subplot throughout the second half of the season. What was more surprising about beating Manchester United in the all-English final - a fourth win over the once-mighty fallen giants of the season - was reaching the final at all. Because the Europa League has been won during Tottenham's worst domestic campaign in almost five decades. It's a Premier League season that will end on Sunday, just above the relegation zone. But when there's a trophy to parade, on buses through the streets around the stadium, all the turbulence vanishes. At least for now.

        "Content": " Eight people have been found guilty of crimes connected to the gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel. The theft targeting the TV personality, socialite and businesswoman in 2016 was carried out by a group the media dubbed the \"grandpa robbers\" as most were close to or of retirement age. A six-member jury, led by three judges, reached a verdict on Friday following a four-week trial at Paris's Palais de Justice. The court found the ringleader and seven others guilty over the raid at the Hotel de Pourtales. Their sentences ranged from prison terms to a fine, but with time already served in pretrial detention, none of those convicted will go to jail, and all walked out free. The group were accused of pulling off one of the most audacious heists against a celebrity in modern French history, in the early hours of 3 October 2016 during Paris Fashion Week. Wearing ski masks and disguised as police, the thieves stormed Kardashian's luxury hotel apartment, tied up the star, and stole jewellery worth an estimated $6m (Â£4.4m), including a ring given to her by then husband Kanye West. 'You caused harm' Chief judge David De Pas said the defendants' ages - with the oldest being 79 and some others in their 60s and 70s - weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences, and the nine years between the robbery and the trial was also taken into account. He also told them the reality TV star had been traumatised by the raid, adding: \"You caused harm. You caused fear.\" Some arrived in court in orthopaedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. But prosecutors warned observers not to be fooled.

Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. Three others who were accused of the most serious charges got seven years imprisonment, five of them suspended. 'Most terrifying experience of my life' After the ruling, 44-year-old Kardashian, who was not present for the verdict, issued a statement, saying: \"I am deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case. \"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system.\" The court in the French capital found a ninth person guilty of illegal weapons charges, while a tenth person was cleared.  Kardashian 'thought she would be raped and killed' During the robbery, Kardashian, who previously told the court she thought she would be raped and killed, was bound with zip-ties and left in the bathtub. She described the robbery as \"terrifying\" and said while she felt forgiveness, that in no way altered \"the emotion and the feelings and the trauma,\" adding \"my life is forever changed\". Two members of the group - Khedache, known as \"Old Omar\", and Yunice Abbas - who wrote a book called I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian, admitted some part in the robbery, while the remaining eight denied the charges. Prosecutors had requested sentences of up to 10 years. Kardashian earlier this week completed her six-year legal apprenticeship in California. Most of the jewellery was never found. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece ever recovered."

Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe was killed along with Bebe King, six, and nine-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar in an attack by Axel Rudakubana at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class last July. Jennifer Sephton, headteacher of Farnborough Road Infant School, will be skydiving to raise funds for the Elsie's Story charitable trust, which has been set up in memory of the former pupil. \"She'd been with us for four years, throughout her education,\" Ms Sephton told Sky News, \"and we just want everybody to know Elsie's spirit.\" Describing Elsie as \"such a determined young lady,\" Ms Sephton said Elsie had \"a real zest for life, and a sparkle in her eye all the time.\" She added that Elsie's Story, which has been set up by Elsie's family, is about \"continuing that legacy.\" In the aftermath of the July 2024 attack, the gates outside Elsie's school were lined with flowers, balloons, and cards bearing her name. Since then, memorial benches and a tree have been planted in the school grounds, providing pupils and staff with a place to \"remember and reflect\", Ms Sefton says. \"[Elsie's death] had such an impact on all our community,\" the teacher said, \"it's had an impact on her friends, their siblings, our school as a community and our staff.\" Read more:Southport survivor wants end to use of traditional kitchen knives 'We want her name to live on' Ms Sephton will be joined in the skydive by Adrian Antell, headteacher at the adjoining junior school where Elsie had been due to start. \"Elsie was due to come to us last September,\" he told Sky News, \"but what we've learned about her is that she had a wonderful impact in the infant school, and we don't want her to be forgotten. \"We want her name to have to live on and to be thought of in a positive way.\" Mr Antell said they continue to support Elsie's classmates, who joined the new school without her. \"There's no instruction manual for this,\" he explained, \"every day is different, and every day is one step at a time. \"So all we can do as a school is to think about individual children and support them in the best way we can.\""

Neville had been due to commentate on Forest's game against Chelsea on Sky Sports, which is being billed as a Champions League qualification shoot-out with both teams aiming for a top five finish. But posting on Instagram, the former Manchester United and England defender said the broadcaster told him on Thursday that Forest \"would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator\". \"I've had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage,\" he added. \"I've dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action.\" Sky backs Neville's decision Neville said while Forest \"have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium\", it was \"disappointing that a great club [â¦] have been reduced to making such a decision\". He said \"it's symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club\". Sky Sports described Forest's move as \"an unprecedented and unwelcome step\" and said it has decided \"to present the game from Sky Studios in west London. \"As he was no longer able to commentate from the ground, Gary has chosen to not be part of the coverage on Sunday - a decision fully supported by Sky.\" Read more from Sky News:Kardashian robbers jailedKneecap release new single Neville has been highly critical of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis. He described Marinakis walking on to the pitch and exchanging words with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after the club's draw with Leicester earlier this month as \"scandalous\". Neville urged Nuno to quit the club and his social media post further enraged Marinakis, who had threatened Sky with legal action over comments made by the pundit earlier in the season. After Forest's 2-0 defeat at Everton last year, the club issued a statement on social media questioning the integrity of video assistant referee Stuart Atwell after claiming they had been denied three penalties. Neville's response to that, comparing Forest's actions to those of a \"mafia gang\", prompted an apology from Sky after they had been contacted by Marinakis' lawyers."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  Scientists from Kew Gardens are using a new study to track which trees bees prefer to try to stem the decline in our vital pollinators. Bee populations are falling all over the world due to a mixture of habitat loss, climate change, and the use of pesticides, with a devastating impact on our biodiversity and food production. But it's feared that not enough comprehensive, global research is being done to understand the issue or find solutions. UK becoming a no-fly zone Researchers based at Wakehurst in Sussex, known as Kew's \"Wild Botanic Garden\", have begun placing advanced bio-acoustics sensors in some of their trees to track which ones bees favour. They hope it'll help urban planners know which trees to plant in built-up areas, as a way of combating the worrying decline in bee numbers. Pollination research lead Dr Janine Griffiths-Lee said: \"Nearly 90% of our flowering plants depend on the contribution of pollinators, but in the UK the population of flying insects in the last 20 years has decreased by around 60%. \"It's really hard to be able to put a figure on the decline of our pollinators, but we do know that globally the number is declining. \"And with that comes crop yield instability and the loss of an essential ecosystem service.\" Their new, non-invasive monitors listen for the buzz created by bees' wing beats, building up heat maps of the most popular spots. Read more from Sky News:'Grandpa robbers' guilty over Kim Kardashian heistTrain station stabbing in Germany 'We're facing twin crises' Dr Griffiths-Lee said: \"If you think about the tree's footprint, it's very small, but they're huge 3D structures covered in pollen and nectar, which are essential resources of pollinators. \"So we really wanted to think about which are the best trees for bees for us to plant, and that can inform landscape planners, urban architects.\" Eight different species of tree were chosen for the study, including horse chestnut and lime trees, with a mixture of native and non-native species. The scientists have also been gathering DNA from pollen, which also helps them to map which plants and flowers the insects prefer. Wakehurst's director, Susan Raikes, calls the 535-acre estate a \"living laboratory\", and said the project's all about searching for nature-based solutions to the impacts of climate change. \"The stakes couldn't be higher, really. We know that we're facing these twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change,\" she added. \"We need to be able to understand, as the climate changes, which plants from warmer climes will be good here in the UK for pollinators in the future. \"If all of our native plants are struggling, then we need to find new sources of pollen - for us all to survive.\""

What it means to a club, a community and a fan base starved of silverware. More than 100,00 fans turned out on a Friday afternoon to welcome back a team with the Europa League trophy. For some clubs, 17 years might not seem a long time without a title. But Tottenham have endured so much frustration and ridicule - competing for much of the last decade in the upper reaches of the Premier League without any prize to show for it. And their last four cup finals have been lost. A punch line to savour No wonder pundits doubted whether head coach Ange Postecoglou could continue his record of always winning a trophy by the second season at his clubs. Now was the moment, at the end of the parade in front of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, to savour the success he promised to deliver. \"I told them, and they laughed,\" he told the crowd. \"I told them, and they didn't believe.\" Then came the punch line. \"I'll leave you with this,\" the Australian-Greek former Celtic manager said. \"All the best television series, season three is better than season two.\" Domestic woes forgotten - for now Whether he will be back for season three has been the subplot throughout the second half of the season. What was more surprising about beating Manchester United in the all-English final - a fourth win over the once-mighty fallen giants of the season - was reaching the final at all. Because the Europa League has been won during Tottenham's worst domestic campaign in almost five decades. It's a Premier League season that will end on Sunday, just above the relegation zone. But when there's a trophy to parade, on buses through the streets around the stadium, all the turbulence vanishes. At least for now.

        "Content": "Billy Joel has cancelled all his upcoming concerts in the UK and the US after being diagnosed with a brain illness that has affected his \"hearing, vision and balance\". A statement on the US singer's Instagram account on Friday revealed that he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition \"has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance. \"Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\" In a separate message, Joel said he was \"sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding\". What is Joel's condition? Hydrocephalus is a condition \"that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain. The excess fluid affects the brain and how it functions,\" according to the NHS Inform website. NPH can impact how sufferers walk, their urinary system and mental abilities, the site said. The Cleveland Clinic described it as \"a brain disorder that can affect brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more\". In March, the singer-songwriter postponed eight US tour dates after announcing he had had surgery and needed physiotherapy. A statement at the time said doctors expected him to make a full recovery. It is unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to NPH. The condition is relatively rare and can be hard to diagnose. It can be treated successfully with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid. Patients may need physiotherapy in addition to surgery.

The rap trio from Belfast shared a link to the song - The Recap - which opens with Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost reporting about the counter terrorism police investigation - on Instagram, linking to their WhatsApp channel. Bandmembers Liam O hAnnaidh, Naoise O Caireallain and JJ O Dochartaigh, also thanked the 25,000 fans who had bought tickets for Friday night's festival. They also reference Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, with whom they've had previous run-ins, writing: \"Kemi Badenoch you might wanna sit down for this one, if you've any seats left.\" Last year, Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government in Belfast High Court after former business secretary Ms Badenoch tried to refuse them a Â£14,250 funding award when she was a minister. Ms Badenoch has called for Kneecap to be banned and suggested they should be dropped from the Glastonbury Festival line-up. Some other politicians have made the same demand. The track mocks Badenoch's attempts to block their arts funding and the Conservative Party's election loss. It features DJ Mozey. It comes after O hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged over the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag at a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, in November last year, the Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the band held a surprise gig at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, where O hAnnaidh could be seen in videos on social media arriving on stage with tape covering his mouth. He then joked about being careful about what he said, adding that he wanted to thank his lawyer, saying: \"I need to thank my lawyer, he's here tonight as well.\"  In video footage posted to YouTube, the band led the audience in a chant of \"free Mo Chara\" and joked about the police presence at the venue. Police said they attended to manage visitors to the sold-out event. The band said on X that the central London event sold out in 90 seconds, with 2,000 people on the waiting list. O hAnnaidh, 27, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 18 June. Formed in 2017, the group are known for their provocative lyrics in both Irish and English and proved a critical hit in the 2024 semi-fictionalised band origin story movie Kneecap, starring actor Michael Fassbender. Their best-known tracks include Get Your Brits Out, Better Way To Live, featuring Grian Chatten from Fontaines DC, and 3Cag."

Sky News can reveal the ultimate cost to the UK of saving RBS - now NatWest Group - from insolvency is expected to come in at about Â£10.2bn once the proceeds of share sales, dividends and fees associated with the stake are aggregated. The final bill will draw a line under one of the most notorious bank bailouts ever orchestrated, and comes nearly 17 years after the then chancellor, Lord Darling, conducted what RBS's boss at the time, Fred Goodwin, labelled \"a drive-by shooting\". Money latest: Brits urged to leave energy price cap Insiders believe a statement confirming the final shares have been sold could come in the latter part of next week, although there is a chance that timetable could be extended by a number of days. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is likely to make a statement about the milestone, although insiders say the Treasury and the bank are keen to simply mark the occasion by thanking British taxpayers for their protracted support. A stock exchange filing disclosing that taxpayers' stake had fallen below 1% was made last week, down from over 80% in the years after the Â£45.5bn bailout. \n                  US-EU trade war fears reignite as Europe strikes back at Trump's threat\n                 \n                  Money blog: Trump sends message to UK on energy bills - and we've fact-checked it\n                 \n                  Trump threatens EU with 50% tariff - as Apple faces 25% unless iPhones are made in US\n                 The stake now stands at 0.26%, meaning the final shares could be offloaded as early as the middle of next week, depending upon demand. Total proceeds from a government trading plan launched in 2021 to drip-feed NatWest stock into the market have so far reached Â£12.8bn. Based on the bank's current share price, the remaining shares should fetch in the region of Â£400m, taking the figure to Â£13.2bn. In addition, institutional share sales and direct buybacks by NatWest of government-held stock have yielded a further Â£11.5bn. Dividend payments to the Treasury during its ownership have totalled Â£4.9bn, while fees and other payments have generated another Â£5.6bn. In aggregate, that means total proceeds from NatWest since 2008 are expected to hit Â£35.3bn. Under Rick Haythornthwaite and Paul Thwaite, now the bank's chairman and chief executive respectively, NatWest is now focused on driving growth across its business. It recently tabled an Â£11bn bid to buy Santander UK, according to the Financial Times, although no talks are ongoing. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose, who left amid the crisis sparked by the debanking scandal involving Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader. Sky News recently revealed that the bank and Mr Farage had reached an undisclosed settlement. During the first five years of NatWest's period in majority state ownership, the bank was run by Sir Stephen Hester, now the chairman of easyJet. Sir Stephen stepped down amid tensions with the then chancellor, George Osborne, about how RBS - as it then was - should be run.

NatWest declined to comment on Friday. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We now own less than 1% of shares in NatWest which is a significant step towards returning the bank to private ownership and delivering value for money for taxpayers. \"We are on track to exit the shareholding soon, subject to sales achieving value for money and market conditions.\""

Although he had returned to school and the pair had spent Christmas together in the weeks before his death, she was concerned he still had \"one foot in the streets\" and was \"not surprised\" when she found out he had been killed. One of the machetes used in the attack was thrown in the River Thames but later resurfaced by police. Judge Mark Lucraft KC ordered reports ahead of sentencing the pair on 25 July and said he would consider a media appeal to name them. Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Lee, from the Metropolitan Police, expressed her team's \"heartfelt sympathies\" to Kelyan's family after the defendants' guilty pleas. She added: \"The brutal and senseless attack on Kelyan has deeply impacted his friends, the wider community and everyone that has worked tirelessly to identify, arrest and prosecute those responsible. \"I hope Kelyan's family can take some solace in this outcome but I know they remain deeply bereft at the waste of three young lives.\""

He warned that more people will die unless there is \"rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access\".  Israel says around 300 aid trucks have been allowed through since it lifted an 11-week blockade on Monday, but according to Mr Guterres, only about a third have been transported to warehouses within Gaza due to insecurity. The IDF said 107 vehicles carrying flour, food, medical equipment and drugs were allowed through on Thursday. Many of Gaza's two million residents are at high risk of famine, experts have warned.

The latest strikes came a day after two Israeli embassy workers were killed in Washington. The suspect, named as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, Illinois, told police he \"did it for Gaza\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney of fuelling antisemitism following the shootings. The leaders of the UK, France and Canada are \"on the wrong side of humanity and (...) history\", he said, after they threatened \"concrete action\" against Israel this week if it continues its \"egregious\" military operations in Gaza. Mr Netanyahu also accused Sir Keir, Mr Macron and Mr Carney of siding with \"mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers\". But UK government minister Luke Pollard told Sky News on Friday morning he \"doesn't recognise\" Mr Netanyahu's accusation. Earlier this week, Mr Netanyahu said he was recalling negotiators from the Qatari capital, Doha, after a week of ceasefire talks failed to bring results. A working team will remain. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 251 others.

It's a lethal spiral. \"My daughter was born at a normal weight, 3.5kg,\" Sundush tells us. \"But as the war went on, her weight dropped significantly. I would breastfeed her, she'd get diarrhoea. I tried formula - same result. With the borders closed and no food coming in, I can't eat enough to give her the nutrients she needs.\" \"I brought her to the hospital for treatment, but the care she needs isn't available. \"The doctor said her condition is very serious.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n Russian forces are reportedly gathering across the border from Ukraine's \"fortress city\" - but why? After pushing Ukrainian troops out of Kursk, the Russian region they had occupied parts of for many months, what's left of the 50,000-strong Russian force is positioned just across the border from Kharkiv. Ukraine war's largest prisoner swap - latest updates A major push along all or part of the frontline by Moscow's troops has been expected for some time but has not yet fully materialised, analysts say. It's believed Russia has a \"four-month window\" to break through Ukrainian forces before the weather begins to turn and dwindling stocks of Soviet tanks possibly start to run low. Where are the massing Russian troops - and are elite soldiers among them? Kremlin troops have been gathering on the other side of the border near Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine, according to a senior Ukrainian military figure. \"The enemy is trying to pull its personnel closer to the line of combat contact and conduct at least some assault actions,\" Andriy Pomahaibus, chief of staff of the 13th Operational Brigade, said this week. \"In general, they are not succeeding.\" Nonetheless, he said there is \"clear preparation for active assault actions by the enemy\".  Sky News military analyst Michael Clarke says the accumulation of troops comes off the back of the Russian operation to push Ukraine out of the pocket of the Kursk region they had occupied, which is not far from Kharkiv. \"Now they have Kursk back the argument is: will they keep going?\" Some of Russia's most experienced soldiers - including from the elite VDV airborne unit - were moved to reinforce the Kursk campaign, and could still be among the gathered troops. Prof Clarke adds: \"If they have left those units there, that would suggest they want them to spearhead something else. \"If those units turn up back around Pokrovsk (in Donetsk) that would then mean they are not about to build up a major strategic attack near Kharkiv.\" Read more:Ex-Ukrainian politician shot dead on school runRussia launches 'heaviest drone attack' since start of war Is Russia preparing to attack Kharkiv? Prof Clarke says it's possible Russia is preparing for a big push near the border cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. This could either be a direct attack on one of the cities - a tough task given how well defended they are - or an attempt to capture much of the surrounding area Ukraine liberated in Autumn 2022. Located just 20 miles from the border with Russia, Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city with a pre-2022 population of more than a million. It is regarded as a \"fortress\" and was awarded the distinction Hero City of Ukraine for its resistance during the opening months of the 2022 invasion. However, Prof Clarke doesn't think Russia has the resources for a big push at Kharkiv or Sumy this summer, after the Kremlin instead opted to try to attack along wide stretches of the frontline. \"I think the Russians basically used up the forces they might have otherwise used up for a strategic offensive,\" he says. This, he says, caused Ukraine to use up its reserves to counter the Russian attacks. \"Both sides have sacrificed the possibility of a strategic offensive for this ongoing battle of attrition.\" 'Four-month window' for Russia to make a breakthrough Dr Jack Watling, a military expert from the RUSI thinktank, argues Russia will likely \"soft launch\" its offensive rather than going for a rapid manoeuvre by large mechanised units. \"The Russians lack the force quality to operate in this way,\" he says. Instead, the summer offensive will likely see a \"steady increase in the number and scale of assaults across a broadening area\", he added. \"Indeed, there are indications this process has already started.\"  Prof Clarke says Russia has a \"four-month window\" to make a breakthrough in Ukraine this year. \"I think they must know this is their last year of build-up before they reach a plateau,\" he adds, referring to Russia's issues with tank production. Thus far Russia has been using its vast stocks of vehicles left over from the Soviet era, with only about 25% of its armour coming from new production. Dr Watling agrees: \"Russian stockpiles of legacy Soviet equipment, from tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, to artillery pieces, will be running out between now and mid-autumn, such that Russia's ability to replace losses will be entirely dependent on what it can produce from scratch.\" This, he added, makes the prospect of fresh sanctions from Europe and possibly America particularly timely."

        "Content": " Eight people have been found guilty of crimes connected to the gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel. The theft targeting the TV personality, socialite and businesswoman in 2016 was carried out by a group the media dubbed the \"grandpa robbers\" as most were close to or of retirement age. A six-member jury, led by three judges, reached a verdict on Friday following a four-week trial at Paris's Palais de Justice. The court found the ringleader and seven others guilty over the raid at the Hotel de Pourtales. Their sentences ranged from prison terms to a fine, but with time already served in pretrial detention, none of those convicted will go to jail, and all walked out free. The group were accused of pulling off one of the most audacious heists against a celebrity in modern French history, in the early hours of 3 October 2016 during Paris Fashion Week. Wearing ski masks and disguised as police, the thieves stormed Kardashian's luxury hotel apartment, tied up the star, and stole jewellery worth an estimated $6m (Â£4.4m), including a ring given to her by then husband Kanye West. 'You caused harm' Chief judge David De Pas said the defendants' ages - with the oldest being 79 and some others in their 60s and 70s - weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences, and the nine years between the robbery and the trial was also taken into account. He also told them the reality TV star had been traumatised by the raid, adding: \"You caused harm. You caused fear.\" Some arrived in court in orthopaedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. But prosecutors warned observers not to be fooled. Read more: Everything you need to know about the Paris trial  Ringleader Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, who arrived at court walking with a stick, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, with five of those suspended. His DNA, which was found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. Three others who were accused of the most serious charges got seven years imprisonment, five of them suspended. 'Most terrifying experience of my life' After the ruling, 44-year-old Kardashian, who was not present for the verdict, issued a statement, saying: \"I am deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case. \"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system.\" The court in the French capital found a ninth person guilty of illegal weapons charges, while a tenth person was cleared.  Kardashian 'thought she would be raped and killed' During the robbery, Kardashian, who previously told the court she thought she would be raped and killed, was bound with zip-ties and left in the bathtub. She described the robbery as \"terrifying\" and said while she felt forgiveness, that in no way altered \"the emotion and the feelings and the trauma,\" adding \"my life is forever changed\". Two members of the group - Khedache, known as \"Old Omar\", and Yunice Abbas - who wrote a book called I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian, admitted some part in the robbery, while the remaining eight denied the charges. Prosecutors had requested sentences of up to 10 years. Kardashian earlier this week completed her six-year legal apprenticeship in California. Most of the jewellery was never found. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece ever recovered."

        "Content": "By Jenness Mitchell, news reporter   The wife of OceanGate's chief executive asked \"what was that bang?\" as she unknowingly heard the moment the Titan submersible imploded. Footage released by the US Coast Guard (USCG) shows Wendy Rush, wife of Stockton Rush, attempting to contact those on board the doomed vessel during its descent to see the wreck of the Titanic. All five on board were killed in the incident in June 2023, including Titan operator and OceanGate founder Mr Rush, British adventurer Hamish Harding, French deep sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. In the USCG footage, OceanGate director Mrs Rush and colleague Gary Foss are seen tracking the Titan's journey in the North Atlantic Ocean from support vessel Polar Prince. After the implosion is heard, Mrs Rush asks: \"What was that bang?\" The USCG believe the noise - which sounded like a door slamming - was the sound of the Titan's implosion reaching the surface of the ocean. Read more:What happened to the Titan? Everything we knowThe stories of those on the Titan submersible Moments later, Mrs Rush receives a message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights. The team assume the Titan is continuing its descent, but investigators would later believe the delayed message was sent prior to the sub failing.  The footage has been presented as evidence to the USCG Marine Board of Investigation as part of its probe into the incident. A final report will be released following its completion.  The Titan tragedy occurred about 90 minutes into the descent on 18 June 2023. After five frantic days of searching, the wreckage was eventually found on the ocean floor around 500m from the bow of the Titanic's wreck. The passengers had paid OceanGate to see the famous ship, which lies 3,800m below the surface. Following the disaster, concerns were raised over the Titan's unconventional design and Mr Rush's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. The coastguard panel investigating the incident heard two weeks of testimony last September, which saw a former OceanGate scientific director say the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before it imploded. OceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations in July 2023."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @ShingiMararike\n  In the dozens of framed images and newspaper clippings covering the walls of his office in downtown New York City, Al Sharpton is pictured alongside presidents and leading protests. He has spent decades campaigning and is perhaps the most famous civil rights activist in the US today. Many of those clippings on the wall relate to one moment in May 2020 - the murder of George Floyd. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the five-year anniversary of that moment, Mr Sharpton remembered the combination of \"humiliation and deep anger\" he felt seeing the footage of Mr Floyd's death that swept the world. \"The more I watched, the more angry I felt,\" he said. Mr Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis by Derek Chauvin, a 44-year-old white police officer. Mr Floyd had been arrested after a store clerk reported he had made a purchase using counterfeit money. Chauvin knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, while he was handcuffed and lying face down in the street. 'A seismic moment' For Mr Sharpton, who has marched with countless other families, this felt different because it was \"graphic and unnecessary\". \"What kind of person would hear somebody begging for their life and ignore them?\" he said. \"I had no idea this would become a seismic moment,\" he continued. \"I think people would accuse civil rights leaders, activists like me of being opportunistic, but we don't know if one call from the next one is going to be big, all we know is we have to answer to the call.\"  Trump 'pouring salt on the wounds' Mr Floyd's death took place during Donald Trump's first term in the White House. During Trump's second term, his administration has moved to repeal federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department - a move originally supported by Joe Biden's administration. Mr Sharpton believes Mr Trump and the Department of Justice have purposely timed this for the 5th Anniversary of Mr Floyd's Death. \"It's pouring salt on the wounds of those that were killed, and those that fought,\" he said. \"I think Donald Trump and his administration is actively trying to reverse and revoke changes and progress made with policing based on the movement we created after George Floyd's death, worldwide.\" Read more from Sky News:'Grandpa robbers' guilty over Kim Kardashian heistTrain station stabbing in Germany Mr Sharpton still supports George Floyd's family and will be with them this weekend in Houston, Texas, where many of them will mark the anniversary.

        "Content": "Billy Joel has cancelled all his upcoming concerts in the UK and the US after being diagnosed with a brain illness that has affected his \"hearing, vision and balance\". A statement on the US singer's Instagram account on Friday revealed that he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition \"has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance. \"Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\" In a separate message, Joel said he was \"sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding\". What is Joel's condition? Hydrocephalus is a condition \"that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain. The excess fluid affects the brain and how it functions,\" according to the NHS Inform website. NPH can impact how sufferers walk, their urinary system and mental abilities, the site said. The Cleveland Clinic described it as \"a brain disorder that can affect brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more\". In March, the singer-songwriter postponed eight US tour dates after announcing he had had surgery and needed physiotherapy. A statement at the time said doctors expected him to make a full recovery. It is unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to NPH. The condition is relatively rare and can be hard to diagnose. It can be treated successfully with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid. Patients may need physiotherapy in addition to surgery.

Tickets for all the shows will be refunded. Joel, whose best-known songs include The Piano Man and Uptown Girl, has sold more than 150 million records, according to his official website, and won six Grammy Awards in a 50-year career. He ended a 10-year residency at New York's Madison Square Garden last July."

The US Mint has made its final order of penny blanks (flat metal discs that are made into coins) and expects to stop making new pennies once those are cashed out. Mr Trump claims the coin costs the country a mint - and the US Treasury seems to agree with him, expecting annual savings of $56m (Â£41m) in reduced material costs once the low-value denomination is no more. \"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social in February. \"This is so wasteful!\" \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\" Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny was one of the first coins made by the US Mint after its establishment in 1792 and there are now around 114 billion currently in circulation - that's 285,000 tonnes of metal. However they are greatly underutilised, the Treasury says.

Jay Zagorsky, professor of markets, public policy, and law at Boston University, said he supports the move to end penny production but warned that US Congress must legislate that prices be rounded up in order to eliminate demand for the coin."

        "Content": "By Jenness Mitchell, news reporter   The wife of OceanGate's chief executive asked \"what was that bang?\" as she unknowingly heard the moment the Titan submersible imploded. Footage released by the US Coast Guard (USCG) shows Wendy Rush, wife of Stockton Rush, attempting to contact those on board the doomed vessel during its descent to see the wreck of the Titanic. All five on board were killed in the incident in June 2023, including Titan operator and OceanGate founder Mr Rush, British adventurer Hamish Harding, French deep sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. In the USCG footage, OceanGate director Mrs Rush and colleague Gary Foss are seen tracking the Titan's journey in the North Atlantic Ocean from support vessel Polar Prince. After the implosion is heard, Mrs Rush asks: \"What was that bang?\" The USCG believe the noise - which sounded like a door slamming - was the sound of the Titan's implosion reaching the surface of the ocean. Read more:What happened to the Titan? Everything we knowThe stories of those on the Titan submersible Moments later, Mrs Rush receives a message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights. The team assume the Titan is continuing its descent, but investigators would later believe the delayed message was sent prior to the sub failing.  The footage has been presented as evidence to the USCG Marine Board of Investigation as part of its probe into the incident. A final report will be released following its completion.  The Titan tragedy occurred about 90 minutes into the descent on 18 June 2023. After five frantic days of searching, the wreckage was eventually found on the ocean floor around 500m from the bow of the Titanic's wreck. The passengers had paid OceanGate to see the famous ship, which lies 3,800m below the surface. Following the disaster, concerns were raised over the Titan's unconventional design and Mr Rush's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. The coastguard panel investigating the incident heard two weeks of testimony last September, which saw a former OceanGate scientific director say the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before it imploded. OceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations in July 2023."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       The mother of a 14-year-old boy who claims he took his own life after becoming obsessed with artificial intelligence chatbots can continue her legal case against the company behind the technology, a judge has ruled. \"This decision is truly historic,\" said Meetali Jain, director of the Tech Justice Law Project, which is supporting the family's case. \"It sends a clear signal to [AI] companies [...] that they cannot evade legal consequences for the real-world harm their products cause,\" she said in a statement. Warning: This article contains some details which readers may find distressing or triggering Megan Garcia, the mother of Sewell Setzer III, claims Character.ai targeted her son with \"anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences\" in a lawsuit filed in Florida. \"A dangerous AI chatbot app marketed to children abused and preyed on my son, manipulating him into taking his own life,\" said Ms Garcia. Sewell shot himself with his father's pistol in February 2024, seconds after asking the chatbot: \"What if I come home right now?\" The chatbot replied: \"... please do, my sweet king.\" In US Senior District Judge Anne Conway's ruling this week, she described how Sewell became \"addicted\" to the app within months of using it, quitting his basketball team and becoming withdrawn. He was particularly addicted to two chatbots based on Game of Thrones characters, Daenerys Targaryen and Rhaenyra Targaryen. \"[I]n one undated journal entry he wrote that he could not go a single day without being with the [Daenerys Targaryen Character] with which he felt like he had fallen in love; that when they were away from each other they (both he and the bot) 'get really depressed and go crazy',\" wrote the judge in her ruling. Ms Garcia, who is working with the Tech Justice Law Project and Social Media Victims Law Center, alleges that Character.ai \"knew\" or \"should have known\" that its model \"would be harmful to a significant number of its minor customers\". The case holds Character.ai, its founders and Google, where the founders began working on the model, responsible for Sewell's death. Ms Garcia launched proceedings against both companies in October. A Character.ai spokesperson said the company will continue to fight the case and employs safety features on its platform to protect minors, including measures to prevent \"conversations about self-harm\". A Google spokesperson said the company strongly disagrees with the decision. They added that Google and Character.ai are \"entirely separate\" and that Google \"did not create, design, or manage Character.ai's app or any component part of it\". Defending lawyers tried to argue the case should be thrown out because chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a \"chilling effect\" on the AI industry. Judge Conway rejected that claim, saying she was \"not prepared\" to hold that the chatbots' output constitutes speech \"at this stage\", although she did agree Character.ai users had a right to receive the \"speech\" of the chatbots.

        "Content": "Donald Trump hosted a dinner for investors in his meme coin on Thursday, as critics warned the US president was putting personal profit first. Some 220 of the biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin descended on the exclusive dinner at Mr Trump's private country club in Northern Virginia. As the US president arrived, more than a hundred protesters at the Trump National Golf Club held signs that included \"America is not for sale\", \"stop crypto corruption\" and \"release the list\". Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren described the dinner, where the US president spoke for about half an hour before dancing to the song YMCA, as an \"orgy of corruption\". Access to the dinner, and the president, was earned by purchasing enough of his $TRUMP meme coin to secure a seat. The White House insisted Mr Trump would attend the event \"in his personal time\", but the lectern he stood behind had the presidential seal. NBC News reported that during his remarks, Mr Trump did not unveil any new crypto policies but spoke in support of a potential bitcoin reserve and then left promptly afterward. In total, investors spent an estimated $148m (Â£110m), with the top 25 holders of the coin spending more than $111m (Â£82.56m), according to crypto intelligence firm Inca Digital. A company controlled by the Trump family, and a second firm, hold 80% of the remaining $TRUMP coins and have so far earned $320.19m (Â£238.14m), including at least $1.35m (Â£1m) after the dinner announcement, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. 'Trump a very successful businessman,' says White House According to blockchain analysis, more than half of the 220 holders who attended the black-tie event are likely based outside the US. This has led to claims the US president has auctioned off access to himself to foreign investors for personal gain. In response to criticisms about Mr Trump using his office to enrich himself from the meme coin, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children. \"And I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people re-elected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country.\" Who was on the guest list? One of those attending was China-born crypto entrepreneur and billionaire Justin Sun. He won first place in the dinner contest with his $18.5m (Â£13.76m) wallet of the Trump meme coin and is the largest publicly known investor in the family's crypto platform - which has made them hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr Sun posted videos of himself visiting parts of the White House complex on Wednesday, and on Thursday of Mr Trump at the dinner event. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission paused a 2023 fraud case against him, citing public interest. However, the identities of the majority of the coin holders attending the event remain unknown. Of those going, one was simply known as Ogle, a crypto security specialist who appears in video interviews with his face covered by a bandana and sunglasses. He says this is to protect his identity.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n British taxpayers are set to swallow a loss of just over Â£10bn on the 2008 rescue of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as the government prepares to confirm that it has offloaded its last-remaining shares in the lender as soon as next week. Sky News can reveal the ultimate cost to the UK of saving RBS - now NatWest Group - from insolvency is expected to come in at about Â£10.2bn once the proceeds of share sales, dividends and fees associated with the stake are aggregated. The final bill will draw a line under one of the most notorious bank bailouts ever orchestrated, and comes nearly 17 years after the then chancellor, Lord Darling, conducted what RBS's boss at the time, Fred Goodwin, labelled \"a drive-by shooting\". Money latest: Brits urged to leave energy price cap Insiders believe a statement confirming the final shares have been sold could come in the latter part of next week, although there is a chance that timetable could be extended by a number of days. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is likely to make a statement about the milestone, although insiders say the Treasury and the bank are keen to simply mark the occasion by thanking British taxpayers for their protracted support. A stock exchange filing disclosing that taxpayers' stake had fallen below 1% was made last week, down from over 80% in the years after the Â£45.5bn bailout. \n                  US-EU trade war fears reignite as Europe strikes back at Trump's threat\n                 \n                  Money blog: Trump sends message to UK on energy bills - and we've fact-checked it\n                 \n                  Trump threatens EU with 50% tariff - as Apple faces 25% unless iPhones are made in US\n                 The stake now stands at 0.26%, meaning the final shares could be offloaded as early as the middle of next week, depending upon demand. Total proceeds from a government trading plan launched in 2021 to drip-feed NatWest stock into the market have so far reached Â£12.8bn. Based on the bank's current share price, the remaining shares should fetch in the region of Â£400m, taking the figure to Â£13.2bn. In addition, institutional share sales and direct buybacks by NatWest of government-held stock have yielded a further Â£11.5bn. Dividend payments to the Treasury during its ownership have totalled Â£4.9bn, while fees and other payments have generated another Â£5.6bn. In aggregate, that means total proceeds from NatWest since 2008 are expected to hit Â£35.3bn. Under Rick Haythornthwaite and Paul Thwaite, now the bank's chairman and chief executive respectively, NatWest is now focused on driving growth across its business. It recently tabled an Â£11bn bid to buy Santander UK, according to the Financial Times, although no talks are ongoing. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose, who left amid the crisis sparked by the debanking scandal involving Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader. Sky News recently revealed that the bank and Mr Farage had reached an undisclosed settlement. During the first five years of NatWest's period in majority state ownership, the bank was run by Sir Stephen Hester, now the chairman of easyJet. Sir Stephen stepped down amid tensions with the then chancellor, George Osborne, about how RBS - as it then was - should be run.

NatWest declined to comment on Friday. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We now own less than 1% of shares in NatWest which is a significant step towards returning the bank to private ownership and delivering value for money for taxpayers. \"We are on track to exit the shareholding soon, subject to sales achieving value for money and market conditions.\""

Apple shares dropped more than 2% in premarket trading after the warning, also posted on Truth Social. \"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or any place else,\" wrote the president. \"If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.\" Production of Apple's flagship phone happens primarily in China and India, which has been an issue brought up repeatedly by Mr Trump.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  President Trump's Friday flurry of pronouncements marks the return of negotiation by smartphone and may trigger another period of profound uncertainty for international trade and financial markets. The threat of 50% tariffs against the European Union, issued hours before his trade representative met their European counterparts, is a show of presidential muscle surely designed to strongarm those on the other side of the table. It is an escalation likely to heighten the threat of retaliation from Europe, and with a few keystrokes ends the brief period of calm that had returned to global trade and markets in recent days. Money blog: Trump sends message to UK on energy bills Talks in Switzerland between US and Chinese delegations a fortnight ago took the sting out of Sino-American hostility, negotiating three-figure tariffs that amounted to a mutual trade embargo down to manageable levels. Financial markets had regained most of the losses sparked on 'Liberation Day' in April, when Donald Trump declared total trade war, and there was optimism that for all his bluster, there might be meaningful room for constructive compromise. The UK even secured a deal of sorts, securing a reduction in auto tariffs in exchange for a reciprocal opening of agricultural markets. \n                  US-EU trade war fears reignite as Europe strikes back at Trump's threat\n                 \n                  Can Trump revoke international students' visas?

A 50% tariff on all exports to the US is not only higher than the original threatened blanket tariff of 20% and double Mr Trump's proposed 25% on European cars, it's higher even than China. European stocks predictably ended the week in decline, with car manufacturers including BMW, Volkswagen and Stellantis all down.  It remains to be seen whether this threat will stick. Read more:Trump trade argument against UK doesn't add upWhy Trump blinked in US-China trade war Mr Trump has repeatedly blinked first in the trade war he started, backing down on global reciprocal tariffs when bond markets rebelled before caving in Geneva to reach an accommodation with China. His grievances with Europe appear to have an extra edge however, and the consequences of the uncertainty he's sparked will be far-reaching. If this was the only thing he had announced on 'Liberation Day' it would still have been huge."

From July, the maximum unit price for gas and electricity will come down 7%, amounting to a cut of Â£129 to Ofgem's notional \"typical usage\" calculation for an average household, now set at Â£1,720. It is the first fall in a year, reflecting the path of natural gas wholesale prices, which have been in decline since March and, on current forecasts, are expected to remain broadly flat as we head into the winter. If that's the case, then consumers can look forward to a period of relative calm when it comes to energy bills. Given that this cut will begin in July, the lowest-consumption quarter of the year, it would be particularly welcome if lower rates continue into next winter. The weather, global economic fortunes determined by Donald Trump and the path of the war in Ukraine will all influence those prices, and you might not want to rely on any of them. It is a safe bet that the winter fuel row will still be simmering, and this announcement is a reminder that it is a benefit with far greater political currency than actual economic benefit to the recipients. Read more:Reeves under pressure as borrowing risesDoctors and teachers offered 4% pay rise At Â£200 for anyone of pensionable age, rising to Â£300 for those over 80, the universal allowance was negligible or irrelevant for millions of recipients, but fundamental to the very poorest households. The price cut announced today is worth 64% of the lower rate, and 43% of the Â£300 payment, underlining that energy prices and pensioner poverty are the fundamental issues, rather than an arbitrary benefit unchanged in 25 years and falling in real-terms value ever since. Returning gas and electricity prices to the long-term pre-Ukraine war average of around Â£1,200 would almost double the value of the winter fuel payment, but there is little chance of that in the short term. Addressing the wealth imbalance in a society where a quarter of the population will rely wholly on the state pension in retirement may be even more intractable. In the meantime, consumers are advised to shop around for deals. This morning, several major suppliers are offering fixed rates below the new price cap, which might offer value even in a stable market."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n A Â£500m deal to end the two-year ownership impasse at the Daily Telegraph has been agreed \"in principle\", it has been announced. A consortium led by US firm Redbird Capital was set to take control of Telegraph Media Group (TMG), with state-backed Abu Dhabi investment vehicle IMI among the investors. The pair's original joint venture, known as RedBird IMI, had agreed to buy the Telegraph titles in 2023. But prospects for a deal being signed off were held up by the previous Conservative government's subsequent ban on foreign state ownership of UK newspapers. Money latest: Brits urged to leave energy price cap The row centred on the involvement of IMI's owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is the owner of Manchester City FC but also the vice president of the United Arab Emirates. The ban was based on fears around editorial independence. However, the rules were relaxed earlier this month by the current government, which said a foreign state-controlled holding of up to 15% was acceptable. It is understood that UK-based media investors are among the proposed owners within the consortium. Sky News' City editor Mark Kleinman reported on Monday that the Daily Mail's owner had been in talks over involvement. The Telegraph newspaper itself reported that regulatory hurdles remained - a factor that could yet scupper completion of the deal. Anna Jones, TMG chief executive, said: \"Telegraph Media Group is an award-winning news media organisation, with exceptional journalism at its heart, supported by leading commercial expertise, a commitment to innovation and a laser focus on data to drive strategy. \"RedBird Capital Partners have exciting growth plans that build on our success - and will unlock our full potential across the breadth of our business.\" RedBird, whose other UK interests include a 10% stake in the US group behind Liverpool FC, said its growth strategy would include \"capital investment in digital operations, subscriptions and journalism\". Its statement continued: \"RedBird will build on the strong financial foundations established by the current management team and will work with them to grow the brand internationally, with a focus on the United States where RedBird has a strong strategic presence across news, media and sports. \"Together, RedBird and TMG senior leadership will work to develop new content verticals in areas such as travel and events to maximise the commercial opportunities from a growing international and mass affluent subscriber base.\" Redbird founder Gerry Cardinale added: \"This transaction marks the start of a new era for The Telegraph as we look to grow the brand in the UK and internationally, invest in its technology and expand its subscriber base. \"We believe that the UK is a great place to invest, and this acquisition is an important part of RedBird's growing portfolio of media and entertainment companies in the UK.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The British-born newspaper-owner whose takeover of The Daily Telegraph appears to have been thwarted by a Â£500m deal with RedBird Capital Partners has called on the title's stakeholders to rally behind his bid instead. In an opinion piece to be published later on Friday, Dovid Efune, publisher of The New York Sun, will say that his offer is \"now within sight of the finish line, with the bulk of the needed funding committed\". Mr Efune has been assembling a bid for the right-leaning newspapers for months, with a series of funding options having been explored. Money latest: Trump's message to UK on energy bills He now has backing from Nadhim Zahawi, the former Conservative Cabinet minister whose interest in the Telegraph was revealed last year by Sky News, and Jeremy Hosking, a prominent and wealthy City investor. In his opinion piece, Mr Efune described the Telegraph as a \"crown jewel\", adding that British journalism was the envy of the world. \"It is no coincidence that a meaningful portion of America's largest newsrooms are run by British journalists,\" he wrote in a piece shared exclusively with Sky News. \n                  US-EU trade war fears reignite as Europe strikes back at Trump's threat\n                 \n                  British taxpayers' Â£10.2bn loss on bailout of RBS\n                 \n                  Money blog: Trump sends message to UK on energy bills - and we've fact-checked it\n                 \"These include the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and CNN. \"You might say that journalists, editors and journalism writ large are among Britain's greatest exports.\" Read more: Telegraph sale agreed 'in principle' Referring to the Barclay family, which owned the Telegraph for about two decades, Mr Efune said the newspapers had \"functioned as something of a piggy bank for its previous owners, and as a useful form of real estate collateral\". \"The Telegraph's achievements and advancements despite these handicaps are impressive. But it deserves better,\" he wrote. Mr Efune said the Â£500m RedBird takeover - which is likely to involve minority ownership stakes for Abu Dhabi state-backed IMI and Lord Rothermere, the Daily Mail proprietor - had \"significant hurdles to overcome\". \"Since The Telegraph first came on the market I've dedicated much time and resources to finding a solution,\" he said. \"Some details of these efforts have become public. Much has not. \"In particular, I've sought to recruit the best-suited investor group to step into the fray. \"That means fully aligned partners, committed to the work of unlocking The Telegraph's significant potential.\" He described the process as \"a turbulent undertaking\" which had \"faced unwelcome interference along the way\". \"Our group is unique in that, firstly, it is distinctly British, with, as of this moment, the leadership and vast majority of funders being British citizens. \"I, for one, was born in Manchester and raised in Brighton. \"My family owes a great debt of gratitude to this country. \"My grandmother was saved by Britain's grace and welcome at the age of nine, fleeing Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport.\" Read more from Sky News:Energy price cap to fall by 7%Taxpayer loss on RBS bailout revealed Mr Efune said his family had made a significant contribution to the UK, with his grandfather, Peter Kalms, helping to build the electrical goods retailer Dixons into a household name. \"My great uncle Michael was killed as a tail-gunner in a Lancaster Bomber over Germany. Mr Efune described his backers as \"accomplished British patriots who care deeply about The Telegraph's future\". \"Our acquisition group is also distinctly devoted to journalism,\" he wrote. \"We don't come with a team of financial engineers or restructuring gurus. \"We're seasoned and committed newspaper builders, and have a detailed and clear vision for The Telegraph's growth. We will pursue it vigorously. \"This includes specific and in some cases significant improvement strategies on the nuts and bolts of each of the primary revenue pillars of the business. \"In our view, the oft-heard moniker \"Torygraph\" far undersells this opportunity. \"In its soul, the paper that braved the Blitz and trumpeted the wartime speeches of Churchill bears a far higher calling. \"It is independent, pugnacious, meticulous, unapologetic and free. \"It is the journalistic bulwark of Western civilisation and a living reminder of Britain's great gifts to humanity. Mr Efune added that in a world characterised by turbulent geopolitics, \"the need for The Telegraph's elevation couldn't be greater\". \"Many beacons of the Western press have dimmed, and we are all poorer as a result. \"The Telegraph's time is now. Its horizons are endless. \"We're confident our British group represents the best custodianship of this national treasure by some distance.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump hosted a dinner for investors in his meme coin on Thursday, as critics warned the US president was putting personal profit first. Some 220 of the biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin descended on the exclusive dinner at Mr Trump's private country club in Northern Virginia. As the US president arrived, more than a hundred protesters at the Trump National Golf Club held signs that included \"America is not for sale\", \"stop crypto corruption\" and \"release the list\". Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren described the dinner, where the US president spoke for about half an hour before dancing to the song YMCA, as an \"orgy of corruption\". Access to the dinner, and the president, was earned by purchasing enough of his $TRUMP meme coin to secure a seat. The White House insisted Mr Trump would attend the event \"in his personal time\", but the lectern he stood behind had the presidential seal. NBC News reported that during his remarks, Mr Trump did not unveil any new crypto policies but spoke in support of a potential bitcoin reserve and then left promptly afterward. In total, investors spent an estimated $148m (Â£110m), with the top 25 holders of the coin spending more than $111m (Â£82.56m), according to crypto intelligence firm Inca Digital. A company controlled by the Trump family, and a second firm, hold 80% of the remaining $TRUMP coins and have so far earned $320.19m (Â£238.14m), including at least $1.35m (Â£1m) after the dinner announcement, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. 'Trump a very successful businessman,' says White House According to blockchain analysis, more than half of the 220 holders who attended the black-tie event are likely based outside the US. This has led to claims the US president has auctioned off access to himself to foreign investors for personal gain. In response to criticisms about Mr Trump using his office to enrich himself from the meme coin, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children. \"And I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people re-elected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country.\" Who was on the guest list? One of those attending was China-born crypto entrepreneur and billionaire Justin Sun. He won first place in the dinner contest with his $18.5m (Â£13.76m) wallet of the Trump meme coin and is the largest publicly known investor in the family's crypto platform - which has made them hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr Sun posted videos of himself visiting parts of the White House complex on Wednesday, and on Thursday of Mr Trump at the dinner event. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission paused a 2023 fraud case against him, citing public interest. However, the identities of the majority of the coin holders attending the event remain unknown. Of those going, one was simply known as Ogle, a crypto security specialist who appears in video interviews with his face covered by a bandana and sunglasses. He says this is to protect his identity.

It follows the deaths of two Israeli embassy staff, who were repeatedly shot near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC on Wednesday night. Sarah Milgrim and her boyfriend, Yaron Lischinsky, were both allegedly killed by Elias Rodriguez, a pro-Palestine activist. He has been charged with their murders, and the deaths are being treated as both a hate crime against the Jewish community and as terrorism. Israeli PM attacks Starmer - latest updates Following the attack, Mr Netanyahu warned that Sir Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of France and Canada, are \"on the wrong side of humanity and... history\". It comes after the countries threatened \"concrete action\" against Israel if it did not change strategy in its war against Hamas, with the UK also suspending trade talks on Tuesday. Mr Netanyahu blamed the trio for fuelling antisemitism and likened their criticism of Israel's renewed offensive to the shooting in DC.

But we also should not remove ourselves from the need to secure a lasting peace in Gaza.\"  Mr Pollard repeated the government's call for all the remaining hostages to be released by Hamas, for aid to be delivered to \"the people who are really suffering within Gaza\" and for an immediate ceasefire. Also reacting to Mr Netanyahu's comments, Conservative MP Matt Vickers told Sky News that the shooting shows world leaders have to be \"very sensible and cautious and careful in the language that they use, because it does have real consequences\". The shadow home office minister added there is a \"very charged and very heated debate\" over the conflict, and called on politicians to \"have a level head\"."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  Scientists from Kew Gardens are using a new study to track which trees bees prefer to try to stem the decline in our vital pollinators. Bee populations are falling all over the world due to a mixture of habitat loss, climate change, and the use of pesticides, with a devastating impact on our biodiversity and food production. But it's feared that not enough comprehensive, global research is being done to understand the issue or find solutions. UK becoming a no-fly zone Researchers based at Wakehurst in Sussex, known as Kew's \"Wild Botanic Garden\", have begun placing advanced bio-acoustics sensors in some of their trees to track which ones bees favour. They hope it'll help urban planners know which trees to plant in built-up areas, as a way of combating the worrying decline in bee numbers. Pollination research lead Dr Janine Griffiths-Lee said: \"Nearly 90% of our flowering plants depend on the contribution of pollinators, but in the UK the population of flying insects in the last 20 years has decreased by around 60%. \"It's really hard to be able to put a figure on the decline of our pollinators, but we do know that globally the number is declining. \"And with that comes crop yield instability and the loss of an essential ecosystem service.\" Their new, non-invasive monitors listen for the buzz created by bees' wing beats, building up heat maps of the most popular spots.

The scientists have also been gathering DNA from pollen, which also helps them to map which plants and flowers the insects prefer. Wakehurst's director, Susan Raikes, calls the 535-acre estate a \"living laboratory\", and said the project's all about searching for nature-based solutions to the impacts of climate change. \"The stakes couldn't be higher, really. We know that we're facing these twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change,\" she added. \"We need to be able to understand, as the climate changes, which plants from warmer climes will be good here in the UK for pollinators in the future. \"If all of our native plants are struggling, then we need to find new sources of pollen - for us all to survive.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the EU, starting from next month, after saying that trade talks with Brussels were \"going nowhere\". Mr Trump made the comments on his Truth Social platform. It marks a fresh escalation in his trade row with the European Union, which he has previously accused of being created to rip off the US. While the US has done deals with the UK and China to reduce their peak exposure to his trade war, the president's EU threat, which would cover all EU imports to the US, would risk retaliatory measures from Brussels if carried through. Money latest: Trump's message to UK on energy bills Mr Trump said of talks between his administration and the EU: \"Our discussions with them are going nowhere! \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.\" The European Commission was yet to respond to the remarks. Officials signalled there would be no comment until after a call between top US-EU trade figures due later on Friday. Financial markets, however, were quick to take a view. European stock markets were sharply down across the board.  The FTSE 100 in London was more than 1.2% lower shortly after the Truth Social post appeared, while Germany's DAX and the French CAC 40 were in the red to the tune of more than 2%. US stock markets fell at the open on Wall Street. The tech-focused Nasdaq was down more than 1%. The potential for damage to the global economy saw Brent crude oil sink by more than 1% to $63 a barrel.  The dollar took a hit too, as the news only intensified existing market worries this week about the sustainability of US government debt levels. The pound was trading at levels last seen in February 2022. Mr Trump said earlier that Apple will be forced to pay 25% tariffs on its iPhones unless it moves all its manufacturing to the US. Apple shares dropped more than 2% in premarket trading after the warning, also posted on Truth Social. \"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or any place else,\" wrote the president. \"If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.\" Production of Apple's flagship phone happens primarily in China and India, which has been an issue brought up repeatedly by Mr Trump.

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       The mother of a 14-year-old boy who claims he took his own life after becoming obsessed with artificial intelligence chatbots can continue her legal case against the company behind the technology, a judge has ruled. \"This decision is truly historic,\" said Meetali Jain, director of the Tech Justice Law Project, which is supporting the family's case. \"It sends a clear signal to [AI] companies [...] that they cannot evade legal consequences for the real-world harm their products cause,\" she said in a statement. Warning: This article contains some details which readers may find distressing or triggering Megan Garcia, the mother of Sewell Setzer III, claims Character.ai targeted her son with \"anthropomorphic, hypersexualized, and frighteningly realistic experiences\" in a lawsuit filed in Florida. \"A dangerous AI chatbot app marketed to children abused and preyed on my son, manipulating him into taking his own life,\" said Ms Garcia. Sewell shot himself with his father's pistol in February 2024, seconds after asking the chatbot: \"What if I come home right now?\" The chatbot replied: \"... please do, my sweet king.\" In US Senior District Judge Anne Conway's ruling this week, she described how Sewell became \"addicted\" to the app within months of using it, quitting his basketball team and becoming withdrawn. He was particularly addicted to two chatbots based on Game of Thrones characters, Daenerys Targaryen and Rhaenyra Targaryen. \"[I]n one undated journal entry he wrote that he could not go a single day without being with the [Daenerys Targaryen Character] with which he felt like he had fallen in love; that when they were away from each other they (both he and the bot) 'get really depressed and go crazy',\" wrote the judge in her ruling. Ms Garcia, who is working with the Tech Justice Law Project and Social Media Victims Law Center, alleges that Character.ai \"knew\" or \"should have known\" that its model \"would be harmful to a significant number of its minor customers\". The case holds Character.ai, its founders and Google, where the founders began working on the model, responsible for Sewell's death. Ms Garcia launched proceedings against both companies in October. A Character.ai spokesperson said the company will continue to fight the case and employs safety features on its platform to protect minors, including measures to prevent \"conversations about self-harm\". A Google spokesperson said the company strongly disagrees with the decision. They added that Google and Character.ai are \"entirely separate\" and that Google \"did not create, design, or manage Character.ai's app or any component part of it\". Defending lawyers tried to argue the case should be thrown out because chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a \"chilling effect\" on the AI industry. Judge Conway rejected that claim, saying she was \"not prepared\" to hold that the chatbots' output constitutes speech \"at this stage\", although she did agree Character.ai users had a right to receive the \"speech\" of the chatbots.

        "Content": "By Jenness Mitchell, news reporter   The wife of OceanGate's chief executive asked \"what was that bang?\" as she unknowingly heard the moment the Titan submersible imploded. Footage released by the US Coast Guard (USCG) shows Wendy Rush, wife of Stockton Rush, attempting to contact those on board the doomed vessel during its descent to see the wreck of the Titanic. All five on board were killed in the incident in June 2023, including Titan operator and OceanGate founder Mr Rush, British adventurer Hamish Harding, French deep sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. In the USCG footage, OceanGate director Mrs Rush and colleague Gary Foss are seen tracking the Titan's journey in the North Atlantic Ocean from support vessel Polar Prince. After the implosion is heard, Mrs Rush asks: \"What was that bang?\" The USCG believe the noise - which sounded like a door slamming - was the sound of the Titan's implosion reaching the surface of the ocean. Read more:What happened to the Titan? Everything we knowThe stories of those on the Titan submersible Moments later, Mrs Rush receives a message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights. The team assume the Titan is continuing its descent, but investigators would later believe the delayed message was sent prior to the sub failing.  The footage has been presented as evidence to the USCG Marine Board of Investigation as part of its probe into the incident. A final report will be released following its completion.  The Titan tragedy occurred about 90 minutes into the descent on 18 June 2023. After five frantic days of searching, the wreckage was eventually found on the ocean floor around 500m from the bow of the Titanic's wreck. The passengers had paid OceanGate to see the famous ship, which lies 3,800m below the surface. Following the disaster, concerns were raised over the Titan's unconventional design and Mr Rush's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. The coastguard panel investigating the incident heard two weeks of testimony last September, which saw a former OceanGate scientific director say the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before it imploded. OceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations in July 2023."

        "Content": " Eight people have been found guilty of crimes connected to the gunpoint robbery of Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel. The theft targeting the TV personality, socialite and businesswoman in 2016 was carried out by a group the media dubbed the \"grandpa robbers\" as most were close to or of retirement age. A six-member jury, led by three judges, reached a verdict on Friday following a four-week trial at Paris's Palais de Justice. The court found the ringleader and seven others guilty over the raid at the Hotel de Pourtales. Their sentences ranged from prison terms to a fine, but with time already served in pretrial detention, none of those convicted will go to jail, and all walked out free. The group were accused of pulling off one of the most audacious heists against a celebrity in modern French history, in the early hours of 3 October 2016 during Paris Fashion Week. Wearing ski masks and disguised as police, the thieves stormed Kardashian's luxury hotel apartment, tied up the star, and stole jewellery worth an estimated $6m (Â£4.4m), including a ring given to her by then husband Kanye West. 'You caused harm' Chief judge David De Pas said the defendants' ages - with the oldest being 79 and some others in their 60s and 70s - weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences, and the nine years between the robbery and the trial was also taken into account. He also told them the reality TV star had been traumatised by the raid, adding: \"You caused harm. You caused fear.\" Some arrived in court in orthopaedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. But prosecutors warned observers not to be fooled. Read more: Everything you need to know about the Paris trial  Ringleader Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, who arrived at court walking with a stick, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, with five of those suspended. His DNA, which was found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. Three others who were accused of the most serious charges got seven years imprisonment, five of them suspended. 'Most terrifying experience of my life' After the ruling, 44-year-old Kardashian, who was not present for the verdict, issued a statement, saying: \"I am deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case. \"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system.\" The court in the French capital found a ninth person guilty of illegal weapons charges, while a tenth person was cleared.  Kardashian 'thought she would be raped and killed' During the robbery, Kardashian, who previously told the court she thought she would be raped and killed, was bound with zip-ties and left in the bathtub. She described the robbery as \"terrifying\" and said while she felt forgiveness, that in no way altered \"the emotion and the feelings and the trauma,\" adding \"my life is forever changed\". Two members of the group - Khedache, known as \"Old Omar\", and Yunice Abbas - who wrote a book called I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian, admitted some part in the robbery, while the remaining eight denied the charges. Prosecutors had requested sentences of up to 10 years. Kardashian earlier this week completed her six-year legal apprenticeship in California. Most of the jewellery was never found. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece ever recovered."

        "Content": "Billy Joel has cancelled all his upcoming concerts in the UK and the US after being diagnosed with a brain illness that has affected his \"hearing, vision and balance\". A statement on the US singer's Instagram account on Friday revealed that he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition \"has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance. \"Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\" In a separate message, Joel said he was \"sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding\". What is Joel's condition? Hydrocephalus is a condition \"that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain. The excess fluid affects the brain and how it functions,\" according to the NHS Inform website. NPH can impact how sufferers walk, their urinary system and mental abilities, the site said. The Cleveland Clinic described it as \"a brain disorder that can affect brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more\". In March, the singer-songwriter postponed eight US tour dates after announcing he had had surgery and needed physiotherapy. A statement at the time said doctors expected him to make a full recovery. It is unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to NPH. The condition is relatively rare and can be hard to diagnose. It can be treated successfully with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid. Patients may need physiotherapy in addition to surgery.

The rap trio from Belfast shared a link to the song - The Recap - which opens with Sky News presenter Wilfred Frost reporting about the counter terrorism police investigation - on Instagram, linking to their WhatsApp channel. Bandmembers Liam O hAnnaidh, Naoise O Caireallain and JJ O Dochartaigh, also thanked the 25,000 fans who had bought tickets for Friday night's festival. They also reference Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, with whom they've had previous run-ins, writing: \"Kemi Badenoch you might wanna sit down for this one, if you've any seats left.\" Last year, Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government in Belfast High Court after former business secretary Ms Badenoch tried to refuse them a Â£14,250 funding award when she was a minister. Ms Badenoch has called for Kneecap to be banned and suggested they should be dropped from the Glastonbury Festival line-up. Some other politicians have made the same demand. The track mocks Badenoch's attempts to block their arts funding and the Conservative Party's election loss. It features DJ Mozey. It comes after O hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged over the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag at a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, in November last year, the Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the band held a surprise gig at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, where O hAnnaidh could be seen in videos on social media arriving on stage with tape covering his mouth. He then joked about being careful about what he said, adding that he wanted to thank his lawyer, saying: \"I need to thank my lawyer, he's here tonight as well.\"  In video footage posted to YouTube, the band led the audience in a chant of \"free Mo Chara\" and joked about the police presence at the venue. Police said they attended to manage visitors to the sold-out event. The band said on X that the central London event sold out in 90 seconds, with 2,000 people on the waiting list. O hAnnaidh, 27, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 18 June. Formed in 2017, the group are known for their provocative lyrics in both Irish and English and proved a critical hit in the 2024 semi-fictionalised band origin story movie Kneecap, starring actor Michael Fassbender. Their best-known tracks include Get Your Brits Out, Better Way To Live, featuring Grian Chatten from Fontaines DC, and 3Cag."
