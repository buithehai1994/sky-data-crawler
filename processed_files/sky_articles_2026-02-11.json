        "Content": "The prime minister has condemned Sir Jim Ratcliffe's \"offensive and wrong\" remarks about immigration. The Manchester United co-owner, one of Britain's richest men but a resident of tax-free Monaco, told Sky News that Britain had been \"colonised\" by immigrants who are draining resources from the state. \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. \"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\" In a post on X responding to the interview, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Offensive and wrong. Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country. Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\" Sir Jim, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, also claimed to Sky's economics and data editor Ed Conway immigration had pushed the country's population from 58 million in 2020 to 70 million in 2026. \n                  Sir Jim Ratcliffe's immigration outburst risks antagonising those inside and out of Man Utd\n                 \n                  'UK has been colonised by immigrants', says INEOS boss and Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\n                 \n                  Man Utd and chemicals boss warns of 'moment of reckoning' for his industry\n                 The Office for National Statistics estimates the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. It was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000. Sir Jim said the government needed a leader \"prepared to be unpopular for a period\" to address Britain's issues, suggesting Sir Keir, while \"a nice man\", might not be the right man for the top job. He said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, describing him as \"intelligent\" with \"good intentions\". The Reform UK leader later backed his remarks about immigration, telling Sky News: \"The country has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in the country. \"Labour may try and ignore that but Reform won't.\" Read more from Sky News:Dawson's Creek star diesPolice and prosecutors hold talks on Andrew Speaking before Sir Keir's intervention, Sports Secretary Lisa Nandy told Matt Barbet on Sky's Politics Hub that immigration had been too high, especially under Boris Johnson's government. But she said the government was investing in more opportunities for British youngsters, and declared: \"My dad comes from an immigrant background. I want your viewers to know that I am really proud that Britain is a diverse and tolerant country that is strengthened by waves of immigration.\" 'Disgraceful and divisive' The prime minister's criticism has been widely echoed by football and anti-racism groups. The Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club accused Sir Jim of risking \"legitimising prejudice and deepening division\", saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by his rhetoric. \"The term 'colonised' is not neutral. It echoes language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats,\" said a statement. \"Such rhetoric has real-world consequences,\" it added, and pointed out United has \"players, staff and supporters from every background, faith, and ethnicity\". Sports correspondent Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become increasingly divisive with his actions and rhetoric as the face and voice of Manchester United's leadership. The INEOS billionaire's outburst on immigration risks further antagonising those inside and outside the club. The men's squad alone relies on overseas talent, featuring more than a dozen different nationalities. And then there's the staff - many with global heritage - who keep the club running on a daily or temporary basis from the training ground to Old Trafford. Sir Jim's view of foreign people coming to Britain collides with the ideals promoted by United and the Premier League. Read Rob's full analysis here Football's anti-discrimination body Kick It Out labelled Sir Jim's comments \"disgraceful and deeply divisive at a time when football does so much to bring communities together\". Its damning statement added: \"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.\" Charity Show Racism the Red Card also said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the remarks, and said public figures should use their platform to \"challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony\"."

        "Content": "Police and prosecutors have held talks over allegations that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaked confidential reports to Jeffrey Epstein. Documents in the latest release of the Epstein files appeared to suggest the former prince and Duke of York shared government information with the deceased sex offender when he was the UK's trade envoy. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In a statement on Friday, Thames Valley Police said it has spoken with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) about allegations of misconduct in public office. Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: \"As part of this assessment, we have engaged in discussions with specialist crown prosecutors from the CPS.\" Follow latest updates on the Epstein files He added that at this phase, information is evaluated to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is needed. \n                  The Irishman detained by ICE\n                 \n                  Majority of people think the King should encourage Andrew to testify about Epstein – poll\n                 \n                  Congress turns on the King\n                 Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, also said that the CPS is in \"close contact\" with both Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police, \"but we haven't been asked to give formal advice yet\". He added: \"In complex and sensitive cases, the CPS and the police do work together, and I'm sure in the investigation that's been announced, we will do so. \"The position now is we have made contact and we won't be giving step-by-step updates about the investigation.\" When asked about the common law offence of misconduct in a public office, Mr Parkinson said that \"the law is quite clear\". \"I don't think it would be difficult to give advice on that,\" he added. \"As always, the issue when giving advice on criminal cases is about the application of the law.\" Read more from Sky News:Man Utd co-owner makes claim about immigrants in UKOat-based products cannot be sold as 'milk', court rules It comes after Buckingham Palace said it would support the police if contacted over the allegations about Andrew earlier this week.

Meanwhile, on Friday, US attorney general Pam Bondi testified to the US Congress about the release of the Epstein files, and was asked by a Democrat why she has \"not prosecuted former prince Andrew\". Ms Bondi responded to Ted Lieu, Democratic representative for California's 36th district, by asking why he did not ask the former attorney general under Joe Biden the same questions. He said he did ask before accusing her of failing to hold anyone accountable, adding \"shame on you\"."

        "Headline": "The shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia marks one of the deadliest mass casualty events in Canada's recent history.",
        "Content": "Eight people have been killed in one of Canada's deadliest mass shootings, which also left the attacker dead. Police have now shared more details about the shooting in Tumbler Ridge, a small town with a population of just 2,400, in British Columbia on Tuesday. Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the suspect? The attacker has been identified by police as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said at a news conference on Wednesday. He said the suspect, from Tumbler Ridge, identified as female but was born a biological male, and began to transition around six years ago. The suspect was found at the scene with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The deputy commissioner added that Van Rootselaar was not currently attending Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and had dropped out about four years ago. \"Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,\" Mr McDonald added. A public alert sent to phones initially described the shooter as \"a female in a dress with brown hair\". Police superintendent Ken Floyd earlier said the suspect's motive remained unclear and that authorities are \"not in a place to understand why or what may have motivated this tragedy\". Suspect's mother among those killed Police said they received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, which has around 175 students, at 1.20pm on Tuesday (8.20pm UK time). When officers entered and searched the school, they found multiple victims dead. An individual believed to be the attacker was also found dead with what appeared to be a self‑inflicted injury. At the school, police said those killed were a 39-year-old female teacher, three 12-year-old female students, and two male students aged 12 and 13. They said two further victims, a 39-year-old female and an 11-year-old male, were found at a local home. When questioned by reporters, police said the 39-year-old was the mother of the suspect, with the 11-year-old thought to be their brother or step-brother. The attacker's family members were killed first, before the school shootings. Initial reports claimed another victim died while on the way to hospital, but Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said that \"a female with significant injuries\" survived the shooting. Overnight, police said approximately 25 others were being assessed for non‑life‑threatening injuries. Children 'barricaded themselves' as parents waited for news Children who were at the school at the time were frantically trying to barricade themselves in their classrooms as the attack unfolded, according to local reports. Citing the reports, Sky News' international correspondent John Sparks said: \"They were putting desks and chairs up against the doors, trying to keep the shooter out of their classroom.\" There were also \"desperate scenes\" in the town of Tumbler Ridge during the attack, Sparks added. \"Parents were shepherded to a local hall to await news of whether their children were affected by this. \"In a tight-knit community like this, it's very difficult for the people who live there.\" 'I probably know every victim' Canadians in the small town, located more than 600 miles north of Vancouver, near the border with Alberta, are grieving after the tragedy. Darryl Krakowka, mayor of Tumbler Ridge, told reporters: \"I broke down. It's devastating.\" He described the town's small community as a \"big family\" and added: \"I have lived here for 18 years. I probably know every one of the victims.\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered his \"prayers and deepest condolences\" to the families and friends of the victims after the \"horrific\" attack. \"I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Our ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country - our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other.\" The premier of British Columbia, David Eby, added: \"Our hearts are in Tumbler Ridge tonight with the families of those who have lost loved ones. \"Government will ensure every possible support for community members in the coming days, as we all try to come to terms with this unimaginable tragedy.\" The school has said it will be closed for the rest of the week. What are the gun laws in Canada? While its neighbour has some of the most relaxed firearms legislation in the world, Canadian laws are much stricter. Anyone wanting to possess a firearm in Canada needs to obtain a possession and acquisition licence (PAL). Some types of firearm - such as handguns - need a restricted possession and acquisition licence (RPAL), which is issued by police. In 2022, the government introduced a freeze on the importing, buying or selling of handguns. A previous mass shooting in Nova Scotia in April 2020, in which an attacker killed 22 people, prompted the government to announce an immediate ban on the sale and use of assault-style weapons. Justin Trudeau, then the prime minister, announced the ban of more than 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, including two guns used by the 2020 gunman as well as the AR-15 and other weapons that have been used in a number of mass shootings in the US. But almost six years later, possession of such firearms is not illegal - yet. A compensation programme in which gun owners register their interest in turning in these firearms in exchange for cash runs until the end of March this year. Owners have until the end of October to hand over any banned assault weapons. After this, anyone in possession \"will be breaking the law and could face criminal prosecution\", government briefing documents say. It has not yet been made public what type of firearm or firearms were used in the most recent attack."

Austin Appelbee, his mother, brother and sister, from Perth, were on an inflatable kayak and paddleboards when they got into difficulty off the west coast of Western Australia. Mum Joanne Appelbee, 47, asked her son to swim around 4km (2.5miles) to shore - where he then ran 2km to find a phone he could use to call the emergency services. With Ms Appelbee's permission, the Western Australia Police Force has released the audio of Austin's call, on which he can be heard calmly explaining the life-threatening situation. \"Hello, my name is Austin and I'm outside [the] beach,\" he says, before explaining that he has two siblings, brother Beau, aged 12, and sister Grace, eight. \"We went out on a kayak trip and a paddleboard trip, and we got took out to sea and we got lost out there,\" he continues. \"We got lost around about, I don't know what time it was, but it was a very long time ago. You know, we couldn't get back to shore and mum told me to go back and get help, and then I haven't seen them since.\" Austin then suggests: \"I think we need a helicopter to go find them.\" \"I'm sitting on the beach right now, and I have to explain, I think I need an ambulance because I think I have hypothermia,\" he adds. When the emergency services operator checks that they have the correct information, Austin admits being \"really scared\" and explains: \"I had a kayak, and then I had a bunch of water in it. \"It started to sink and I kept on, like, falling off it. So I decided to ditch the kayak and I decided to take off my life jacket, and I had to swim around about four kilometres facing the current. \"And like I'm really, I'm extremely tired. I think I have heatstroke and I feel like I'm about to pass out. I'm very dizzy.\" After Austin's call, a multi-agency search and rescue response was coordinated and his family members were located clinging to a paddleboard at about 8.30pm local time - 10 hours after they had entered the water. They were then safely brought back to shore by a volunteer marine rescue vessel.

        "Content": "Strictly Come Dancing star Robin Windsor left a note saying the way he was treated when he was dropped from the show \"destroyed me\", an inquest has heard. The professional dancer was 44 when he was found dead in a hotel room in Shepherd's Bush, west London, in February 2024. Police found a note left in the room in which he said he had been \"fighting it\" since losing his job on the show, coroner Dr Anton van Dellen told jurors at West London Coroner's Court on Wednesday. Windsor joined Strictly in 2010 and danced with actresses Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Lisa Riley, as well as Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, in four series until 2013. He could not perform in the 2014 series because of a back injury and was dropped in 2015, though still danced with TV presenter Alison Hammond in the Christmas special that year. In a written statement read to the court earlier, Emmerdale actress Riley said Windsor's \"glow had gone\" after he was cut from the professional dancers' line-up. \"It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression,\" she said. Riley said Windsor told her about times of \"never feeling good enough\" and \"imposter syndrome\". \"One night he opened up, telling me of the horrific time he was molested by an old dance tutor and [he] felt his parents never really understood this,\" she said. \"Robin was and always has been very influenced by other men. It became a standing joke that he fell in love after three days.\" Read more from Sky News:'UK has been colonised by immigrants', says Sir Jim RatcliffeDad unlawfully killed British daughter after Trump row She said Windsor was insecure about his body and took steroids, which could put him in a bad place when combined with alcohol, adding he was \"drowning in debts\" and \"frantically\" spent money on designer items he could not afford. \"Money problems also played a part of his darker days,\" she said. \"He was drowning in debts which led to weekends I wouldn't hear from him.\" Summing up the evidence, coroner Dr van Dellen read parts of a written statement by Windsor's ex-boyfriend, X Factor star Marcus Collins, who said Windsor's mental health deteriorated when he was released from his Strictly contract. \"The day that he was informed that he was no longer required for Strictly really broke his spirit,\" Collins said. \"Robin's mental health was challenged almost constantly from this point and at times it altered his personality.\" After being approached by Sky News, a BBC spokesperson said: \"We wouldn't comment on an ongoing inquiry.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "A 13-year-old boy suspected of stabbing two boys at a secondary school is a former pupil, police have confirmed. He was arrested after being seen at a mosque, they added. Police believe the attack began when the teenager, a British national, went into a first floor classroom at Kingsbury High School, in Brent, north-west London, and sprayed a substance towards a pupil who was not injured. Chief Superintendent Helen Flanagan told reporters: \"The suspect has then attacked another pupil, a 13-year-old in that classroom, stabbing him, and then the suspect has left, running down the hallway of the school. \"As he is leaving, he then attacked another victim, a 12-year-old, stabbing him before running off and away from the school.\" Two boys, aged 12 and 13, were taken to hospital in a serious condition after the incident, which unfolded at lunchtime on Tuesday. Counter-terror police have been leading the investigation into the attack but Ch Supt Flanagan said it has not been declared a terrorist incident. She added that officers do not believe the suspect has \"any particular connection\" to the mosque. \"Police were called by a member of the public at approximately 4.50pm over concerns of a child that had been seen at a mosque in north west London,\" she said. \"Officers attended shortly after and arrested a 13-year-old boy on suspicion of attempted murder, and he remains in custody. \"At this stage, we think that it may have been coincidental that he ended up in that area, and all of those at the mosque have been incredibly supportive of this investigation.\" Officers are understood to be leaning towards a personal grievance being the motivation, rather than terrorist ideology. Searches have been carried out at two addresses connected to the suspect and the mosque where he was arrested. Police are also speaking to around 30 to 40 witnesses. In a letter to parents, the school's head teacher said it was a \"deeply traumatic event for the whole school community\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood described the attack as \"shocking\"."

        "Content": "Sex offenders could be recalled to prison if they fail to report a pregnancy in their relationship, under changes recommended by a national safeguarding review. The review followed the high-profile case of baby Victoria, who died at the hands of her aristocrat mother Constance Marten and her father Mark Gordon. Marten, 38, and her convicted rapist partner Gordon, 51, went on the run with their daughter to get away from social services after their four other children were taken into care. Victoria's body was later found inside a shopping bag. Marten and Gordon have been jailed for a total of 28 years after they were convicted of killing their baby. Read more:How runaway couple killed their babyMarten tells court 'we did everything we could' The review, published by the national Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel, said the baby girl's birth \"was the last within her family of a rapid series of pregnancies, births, and removals into care that by the time she was conceived had become a repeating pattern with devastating consequences\". It said that, given the family history, professionals around them \"needed to contemplate the prospect of Victoria being conceived and born well in advance, to have a better chance of engaging more productively with her parents\". In 1989, British national Gordon was jailed in the US for raping a woman in Florida when he was 14. The review said when he was deported back to the UK, he was not required to share details about new partners or pregnancy. At least three of the pregnancies during his relationship with Marten were concealed or disclosed late, which the review said limited \"safeguarding opportunities\". 'I was given ultimatums' Asked by the review how contact with child safeguarding agencies made her feel, Marten said: \"I was given ultimatums, rather than true assistance. \"It felt like they were using the powers of the state coercively rather than constructively. \"It felt, in a way, that there was a flow chart which would ultimately result in the removal of my children, step by step. \"My mistrust of social services is not an innate feature of my personality, it developed due to my dealings with them.\" 'Hard to hear' The report called for better support for parents of children who are taken into care to prevent harm to any babies they might have in the future. Panel chairman Sir David Holmes said while it might be \"hard to hear and harder still to action\", a lesson from the case is that a focus must be kept on support for parents in cases of child removal \"however hard to understand they may be\". The review noted the couple's \"persistent reluctance to engage\" with authorities, having moved five times during their five pregnancies between 2017 and 2023, \"with each move coinciding with escalating safeguarding concerns\"."

        "Content": "A 23-year-old British woman who was shot dead by her father while visiting him at his home in the US was unlawfully killed, an inquest has concluded. Lucy Harrison, a fashion buyer from Warrington, Cheshire, was staying with her father, Kris Harrison, and his family at their home in Prosper, Texas, in January last year. Mr Harrison, described to the court as a functioning alcoholic, claimed the gun had gone off accidentally in the incident, shortly before 3pm. Concluding the inquest into Ms Harrison's death on Wednesday, senior coroner Jacqueline Devonish said she found the father's actions \"to be reckless\". She said that \"to shoot [his daughter] through the chest whilst she was standing would have required him to have been pointing the gun at his daughter, without checking for bullets, and pulling the trigger\". The coroner found Ms Harrison died due to unlawful killing on the grounds of gross negligence manslaughter, adding that the 23-year-old was \"young, vibrant and beautiful with her whole life ahead of her and this is a most tragic death\". Ms Harrison's boyfriend, Sam Littler, who was on the trip to the US with her, previously told Cheshire Coroner's Court that she would often become upset with her father when he spoke about his gun ownership. \n                  Warrington hospital's home birth service played 'Russian roulette' with lives, grieving father says\n                 \n                  Attempted murderer who escaped from 23 year prison sentence is recaptured\n                 \n                  Fake nurse, 46, who fraudulently pocketed more than £170,000 jailed\n                 He said that Ms Harrison and her father argued about Donald Trump on the morning of 10 January 2025, when the couple were due to fly home. About half an hour before they were expected to leave for the airport, Mr Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her from the kitchen to his ground-floor bedroom, where he kept a Glock semi-automatic handgun in his bedside cabinet. He said he heard a loud bang some 15 seconds later, before Mr Harrison started screaming for his wife, Heather. Mr Littler said: \"I remember running into the room and Lucy was lying on the floor near the entrance to the bathroom and Kris was just screaming, just sort of nonsense.\" Mr Harrison did not attend the two-day inquest hearing, but said in a statement that he had bought the gun to give his family a \"sense of security\". As it was for home defence, Texas laws meant he did not need a licence. Verdict gives 'Luce her voice back', says mum Speaking outside the court in Warrington, Ms Harrison's mother Jane Coates said that the outcome \"has finally given Luce her voice back, after what has been an unrelenting year of deep shock, grief and fight\". She said her daughter was \"failed\" by Texan gun laws and decisions made by the police department in Prosper. \"Although we are satisfied with the coroner's conclusion,\" Ms Coates added, \"there is much to be learnt from Lucy's needless and entirely avoidable death.\" The inquest heard a grand jury in the US determined there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone in connection with Ms Harrison's death. It was also told that Mr Harrison had previously been to rehab for alcohol addiction. His representative, Ana Samuel, said the hearing was \"more akin to a criminal investigation than a fact-finding inquiry\".

Lucy's spirit - her warmth, her humour, her kindness - will live on in all of us who loved her.\""

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants, who are draining resources from the state, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of the country's richest and most influential men, has told Sky News. Sir Jim, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group and part-owner of Manchester United, warned that Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years. \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. \"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000. Sir Keir Starmer responded to Sir Jim's remarks on immigration, saying they were \"offensive and wrong\". \"Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country,\" the prime minister added. \"Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\" In his interview with Sky News, Sir Jim - who is a resident of Monaco - signalled that Sir Keir might not be the right man for the top job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or, or he's maybe too nice - I mean, Keir is a nice man. I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\" The chemicals boss said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, saying of him: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man, and, I think he's got good intentions. But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\" Referring to his role at Manchester United, Sir Jim added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\" Read more:How much does the UK rely on legal migration?Britain's immigration system changes explained amid shake-up Sir Jim continued: \"Well, I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off. \"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\" Sports correspondent Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become increasingly divisive with his actions and rhetoric as the face and voice of Manchester United's leadership. The INEOS billionaire's outburst on immigration risks further antagonising those inside and outside the club. The men's squad alone relies on overseas talent, featuring more than a dozen different nationalities.\n And then there's the staff - many with global heritage - who keep the club running on a daily or temporary basis from the training ground to Old Trafford. Sir Jim's view of foreign people coming to Britain collides with the ideals promoted by United and the Premier League. Read Rob's full analysis here Sir Jim was talking on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, at which leaders from many of Europe's biggest economies, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz, are meeting with industrialists to discuss the fate of its economy. The summit comes amid a spate of closures across the European chemicals sector, closures that indicate, in the INEOS founder's view, that the European chemicals sector is facing \"unsurvivable conditions\". Reacting to Sir Jim's comments to Sky News, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told Sky's Matt Barbet on the Politics Hub that migration - both legal and illegal - was too high under the Conservatives, and that people want to see those arriving \"making a contribution\" and \"not doing that at the expense\" of a government that isn't investing in young people. But she continued: \"My dad comes from an immigrant background. I want your viewers to know that I am really proud that Britain is a diverse and tolerant country that is strengthened by waves of immigration.\" She added: \"I'd be more than happy to speak to him about what we're doing.\""

Branding Sir Jim \"disgraceful\", Kick It Out said in a statement to Sky News: \"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football.\" How will Sir Jim's allies react? Especially Gary Neville, based on what he said in 2019. The former United player said racism was being fuelled by then-prime minister Boris Johnson's inflammatory language on limiting migration. Neville now advises Sir Jim on new stadium plans. A minority stake was sold in 2024 by the majority owners, the Glazers, to tap into Sir Jim's expertise and improve the running of the business and bring the biggest trophies back to Old Trafford.

Rushing through the narrow streets of the Old Town of Al Ula in Saudi Arabia, our guides eventually helped us catch up with him. They had changed where he was due to arrive, after his lunch had run over. It was all fairly frantic, but for his aides, now tasked with getting him to his plane on time to head home, this was nothing like the other challenges they had faced. This has felt like a week where the royal family have really seen what they are up against when it comes to the Andrew and Epstein scandal. The noise has been never-ending with shouts at both the prince and the King, and more documents being uncovered. Follow latest updates on the Epstein files There had been hopes that the Prince of Wales' trip to Saudi Arabia, a significant diplomatic visit, might have been enough to shift some of the attention. With all the pictures of William with kids and women, there could not have been more effort made to sell this as a trip all about the future, projecting a positive image of Saudi Arabia and the work of the British royal family. The visit, of course, was always going to be a political tightrope for him, with questions over human rights here, despite significant social charges. But nothing could stop the runaway scandal of the Epstein files from being the bigger problem. Read more: Tour of Saudi Arabia ends with nature reserve visit The demand to hear from the royals has been enormous. But the calls for them to tell us more risk overshadowing how huge it was to get those statements earlier in the week from both William and Kate and Buckingham Palace. I have done this job long enough to know there must have been tense conversations before they got the final sign-off for release. They knew they would be blowing the story up again, but doing nothing was not an option. For them, the problem is that people still want more. We expect to see our leaders on camera, to see them visibly taking control and being accountable. There is no doubt that in recent years there has been a change in what the family are prepared to open up about on camera, remember for example the videos released about the King and Kate's cancer, but it's always on their own terms. And from what we have had so far, I'm not sure on this one; they're going to bow to public pressure to talk, despite some saying silence only exacerbates the huge reputational risks. For 15 years, this has been hanging over them, first the Queen, now Andrew's brother, the King, undoubtedly going so much further than their mother ever did. The \"maximalist approach\", as they describe it, stripping him of his titles and Windsor home. And this week, in written words, we have seen greater efforts to distance themselves from Andrew, partly, I suspect, out of a concern about what else may come, despite his constant denials of any wrongdoing. Whether you agree or not, for now, they do not feel like they have more questions to answer. Yes, there are pictures and emails that strongly suggest Epstein spent time at palaces and royal properties. In the end, Andrew maintained that contact, not the wider family or the institution."

        "Content": "A 13-year-old boy suspected of stabbing two boys at a secondary school is a former pupil, police have confirmed. He was arrested after being seen at a mosque, they added. Police believe the attack began when the teenager, a British national, went into a first floor classroom at Kingsbury High School, in Brent, north-west London, and sprayed a substance towards a pupil who was not injured. Chief Superintendent Helen Flanagan told reporters: \"The suspect has then attacked another pupil, a 13-year-old in that classroom, stabbing him, and then the suspect has left, running down the hallway of the school. \"As he is leaving, he then attacked another victim, a 12-year-old, stabbing him before running off and away from the school.\" Two boys, aged 12 and 13, were taken to hospital in a serious condition after the incident, which unfolded at lunchtime on Tuesday. Counter-terror police have been leading the investigation into the attack but Ch Supt Flanagan said it has not been declared a terrorist incident. She added that officers do not believe the suspect has \"any particular connection\" to the mosque. \"Police were called by a member of the public at approximately 4.50pm over concerns of a child that had been seen at a mosque in north west London,\" she said. \"Officers attended shortly after and arrested a 13-year-old boy on suspicion of attempted murder, and he remains in custody. \"At this stage, we think that it may have been coincidental that he ended up in that area, and all of those at the mosque have been incredibly supportive of this investigation.\" Officers are understood to be leaning towards a personal grievance being the motivation, rather than terrorist ideology. Searches have been carried out at two addresses connected to the suspect and the mosque where he was arrested. Police are also speaking to around 30 to 40 witnesses. In a letter to parents, the school's head teacher said it was a \"deeply traumatic event for the whole school community\". Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood described the attack as \"shocking\"."

Documents in the latest release of the Epstein files appeared to suggest the former prince and Duke of York shared government information with the deceased sex offender when he was the UK's trade envoy. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In a statement on Friday, Thames Valley Police said it has spoken with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) about allegations of misconduct in public office. Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: \"As part of this assessment, we have engaged in discussions with specialist crown prosecutors from the CPS.\" Follow latest updates on the Epstein files He added that at this phase, information is evaluated to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is needed. \n                  The Irishman detained by ICE\n                 \n                  Majority of people think the King should encourage Andrew to testify about Epstein – poll\n                 \n                  Congress turns on the King\n                 Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, also said that the CPS is in \"close contact\" with both Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police, \"but we haven't been asked to give formal advice yet\". He added: \"In complex and sensitive cases, the CPS and the police do work together, and I'm sure in the investigation that's been announced, we will do so. \"The position now is we have made contact and we won't be giving step-by-step updates about the investigation.\" When asked about the common law offence of misconduct in a public office, Mr Parkinson said that \"the law is quite clear\". \"I don't think it would be difficult to give advice on that,\" he added. \"As always, the issue when giving advice on criminal cases is about the application of the law.\" Read more from Sky News:Man Utd co-owner makes claim about immigrants in UKOat-based products cannot be sold as 'milk', court rules It comes after Buckingham Palace said it would support the police if contacted over the allegations about Andrew earlier this week. The palace also said the King had \"made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern\" over the claims about his brother. Meanwhile, on Friday, US attorney general Pam Bondi testified to the US Congress about the release of the Epstein files, and was asked by a Democrat why she has \"not prosecuted former prince Andrew\". Ms Bondi responded to Ted Lieu, Democratic representative for California's 36th district, by asking why he did not ask the former attorney general under Joe Biden the same questions. He said he did ask before accusing her of failing to hold anyone accountable, adding \"shame on you\"."

        "Content": "Sex offenders could be recalled to prison if they fail to report a pregnancy in their relationship, under changes recommended by a national safeguarding review. The review followed the high-profile case of baby Victoria, who died at the hands of her aristocrat mother Constance Marten and her father Mark Gordon. Marten, 38, and her convicted rapist partner Gordon, 51, went on the run with their daughter to get away from social services after their four other children were taken into care. Victoria's body was later found inside a shopping bag. Marten and Gordon have been jailed for a total of 28 years after they were convicted of killing their baby. Read more:How runaway couple killed their babyMarten tells court 'we did everything we could' The review, published by the national Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel, said the baby girl's birth \"was the last within her family of a rapid series of pregnancies, births, and removals into care that by the time she was conceived had become a repeating pattern with devastating consequences\". It said that, given the family history, professionals around them \"needed to contemplate the prospect of Victoria being conceived and born well in advance, to have a better chance of engaging more productively with her parents\". In 1989, British national Gordon was jailed in the US for raping a woman in Florida when he was 14. The review said when he was deported back to the UK, he was not required to share details about new partners or pregnancy. At least three of the pregnancies during his relationship with Marten were concealed or disclosed late, which the review said limited \"safeguarding opportunities\". 'I was given ultimatums' Asked by the review how contact with child safeguarding agencies made her feel, Marten said: \"I was given ultimatums, rather than true assistance. \"It felt like they were using the powers of the state coercively rather than constructively. \"It felt, in a way, that there was a flow chart which would ultimately result in the removal of my children, step by step. \"My mistrust of social services is not an innate feature of my personality, it developed due to my dealings with them.\" 'Hard to hear' The report called for better support for parents of children who are taken into care to prevent harm to any babies they might have in the future. Panel chairman Sir David Holmes said while it might be \"hard to hear and harder still to action\", a lesson from the case is that a focus must be kept on support for parents in cases of child removal \"however hard to understand they may be\". The review noted the couple's \"persistent reluctance to engage\" with authorities, having moved five times during their five pregnancies between 2017 and 2023, \"with each move coinciding with escalating safeguarding concerns\"."

Cambridge United fan Simon Dobbin was attacked after watching his team play Southend United in Southend, Essex, on 21 March 2015. Violence broke out outside the Railway Tavern pub in Southend in March 2015.

Essex Police said on Wednesday that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had authorised manslaughter charges against 12 men. The CPS said they were: Greg Allen, 37, of of Westcliff-on-Sea; Ryan Carter, 40, of HMP The Mount; Jamie Chambers, 33, of Southend-on-Sea; Lewis Courtnell, 43, of Leigh-on-Sea; Philip McGill, 40, of Westcliff-on-Sea; Scott Nicholls, 49, of Basildon; Matthew Petchey, 35, of Rochford; Rhys Pullen, 29, of Maldon; Thomas Randall, 31, of Leigh-on-Sea; Michael Shawyer, 40, of Leigh-on-Sea; Alexander Woods, 33, of Westcliff-on-Sea; and James Woods, 33, of Westcliff-on-Sea. Rebecca Mundy, deputy chief crown prosecutor, confirmed the charges and said: \"Prosecutors in our Complex Casework Unit have worked closely with Essex Police to examine and review the material obtained from their investigations from both the incident itself and following the death of Mr Dobbin. \"We have established that there is sufficient evidence to charge 12 people with the offence of manslaughter and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings.\" Read more from Sky News:Woman who cut her girlfriend in half jailed for lifeCold weather health alert issued - as Met Office warns of snow Detective Superintendent Stephen Jennings of Essex Police said: \"This is a significant milestone in an extremely complex investigation, and comes as the result of the professionalism, dedication and hard work from a team of highly skilled officers and staff. \"Investigations such as these are challenging and can take time, it has required hundreds of hours of painstaking work to get to this stage.\" He added: \"Simon's case is one that has evoked a great deal of emotion but I would ask people to be mindful about commentary to ensure those charged are able to have a fair trial. \"I want to thank Simon's family - his wife Nicole and daughter Emily - for their patience and unwavering support for our team.\" The men are due to appear before Colchester Magistrates' Court on 31 March."

        "Content": "A 23-year-old British woman who was shot dead by her father while visiting him at his home in the US was unlawfully killed, an inquest has concluded. Lucy Harrison, a fashion buyer from Warrington, Cheshire, was staying with her father, Kris Harrison, and his family at their home in Prosper, Texas, in January last year. Mr Harrison, described to the court as a functioning alcoholic, claimed the gun had gone off accidentally in the incident, shortly before 3pm. Concluding the inquest into Ms Harrison's death on Wednesday, senior coroner Jacqueline Devonish said she found the father's actions \"to be reckless\". She said that \"to shoot [his daughter] through the chest whilst she was standing would have required him to have been pointing the gun at his daughter, without checking for bullets, and pulling the trigger\". The coroner found Ms Harrison died due to unlawful killing on the grounds of gross negligence manslaughter, adding that the 23-year-old was \"young, vibrant and beautiful with her whole life ahead of her and this is a most tragic death\". Ms Harrison's boyfriend, Sam Littler, who was on the trip to the US with her, previously told Cheshire Coroner's Court that she would often become upset with her father when he spoke about his gun ownership. \n                  Warrington hospital's home birth service played 'Russian roulette' with lives, grieving father says\n                 \n                  Attempted murderer who escaped from 23 year prison sentence is recaptured\n                 \n                  Fake nurse, 46, who fraudulently pocketed more than £170,000 jailed\n                 He said that Ms Harrison and her father argued about Donald Trump on the morning of 10 January 2025, when the couple were due to fly home. About half an hour before they were expected to leave for the airport, Mr Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her from the kitchen to his ground-floor bedroom, where he kept a Glock semi-automatic handgun in his bedside cabinet. He said he heard a loud bang some 15 seconds later, before Mr Harrison started screaming for his wife, Heather. Mr Littler said: \"I remember running into the room and Lucy was lying on the floor near the entrance to the bathroom and Kris was just screaming, just sort of nonsense.\" Mr Harrison did not attend the two-day inquest hearing, but said in a statement that he had bought the gun to give his family a \"sense of security\". As it was for home defence, Texas laws meant he did not need a licence. Verdict gives 'Luce her voice back', says mum Speaking outside the court in Warrington, Ms Harrison's mother Jane Coates said that the outcome \"has finally given Luce her voice back, after what has been an unrelenting year of deep shock, grief and fight\". She said her daughter was \"failed\" by Texan gun laws and decisions made by the police department in Prosper. \"Although we are satisfied with the coroner's conclusion,\" Ms Coates added, \"there is much to be learnt from Lucy's needless and entirely avoidable death.\" The inquest heard a grand jury in the US determined there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone in connection with Ms Harrison's death. It was also told that Mr Harrison had previously been to rehab for alcohol addiction. His representative, Ana Samuel, said the hearing was \"more akin to a criminal investigation than a fact-finding inquiry\".

Lucy's spirit - her warmth, her humour, her kindness - will live on in all of us who loved her.\""

People expect this sort of thing to take place south of the border, in the United States - but not in Canada - not in a place like Tumbler Ridge. Read the latest: Canada school shooting The sorrow, the grief will be felt collectively, right across this mammoth country. A massacre in a high school is not a Canadian thing - and it is not a small-town Canada thing either. The town is certainly isolated, with Vancouver some 1,000km to the southeast but in a way, its remote location should have worked to protect it. The community had its own detachment of the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - and the officers there would have known everyone in town. What's more, places like Tumbler Ridge are basically self-policing. I grew up in small-town Canada, and I can tell you that a trip down 'Main Street' involves a chat, a wave and a friendly interaction with all. Canada school shooting: What we know In essence, your business is the community's business, and that makes the sort of interventions that work to prevent such tragedies more likely. The authorities say they have identified the shooter, who was described in a police alert as \"a female wearing a dress with brown hair\". The shooter's body is one of eight that have been recovered from the corridors and classrooms of the Tumbler Ridge High School. Read more from Sky News:Arrest over missing TV star's motherTexas airport closed for 'security reasons'Trump's threats over Canadian bridge The RCMP chief said he would not release any further details \"for privacy reasons\" - but the fact is, the residents of Tumbler Ridge will probably know who the shooter was. Their grief in the face of this catastrophic loss, will be accompanied by the desperate need for an explanation, an answer to the question why. Many residents may feel a sense of responsibility. It is on these fundamental questions that the local RCMP chief produced a remarkably frank and honest assessment. \"I think we will struggle to determine the 'why',\" said Superintendent Ken Floyd, \"but we will try our best to determine what transpired.\""

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n We had temporarily lost Prince William. Rushing through the narrow streets of the Old Town of Al Ula in Saudi Arabia, our guides eventually helped us catch up with him. They had changed where he was due to arrive, after his lunch had run over. It was all fairly frantic, but for his aides, now tasked with getting him to his plane on time to head home, this was nothing like the other challenges they had faced. This has felt like a week where the royal family have really seen what they are up against when it comes to the Andrew and Epstein scandal. The noise has been never-ending with shouts at both the prince and the King, and more documents being uncovered. Follow latest updates on the Epstein files There had been hopes that the Prince of Wales' trip to Saudi Arabia, a significant diplomatic visit, might have been enough to shift some of the attention. With all the pictures of William with kids and women, there could not have been more effort made to sell this as a trip all about the future, projecting a positive image of Saudi Arabia and the work of the British royal family. The visit, of course, was always going to be a political tightrope for him, with questions over human rights here, despite significant social charges. But nothing could stop the runaway scandal of the Epstein files from being the bigger problem. Read more: Tour of Saudi Arabia ends with nature reserve visit The demand to hear from the royals has been enormous. But the calls for them to tell us more risk overshadowing how huge it was to get those statements earlier in the week from both William and Kate and Buckingham Palace. I have done this job long enough to know there must have been tense conversations before they got the final sign-off for release. They knew they would be blowing the story up again, but doing nothing was not an option. For them, the problem is that people still want more. We expect to see our leaders on camera, to see them visibly taking control and being accountable. There is no doubt that in recent years there has been a change in what the family are prepared to open up about on camera, remember for example the videos released about the King and Kate's cancer, but it's always on their own terms. And from what we have had so far, I'm not sure on this one; they're going to bow to public pressure to talk, despite some saying silence only exacerbates the huge reputational risks. For 15 years, this has been hanging over them, first the Queen, now Andrew's brother, the King, undoubtedly going so much further than their mother ever did. The \"maximalist approach\", as they describe it, stripping him of his titles and Windsor home. And this week, in written words, we have seen greater efforts to distance themselves from Andrew, partly, I suspect, out of a concern about what else may come, despite his constant denials of any wrongdoing. Whether you agree or not, for now, they do not feel like they have more questions to answer. Yes, there are pictures and emails that strongly suggest Epstein spent time at palaces and royal properties. In the end, Andrew maintained that contact, not the wider family or the institution."

Laegreid finished in third place in the biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, and then broke down in tears at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, telling Norwegian state broadcaster NRK how he lost the \"love of my life\" due to his cheating after meeting her six months ago. \"Three months ago, I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.

When the emergency services operator checks that they have the correct information, Austin admits being \"really scared\" and explains: \"I had a kayak, and then I had a bunch of water in it. \"It started to sink and I kept on, like, falling off it. So I decided to ditch the kayak and I decided to take off my life jacket, and I had to swim around about four kilometres facing the current. \"And like I'm really, I'm extremely tired. I think I have heatstroke and I feel like I'm about to pass out. I'm very dizzy.\" After Austin's call, a multi-agency search and rescue response was coordinated and his family members were located clinging to a paddleboard at about 8.30pm local time - 10 hours after they had entered the water. They were then safely brought back to shore by a volunteer marine rescue vessel.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n Seamus Culleton exists in two places - his wife's memory and a detention centre in Texas. Tiffany Smyth had a handful of photographs to show me, illustrating their life together. Sunbathing on a beach, posing with their two dogs, celebrating their engagement with radiant smiles. But the hope illustrated in those snapshots was snatched away one afternoon five months ago. Seamus, 38, was at a building supplies store in Boston when ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents detained him. Via Buffalo, New York, he eventually ended up at Camp East Montana, El Paso, Texas. He has described it \"like a modern-day concentration camp… horrible and filthy.\" Housed with 70 other detainees in one tent, he said he feared for his own life. It was striking to hear his Irish accent on the phoneline from there. \"If it can happen to me… it can kind of happen to anyone,\" he told me. Living in the US for nearly 18 years, he had, in his words, \"lived a normal life\". \"Just working hard, staying out of trouble, I wasn't a big party guy, just spending time with my wife and my dogs,\" he said. Tiffany recalled the moment her husband phoned her to say he had been detained. \"He says ICE picked him up, and I had a million questions… where are they taking you? \"And he said, no, they're not telling me anything. I'll call you when I can, and then the phone hung up. I didn't hear from him for four or five days,\" she said. Fighting through the tears, she described his situation as \"hard to believe\". A native of Kilkenny, he arrived in the US in 2009 and overstayed the 90 days of his visa waiver. But he later married an American, giving him the right to seek a change of status. He had obtained a work permit and was one appointment away from securing a green card. The Department of Homeland Security describes Seamus Culleton as \"an illegal alien from Ireland\". In a statement, it said a green card application and work permit did not grant someone legal status to be in the United States and rejected claims he was being held in high-risk conditions. 'Deplorable' conditions But his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye, said: \"Conditions are deplorable, unimaginable, inhumane, not conducive for even the most atrocious of criminals.\" ICE is currently holding around 70,000 people and 74% of them have no criminal conviction, according to recent data. Donald Trump pledged the greatest mass deportation in US history, to remove seasoned criminals, \"the worst of the worst\" in his words.

        "Headline": "The shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia marks one of the deadliest mass casualty events in Canada's recent history.",
        "Content": "Eight people have been killed in one of Canada's deadliest mass shootings, which also left the attacker dead. Police have now shared more details about the shooting in Tumbler Ridge, a small town with a population of just 2,400, in British Columbia on Tuesday. Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the suspect? The attacker has been identified by police as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said at a news conference on Wednesday. He said the suspect, from Tumbler Ridge, identified as female but was born a biological male, and began to transition around six years ago. The suspect was found at the scene with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The deputy commissioner added that Van Rootselaar was not currently attending Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and had dropped out about four years ago. \"Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,\" Mr McDonald added. A public alert sent to phones initially described the shooter as \"a female in a dress with brown hair\". Police superintendent Ken Floyd earlier said the suspect's motive remained unclear and that authorities are \"not in a place to understand why or what may have motivated this tragedy\". Suspect's mother among those killed Police said they received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, which has around 175 students, at 1.20pm on Tuesday (8.20pm UK time). When officers entered and searched the school, they found multiple victims dead. An individual believed to be the attacker was also found dead with what appeared to be a self‑inflicted injury. At the school, police said those killed were a 39-year-old female teacher, three 12-year-old female students, and two male students aged 12 and 13. They said two further victims, a 39-year-old female and an 11-year-old male, were found at a local home. When questioned by reporters, police said the 39-year-old was the mother of the suspect, with the 11-year-old thought to be their brother or step-brother. The attacker's family members were killed first, before the school shootings. Initial reports claimed another victim died while on the way to hospital, but Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said that \"a female with significant injuries\" survived the shooting. Overnight, police said approximately 25 others were being assessed for non‑life‑threatening injuries. Children 'barricaded themselves' as parents waited for news Children who were at the school at the time were frantically trying to barricade themselves in their classrooms as the attack unfolded, according to local reports. Citing the reports, Sky News' international correspondent John Sparks said: \"They were putting desks and chairs up against the doors, trying to keep the shooter out of their classroom.\" There were also \"desperate scenes\" in the town of Tumbler Ridge during the attack, Sparks added. \"Parents were shepherded to a local hall to await news of whether their children were affected by this. \"In a tight-knit community like this, it's very difficult for the people who live there.\" 'I probably know every victim' Canadians in the small town, located more than 600 miles north of Vancouver, near the border with Alberta, are grieving after the tragedy. Darryl Krakowka, mayor of Tumbler Ridge, told reporters: \"I broke down. It's devastating.\" He described the town's small community as a \"big family\" and added: \"I have lived here for 18 years. I probably know every one of the victims.\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered his \"prayers and deepest condolences\" to the families and friends of the victims after the \"horrific\" attack. \"I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Our ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country - our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other.\" The premier of British Columbia, David Eby, added: \"Our hearts are in Tumbler Ridge tonight with the families of those who have lost loved ones. \"Government will ensure every possible support for community members in the coming days, as we all try to come to terms with this unimaginable tragedy.\" The school has said it will be closed for the rest of the week. What are the gun laws in Canada? While its neighbour has some of the most relaxed firearms legislation in the world, Canadian laws are much stricter. Anyone wanting to possess a firearm in Canada needs to obtain a possession and acquisition licence (PAL). Some types of firearm - such as handguns - need a restricted possession and acquisition licence (RPAL), which is issued by police. In 2022, the government introduced a freeze on the importing, buying or selling of handguns. A previous mass shooting in Nova Scotia in April 2020, in which an attacker killed 22 people, prompted the government to announce an immediate ban on the sale and use of assault-style weapons. Justin Trudeau, then the prime minister, announced the ban of more than 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, including two guns used by the 2020 gunman as well as the AR-15 and other weapons that have been used in a number of mass shootings in the US. But almost six years later, possession of such firearms is not illegal - yet. A compensation programme in which gun owners register their interest in turning in these firearms in exchange for cash runs until the end of March this year. Owners have until the end of October to hand over any banned assault weapons. After this, anyone in possession \"will be breaking the law and could face criminal prosecution\", government briefing documents say. It has not yet been made public what type of firearm or firearms were used in the most recent attack."

The future king toured the Sharaan Nature Reserve in the east of the country to hear about ongoing conservation initiatives aimed at protecting and reintroducing native species such as gazelles and the Arabian oryx. He was also told about a flagship programme to bring back the critically endangered Arabian leopard. The prince planted an acacia tree at the reserve as he was given details about ongoing efforts to protect its natural wildlife and landscape. William is also spending part of the day visiting the old town of AlUla, which features more than 900 mud‑brick houses and a historic citadel. The town has a network of narrow alleyways that formed a thriving settlement on the ancient incense road, the trade route that carried spices, textiles and aromatics across Arabia for centuries. The prince is also meeting local farmers during a tour of AlUla's Oasis and EcoGardening farm. The farmers were giving details to the prince about their belief in sustainable farming and on efforts to preserve their region's agricultural history. The trip has been overshadowed by the allegations surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew denies any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. The Prince and Princess of Wales attempted to make their position clear on the scandal on Monday when they issued their first public statement about it. A Kensington Palace spokesperson said they were \"deeply concerned by the continued revelations\", and \"their thoughts remain focused on the victims\"."

The mission, called Arctic Sentry, will coordinate the increasing military presence of NATO allies in the Arctic, the alliance's military headquarters said in a statement.

It comes after Mr Trump repeatedly highlighted his ambition to own Greenland, saying it was necessary for US national security. Denmark and other European NATO members pushed back, after which the US president said he couldn't rule out military action and later threatened some European nations - including the UK - with new tariffs if he was blocked from purchasing Greenland.

        "Content": "Doorbell footage showing a masked man approaching Nancy Guthrie's home on the day of her disappearance has been released by the FBI. It comes almost 10 days after the 84-year-old mother of TV host Savannah Guthrie went missing - and after local authorities said there was no available footage from the incident. The retrieval of the video, which sees the suspect at the front door of Ms Guthrie's home near Tucson, Arizona, holding a gun, has been a welcome development in the case. Yet some have raised concerns about what the footage's existence says about our rights to privacy. Here's what you need to know about how the footage was retrieved and why it has proved controversial. Video collected via 'backend systems', FBI says Ms Guthrie, who lives alone, has a Nest camera on her front door. Days ago, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Ms Guthrie's camera was disconnected just before 2am on the night she disappeared - 1 February - and that despite the camera's software detecting movement minutes later, no footage was preserved. He didn't explain how the camera was disconnected. He also said the resident didn't have a subscription with Nest, which would have meant footage was automatically saved. Sheriff Nanos did say that investigators were still trying to work with a tech company on the difficult forensic task of recovering any video from the property, where Ms Guthrie had multiple cameras. Then on 10 February, FBI director Kash Patel said footage had been recovered via \"backend systems\". Sharing video and pictures of the suspect on Ms Guthrie's door, Mr Patel wrote on X: \"Over the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie's home that may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices. \"The video was recovered from residual data located in backend systems.\" Mr Patel did not say how the FBI was able to collect the video, or why it took so long to retrieve. Joseph Giacalone, a retired New York police sergeant who managed hundreds of homicide and missing person cases, suggested the FBI may have intentionally delayed the footage's release and tried to identify the person themselves. \"You're trying to keep these things close to the vest. I think they worked this angle for a couple of days,\" he said. Nancy Guthrie disappearance latest Former FBI cybercrime agent E.J. Hilbert told Sky News's US sister network NBC News that it can be challenging for Google to find recordings and that it takes time for legal processes to play out. \"Nest/Google deletes billions of data points every hour,\" he said, comparing the process to finding a needle in a haystack. Why has this led to privacy concerns? Google's Nest offers two tiers with its subscription service: Standard, which tracks \"event-based history\" on a rolling 30-day basis, and Advanced, a subscription which allows for video to be recorded 24/7 and stores the contents for 10 days, with event-based storage for 60 days. \"Events\" refer to movement near the camera. The video recorded on home camera devices is then routinely transmitted to data centres because the devices themselves don't have capacity to store it. But Ms Guthrie didn't have a subscription according to officials, and her device was disconnected, which has led some experts to question why Google was able to collect, access and share footage collected on the camera. Michelle Dahl, the executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said: \"Our hearts are on her [Ms Guthrie's] family and what they are going through, and we are glad for any information that can lead to her being found.\" At the same time, she added, \"we should absolutely be alarmed over the privacy implications that are at stake with this video that was recovered by the Nest camera\". Google's privacy policy does make clear that videos can be captured when a device is offline. \"That means you may not see a visual indicator when your camera is sending the video footage to our servers,\" the policy states. The policy also says while footage can stay on cloud servers for varying amounts of time, users have the right to view and delete them at their discretion. Stacey Higginbotham, a policy fellow at Consumer Reports who specialises in cybersecurity issues, says Google routinely purges footage rather than retaining it permanently, but adds that videos can still be retrieved and watched before being wiped. \"It's basically like when you send an email to the trash. It's still accessible,\" she says. When can Google share home videos? The uptake in internet-connected cameras at home has been a big pro for law enforcement, with authorities regularly working with companies to recover video footage relevant to cases. Experts say that how compliant companies like Google are when it comes to investigation requests depends on their policies. Ms Dahl says that under many user agreements, camera companies need a warrant or consent from the camera owner to share footage with law enforcement, but adds there are plenty of legal loopholes that allow the companies to bypass these steps. She adds that some companies have user agreements specifying that the data collected on cameras belong to the camera company, not the private camera owner, meaning they can share footage with law enforcement at their own discretion, without even notifying its users. \"I think the public has gotten too comfortable with surveillance cameras in not only public spaces, but also their private homes, without thinking about the consequences of where that data ends up,\" she says. \"If a camera is absolutely necessary for your security, look into options where that data is not transmitted off to a cloud.\" In a transparency report, Google's Nest said that it does work with law enforcement but that it also works to maintain user privacy and notifies users about legal demands. \"For example, if a US government agency presented us with a search warrant to investigate a crime they think was captured on a Nest Cam, we wouldn't just hand over user data. We'd analyse the request to be sure the warrant wasn't overly broad, then we'd make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,\" the company wrote. Sky News has contacted Nest's parent company Google for comment. The company previously told NBC News that it was assisting with the Guthrie investigation and that it could not provide further details."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Jeffrey Epstein had power and influence because he had money. It attracted wealth and those who also sought it. His fortune enabled the crimes he committed. Its role cannot be underestimated. The frenzied fallout from his death leaves a trail of questions over how he came by his money. Epstein files: See the latest revelations Epstein's empire once included the largest residential property in Manhattan, two sun-soaked islands and three planes. But were they the product of pure financial acumen or were there also more sinister elements; blackmail disguised as financial expertise and a free rein to ensnare people of interest to the security services? Here's what we do know. How much was Epstein worth? A document, signed by the convicted paedophile just two days before his suicide in 2019, suggests his estate was worth in the region of $580m (£475m at that time) before the payment of any taxes and liabilities. The 1953 Trust - likely named in reference to the year of his birth - was a trust fund that allowed the identities of his beneficiaries to be hidden, as opposed to a simple will. The final version was released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), with some redactions, for the first time last week and showed more than 40 people were set to inherit millions of dollars each, including Ghislaine Maxwell ($10m). Where it all began To understand the end, we have to explore the beginning. New York-born Epstein was considered a maths genius but never graduated, despite attending university. He left education for education - to teach teenage boys and girls, without qualifications, at a private school that was attended by children of many of New York's elite. After being fired - apparently for lacking teaching skills - Epstein was given a job at the investment banking giant Bear Stearns by its soon-to-be chief executive Alan \"Ace\" Greenberg, who had children at the school. It marked his first big break - one that would underpin his financial status for years to come. Epstein worked his way up over five years but left Bear Stearns in 1981 over a trading violation for which the company fined him $2,500 - worth almost $9,000 (£6,597) in today's money. He told regulators at the time he was latterly earning over $200,000 per year - around $710,000 (£520,501) now - in total compensation from Bear Stearns for his work as an adviser and limited partner. He may have left the bank, but that was not the end of his relations with the company that became the first domino to fall in the financial crisis 27 years later. The big bucks It is from here that Epstein's obsession with privacy starts to cloud his earnings. His business interests from 1981 onwards lacked transparency as they were not listed entities, though lawsuits and some filings have revealed limited data on performance. He started his own firm which specialised in recovering money for individuals and, reportedly, a number of foreign governments, and was also hired as a \"consultant\" in 1987 at the then Towers Financial Corporation. He left in 1989, four years before it was exposed as a Ponzi scheme. He earned $25,000 per month for his role at Towers and was never charged over the $450m fraud. J Epstein & Company, founded in 1988, was where the big bucks started to appear. This entity became Financial Trust Company after Epstein based his financial operations in the US Virgin Islands - a tax haven. He also started, in 2011, Southern Trust Company which latterly became his main source of income. How much did he rake in, and how did he do it? The extent to which the revenue he generated - largely tax-free - from his clients and from investments was legitimate, is one of the big questions hanging over Epstein's activities. He certainly evaded regulations covering financial advisers, lawyers, and accountants globally by painting himself as a consultant. A review by Forbes showed that two individuals accounted for the bulk of the fees that Epstein's vehicles attracted. First, J Epstein & Co managed the financial affairs of the US billionaire Les Wexner - the long-time boss of Victoria's Secret. He was found to have paid Epstein $200m until they parted ways in 2007. Leon Black, the co-founder of private equity firm Apollo Global Management, is believed to have handed over $170m to the entities from 2012 to 2017. He said in a letter to Apollo investors in 2020 that \"I deeply regret having had any involvement with him\", adding that their relationship was confined to \"estate planning, tax and philanthropic endeavours\". Mr Wexner has previously said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 and also denied knowledge of his sexual abuse. In all, Forbes said, Epstein took at least $360m in dividends from his companies between 1999 and 2018 and saved himself $300m in tax due to the US Virgin Islands jurisdiction. It wasn't all plain sailing… US prosecutors have suggested, according to the Financial Times, that Mr Wexner received a $100m payment from Epstein in 2008. It related to claims by the lingerie tycoon that hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from him while Epstein had power of attorney over his personal financial affairs. It included allegations of improper property purchases, the FT said citing US Department of Justice documents, that saw Epstein buy real estate from Mr Wexner's portfolio at a discount. The repayment sum was said to have been divulged to the authorities as Mr Wexner's legal team sought to assist their enquiries before Epstein's death in 2019. The financial crisis Epstein suffered big losses in the wake of the financial crash later in 2008. Financial Trust was an investor in a Bear Stearns fund that collapsed along with the bank in March of that year - the first major casualty of the crisis. The company recorded net losses of $166m between 2008 and 2010 - losses that gave rise to his new venture Southern Trust. It was also widely reported that Epstein lost money through an exposure to mortgage-backed securities at a Bermuda-based company where he previously served as chairman. What about other income sources? Epstein oversaw Liquid Funding Ltd for eight years until 2007. Months before his death, a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) highlighted evidence that Epstein's wealth was being \"cloaked\" through a series of offshore shell companies based in tax havens. The ICIJ, citing papers seen by its partners McClatchy and the Miami Herald, reported that Bear Stearns was among Liquid Funding's owners and its interests were in financial products that became synonymous with the 2008 crash. Were his interests legitimate? Epstein clearly made money through various vehicles, investments, and tax avoidance. They may have been legal but a facade too. Files released by the Department of Justice only add to the suspicions that the lining of Epstein's pockets was facilitated by the blackmail of wealthy individuals, potentially through covert filming of sexual activities at his properties. The \"victims\" could save themselves some tax in return for more business. It's a theory that has gathered traction as journalists continue to flick through the vast document dump. It is important to point out that the business relationships highlighted do not suggest any wrongdoing on the part of those identified. And the sex-trafficking operations? JPMorgan - the US investment bank that retained Epstein as a client between 1998 and 2013 and paid for that relationship through a series of later settlements - flagged more than $1bn of suspicious transactions linked to Epstein soon after his death. The New York Times said the bank identified thousands of transactions that could have facilitated sex trafficking. His true wealth Financial journalists have spent years trying to get to the truth behind Epstein's fortune. You can see, from his story, he was a master of manipulation from the off. But it would not be surprising if there is more money to be found, once his estate has been exhausted through legal costs, compensation, and victim settlements."

        "Content": "A murderer who killed a travelling salesman in a deadly robbery has become the first to face the death penalty in Florida this year. Ronald Palmer Heath was given the lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, in the north of the state, on Tuesday. He was convicted of the 1989 murder of Michael Sheridan after conspiring with his brother, Kenneth Heath, to rob him. The 64-year-old was already strapped down with an IV inserted into his arm when the curtain rose on the execution chamber at 6pm. According to Sky's US partner, NBC News, he was asked by the warden if he had any last words, and replied: \"I'm sorry. That's all I can say. Thank you.\" He showed little outward reaction as the three drugs were administered, closing his eyes and appearing to fall asleep, before becoming motionless. He was pronounced dead at 6.12pm. Court records show that the Heath brothers met Mr Sheridan at a Gainesville bar on 24 May, 1989, where the travelling salesman brought them a drink. \n                  Boy, 13, arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after double stabbing at school\n                 \n                  Drug dealer inspired by Home Alone rigged house with booby-traps\n                 \n                  Man sought after rape on university campus\n                 When he inquired whether the duo had any marijuana, they conspired to take him somewhere and rob him. After stopping on a dirt road in an isolated area, Kenneth held up the victim at gunpoint. However, Mr Sheridan initially refused to give the brothers anything, so Kenneth shot him in the chest. Then the salesman, still alive, started emptying his pockets, but Ronald kicked him and stabbed him with a hunting knife. Kenneth then shot their victim twice in the head. After the brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area, they returned to the bar to loot his rental car. The brothers were caught after making multiple purchases with his credit cards. Ronald was convicted of first degree murder, armed robbery, and multiple forgery charges, and sentenced to death. But Kenneth made a plea deal and testified against his brother, according to Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (FADP), a group campaigning against capital punishment.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years, and is now eligible for parole. Court records describing the killing suggest that Ronald was the driving force, ordering Kenneth to shoot. But FADP condemned the execution, saying: \"Ronnie was put to death for a murder he did not commit. \"The undisputed trigger man in that crime, Ronnie's brother Kenneth, received a life sentence with the possibility of parole. \"That means one day Kenneth may walk free on this earth, while Ronnie will be buried six feet under it.\" Executions in Florida reached a new annual high in 2025, with 19 people put to death, smashing the previous record of eight in 2014. The state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, oversaw more executions in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. FADP said Heath's death continued an \"execution spree that remains politicised, frantic, and disproportionate\"."

Tiffany Smyth had a handful of photographs to show me, illustrating their life together. Sunbathing on a beach, posing with their two dogs, celebrating their engagement with radiant smiles. But the hope illustrated in those snapshots was snatched away one afternoon five months ago. Seamus, 38, was at a building supplies store in Boston when ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents detained him. Via Buffalo, New York, he eventually ended up at Camp East Montana, El Paso, Texas. He has described it \"like a modern-day concentration camp… horrible and filthy.\" Housed with 70 other detainees in one tent, he said he feared for his own life. It was striking to hear his Irish accent on the phoneline from there. \"If it can happen to me… it can kind of happen to anyone,\" he told me. Living in the US for nearly 18 years, he had, in his words, \"lived a normal life\". \"Just working hard, staying out of trouble, I wasn't a big party guy, just spending time with my wife and my dogs,\" he said. Tiffany recalled the moment her husband phoned her to say he had been detained. \"He says ICE picked him up, and I had a million questions… where are they taking you? \"And he said, no, they're not telling me anything. I'll call you when I can, and then the phone hung up. I didn't hear from him for four or five days,\" she said. Fighting through the tears, she described his situation as \"hard to believe\". A native of Kilkenny, he arrived in the US in 2009 and overstayed the 90 days of his visa waiver. But he later married an American, giving him the right to seek a change of status. He had obtained a work permit and was one appointment away from securing a green card. The Department of Homeland Security describes Seamus Culleton as \"an illegal alien from Ireland\". In a statement, it said a green card application and work permit did not grant someone legal status to be in the United States and rejected claims he was being held in high-risk conditions. 'Deplorable' conditions But his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye, said: \"Conditions are deplorable, unimaginable, inhumane, not conducive for even the most atrocious of criminals.\" ICE is currently holding around 70,000 people and 74% of them have no criminal conviction, according to recent data. Donald Trump pledged the greatest mass deportation in US history, to remove seasoned criminals, \"the worst of the worst\" in his words.

        "Content": "A newly uncovered FBI document suggests Donald Trump told police about Jeffrey Epstein's behaviour in 2006. The document, released in the latest batch of Epstein files, is a written record of a 2019 FBI interview with an ex-cop from Palm Beach, Florida, who says Mr Trump called him in relation to an investigation into the financier. \"Thank goodness you're stopping him, everyone has known he's been doing this,\" Mr Trump apparently said. Epstein files: See the latest revelations The name of the officer has been redacted from the file, however, Michael Reiter - who retired from his role as police chief in 2009 - told the Miami Herald he had taken the call. Mr Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. The document would appear to contradict previous claims by the president that he \"had no idea\" about his crimes. When asked by reporters following the disgraced financier's arrest for sex trafficking in 2019 if he had \"any suspicions\" about him, Mr Trump said: \"No, I had no idea. I had no idea. I haven't spoken to him in many, many years.\" What else does FBI file say? According to the FBI summary of the interview, Mr Trump told police in July 2006 that \"people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting\" and that he had thrown Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club. Mr Trump allegedly told authorities he was once around Epstein when he was with teenagers and that he \"got the hell out of there\". The summary also claims Mr Trump told the police chief that Ghislaine Maxwell - who is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking, and has this week refused to answer questions at a congressional hearing - was Epstein's \"operative\" and \"she is evil and to focus on her\". According to the newly revealed document, Mr Trump was \"one of the very first people to call\" the police when he found out they were investigating Epstein.

Epstein agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors in 2008 that meant he avoided more serious federal charges. A Department of Justice official told NBC News, the US sister network of Sky News, that \"we are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the president contacted law enforcement 20 years ago\". Trump and Epstein moved in the same circles in Florida and New York for many years, and were pictured together on several occasions in the 1990s and early 2000s, including at the real estate mogul's club in Palm Beach. There is now-infamous NBC News archive footage of the pair socialising in November 1992 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, with the now-president appearing to point out women on the dance floor. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump was quoted saying: \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. \"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\"\n Trump was asked about his relationship with Epstein after he was found dead in his cell in 2019, and he played down the extent of their relationship. He said he \"knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\", but added: \"I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.\" Asked why the pair fell out, Mr Trump said: \"The reason doesn't make any difference, frankly,\" and added that he had \"no idea\" about Epstein's crimes. Tap here to read more about what we know about their relationship. What has the White House said? White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked on Tuesday about the alleged call Mr Trump made to police, said it \"may or may not have happened in 2006. I don't know the answer\". She added: \"What President Trump has always said is that he kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club because Jeffrey Epstein was a creep. \"And that remains true in this call. If it did happen it corroborates exactly what President Trump has said from the beginning.\" Mr Reiter declined comment to NBC News, writing that he is \"not participating in interviews at this time\"."

It comes after Mr Trump repeatedly highlighted his ambition to own Greenland, saying it was necessary for US national security.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants, who are draining resources from the state, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of the country's richest and most influential men, has told Sky News. Sir Jim, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group and part-owner of Manchester United, warned that Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years. \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. \"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000. Sir Keir Starmer responded to Sir Jim's remarks on immigration, saying they were \"offensive and wrong\". \"Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country,\" the prime minister added. \"Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\" In his interview with Sky News, Sir Jim - who is a resident of Monaco - signalled that Sir Keir might not be the right man for the top job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or, or he's maybe too nice - I mean, Keir is a nice man. I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\" The chemicals boss said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, saying of him: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man, and, I think he's got good intentions. But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\" Referring to his role at Manchester United, Sir Jim added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\" Read more:How much does the UK rely on legal migration?Britain's immigration system changes explained amid shake-up Sir Jim continued: \"Well, I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off. \"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\" Sports correspondent Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become increasingly divisive with his actions and rhetoric as the face and voice of Manchester United's leadership.

Sir Jim's view of foreign people coming to Britain collides with the ideals promoted by United and the Premier League. Read Rob's full analysis here Sir Jim was talking on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, at which leaders from many of Europe's biggest economies, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz, are meeting with industrialists to discuss the fate of its economy. The summit comes amid a spate of closures across the European chemicals sector, closures that indicate, in the INEOS founder's view, that the European chemicals sector is facing \"unsurvivable conditions\". Reacting to Sir Jim's comments to Sky News, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told Sky's Matt Barbet on the Politics Hub that migration - both legal and illegal - was too high under the Conservatives, and that people want to see those arriving \"making a contribution\" and \"not doing that at the expense\" of a government that isn't investing in young people. But she continued: \"My dad comes from an immigrant background. I want your viewers to know that I am really proud that Britain is a diverse and tolerant country that is strengthened by waves of immigration.\" She added: \"I'd be more than happy to speak to him about what we're doing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Jeffrey Epstein had power and influence because he had money. It attracted wealth and those who also sought it. His fortune enabled the crimes he committed. Its role cannot be underestimated. The frenzied fallout from his death leaves a trail of questions over how he came by his money. Epstein files: See the latest revelations Epstein's empire once included the largest residential property in Manhattan, two sun-soaked islands and three planes. But were they the product of pure financial acumen or were there also more sinister elements; blackmail disguised as financial expertise and a free rein to ensnare people of interest to the security services? Here's what we do know. How much was Epstein worth? A document, signed by the convicted paedophile just two days before his suicide in 2019, suggests his estate was worth in the region of $580m (£475m at that time) before the payment of any taxes and liabilities. The 1953 Trust - likely named in reference to the year of his birth - was a trust fund that allowed the identities of his beneficiaries to be hidden, as opposed to a simple will. The final version was released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), with some redactions, for the first time last week and showed more than 40 people were set to inherit millions of dollars each, including Ghislaine Maxwell ($10m). Where it all began To understand the end, we have to explore the beginning. New York-born Epstein was considered a maths genius but never graduated, despite attending university. He left education for education - to teach teenage boys and girls, without qualifications, at a private school that was attended by children of many of New York's elite. After being fired - apparently for lacking teaching skills - Epstein was given a job at the investment banking giant Bear Stearns by its soon-to-be chief executive Alan \"Ace\" Greenberg, who had children at the school. It marked his first big break - one that would underpin his financial status for years to come. Epstein worked his way up over five years but left Bear Stearns in 1981 over a trading violation for which the company fined him $2,500 - worth almost $9,000 (£6,597) in today's money. He told regulators at the time he was latterly earning over $200,000 per year - around $710,000 (£520,501) now - in total compensation from Bear Stearns for his work as an adviser and limited partner. He may have left the bank, but that was not the end of his relations with the company that became the first domino to fall in the financial crisis 27 years later. The big bucks It is from here that Epstein's obsession with privacy starts to cloud his earnings. His business interests from 1981 onwards lacked transparency as they were not listed entities, though lawsuits and some filings have revealed limited data on performance. He started his own firm which specialised in recovering money for individuals and, reportedly, a number of foreign governments, and was also hired as a \"consultant\" in 1987 at the then Towers Financial Corporation. He left in 1989, four years before it was exposed as a Ponzi scheme. He earned $25,000 per month for his role at Towers and was never charged over the $450m fraud. J Epstein & Company, founded in 1988, was where the big bucks started to appear. This entity became Financial Trust Company after Epstein based his financial operations in the US Virgin Islands - a tax haven. He also started, in 2011, Southern Trust Company which latterly became his main source of income. How much did he rake in, and how did he do it? The extent to which the revenue he generated - largely tax-free - from his clients and from investments was legitimate, is one of the big questions hanging over Epstein's activities. He certainly evaded regulations covering financial advisers, lawyers, and accountants globally by painting himself as a consultant. A review by Forbes showed that two individuals accounted for the bulk of the fees that Epstein's vehicles attracted. First, J Epstein & Co managed the financial affairs of the US billionaire Les Wexner - the long-time boss of Victoria's Secret. He was found to have paid Epstein $200m until they parted ways in 2007. Leon Black, the co-founder of private equity firm Apollo Global Management, is believed to have handed over $170m to the entities from 2012 to 2017. He said in a letter to Apollo investors in 2020 that \"I deeply regret having had any involvement with him\", adding that their relationship was confined to \"estate planning, tax and philanthropic endeavours\". Mr Wexner has previously said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 and also denied knowledge of his sexual abuse. In all, Forbes said, Epstein took at least $360m in dividends from his companies between 1999 and 2018 and saved himself $300m in tax due to the US Virgin Islands jurisdiction. It wasn't all plain sailing… US prosecutors have suggested, according to the Financial Times, that Mr Wexner received a $100m payment from Epstein in 2008. It related to claims by the lingerie tycoon that hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from him while Epstein had power of attorney over his personal financial affairs. It included allegations of improper property purchases, the FT said citing US Department of Justice documents, that saw Epstein buy real estate from Mr Wexner's portfolio at a discount. The repayment sum was said to have been divulged to the authorities as Mr Wexner's legal team sought to assist their enquiries before Epstein's death in 2019. The financial crisis Epstein suffered big losses in the wake of the financial crash later in 2008. Financial Trust was an investor in a Bear Stearns fund that collapsed along with the bank in March of that year - the first major casualty of the crisis. The company recorded net losses of $166m between 2008 and 2010 - losses that gave rise to his new venture Southern Trust. It was also widely reported that Epstein lost money through an exposure to mortgage-backed securities at a Bermuda-based company where he previously served as chairman. What about other income sources? Epstein oversaw Liquid Funding Ltd for eight years until 2007. Months before his death, a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) highlighted evidence that Epstein's wealth was being \"cloaked\" through a series of offshore shell companies based in tax havens. The ICIJ, citing papers seen by its partners McClatchy and the Miami Herald, reported that Bear Stearns was among Liquid Funding's owners and its interests were in financial products that became synonymous with the 2008 crash. Were his interests legitimate? Epstein clearly made money through various vehicles, investments, and tax avoidance. They may have been legal but a facade too. Files released by the Department of Justice only add to the suspicions that the lining of Epstein's pockets was facilitated by the blackmail of wealthy individuals, potentially through covert filming of sexual activities at his properties. The \"victims\" could save themselves some tax in return for more business. It's a theory that has gathered traction as journalists continue to flick through the vast document dump. It is important to point out that the business relationships highlighted do not suggest any wrongdoing on the part of those identified. And the sex-trafficking operations? JPMorgan - the US investment bank that retained Epstein as a client between 1998 and 2013 and paid for that relationship through a series of later settlements - flagged more than $1bn of suspicious transactions linked to Epstein soon after his death. The New York Times said the bank identified thousands of transactions that could have facilitated sex trafficking. His true wealth Financial journalists have spent years trying to get to the truth behind Epstein's fortune. You can see, from his story, he was a master of manipulation from the off. But it would not be surprising if there is more money to be found, once his estate has been exhausted through legal costs, compensation, and victim settlements."

        "Content": "Social media users have been warned they risk breaking the law by promoting weight-loss jabs, after posts by members of the public endorsing the injections were banned by the advertising regulator for the first time. The Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook posts used discount codes and referral links to advertise the drugs for the online pharmacies Voy, Zava, MedExpress and the online prescribing service UK Meds Direct, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said. Weight-loss injections are a prescription-only medicine and cannot be advertised to the public. The ASA said this meant Britons may be promoting weight-loss medicines to friends, family, and social media followers without realising they could be breaking the rules. The posts promoted the medicines by naming them directly, using hashtags, showing images of injection pens, encouraging followers to start their own weight-loss journey and offering discounts or incentives. ASA investigations manager Catherine Drewett said the rulings \"send a clear message that affiliate marketing is not a loophole and that promoting prescription medicines through social media, whether as a brand, influencer or customer, is against the law and our rules\". Voy and Zava responded by saying the posts were shared independently by customers. Children exposed to 'extreme' products The rulings came as Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza warned children were being routinely exposed online to products that claimed to change their bodies and appearance. Some 78% of children said the ads had a negative impact on their self-esteem, with 41% of 13 to 17-year-olds seeing promotions for prescription-only weight loss drugs, according to her new report. The report, \"A healthy influence? Children's exposure to appearance-changing products online\", also found 54% of children had seen exercise and diet plans and 52% had seen ads for food and drink products for weight loss. Many had also seen ads for skin lightening products, including 46% of black children and 35% of Asian children. Many of these products are illegal in the UK because they contain toxic ingredients. Dame Rachel is calling for an end to all advertising to children on social media by amending the Online Safety Act and changing Ofcom's Children's Code of Practice to explicitly protect children from body stigma content. She has also proposed strengthening the regulation of online sales of age-restricted products. \"Extreme and potentially dangerous appearance-changing products are being normalised to children through advertising, influencer culture and online posts, despite many of these products being unsafe, illegal or strictly age-restricted,\" she said.

Some 8% of children had bought or tried non-prescription pills that claimed to aid weight loss, and 21% of children had bought or tried food or drink marketed for weight loss. The study found black children were more likely to try these products, exercise, and diet plans than white children. Some children reported harmful reactions after buying or trying appearance-changing products online, such as infections from eyelash products containing unknown chemicals. The report follows survey findings by the commissioner in 2024 that found just 40% of girls and 60% of boys were happy with how they look."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Pimco, the giant asset management group, is backing a £3bn deal orchestrated by the sports investment vehicle which owns stakes in the women's professional tennis tour and Premiership Rugby. Sky News has learnt that Pimco, which manages roughly $2trn in assets, has agreed to anchor a €2.35bn senior debt financing expected to be finalised by Global Sport Group (GSG) this week. The refinancing forms part of a broader overhaul of GSG's capital structure, which also includes roughly €900m of junior debt as well as the sale of a minority equity stake in the business. CVC Capital Partners, the private equity firm which has overseen the creation of GSG to house its portfolio of sports assets, has been working on the refinancing for several months. Money latest: 'World first' as Sky brings four streaming platforms into its subscription The Pimco-led senior debt deal is said by debt market sources to have been struck on favourable terms for the CVC-controlled company. Sources also told Sky News last month that KKR, the American private equity giant, was in advanced talks about acquiring a minority equity stake in the vehicle, which also owns shareholdings in Six Nations Rugby, international volleyball and the top flights of French and Spanish men's football. \n                  Ed Conway analyses his interview with Man Utd owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe \n                 \n                  Starmer calls for apology from Man Utd co-owner after 'offensive' remarks to Sky News\n                 \n                  'UK has been colonised by immigrants', says INEOS boss and Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\n                 In total, KKR, which recently agreed the purchase of sports investment firm Arctos, is investing €1.6bn across GSG's capital structure, including debt and equity, according to people close to the situation. The overall financing package, expected to be worth in the region of £3bn, will reinforce GSG's ambitions of becoming the most sophisticated global investor in elite sports teams, leagues and other related properties. The CVC-backed vehicle last month confirmed its acquisition of Equine Network, the largest for-profit equestrian sports league in the US. Gemma Wright, a partner in CVC's sports, media and entertainment team, said in relation to that transaction: \"The creation of Global Sport Group was driven by our conviction that premium sports leagues benefit from long-term, specialist ownership and collaboration. \"CVC's investment experience in sports spans over twenty years and, while much has changed in that time, sports IP remains a very attractive opportunity in which we continue to see significant potential for further innovation and growth.\" For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. GSG is chaired by Marc Allera, the former BT Group consumer chief, and is now scouring the globe for other deal opportunities. Its new warchest is expected to be deployed to buy assets in sports with substantial commercial growth prospects. Once completed, the deal will allow CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in GSG or a future initial public offering on a major international exchange. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the GSG approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC potentially interested in the acquisition of further elite tennis tournaments. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. CVC, GSG, KKR and Pimco all declined to comment."

Sky News understands that Tembo, which was founded just over five years ago, will announce on Thursday that it has secured the money in a round led by new investor Gresham House Ventures. The McPike Family Office, which is the largest investor in Starling Bank, one of Britain's most prominent neobanks, also participated in the round. Money latest: 'World first' as Sky brings four major streaming platforms into its subscription Other investors in Tembo include Aviva Investors, Goodwater Capital, Love Ventures, Ascension and the British Business Bank.

Tembo, which did not disclose its valuation in its latest funding round, claims to be on track to have a 20% market share of the UK first-time buyer market within two years. \"This investment is a major milestone for Tembo as we continue building a platform that doesn't just help people find and secure a mortgage, but puts them genuinely in control of their journey to homeownership, from the first pound they save to the day they get the keys,\" said Richard Dana, Tembo co-founder and chief executive. Rohit Mathur, an investment partner at Gresham House, said: \"Home ownership in the UK has become one of the hardest financial milestones to reach, despite a £1.6 trillion mortgage market. \"Home buyers, especially first-time buyers, are expected to save more, faster, while navigating an increasingly complex mortgage landscape.\""

        "Content": "The prime minister has condemned Sir Jim Ratcliffe's \"offensive and wrong\" remarks about immigration. The Manchester United co-owner, one of Britain's richest men but a resident of tax-free Monaco, told Sky News that Britain had been \"colonised\" by immigrants who are draining resources from the state. \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. \"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\" In a post on X responding to the interview, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Offensive and wrong. Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country. Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\" Sir Jim, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, also claimed to Sky's economics and data editor Ed Conway immigration had pushed the country's population from 58 million in 2020 to 70 million in 2026. \n                  Sir Jim Ratcliffe's immigration outburst risks antagonising those inside and out of Man Utd\n                 \n                  'UK has been colonised by immigrants', says INEOS boss and Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\n                 \n                  Man Utd and chemicals boss warns of 'moment of reckoning' for his industry\n                 The Office for National Statistics estimates the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. It was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000. Sir Jim said the government needed a leader \"prepared to be unpopular for a period\" to address Britain's issues, suggesting Sir Keir, while \"a nice man\", might not be the right man for the top job. He said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, describing him as \"intelligent\" with \"good intentions\". The Reform UK leader later backed his remarks about immigration, telling Sky News: \"The country has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in the country. \"Labour may try and ignore that but Reform won't.\" Read more from Sky News:Dawson's Creek star diesPolice and prosecutors hold talks on Andrew Speaking before Sir Keir's intervention, Sports Secretary Lisa Nandy told Matt Barbet on Sky's Politics Hub that immigration had been too high, especially under Boris Johnson's government. But she said the government was investing in more opportunities for British youngsters, and declared: \"My dad comes from an immigrant background. I want your viewers to know that I am really proud that Britain is a diverse and tolerant country that is strengthened by waves of immigration.\" 'Disgraceful and divisive' The prime minister's criticism has been widely echoed by football and anti-racism groups. The Manchester United Muslim Supporters' Club accused Sir Jim of risking \"legitimising prejudice and deepening division\", saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by his rhetoric. \"The term 'colonised' is not neutral. It echoes language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats,\" said a statement. \"Such rhetoric has real-world consequences,\" it added, and pointed out United has \"players, staff and supporters from every background, faith, and ethnicity\". Sports correspondent Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become increasingly divisive with his actions and rhetoric as the face and voice of Manchester United's leadership. The INEOS billionaire's outburst on immigration risks further antagonising those inside and outside the club. The men's squad alone relies on overseas talent, featuring more than a dozen different nationalities. And then there's the staff - many with global heritage - who keep the club running on a daily or temporary basis from the training ground to Old Trafford. Sir Jim's view of foreign people coming to Britain collides with the ideals promoted by United and the Premier League. Read Rob's full analysis here Football's anti-discrimination body Kick It Out labelled Sir Jim's comments \"disgraceful and deeply divisive at a time when football does so much to bring communities together\". Its damning statement added: \"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.\" Charity Show Racism the Red Card also said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the remarks, and said public figures should use their platform to \"challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony\"."

        "Content": "Half a dozen beavers have been legally released at two sites in Somerset in a bid to restore a river and wetland.  The releases, one involving a mother and her three children and another involving a pair of Eurasian beavers, took place at spots across the National Trust's Holnicote Estate on Exmoor on Tuesday. It is the second time the charity has been granted a licence by Natural England to release beavers into the wild after the first release on the Purbeck Estate in Dorset in March last year. The species was previously released into enclosed areas of the Holnicote Estate in 2020 as part of a trial reintroduction. Ben Eardley, project manager at the National Trust, said the latest release was \"incredibly exciting and is the latest step in our ambitions to restore a huge swathe of Somerset countryside and moorland to help bring back nature\". He called beavers \"extraordinary partners\" in the work done by the charity to help \"restore nature\" and said the semiaquatic mammals play a \"vital role\" in slowing water flow, creating and holding wetland habitats, reducing erosion and improving water quality. Mr Eardley added: \"Across the estate they will have the opportunity to develop their own territory, enabling them to create wetlands, ponds, build dams, and enrich the landscape in ways only beavers can.\" Why the comeback? It comes nearly 12 months after the government approved the wild release of beavers following years of discussion about their reintroduction. Beavers became extinct in Britain more than 400 years ago due to hunting for their pelts, meat, and glands. They have made their way back to England's rivers in recent years, through escapes from enclosures and illegal releases, and in 2022 were given legal protection. Conservationists have long called for the return of beavers to the English countryside, but concerns have been raised about their release, including the risk of flooding and targeting of crops such as maize and cricket bat willow. Read more from Sky News:Social media users warned over weight-loss jabs postsCounter-terror police investigating 'deeply traumatic' double stabbing Nature minister Mary Creagh said: \"It was a privilege to witness beavers returning to Somerset. \"These extraordinary creatures are brilliant for biodiversity, reduce flood risk and improve water quality in our rivers. \"The return of beavers is a vital part of this government's mission to protect and restore nature, and we're working closely with local communities to maximise their benefits.\" On Monday, two pairs of beavers were released by Cornwall Wildlife Trust into the Par and Fowey river catchments."

        "Content": "Social media users have been warned they risk breaking the law by promoting weight-loss jabs, after posts by members of the public endorsing the injections were banned by the advertising regulator for the first time. The Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook posts used discount codes and referral links to advertise the drugs for the online pharmacies Voy, Zava, MedExpress and the online prescribing service UK Meds Direct, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said. Weight-loss injections are a prescription-only medicine and cannot be advertised to the public. The ASA said this meant Britons may be promoting weight-loss medicines to friends, family, and social media followers without realising they could be breaking the rules. The posts promoted the medicines by naming them directly, using hashtags, showing images of injection pens, encouraging followers to start their own weight-loss journey and offering discounts or incentives. ASA investigations manager Catherine Drewett said the rulings \"send a clear message that affiliate marketing is not a loophole and that promoting prescription medicines through social media, whether as a brand, influencer or customer, is against the law and our rules\". Voy and Zava responded by saying the posts were shared independently by customers. Children exposed to 'extreme' products The rulings came as Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza warned children were being routinely exposed online to products that claimed to change their bodies and appearance. Some 78% of children said the ads had a negative impact on their self-esteem, with 41% of 13 to 17-year-olds seeing promotions for prescription-only weight loss drugs, according to her new report. The report, \"A healthy influence? Children's exposure to appearance-changing products online\", also found 54% of children had seen exercise and diet plans and 52% had seen ads for food and drink products for weight loss. Many had also seen ads for skin lightening products, including 46% of black children and 35% of Asian children. Many of these products are illegal in the UK because they contain toxic ingredients. Dame Rachel is calling for an end to all advertising to children on social media by amending the Online Safety Act and changing Ofcom's Children's Code of Practice to explicitly protect children from body stigma content. She has also proposed strengthening the regulation of online sales of age-restricted products. \"Extreme and potentially dangerous appearance-changing products are being normalised to children through advertising, influencer culture and online posts, despite many of these products being unsafe, illegal or strictly age-restricted,\" she said.

Some 8% of children had bought or tried non-prescription pills that claimed to aid weight loss, and 21% of children had bought or tried food or drink marketed for weight loss. The study found black children were more likely to try these products, exercise, and diet plans than white children. Some children reported harmful reactions after buying or trying appearance-changing products online, such as infections from eyelash products containing unknown chemicals. The report follows survey findings by the commissioner in 2024 that found just 40% of girls and 60% of boys were happy with how they look."

Hayu, billed as \"the home of reality TV\", offers The Real Housewives back catalogue as well as British shows such as Made In Chelsea and The Only Way Is Essex. The two streamers join Disney+, which includes film franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel, and the hit series Rivals, as well as Netflix - home to shows including Stranger Things, Black Mirror and Adolescence - in being offered as part of a Sky subscription. The service will begin in March, with Hayu available from July. Sky, the owner of Sky News, is home to shows including Brassic and A League Of Their Own, and is also due to launch the first UK version of hit US comedy show Saturday Night Live in March. With viewers preferring to access their favourite shows and films in one place, the announcement gives Sky an appealing offering amid increasing competition from streamers. Bosses say the deal marks \"a new era\" for the broadcaster and its own streaming service, NOW. \"In a world-first, we're bringing together Sky, Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max and Hayu into a single Sky TV subscription,\" said Sophia Ahmad, Sky's chief consumer officer. \"Nowhere else offers this breadth of incredible entertainment in a fully integrated experience, with everything customers love watching side by side so viewers can jump from show to show with ease.\" Arts and entertainment correspondent They say traditional TV is dying – but has Sky just come up with a way to fight back? When it comes to bringing entertainment into our living rooms, the broadcaster is known as the home for shows such as The Day Of The Jackal, Brassic and a League Of Their Own - but there's no getting away from the fact that traditional telly is in the midst of a bit of an existential crisis. The rise of social platforms and streamers means broadcasters have to fight harder and harder for audience attention – and with eyeballs elsewhere, it's a battle that linear TV has been losing. In this digital, internet-driven, highly competitive market, Sky has needed to reinvent itself. So now, rather than solely attempting to take the streamers on, it has announced an \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" approach – bringing together some of the world's biggest streaming platforms under a single TV subscription from next month. So the USP is: cut out the faff of multiple payments and bundle those third-party streaming services into one flat fee. As the ad market has shifted to online tech platforms such as Google and Meta, squeezing Sky's business, it really has needed to do something big. And this is big - essentially a real shift to becoming more of a content aggregator. Bosses say the deal marks \"a new era\" for the broadcaster. It's a simple idea. The question now is: will it pay off? Millions of existing customers with Sky Q, Sky Stream or Sky Glass subscriptions will get \"easy access\" to the new line-up as standard, she added. \"We're proud to continue Sky's legacy of innovation, making it easier than ever for people to enjoy the very best entertainment and best experience, all in one place.\" Sky plus the HBO Max Basic subscription with adverts, Disney+ Standard with adverts, Hayu, and Netflix Standard with adverts will be available together for new customers as part of Sky Ultimate TV from £24 a month, Sky has said, while existing customers will get access as part of their Sky TV subscription."

        "Content": "Strictly Come Dancing star Robin Windsor left a note saying the way he was treated when he was dropped from the show \"destroyed me\", an inquest has heard. The professional dancer was 44 when he was found dead in a hotel room in Shepherd's Bush, west London, in February 2024. Police found a note left in the room in which he said he had been \"fighting it\" since losing his job on the show, coroner Dr Anton van Dellen told jurors at West London Coroner's Court on Wednesday. Windsor joined Strictly in 2010 and danced with actresses Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Lisa Riley, as well as Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, in four series until 2013. He could not perform in the 2014 series because of a back injury and was dropped in 2015, though still danced with TV presenter Alison Hammond in the Christmas special that year. In a written statement read to the court earlier, Emmerdale actress Riley said Windsor's \"glow had gone\" after he was cut from the professional dancers' line-up. \"It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression,\" she said. Riley said Windsor told her about times of \"never feeling good enough\" and \"imposter syndrome\". \"One night he opened up, telling me of the horrific time he was molested by an old dance tutor and [he] felt his parents never really understood this,\" she said. \"Robin was and always has been very influenced by other men. It became a standing joke that he fell in love after three days.\" Read more from Sky News:'UK has been colonised by immigrants', says Sir Jim RatcliffeDad unlawfully killed British daughter after Trump row She said Windsor was insecure about his body and took steroids, which could put him in a bad place when combined with alcohol, adding he was \"drowning in debts\" and \"frantically\" spent money on designer items he could not afford. \"Money problems also played a part of his darker days,\" she said. \"He was drowning in debts which led to weekends I wouldn't hear from him.\" Summing up the evidence, coroner Dr van Dellen read parts of a written statement by Windsor's ex-boyfriend, X Factor star Marcus Collins, who said Windsor's mental health deteriorated when he was released from his Strictly contract. \"The day that he was informed that he was no longer required for Strictly really broke his spirit,\" Collins said. \"Robin's mental health was challenged almost constantly from this point and at times it altered his personality.\" After being approached by Sky News, a BBC spokesperson said: \"We wouldn't comment on an ongoing inquiry.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK. Alternatively, you can call Mind's support line on 0300 102 1234, or NHS on 111."

        "Content": "The Prince of Wales has visited a nature reserve on the final day of his first tour of Saudi Arabia to learn about a programme reintroducing endangered species. The future king toured the Sharaan Nature Reserve in the east of the country to hear about ongoing conservation initiatives aimed at protecting and reintroducing native species such as gazelles and the Arabian oryx. He was also told about a flagship programme to bring back the critically endangered Arabian leopard. The prince planted an acacia tree at the reserve as he was given details about ongoing efforts to protect its natural wildlife and landscape. William is also spending part of the day visiting the old town of AlUla, which features more than 900 mud‑brick houses and a historic citadel. The town has a network of narrow alleyways that formed a thriving settlement on the ancient incense road, the trade route that carried spices, textiles and aromatics across Arabia for centuries. The prince is also meeting local farmers during a tour of AlUla's Oasis and EcoGardening farm. The farmers were giving details to the prince about their belief in sustainable farming and on efforts to preserve their region's agricultural history. The trip has been overshadowed by the allegations surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew denies any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. The Prince and Princess of Wales attempted to make their position clear on the scandal on Monday when they issued their first public statement about it. A Kensington Palace spokesperson said they were \"deeply concerned by the continued revelations\", and \"their thoughts remain focused on the victims\"."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n \"Britain's loneliest sheep\" has given birth for the first time. Fiona won hearts across the globe when she was rescued from the foot of a steep coastal cliff close to the Cromarty Firth in the Scottish Highlands in 2023. Kayaker Jill Turner first spotted the stranded ewe in 2021 and then raised the alarm when she saw her on her own again two years later - which led to Fiona being dubbed \"Britain's loneliest sheep\". Fiona was winched to safety during a daring rescue mission and taken into the care of Dalscone Farm in Dumfries. The farm said she had now traded her title for \"world's best mum\" after giving birth to two healthy lambs - a boy and a girl - on Tuesday night. Dalscone Farm manager Ben Best told Sky News a vet was on hand to help Fiona give birth and she has since taken to her new role amazingly well after her nine-hour labour. He said: \"She's doing great. She was a superstar. \n                  Licences to control wild birds have been suspended following golden eagle's disappearance\n                 \n                  Police launch investigation after golden eagle found with shotgun injuries in Scottish Borders\n                 \n                  Puppy farming and trail hunting to be banned - but critics warn of 'war on the countryside'\n                 \"Now we're just making sure that they're happy and healthy, and that Fiona is maintaining good health as well. \"She's bounced back from her labour without any issues whatsoever. All the signs are great and we're making sure the lambs are thriving.\" Given Fiona's struggle to fully interact with other sheep, it is hoped she will enjoy a close bond with her own little family. Mr Best said: \"The whole reason we put her in lamb is so that she can get that bond with them and she'll have an amazing companionship going forward in her life. \"I think it's really going to make a massive difference to her quality of life as well. \"It's not a decision we took lightly. We had a lot of discussions about whether it was the right thing to do. \"But ultimately, for her as an animal, the best decision was to put her in lamb.\" Mr Best said the pressure had been \"intense\" over the past five months, especially as the \"eyes of the world\" would be watching. He added: \"It's been horrendous - it's been like a pressure cooker all the time just making sure she's okay. \"You see her lying in a funny position and you're like 'oh no, is she alright', and keeping her energy levels up and making sure she's optimum health for going into lambing. \"And actually now looking at it, now she's had the lambs, her pregnancy was incredibly straightforward. She did great. There were no issues whatsoever.\" Read more from Sky News:Police probe after golden eagle found with shotgun injuriesViews sought on potential reintroduction of lynx to Scotland Mr Best said they are yet to decide what the twin lambs will be called. With Fiona being named after Cameron Diaz's character in Shrek, consideration is being given to name the newborns after the animated couple's children. In the film, Shrek and Princess Fiona have triplets - Fergus, Farkle and Felicia. Mr Best said: \"We could name them after Shrek's children, which is Fergus and Felicia. \"Or we could name the boy Cliff and the girl Brora [a Highland village north of where Fiona was found].\""
