        "Content": " A police officer has been injured after a night of violent protests outside an asylum hotel in Dublin - with six arrests made. Bricks were thrown and fireworks were discharged outside the Citywest Hotel - with glass bottles used as missiles and a police van set on fire. A Garda helicopter was also targeted with lasers, and the police service says some of those on the streets were seen carrying garden forks. Commissioner Justin Kelly added: \"This was obviously not a peaceful protest. The actions this evening can only be described as thuggery. This was a mob intent on violence. \"We will now begin the process of identifying those who committed crimes and we will bring those involved in this violence to justice.\" It is the second night of demonstrations after an alleged sexual assault in its vicinity in the early hours of Monday morning. Some of the crowd threw stones and other missiles at the public order officers as they moved the protesters back - and water cannon was deployed at the scene. \n                  As food delivery drones take off in Ireland, here are the most popular items\n                 \n                  Dublin Airport terminal reopens after evacuation during security incident\n                 \n                  Conor McGregor says he wants to be Ireland's next president\n                 A line of officers was preventing the protesters from approaching the hotel. Ireland correspondent There had been a small protest on Monday outside the former Citywest Hotel, now an asylum centre, but last night's felt very different. The 26-year-old man who allegedly attacked the young girl had appeared in court yesterday morning, charged with sexual assault. He can't be named but an Arabic translator was requested. Anger grew online, and another protest was called. It's hard to get a clear estimate of numbers, partly due to the street geography around the former hotel, but it's thought up to 2,000 attended. Most were peaceful, some were not. After a Garda van was torched, a major policing operation began.  The smell of fireworks hung in the air as youths hurled missiles at the Gardai. A Garda water cannon truck was deployed for the first time in the Republic of Ireland, parked visibly behind the riot officers. I spoke to local residents who had reasonable concerns about the influx of asylum seekers to the community in recent years. Most did not approve of violent protest, but they articulated the anger and pain felt by many here after the attack on the young girl.  Although it has not been confirmed officially that the accused is an asylum seeker, most of the local residents had the same message: the enemy is not necessarily those who come to Ireland, rather it's the perceived open-doors policy of the Irish government.  'Those involved will be brought to justice' Ireland's premier, Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin, paid tribute to the officers who were on the frontline of the protests. \"There can be no justification for the vile abuse against them, or the attempted assaults and attacks on members of the force that will shock all right-thinking people,\" he said. Justice minister Jim O'Callaghan said those involved in the violence will be brought to justice. \"The scenes of public disorder we have witnessed at Citywest must be condemned,\" he said. \"People threw missiles at Gardai, threw fireworks at them and set a Garda vehicle on fire. \"This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the Gardai. \"Those involved will be brought to justice.\" 'No excuse' for violence The minister said a man had been arrested and had appeared in court in relation to the alleged assault in the vicinity of the hotel. He added: \"While I am not in a position to comment any further on this criminal investigation, I have been advised that there is no ongoing threat to public safety in the area.\" He said attacks on officers would \"not be tolerated\", adding: \"Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy. Violence is not. \"There is no excuse for the scenes we have witnessed.\" The demonstration on Monday night passed without a significant incident. It comes two years after anti-immigrant demonstrators triggered a major riot in the centre of Dublin after three young children were stabbed."

The use of the British-supplied weapons will likely trigger new threats and condemnation from the Kremlin. The UK gave Ukraine permission to use its Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia last year, with the first known strikes happening in November. John Healey, the British defence secretary, on Monday said Vladimir Putin regards the UK as his \"number one enemy\" because of its support for Ukraine. The Ukrainian attack on Tuesday also comes as US President Donald Trump appeared to shelve a plan to meet his Russian counterpart to discuss a peace deal on Ukraine within the next fortnight - and instead prepares to host Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, in Washington today. Ukraine's general staff said the target of the strike was a chemical plant in the Russian region of Bryansk, which produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in Russian ammunition and missiles. \"A massive combined missile and airstrike was carried out, including the use of air-launched Storm Shadow missiles, which successfully penetrated the Russian air defence system,\" it said in a post on social media. \n                  Putin-Trump Budapest meeting in doubt as official says 'no plan for immediate future'\n                 \n                  Exiled Russian oligarch: Putin has sent signal to Trump that he's ready for Ukraine deal\n                 \n                  Donald Trump responds to idea of tunnel connecting Russia and US \n                 \"The outcome of the strike is being assessed.\" Read more:UK ready to send troops to UkraineUkraine can't win, says Trump Images on social media purport to show flames billowing out of the facility.

John Healey, the defence secretary, revealed the deployment barely a week after Yvette Cooper, the new foreign secretary, said the UK had \"no plans\" to send soldiers. The British Major General will work as the deputy to a US commander, who is tasked with running a civil-military coordination centre that is also expected to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The ceasefire deal, brokered by Donald Trump, between Hamas and Israel has created the \"opportunity for a long-term peace\", Mr Healey said. \"We have specialist experience and skills that we have offered to contribute,\" he said, answering questions after delivering a lecture on wider defence issues to business leaders at an event in London on Monday evening. The defence secretary said: \"We can contribute to the monitoring of the ceasefire. That is likely to be led by others. \"We have also, in response to the American request, put a first rate two-star officer into a civilian-military command, as the deputy commander. \n                  'Security breach' as intruders cut fence to steal fuel from Larkhill Camp army garrison\n                 \n                  'Trailblazing' female Army officer killed in Surrey car crash\n                 \n                  Britain is buying new air defence missile systems - but can they protect us?\n                 \"So Britain will play an anchor role, contribute the specialist experience and skills where we can.

One official said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza. It is separate to a planned international stabilisation force that would deploy into the territory to help secure the peace. That force is a key part of Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan. In a sign of potential problems, though, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that countries that might contribute soldiers to the international force are nervous about putting boots on the ground while Hamas remains an armed group. The arrival of British troops in Israel comes as the ceasefire deal remains under pressure, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching its terms. Israel briefly resumed airstrikes over the weekend after its troops were reported to have come under attack. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza yesterday reported more than 50 deaths in the last 24 hours."

        "Headline": "The Metropolitan Police has said it was \"actively looking into the claims\" after it reported Andrew asked an officer to help with an attempted smear campaign against Virginia Giuffre.",
        "Content": "By Rhiannon Mills, royal correspondent, Jordan Milne, royal producer, and Rebecca Spencer, producer   A current senior member of the King's household was the head of royal protection at the time Prince Andrew allegedly asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Virginia Guiffre, Sky News has discovered. Lord Peter Rosslyn, who is now Lord Steward and Personal Secretary to the King and Queen, was head of Royalty and Diplomatic Protection between 2003-2014. It is not clear if Lord Rosslyn - known at the time as Commander Peter Loughborough - was made aware of Prince Andrew's request. However, it reportedly happened in 2011 when it's claimed Andrew wrote in an email that he passed the date of birth and confidential social security number of his accuser, Virginia Guiffre, to one of his close protection team to find out information about her. At the weekend, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively looking into the claims made\". Sky News approached Lord Rosslyn for comment, which was passed to Buckingham Palace. A palace spokesperson said: \"As you may or may not be aware, Lord Rosslyn works for The Royal Household and thus this issue has been referred to me. However, since this matter relates to his time in service with the Metropolitan Police, they would be the appropriate body to approach with media enquiries of this nature.\" The Met Police had nothing further to add. Police sources have told Sky News the officer (CPO) involved would have been expected to escalate this request from Andrew to his superiors. While there may have been other members of senior staff between the CPO and Lord Rosslyn, the request should have been considered serious enough to be referred to the top of the Royalty and Diplomatic Service. Those with knowledge of the royal household tell us Lord Rosslyn is one of the King's closest and most trusted members of staff. His role as Lord Steward involves managing all aspects of the King's personal affairs, and the non-state business of the monarch. Who is Lord Peter Rosslyn? As well as being much respected by Queen Elizabeth II, and affectionately known as her \"favourite policeman\", in 2014 Lord Rosslyn was appointed as Master of the Household of the then Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House. In February 2003, he was made Lord Steward by the King, thereby becoming the \"first dignitary of the King's court\" - a sign that the monarch wanted to keep him around. While Andrew's alleged attempts to smear Virginia Guiffre would have been morally wrong, he also would have been asking his police officer to put his career on the line. Any attempt to use police databases to find information on an innocent individual not connected to a crime would have been a sackable offence, and unlawful. In his statement on Friday, Prince Andrew again stressed that he vehemently denies the allegations against him. A Buckingham Palace source told Sky News that the recent claims that have emerged are being viewed by the Royal Family with \"very serious and grave concern\" and \"should be examined in the proper and fullest ways\". Andrew should give evidence to US authorities - minister The revelation comes as a government minister said Andrew should give evidence to US authorities - and anger grows after it emerged he had been paying \"peppercorn rent\" for two decades. On Friday, Andrew announced he was giving up his royal titles, including the Duke of York, after new, damaging reports about his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Passages from the memoir released on Tuesday of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her, provide further details of their alleged encounters. Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied the allegations. Business Secretary Peter Kyle said on Tuesday he would \"support\" Prince Andrew giving evidence to US prosecutors. He added he would also support any decision by the Met Police to investigate allegations that Prince Andrew used a Met bodyguard to gain information on Giuffre. It comes as anger continues to grow over Prince Andrew's housing arrangements.  'Peppercorn rent' The royal has only paid \"peppercorn rent\" for more than two decades at his Windsor mansion, according to a National Audit Office report published in 2005. \"Peppercorn rent\" is a legal term used in leases to show that rent technically exists, so the lease is valid, but it's nominal, often literally ¬£1 a year or just a symbolic amount. In practice, it means the tenant pays no rent. It also shows he was required to pay a further ¬£7.5m for refurbishments. A document from the Crown Estate also shows he signed a 75-year lease on the property in 2003. It reveals he paid ¬£1m for the lease and that since then he has paid \"one peppercorn\" of rent \"if demanded\" per year. Read More:Pressure grows on Andrew to be stripped of dukedomKey claims from Andrew accuser's posthumous memoir The agreement also contains a clause which states the Crown Estate would have to pay Andrew around ¬£558,000 if he gave up the lease. Pressure is mounting on him to give up the 30-bedroom mansion. Senior Tory Robert Jenrick called for Prince Andrew to live privately. 'He has disgraced himself' He said: \"It's about time Prince Andrew took himself off to live in private and make his own way in life. \"He has disgraced himself, he has embarrassed the royal family time and again. I don't see why the taxpayer, frankly, should continue to foot the bill at all. The public are sick of him.\" Mr Kyle, however, said that would be a question for King Charles. But he did say MPs could bring forward a motion to strip Prince Andrew of his remaining titles, adding it would be up to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to choose one of these motions for debate."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  The maker of the world's most popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot has launched a web browser, potentially accelerating the change in how people search and access information. OpenAI, the company behind the pioneering ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, has launched its new internet browser, called Atlas. It will feel familiar to users of the world's most used internet browsing portal, Google Chrome, with the use of tabs and the ability to go into an \"incognito\" mode so viewing activity is not recorded.   \"Atlas should feel very familiar,\" its product lead, Adam Fry, said. \"So it has all of your tabs, bookmarks, autofill for passwords, all the things you're used to.\" ChatGPT has been incorporated into the design of Atlas, not just \"bolted on\", another of its creators said. \n                  'Treat adult users like adults': ChatGPT to write erotica\n                 \n                  Family sue OpenAI over teenager's death after he confided in ChatGPT\n                 \n                  OpenAI releases long-awaited GPT-5 AI chatbot upgrade\n                 \"We wanted to make sure that Atlas didn't feel like your old browser, just with a chat button that was bolted on,\" its lead engineer Ben Goodger said. That means no need to copy and paste between tabs, with ChatGPT available on every page for any text box on the internet. Through the homepage, users can search their viewing history. Users' activity on Atlas will be embedded in the experience. \"It should really feel like a natural extension of myself,\" said OpenAI's Will Ellsworth, the research lead for the AI agent in Atlas. Use of an AI 'agent' means artificial intelligence could research, plan or book activities. So-called natural language controls mean people can access information by using prompts personal to them, such as \"re-open shoes I looked at yesterday\". Who can use it and when? It's currently available for Apple Mac users across the world. Even those signed up to the free version of ChatGPT can access Atlas. Those paying for ChatGPT via OpenAI's plus and pro packages can make use of the AI agent feature. A time for when Atlas will be available on Windows, the iPhone's iOS operating system and on Android has not been given. Why does it matter? Using an AI chatbot to search the internet is different and can yield different results than traditional search via a search engine. Increased use of generative AI for search could mean some websites lose out on traffic and could change the way people use the internet. While AI has become more energy efficient, it still uses far more electricity than traditional search. The rising adoption of AI has outpaced potential energy efficiency improvements. It is a serious challenger for Google, which had faced the threat of selling its Chrome browser after a US court found its search business was an illegal monopoly. Just the start OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman said: \"There's a lot more to add. This is still early days for this project.\" Google has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Britain has sent a senior commander and a small number of troops to Israel to help international efforts to monitor a fragile Gaza ceasefire following an American request. John Healey, the defence secretary, revealed the deployment barely a week after Yvette Cooper, the new foreign secretary, said the UK had \"no plans\" to send soldiers. The British Major General will work as the deputy to a US commander, who is tasked with running a civil-military coordination centre that is also expected to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The ceasefire deal, brokered by Donald Trump, between Hamas and Israel has created the \"opportunity for a long-term peace\", Mr Healey said. \"We have specialist experience and skills that we have offered to contribute,\" he said, answering questions after delivering a lecture on wider defence issues to business leaders at an event in London on Monday evening. The defence secretary said: \"We can contribute to the monitoring of the ceasefire. That is likely to be led by others. \"We have also, in response to the American request, put a first rate two-star officer into a civilian-military command, as the deputy commander. \n                  'Security breach' as intruders cut fence to steal fuel from Larkhill Camp army garrison\n                 \n                  'Trailblazing' female Army officer killed in Surrey car crash\n                 \n                  Britain is buying new air defence missile systems - but can they protect us?\n                 \"So Britain will play an anchor role, contribute the specialist experience and skills where we can. We don't expect to be leading... but we will play our part.\"  The British officer is being accompanied by a small team of UK military personnel, with expertise in planning. The United States, for its part, is sending up to 200 troops to Israel. They will not enter Gaza. Read more:'Heavy force' could enter Gaza, says TrumpIsrael identifies hostage's body The British contingent will also not be operating inside the strip. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"A small number of UK planning officers have embedded in the US led CMCC, Civil Military Coordination Centre, including a 2* deputy commander to ensure that the UK remains integrated into the US led planning efforts for Gaza post-conflict stability. \"The UK continues to work with international partners to support the Gaza ceasefire to see where the UK can best contribute to the peace process.\" Details about the US plans - headed by Central Command - to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory emerged after Mr Trump brokered a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel on 10 October. One official said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza. It is separate to a planned international stabilisation force that would deploy into the territory to help secure the peace. That force is a key part of Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan. In a sign of potential problems, though, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that countries that might contribute soldiers to the international force are nervous about putting boots on the ground while Hamas remains an armed group. The arrival of British troops in Israel comes as the ceasefire deal remains under pressure, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching its terms. Israel briefly resumed airstrikes over the weekend after its troops were reported to have come under attack. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza yesterday reported more than 50 deaths in the last 24 hours."

        "Headline": "The Metropolitan Police has said it was \"actively looking into the claims\" after it reported Andrew asked an officer to help with an attempted smear campaign against Virginia Giuffre.",
        "Content": "By Rhiannon Mills, royal correspondent, Jordan Milne, royal producer, and Rebecca Spencer, producer   A current senior member of the King's household was the head of royal protection at the time Prince Andrew allegedly asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Virginia Guiffre, Sky News has discovered. Lord Peter Rosslyn, who is now Lord Steward and Personal Secretary to the King and Queen, was head of Royalty and Diplomatic Protection between 2003-2014. It is not clear if Lord Rosslyn - known at the time as Commander Peter Loughborough - was made aware of Prince Andrew's request. However, it reportedly happened in 2011 when it's claimed Andrew wrote in an email that he passed the date of birth and confidential social security number of his accuser, Virginia Guiffre, to one of his close protection team to find out information about her. At the weekend, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively looking into the claims made\". Sky News approached Lord Rosslyn for comment, which was passed to Buckingham Palace. A palace spokesperson said: \"As you may or may not be aware, Lord Rosslyn works for The Royal Household and thus this issue has been referred to me. However, since this matter relates to his time in service with the Metropolitan Police, they would be the appropriate body to approach with media enquiries of this nature.\" The Met Police had nothing further to add. Police sources have told Sky News the officer (CPO) involved would have been expected to escalate this request from Andrew to his superiors. While there may have been other members of senior staff between the CPO and Lord Rosslyn, the request should have been considered serious enough to be referred to the top of the Royalty and Diplomatic Service. Those with knowledge of the royal household tell us Lord Rosslyn is one of the King's closest and most trusted members of staff. His role as Lord Steward involves managing all aspects of the King's personal affairs, and the non-state business of the monarch. Who is Lord Peter Rosslyn? As well as being much respected by Queen Elizabeth II, and affectionately known as her \"favourite policeman\", in 2014 Lord Rosslyn was appointed as Master of the Household of the then Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House. In February 2003, he was made Lord Steward by the King, thereby becoming the \"first dignitary of the King's court\" - a sign that the monarch wanted to keep him around. While Andrew's alleged attempts to smear Virginia Guiffre would have been morally wrong, he also would have been asking his police officer to put his career on the line. Any attempt to use police databases to find information on an innocent individual not connected to a crime would have been a sackable offence, and unlawful. In his statement on Friday, Prince Andrew again stressed that he vehemently denies the allegations against him. A Buckingham Palace source told Sky News that the recent claims that have emerged are being viewed by the Royal Family with \"very serious and grave concern\" and \"should be examined in the proper and fullest ways\". Andrew should give evidence to US authorities - minister The revelation comes as a government minister said Andrew should give evidence to US authorities - and anger grows after it emerged he had been paying \"peppercorn rent\" for two decades. On Friday, Andrew announced he was giving up his royal titles, including the Duke of York, after new, damaging reports about his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Passages from the memoir released on Tuesday of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her, provide further details of their alleged encounters. Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied the allegations. Business Secretary Peter Kyle said on Tuesday he would \"support\" Prince Andrew giving evidence to US prosecutors. He added he would also support any decision by the Met Police to investigate allegations that Prince Andrew used a Met bodyguard to gain information on Giuffre. It comes as anger continues to grow over Prince Andrew's housing arrangements.  'Peppercorn rent' The royal has only paid \"peppercorn rent\" for more than two decades at his Windsor mansion, according to a National Audit Office report published in 2005. \"Peppercorn rent\" is a legal term used in leases to show that rent technically exists, so the lease is valid, but it's nominal, often literally ¬£1 a year or just a symbolic amount. In practice, it means the tenant pays no rent. It also shows he was required to pay a further ¬£7.5m for refurbishments. A document from the Crown Estate also shows he signed a 75-year lease on the property in 2003. It reveals he paid ¬£1m for the lease and that since then he has paid \"one peppercorn\" of rent \"if demanded\" per year. Read More:Pressure grows on Andrew to be stripped of dukedomKey claims from Andrew accuser's posthumous memoir The agreement also contains a clause which states the Crown Estate would have to pay Andrew around ¬£558,000 if he gave up the lease. Pressure is mounting on him to give up the 30-bedroom mansion. Senior Tory Robert Jenrick called for Prince Andrew to live privately. 'He has disgraced himself' He said: \"It's about time Prince Andrew took himself off to live in private and make his own way in life. \"He has disgraced himself, he has embarrassed the royal family time and again. I don't see why the taxpayer, frankly, should continue to foot the bill at all. The public are sick of him.\" Mr Kyle, however, said that would be a question for King Charles. But he did say MPs could bring forward a motion to strip Prince Andrew of his remaining titles, adding it would be up to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to choose one of these motions for debate."

Economists forecast that consumer price inflation (CPI) will have reached double the Bank of England's target in September, driven up from the 3.8% recorded in August by rising fuel and food inflation. Speaking ahead of publication of the figures by the Office for National Statistics, a Treasury spokesman said that bringing down inflation was a priority, and the chancellor would convene a meeting of key cabinet colleagues on Thursday to stress its importance across government. The spokesman specified that action to bring down energy prices was among the options being considered, the strongest indication yet that action on soaring consumer bills will feature in next month's budget. Politics latest: Boris Johnson left in 'homicidal mood' after exam result fiasco  The chancellor is understood to be considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on bills to zero, a move that would save billpayers around ¬£80 a year and cost ¬£2.5bn to implement. Labour's manifesto promised it would cut bills by ¬£300 a year, but the last Ofgem price review saw a small increase driven by policy costs, leaving the government under pressure to reduce the impact of domestic energy rates that are the second-highest in Europe. The spokesman said: \"The chancellor's view is that tackling the cost of living is urgent, and everything is on the table - including measures to bring down energy bills. She's getting the whole of government to play its part, it's her number one focus.\" The chancellor's actions are a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday's inflation figures will be a difficult moment for a government that came to power promising to bring down the cost of living. After peaking at more than 11% in October 2022, CPI returned to the Bank's target of 2% in May last year, two months before Labour took office. After briefly falling below 2% in September 2024 as higher energy prices from a year earlier dropped out of the calculation, it has marched steadily upwards, largely driven by energy and food prices. Read more analysis:First test of chancellor's 'securonomics' policy does not bode wellThe pros and cons of digital IDs - and do we need them? The Bank of England has forecast that this September's figures will mark the peak of this inflation cycle for the same reason, with the Ofgem energy cap rising less this October than a year ago. That underlines the importance of gas and electricity bills to household finances, the official figures and the government's energy policy. Campaigners and some energy companies have urged the government to bring down electricity bills by shifting levies for renewables and funding for social programs to general taxation, a move estimated to cost ¬£6bn. The Conservatives have said they would cut levies that currently pay for carbon taxes and older forms of renewable power subsidy, cutting bills by ¬£165 a year."

Ms Goddard also expressed deep reservations about the shortlisted chairs for the inquiry. Her resignation came after Sky News revealed the two leading candidates were former police chief Jim Gamble and social worker Annie Hudson, who were due to meet the survivors panel on Tuesday, before Ms Hudson withdrew from the running. Some survivors expressed concern that the two candidates' backgrounds in policing and social work might lead to conflicts of interest."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n Aston Villa never said if they supported or opposed the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans but now they are dealing with the fallout and implications of the divisive decision by authorities in Birmingham. It brings further challenges to staging one of the most politically highly charged football matches seen in England. Villa say tickets will only be sold to supporters who bought them for their games before this season. No away section will be occupied after Maccabi opted to reject tickets regardless of whether the ban is overturned. But Sky News today found tickets already being traded on the secondary market for under ¬£100, which opens up the possibility of fans of the Israeli club still being able to gain entry to the Europa League match on 6 November. Villa, though, issued this warning: \"The displaying of political symbols, messages or flags during the match is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate ejection and the issuing of a stadium ban.\" That effectively bans the flags of the countries playing the UEFA match - England and Israel. Villa did not respond to further requests for comment. \n                  British troops deployed to Israel to 'monitor Gaza ceasefire' after US request\n                 \n                  Shrinking herds and rising costs: The beef market is in turmoil - and inflation is spiralling \n                 \n                  'Don't tell anyone': Manager at UK's largest housing association told staff to fake fire safety files\n                 Their website statement said guidance from European football's governing body is being followed. But that is open to interpretation. Would this be allowed? A banner saying: \"Stop killing children. Stop killing civilians.\" To some it could be political, being a reference to Israel's war on Gaza without mentioning any conflict. But it was displayed by UEFA itself on the pitch before the Super Cup in August linked to Palestinian refugees from Gaza being part of the medal ceremony. UEFA insisted it was not a political message. A \"Free Palestine\" banner displayed by Paris Saint-Germain fans last season resulted in no UEFA punishment. Celtic also faced no action for a \"show Israel the red card\" banner - a slogan also pitch-side for Maccabi's game in Greece last month at PAOK. So the same messaging, or similar, should be allowed by Villa on those precedents. Policing banners and activism in the stadium will be fraught, but the bigger challenges could be on the streets of Birmingham. It could still retain its status as a high-risk game - as classified by West Midlands Police - even without the official presence of Maccabi fans. There is no ban on Israelis being in Birmingham, trying to watch the game in bars or restaurants in Maccabi shirts. Could that bring confrontations? They were a target of violence in Amsterdam last season around a match against Ajax. Maccabi fans were also filmed chanting abusively about Arabs and Gaza in particular. Read more:Why have Maccabi fans been banned?Maccabi will not sell tickets to Aston Villa game There will be the anticipation of pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrations around Birmingham on 6 November. A shopping street near Villa Park already featured Palestinian flags when Sky News recently visited. There are still calls, including from Aston's independent MP Ayoub Khan, for all Israeli teams to be banned from European competitions over the deaths in the Gaza war. Sky News revealed a push for a UEFA vote by European football officials that was abandoned as a Gaza peace deal was adopted.  For Maccabi Tel Aviv, there are fears their cause could be appropriated by figures whose backing they reject. Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was in Israel to address a rally in Tel Aviv last week and was pictured in a Maccabi shirt. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, called Robinson \"a thug who represents the very worst of Britain\" while criticising an Israeli minister for inviting the right-wing, anti-Islam activist. Without directly referencing Robinson, Maccabi said: \"We are... concerned about the intervention of divisive figures who do not represent the values of our club. We condemn all abhorrent views that have no place in football.\" That did also mean the club last night looking inwards in the statement rejecting any tickets, acknowledging there was a \"more extreme elements of our fan base\" and saying they had to stamp out racism. Additionally problematic for Maccabi was the unrest around the Tel Aviv derby at the weekend, even if they blame rivals Hapoel for being the main instigators of violence and setting off the pyrotechnics that forced the game to be abandoned. But Maccabi decried the \"toxic atmosphere\" and \"inflammatory rhetoric\" which meant they deemed it no longer safe for their own fans to be at Villa Park on 6 November. And Israel's embassy in London complained about \"racist rhetoric voiced by some members of parliament and local councils\" while claiming \"extremists have turned football‚Ä¶ into a platform for intimidation\". Sir Keir Starmer's government is concerned how the game had been \"weaponised to stoke violence and fear\". The rhetoric is far from being toned down. This is a fraught fixture that has already pitted Westminster politicians against the police, developed into a diplomatic row and stoked new concerns about the safety of Jews in Britain. And there are still two weeks until the match is due to be played."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The chairman of the Sheku Bayoh Inquiry has stepped down from the role - two months after refusing to quit. The Scottish Police Federation (SPF), which represents rank-and-file officers, had previously called for Lord Bracadale to recuse himself amid concerns over his impartiality. Complaints had been made the former judge had privately met with Mr Bayoh's family on five occasions since the inquiry began. Father-of-two Mr Bayoh, 31, died after he was restrained by around six police officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 2015. The Crown Office decided not to take legal action against the officers involved following an investigation, but the circumstances surrounding the death - including how it was investigated and whether race played a factor - are being examined at the inquiry. Two months on after refusing the application to recuse himself, Lord Bracadale has now tendered his resignation to Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes. It comes after the SPF raised a judicial review of his decision in August. \n                  Lorna Slater gave 'emphatic ' assurance to Biffa about Scotland's bottle return scheme, court told\n                 \n                  Brandon McLachlan: Man jailed for stabbing a father to death outside Airdrie nightclub\n                 \n                  Rare glossy ibis birds spotted in part of Scotland for first time\n                 In his letter to Ms Forbes, Lord Bracadale wrote: \"As the judicial review process developed it became clear that the concerns about my conduct had not been allayed by my decision and that the criticisms have persisted. \"As a result, it is now clear to me that many of the core participants have lost confidence in my conduct of the inquiry to such an extent that it cannot be retrieved.\" All evidence has now been led at the inquiry. The next stage is closing submissions followed by preparation of the report by the chair. Lord Bracadale wrote: \"I am concerned that the majority of core participants would have no confidence in the findings of any report prepared by me. \"I consider that that, in turn, would be likely to have a damaging effect on public confidence in the findings of a report prepared by me and recommendations flowing from it. \"In my view the best interests of the inquiry would be served by the appointment of a new chair to whom the existing evidence, all of which is available on tape and transcript, would be available.\" Lord Bracadale said the purpose of his meetings with the families was to \"obtain and retain their confidence in the inquiry and their engagement with it\". He claimed the families had \"already lost confidence\" in Police Scotland, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). Lord Bracadale wrote: \"As the inquiry progressed it became apparent at various points that they were losing confidence in the inquiry and were likely to cease engaging with it. \"I consider that if I had not had meetings with members of the families, it is likely that they would have walked out of the inquiry.\" He added: \"I very much regret that my conduct in relation to meeting the families for what I considered to be a reasonable purpose of maintaining their engagement with the inquiry has led to a loss of confidence by other core participants in my position as chair.\" Read more from Sky News:Teeth-whitening salon boss jailed for series of sex attacksMan jailed for plotting to rape and murder TV star loses appeal Lord Bracadale said much had been achieved in the inquiry so far. He highlighted how former Police Scotland chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone admitted the force was \"institutionally racist\" and had embarked on a programme to address that. Lord Bracadale concluded: \"I very much hope that the Scottish ministers will be able to appoint a new chair in early course in order to restore the confidence of all the core participants in the inquiry and that the families of Sheku Bayoh will continue to engage with and participate in the inquiry under a new chair. The initial application for Lord Bracadale to recuse himself was made by the SPF, PC Craig Walker and former officer Nicole Short. David Kennedy, general secretary of the SPF, said: \"It is unfortunate for all those involved in the inquiry that this situation has occurred. \"The meetings between Lord Bracadale and the family of Sheku Bayoh had created an appearance of bias. We look forward to the final stages of the inquiry and bringing this matter to a conclusion.\" Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who represents the family of Mr Bayoh, said his clients were \"devastated\" by Lord Bracadale's decision. He said: \"Over 10 years ago, Sheku Bayoh died in police hands and his family have fought for the truth and justice ever since.\" Mr Anwar added the family will \"consider its position overnight and make a full statement\" on Wednesday."

        "Content": " A police officer has been injured after a night of violent protests outside an asylum hotel in Dublin - with six arrests made. Bricks were thrown and fireworks were discharged outside the Citywest Hotel - with glass bottles used as missiles and a police van set on fire. A Garda helicopter was also targeted with lasers, and the police service says some of those on the streets were seen carrying garden forks. Commissioner Justin Kelly added: \"This was obviously not a peaceful protest. The actions this evening can only be described as thuggery. This was a mob intent on violence. \"We will now begin the process of identifying those who committed crimes and we will bring those involved in this violence to justice.\" It is the second night of demonstrations after an alleged sexual assault in its vicinity in the early hours of Monday morning. Some of the crowd threw stones and other missiles at the public order officers as they moved the protesters back - and water cannon was deployed at the scene. \n                  As food delivery drones take off in Ireland, here are the most popular items\n                 \n                  Dublin Airport terminal reopens after evacuation during security incident\n                 \n                  Conor McGregor says he wants to be Ireland's next president\n                 A line of officers was preventing the protesters from approaching the hotel. Ireland correspondent There had been a small protest on Monday outside the former Citywest Hotel, now an asylum centre, but last night's felt very different. The 26-year-old man who allegedly attacked the young girl had appeared in court yesterday morning, charged with sexual assault. He can't be named but an Arabic translator was requested. Anger grew online, and another protest was called. It's hard to get a clear estimate of numbers, partly due to the street geography around the former hotel, but it's thought up to 2,000 attended. Most were peaceful, some were not. After a Garda van was torched, a major policing operation began.  The smell of fireworks hung in the air as youths hurled missiles at the Gardai. A Garda water cannon truck was deployed for the first time in the Republic of Ireland, parked visibly behind the riot officers. I spoke to local residents who had reasonable concerns about the influx of asylum seekers to the community in recent years. Most did not approve of violent protest, but they articulated the anger and pain felt by many here after the attack on the young girl.  Although it has not been confirmed officially that the accused is an asylum seeker, most of the local residents had the same message: the enemy is not necessarily those who come to Ireland, rather it's the perceived open-doors policy of the Irish government.  'Those involved will be brought to justice' Ireland's premier, Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin, paid tribute to the officers who were on the frontline of the protests. \"There can be no justification for the vile abuse against them, or the attempted assaults and attacks on members of the force that will shock all right-thinking people,\" he said. Justice minister Jim O'Callaghan said those involved in the violence will be brought to justice. \"The scenes of public disorder we have witnessed at Citywest must be condemned,\" he said. \"People threw missiles at Gardai, threw fireworks at them and set a Garda vehicle on fire. \"This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the Gardai. \"Those involved will be brought to justice.\" 'No excuse' for violence The minister said a man had been arrested and had appeared in court in relation to the alleged assault in the vicinity of the hotel. He added: \"While I am not in a position to comment any further on this criminal investigation, I have been advised that there is no ongoing threat to public safety in the area.\" He said attacks on officers would \"not be tolerated\", adding: \"Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy. Violence is not. \"There is no excuse for the scenes we have witnessed.\" The demonstration on Monday night passed without a significant incident. It comes two years after anti-immigrant demonstrators triggered a major riot in the centre of Dublin after three young children were stabbed."

        "Content": "There are no plans for Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to meet in person in the near future, according to a White House official. The US leader later shed further light on the issue when asked why his planned summit in Hungary had been put on hold. He said he did not want to have a wasted meeting, telling reporters in the Oval Office he had not made a determination about the talks he had wanted to hold. The presidents last week agreed to meet in Budapest after a phone call Mr Trump called \"extremely frank and trustful\".  The US leader suggested it was possible it could happen within a fortnight, though no date was set. However, it appears that's now off the table - and there are fears the meeting could be shelved altogether due to Russia's rigid stance on the Ukraine war. The White House official, speaking to Sky's US partner network NBC, said secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had spoken on Tuesday. The call was described as \"productive\" but the official added there was no plan for the presidents to meet \"in the immediate future\". The last Trump-Putin meeting was in Alaska in August, but it ended without any meaningful progress towards a ceasefire. The Budapest plan was announced shortly before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington last Friday to try to get approval for long-range Tomahawk missiles.  Mr Zelenskyy accused the Russian leader of acting out of fear Ukraine could get the green light and the ability to hit targets far deeper into Russia. In his nightly address on Tuesday, he said Russia \"almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy\" after it became clear Mr Trump had backed away from any decision on the Tomahawks.  Two US officials told Reuters that plans for the Budapest meeting had stalled over Russia's insistence any peace deal must give it control of all of the Donbas region. Those terms are said to have been reiterated over the weekend in a private communique known as a \"no paper\". üëâ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app üëà  The Kremlin's refusal to budge effectively rejects Mr Trump's latest assessment that the frontlines should be frozen as they are. The president shifted position last week after previously telling the UN General Assembly that Ukraine could win back all the land it has lost. Read more:Putin's 'not so secret weapon' | Ukraine war Q&AUK 'ready to spend over ¬£100m' on possibly sending troops to Ukraine Ukraine and European nations issued a joint statement on Tuesday insisting \"international borders must not be changed by force\" and accusing Russia of \"stalling tactics\". But, in an apparent effort to keep the US leader onside, it added: \"We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.\"  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave the impression his country was in no rush to arrange another Trump-Putin meeting, saying on Tuesday \"preparation is needed, serious preparation\". Such talk is likely to increase concerns Russia does not want to stop fighting and is \"playing\" President Trump - all while continuing to launch drone barrages at Ukrainian cities. Russia currently holds about a fifth of Ukraine after its invasion in February in 2022. It also annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Meanwhile, NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte is travelling to Washington to meet with President Trump on Wednesday. He will \"discuss various aspects related to NATO's support to Ukraine and to the US-led efforts towards lasting peace\", an official for the alliance said."

John Healey, the defence secretary, revealed the deployment barely a week after Yvette Cooper, the new foreign secretary, said the UK had \"no plans\" to send soldiers. The British Major General will work as the deputy to a US commander, who is tasked with running a civil-military coordination centre that is also expected to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The ceasefire deal, brokered by Donald Trump, between Hamas and Israel has created the \"opportunity for a long-term peace\", Mr Healey said. \"We have specialist experience and skills that we have offered to contribute,\" he said, answering questions after delivering a lecture on wider defence issues to business leaders at an event in London on Monday evening.

One official said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza. It is separate to a planned international stabilisation force that would deploy into the territory to help secure the peace. That force is a key part of Mr Trump's 20-point peace plan. In a sign of potential problems, though, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that countries that might contribute soldiers to the international force are nervous about putting boots on the ground while Hamas remains an armed group. The arrival of British troops in Israel comes as the ceasefire deal remains under pressure, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching its terms. Israel briefly resumed airstrikes over the weekend after its troops were reported to have come under attack. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza yesterday reported more than 50 deaths in the last 24 hours."

OpenAI, the company behind the pioneering ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, has launched its new internet browser, called Atlas. It will feel familiar to users of the world's most used internet browsing portal, Google Chrome, with the use of tabs and the ability to go into an \"incognito\" mode so viewing activity is not recorded.   \"Atlas should feel very familiar,\" its product lead, Adam Fry, said. \"So it has all of your tabs, bookmarks, autofill for passwords, all the things you're used to.\" ChatGPT has been incorporated into the design of Atlas, not just \"bolted on\", another of its creators said. \n                  'Treat adult users like adults': ChatGPT to write erotica\n                 \n                  Family sue OpenAI over teenager's death after he confided in ChatGPT\n                 \n                  OpenAI releases long-awaited GPT-5 AI chatbot upgrade\n                 \"We wanted to make sure that Atlas didn't feel like your old browser, just with a chat button that was bolted on,\" its lead engineer Ben Goodger said. That means no need to copy and paste between tabs, with ChatGPT available on every page for any text box on the internet. Through the homepage, users can search their viewing history. Users' activity on Atlas will be embedded in the experience. \"It should really feel like a natural extension of myself,\" said OpenAI's Will Ellsworth, the research lead for the AI agent in Atlas. Use of an AI 'agent' means artificial intelligence could research, plan or book activities. So-called natural language controls mean people can access information by using prompts personal to them, such as \"re-open shoes I looked at yesterday\". Who can use it and when? It's currently available for Apple Mac users across the world. Even those signed up to the free version of ChatGPT can access Atlas. Those paying for ChatGPT via OpenAI's plus and pro packages can make use of the AI agent feature. A time for when Atlas will be available on Windows, the iPhone's iOS operating system and on Android has not been given. Why does it matter? Using an AI chatbot to search the internet is different and can yield different results than traditional search via a search engine. Increased use of generative AI for search could mean some websites lose out on traffic and could change the way people use the internet. While AI has become more energy efficient, it still uses far more electricity than traditional search. The rising adoption of AI has outpaced potential energy efficiency improvements. It is a serious challenger for Google, which had faced the threat of selling its Chrome browser after a US court found its search business was an illegal monopoly. Just the start OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman said: \"There's a lot more to add. This is still early days for this project.\" Google has been contacted for comment."

Five days ago the head of the Association of German Banks told Reuters Europe's fragmented regulatory framework is holding them back. \"Many are holding back because Europe is still a patchwork of different national regulations,\" Heiner Herkenhoff said at the International Monetary Fund gathering. \"We urgently need to address this.\" Some in favour of Brexit had hoped that the UK leaving the EU would enable Britain to gain an economic advantage by ditching many of the bloc's standards and regulations but last year the government was forced to admit it would have to retain thousands of European Union laws for at least the next two years. Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose punishing tariffs on the EU, amid claims the US suffers from the impact of the bloc's standards. Last month, he threatened to reverse a trade deal he had struck with the body. The president said: \"We made a deal with the European Union where they're paying us almost a trillion dollars. And you know what? They're happy. It's done. These deals are all done,\" he said. \"I guess we'd have to unwind them.\" Earlier this year, The European Commission began a sweeping review of planned rules on corporate disclosures amid concerns they were holding back European companies from competing with other regions, and the EU Commission proposed changes that would exempt thousands of smaller European businesses from sustainability rules."

        "Content": "Eight countries have been added to a UK Foreign Office (FCDO) list warning Britons of a risk of methanol poisoning from tainted alcohol. Guidance has been added to the FCDO's travel pages for Ecuador, Kenya, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Uganda and Russia after an increase in cases of serious illness and death caused by alcoholic drinks tainted with methanol. The list previously only included methanol poisoning guidance for countries where British nationals have been affected. This included: Cambodia, Indonesia, Turkey, Costa Rica, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Fiji. Last year, British backpacker Simone White died in Laos, after reportedly drinking \"free shots\" from a local bar in the resort of Vang Vieng. The 28-year-old from Orpington, Kent, was one of four, including an Australian woman and two Danish women, who died after being treated for methanol poisoning. As part of the FCDO Travel Aware campaign, it is issuing information on recognising the symptoms and reducing the risks of methanol poisoning. Hamish Falconer, the minister responsible for consular and crisis, said: \"Methanol poisoning can kill - it can be difficult to detect when drinking and early symptoms mirror ordinary alcohol poisoning. By the time travellers realise the danger, it can be too late. \"I encourage all travellers to check our travel advice and Travel Aware pages before they go on holiday.\" What is methanol? Methanol, or CH3OH, is very similar to ethanol - the pure form of alcohol in alcoholic drinks. Like ethanol, it is an odourless, tasteless, and highly flammable liquid - but it has a different chemical structure that makes it toxic for humans. Otherwise known as wood alcohol, methanol is most often used to make solvents, pesticides, paint thinners, and alternative fuels. What makes it so dangerous is the way our bodies metabolise it. Once consumed, our enzymes metabolise methanol into formaldehyde, the substance used to make industrial glue and embalming substances, before breaking it down into formic acid. \"The formic acid upsets the acid balance in blood and the major consequence is initially the effect on someone's breathing. There are effects on many other organs, the kidney being one,\" says Professor Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds. \"Formaldehyde attacks nerves, particularly the optic nerve and blindness is a potential risk,\" he adds. How does it end up in alcoholic drinks? In southeast Asia and other popular tourist destinations, methanol can be found in alcoholic drinks for two main reasons. Firstly, it is cheaper than ethanol, so it is sometimes added instead to save costs, before the counterfeit alcohol is bottled and sold in shops and bars. Alternatively, it can occur by accident when alcohol is homemade - something common across the region. When alcohol is distilled and fermented without the appropriate monitoring, it can sometimes produce methanol in toxic quantities. Because it is impossible to tell the difference between methanol and ethanol content without specialist equipment, homemade drinks are often offered to tourists without anyone knowing how dangerous they are. What are the symptoms of methanol poisoning? Methanol is highly toxic, so as little as 25ml can prove fatal. Methanol poisoning can be treated by using ethanol to counter the effects on the body - but only within the first 10 to 30 hours after consumption. This makes early diagnosis and warnings to others critical. Some symptoms, however, can appear 12‚Äì48 hours after drinking. The most common symptoms are: ‚Ä¢ Vomiting and nausea;‚Ä¢ Changes in vision, including blurring, loss of sight, tunnel vision and difficulty looking at bright lights;‚Ä¢ Abdominal and muscle pain;‚Ä¢ Dizziness and confusion;‚Ä¢ Drowsiness and fatigue. Methanol poisoning symptoms are similar to those from alcohol poisoning - but are often more severe. If drinks were left unattended or your symptoms appear disproportionate to the amount you drank, it could be methanol poisoning, authorities warn. How is it treated? Professor Hay says treatment involves removing methanol from the blood via dialysis - while \"keeping someone mildly drunk\" by giving them ethanol at the same time. \"The principle behind administering ethanol is quite simple; it delays methanol metabolism,\" he says. \"Both alcohols are broken down by the same liver enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase. But the enzyme prefers ethanol. \"So ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor largely preventing methanol breakdown, but markedly slowing it down, allowing the body to vent methanol from the lungs and some through the kidneys, and a little through sweat.\" This avoids the process of methanol ultimately metabolising as formic acid, he adds. How can you avoid it while travelling? The most commonly affected drinks are: ‚Ä¢ Local spirits, such as rice and palm liquor, often labelled 'special' or 'happy' drinks;‚Ä¢ Spirit-based mixed drinks such as cocktails;‚Ä¢ Counterfeit brand-name bottled alcohol sold in bars and shops. In order to minimise risks, travellers should: ‚Ä¢ Buy alcohol only from licensed bars, hotels, or shops;‚Ä¢ Check labels for signs bottles may be counterfeit, including poor print quality or spelling errors;‚Ä¢ Avoid homemade alcohol;‚Ä¢ Check bottles are properly sealed before drinking from them;‚Ä¢ Avoid free drinks you have not seen poured yourself;‚Ä¢ Do not leave drinks or food unattended."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n Aston Villa never said if they supported or opposed the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans but now they are dealing with the fallout and implications of the divisive decision by authorities in Birmingham. It brings further challenges to staging one of the most politically highly charged football matches seen in England. Villa say tickets will only be sold to supporters who bought them for their games before this season. No away section will be occupied after Maccabi opted to reject tickets regardless of whether the ban is overturned. But Sky News today found tickets already being traded on the secondary market for under ¬£100, which opens up the possibility of fans of the Israeli club still being able to gain entry to the Europa League match on 6 November. Villa, though, issued this warning: \"The displaying of political symbols, messages or flags during the match is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate ejection and the issuing of a stadium ban.\" That effectively bans the flags of the countries playing the UEFA match - England and Israel. Villa did not respond to further requests for comment. \n                  British troops deployed to Israel to 'monitor Gaza ceasefire' after US request\n                 \n                  Shrinking herds and rising costs: The beef market is in turmoil - and inflation is spiralling \n                 \n                  'Don't tell anyone': Manager at UK's largest housing association told staff to fake fire safety files\n                 Their website statement said guidance from European football's governing body is being followed. But that is open to interpretation. Would this be allowed? A banner saying: \"Stop killing children. Stop killing civilians.\" To some it could be political, being a reference to Israel's war on Gaza without mentioning any conflict. But it was displayed by UEFA itself on the pitch before the Super Cup in August linked to Palestinian refugees from Gaza being part of the medal ceremony. UEFA insisted it was not a political message. A \"Free Palestine\" banner displayed by Paris Saint-Germain fans last season resulted in no UEFA punishment. Celtic also faced no action for a \"show Israel the red card\" banner - a slogan also pitch-side for Maccabi's game in Greece last month at PAOK. So the same messaging, or similar, should be allowed by Villa on those precedents. Policing banners and activism in the stadium will be fraught, but the bigger challenges could be on the streets of Birmingham. It could still retain its status as a high-risk game - as classified by West Midlands Police - even without the official presence of Maccabi fans. There is no ban on Israelis being in Birmingham, trying to watch the game in bars or restaurants in Maccabi shirts. Could that bring confrontations? They were a target of violence in Amsterdam last season around a match against Ajax. Maccabi fans were also filmed chanting abusively about Arabs and Gaza in particular. Read more:Why have Maccabi fans been banned?Maccabi will not sell tickets to Aston Villa game There will be the anticipation of pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrations around Birmingham on 6 November. A shopping street near Villa Park already featured Palestinian flags when Sky News recently visited. There are still calls, including from Aston's independent MP Ayoub Khan, for all Israeli teams to be banned from European competitions over the deaths in the Gaza war. Sky News revealed a push for a UEFA vote by European football officials that was abandoned as a Gaza peace deal was adopted.  For Maccabi Tel Aviv, there are fears their cause could be appropriated by figures whose backing they reject. Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was in Israel to address a rally in Tel Aviv last week and was pictured in a Maccabi shirt. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, called Robinson \"a thug who represents the very worst of Britain\" while criticising an Israeli minister for inviting the right-wing, anti-Islam activist. Without directly referencing Robinson, Maccabi said: \"We are... concerned about the intervention of divisive figures who do not represent the values of our club. We condemn all abhorrent views that have no place in football.\" That did also mean the club last night looking inwards in the statement rejecting any tickets, acknowledging there was a \"more extreme elements of our fan base\" and saying they had to stamp out racism. Additionally problematic for Maccabi was the unrest around the Tel Aviv derby at the weekend, even if they blame rivals Hapoel for being the main instigators of violence and setting off the pyrotechnics that forced the game to be abandoned. But Maccabi decried the \"toxic atmosphere\" and \"inflammatory rhetoric\" which meant they deemed it no longer safe for their own fans to be at Villa Park on 6 November. And Israel's embassy in London complained about \"racist rhetoric voiced by some members of parliament and local councils\" while claiming \"extremists have turned football‚Ä¶ into a platform for intimidation\". Sir Keir Starmer's government is concerned how the game had been \"weaponised to stoke violence and fear\". The rhetoric is far from being toned down. This is a fraught fixture that has already pitted Westminster politicians against the police, developed into a diplomatic row and stoked new concerns about the safety of Jews in Britain. And there are still two weeks until the match is due to be played."

On Sunday, four thieves stole nine items - one of which was dropped and recovered at the scene - in a heist pulled off while the central Paris museum was open to visitors. What do we know about the police investigation?  A huge police operation to find the culprits and the jewels is now under way - with one expert describing the probe as \"one of the biggest manhunts in French history\". Paris prosecutors have entrusted the investigation to a specialised unit known as the BRB, which often deals with high-profile robberies. A former officer who served in the unit has said it handled the 2016 Kim Kardashian probe, after a gang stormed the reality TV star's Paris apartment, tied her up and escaped with jewellery worth an estimated $6m (¬£4.4m).

Investigators are examining video evidence, telephone records and forensic evidence, while also speaking to informants. Mr Szkudlara said the BRB \"can have teams working on it 24/7 and for a long period\", adding he has \"100%\" confidence the thieves will be caught. Art detective Arthur Brand - who helps police across Europe with investigations into missing works - has said officers will also be reviewing security footage going back weeks, looking to identify suspicious people casing out the gallery.  What do we know about the culprits?  Only a small pool of criminals would be capable of a job as audacious as Sunday's heist and they may already be known to police, specialists say. Art theft expert Anthony Amore told Sky News the culprits are \"probably a European criminal gang\". \"The idea it's professional thieves like you see in Ocean's 11, it's not that,\" he told presenter Anna Botting. \"It's the sort of people who do this in all sorts of venues, so they are professional in that sense. They had this very well planned out.\" What have officers found so far? As well as recovering one of the stolen items - a crown that once belonged to Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugenie - at the scene, French Culture Minister Rachida Dati said police have found \"motorcycles and a licence plate\". They have also recovered evidence from a cherry picker used by the thieves to access the first-floor Galerie d'Apollon, where the jewels were on display.

Earlier this year, Trump said they have \"wanted a ballroom\" in the White House for 150 years. \"There's never been a president that was good at ballrooms,\" he said. \"I'm good at building things and we're going to build quickly and on time. It'll be beautiful, top, top of the line.\" Since being in office, Mr Trump has made a number of changes to the White House. He has hand-picked gold ornamentation for the Oval Office and has redone the Rose Garden. A former Republican member of Congress, Joe Walsh, called the latest plans an \"utter desecration\", and said if he became president would take \"a bulldozer\" to the ballroom."

        "Content": "Demolition on the White House's East Wing is under way to make room for Donald Trump's new $250m (¬£186m)¬†ballroom. The demolition marks the first time the wing, built at the beginning of the last century, has been modified since 1942, and is expected to be the biggest transformation of the presidential complex since 33rd US president Harry Truman oversaw renovations between 1948 and 1952. Mr Trump, who says the ballroom will be paid for by himself and donors, claimed in July that the ballroom would not interfere with the existing landmark, which dates back to 1800.  Earlier this year, Trump said they have \"wanted a ballroom\" in the White House for 150 years, adding: \"It'll be beautiful, top, top of the line.\" The former real estate developer and hotelier has not been shy when it comes to making the historic landmark his own. Here's a look at some of the other changes he has overseen. The Rose Garden The president had the lawn at the White House's famous Rose Garden paved over during the summer. The garden, which was created during the administration of John F. Kennedy after being inspired by gardens he saw during a 1961 state visit to France, has long been used for everything from big announcements to Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremonies. Mr Trump said the lawn often became \"soaking wet\" and inconvenienced \"the women with the high heels,\" leading him to want to put \"gorgeous stone\" over the grass. The changes are reversible, and temporary covers have been put over the grass for events in the past. The Oval Office's golden overhaul Mr Trump promised his second term would usher in the \"golden age of America\" in his inaugural address in January, and that pledge has manifested literally in the Oval Office. The president has redecorated by adding golden accents to the fireplace, doorway arches, walls and other areas of the room. He has also added gold-framed paintings of former presidents to the walls, as well as trophies to the mantelpiece behind where he is often seen holding discussions with other world leaders. \"I've done some 'Trump touches' to the Oval Office,\" he said months after being sworn in for his second term. \"It's a little nicer than it used to be, I think.\" Mr Trump is well known for his love of golden decor. A White House spokesperson told Fox News that the gold touches were \"of the highest quality,\" but did not provide further details other than to say Mr Trump personally covered the costs of the introductions. Every president adjusts the office decor to their liking, with some hiring decorators. Former president Joe Biden had one of his brothers oversee his changes. Trump-centric artwork Mr Trump has bumped the official portrait of former president Barack Obama to another wall in the foyer to make room for one depicting the moment after the assassination attempt on him last summer. The painting was donated by Andrew Pollock, who lost his daughter Meadow in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. In the Booksellers Hall of the East Wing, between official portraits of former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump has put up a painting of himself, showing the red, white and blue of the American flag superimposed over his headshot. New flagpoles on the lawn Mr Trump has installed a pair of flagpoles on the White House lawn, one on the south side of the building, the other on the north. Prior to their introduction in June, he said he would be adding the \"beautiful\" flagpoles on the grounds because \"they've needed flagpoles for 200 years,\" and that he would be paying for them.

Mr Trump had a descendant sapling of the southern magnolia planted after its removal, and said the wood from the old tree \"may be used for other high and noble purposes\"."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Sean 'Diddy' Combs is appealing against the conviction handed down to him earlier this year over prostitution charges relating to his former girlfriends and male sex workers. The music mogul was given a 50-month sentence and a $500,000 fine for flying people around the US and abroad for sexual encounters, including his then-girlfriend and male sex workers, in violation of prostitution laws. He was cleared of more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking that could have put him in jail for life. The two-page formal notice of appeal, seen by Sky News, was filed in Manhattan federal court on Monday, confirming he will be challenging both his conviction and his sentence. It lists Combs's defence council as Alexandra A E Shapiro, and shows a $605 (¬£450) docketing fee was paid to lodge the formal notice. More detailed filings are expected to follow. On the day of sentencing in early October the rapper's lawyers had signalled they intended to appeal. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentenced to more than four years in prison\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs admits 'past wrongs' in letter to judge - hours before his sentencing \n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentencing as it happened: Hip-hop mogul jailed for more than four years - and fined $500,000\n                 Combs, 55, has been in custody since his arrest last year.  His seven-week trial earlier this year included four days of testimony from Cassie, now Cassie Ventura Fine, who told the court she was coerced and sometimes blackmailed into sexual encounters with male sex workers, referred to as \"freak offs\". Jurors were also shown video clips of Combs dragging and beating her in a Los Angeles hotel hallway after one of those sessions in 2016. Ahead of the sentencing, Cassie also submitted a letter to the judge, calling Combs a \"manipulator\" and saying she would fear for her safety should he be immediately released. Ahead of his sentencing, Combs told the court he admitted his past behaviour was \"disgusting, shameful and sick\", and apologised personally to Cassie Ventura and \"Jane\", another former girlfriend who testified anonymously during the trial. He told the court he'd got \"lost in my excess and lost in my ego\", but since his time in prison he has been \"humbled and broken to my core,\" adding \"I hate myself right now... I am truly sorry for it all.\" Judge Arun Subramanian, who had rejected bail for the rapper several times before sentencing, told him that he would get through his time in prison and would still \"have a life afterwards,\" calling it \"a chance for renewal and redemption\". He was facing a maximum of 20 years in prison for the prostitution-related charges, so the sentence was towards the lower end of the scale. Prosecutors had argued he should spend at least 11 years behind bars, while Combs's lawyers had called for him to be freed almost immediately due to time already served since his arrest just over a year ago. Sky News has contacted Combs's lawyers for comment."

        "Content": "There are no plans for Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to meet in person in the near future, according to a White House official. The US leader later shed further light on the issue when asked why his planned summit in Hungary had been put on hold. He said he did not want to have a wasted meeting, telling reporters in the Oval Office he had not made a determination about the talks he had wanted to hold. The presidents last week agreed to meet in Budapest after a phone call Mr Trump called \"extremely frank and trustful\".  The US leader suggested it was possible it could happen within a fortnight, though no date was set. However, it appears that's now off the table - and there are fears the meeting could be shelved altogether due to Russia's rigid stance on the Ukraine war. The White House official, speaking to Sky's US partner network NBC, said secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had spoken on Tuesday. The call was described as \"productive\" but the official added there was no plan for the presidents to meet \"in the immediate future\". The last Trump-Putin meeting was in Alaska in August, but it ended without any meaningful progress towards a ceasefire. The Budapest plan was announced shortly before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington last Friday to try to get approval for long-range Tomahawk missiles.  Mr Zelenskyy accused the Russian leader of acting out of fear Ukraine could get the green light and the ability to hit targets far deeper into Russia. In his nightly address on Tuesday, he said Russia \"almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy\" after it became clear Mr Trump had backed away from any decision on the Tomahawks.  Two US officials told Reuters that plans for the Budapest meeting had stalled over Russia's insistence any peace deal must give it control of all of the Donbas region. Those terms are said to have been reiterated over the weekend in a private communique known as a \"no paper\". üëâ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app üëà  The Kremlin's refusal to budge effectively rejects Mr Trump's latest assessment that the frontlines should be frozen as they are. The president shifted position last week after previously telling the UN General Assembly that Ukraine could win back all the land it has lost. Read more:Putin's 'not so secret weapon' | Ukraine war Q&AUK 'ready to spend over ¬£100m' on possibly sending troops to Ukraine Ukraine and European nations issued a joint statement on Tuesday insisting \"international borders must not be changed by force\" and accusing Russia of \"stalling tactics\". But, in an apparent effort to keep the US leader onside, it added: \"We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.\"  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave the impression his country was in no rush to arrange another Trump-Putin meeting, saying on Tuesday \"preparation is needed, serious preparation\". Such talk is likely to increase concerns Russia does not want to stop fighting and is \"playing\" President Trump - all while continuing to launch drone barrages at Ukrainian cities. Russia currently holds about a fifth of Ukraine after its invasion in February in 2022. It also annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Meanwhile, NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte is travelling to Washington to meet with President Trump on Wednesday. He will \"discuss various aspects related to NATO's support to Ukraine and to the US-led efforts towards lasting peace\", an official for the alliance said."

Naroditsky served as head coach at the Charlotte Chess Centre in North Carolina, which announced his death.

Economists forecast that consumer price inflation (CPI) will have reached double the Bank of England's target in September, driven up from the 3.8% recorded in August by rising fuel and food inflation. Speaking ahead of publication of the figures by the Office for National Statistics, a Treasury spokesman said that bringing down inflation was a priority, and the chancellor would convene a meeting of key cabinet colleagues on Thursday to stress its importance across government. The spokesman specified that action to bring down energy prices was among the options being considered, the strongest indication yet that action on soaring consumer bills will feature in next month's budget. Politics latest: Boris Johnson left in 'homicidal mood' after exam result fiasco  The chancellor is understood to be considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on bills to zero, a move that would save billpayers around ¬£80 a year and cost ¬£2.5bn to implement. Labour's manifesto promised it would cut bills by ¬£300 a year, but the last Ofgem price review saw a small increase driven by policy costs, leaving the government under pressure to reduce the impact of domestic energy rates that are the second-highest in Europe. The spokesman said: \"The chancellor's view is that tackling the cost of living is urgent, and everything is on the table - including measures to bring down energy bills. She's getting the whole of government to play its part, it's her number one focus.\" The chancellor's actions are a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday's inflation figures will be a difficult moment for a government that came to power promising to bring down the cost of living. After peaking at more than 11% in October 2022, CPI returned to the Bank's target of 2% in May last year, two months before Labour took office. After briefly falling below 2% in September 2024 as higher energy prices from a year earlier dropped out of the calculation, it has marched steadily upwards, largely driven by energy and food prices.

The Bank of England has forecast that this September's figures will mark the peak of this inflation cycle for the same reason, with the Ofgem energy cap rising less this October than a year ago. That underlines the importance of gas and electricity bills to household finances, the official figures and the government's energy policy. Campaigners and some energy companies have urged the government to bring down electricity bills by shifting levies for renewables and funding for social programs to general taxation, a move estimated to cost ¬£6bn. The Conservatives have said they would cut levies that currently pay for carbon taxes and older forms of renewable power subsidy, cutting bills by ¬£165 a year."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n  The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group has warned that a tax raid on the banks could harm lending to households and businesses. In an exclusive interview with Sky News at the government's regional investment summit, Charlie Nunn urged the chancellor to ignore calls for a windfall tax on commercial banks even though the sector is enjoying record profits. \"If we are going to have the ability and the confidence to continue to lend into the real economy, to help households and businesses invest, we need to make sure that the financial services system and Lloyds Banking Group really remains healthy in that context,\" he said. Money latest: Which country pays the most for a pint?  Britain's four largest banks - HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest - posted record profits of ¬£45.9bn last year and are on course for another bumper performance this year, thanks to higher interest rates. Their financial success has raised speculation that the sector could be in the chancellor's firing line at next month's budget. \n                  Nationwide app and internet banking back up after outage\n                 \n                  Challenger bank Cynergy seeks ¬£1bn valuation in minority sale\n                 \n                  Abu Dhabi sovereign fund in talks to buy $100m Revolut stake\n                 Rachel Reeves could raise the bank surcharge - a levy on bank profits in addition to corporation tax. The Conservative government cut the levy from 8% to 3% in 2023. Returning it to 8% could raise ¬£2bn for a chancellor who needs to find anywhere up to ¬£50bn to meet her fiscal rules.  Some have suggested a separate windfall tax, which could raise closer to ¬£8bn. Mr Nunn said such a move risked undermining the health of a sector which underpins the country's economic prosperity. \"Obviously, taxes are a matter for the government to look at. But it's definitely one of the factors that impact our ability to support the real economy in the UK,\" he said. A raid on the banks would cause pain to a sector that is already facing substantial costs because of the car finance scandal. Lloyds, one of the most exposed lenders, has set aside nearly ¬£2bn to cover potential compensation arising from the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) redress scheme. The FCA established the scheme to draw a line under the long-running mis-selling scandal, in which lenders failed to disclose commission paid to brokers, meaning many customers ended up paying more than they should have for their car finance. Under the FCA's scheme, eligible customers - as many as 14.2 million - could receive an average of ¬£700 each.  There is mounting anger within the industry at the way the scheme, which is going out to consultation, has been set up. Mr Nunn said the proposal was too generous to customers and not proportionate to the harms actually caused to customers. He did not rule out the possibility of a judicial review but, in the first instance, called for a rethink, warning that the current scheme risks scaring away investors, causing an exodus from the market and driving up the cost and availability of credit. \"When you look at the implication of what's being proposed by the FCA, it's going to potentially take 20 years of profitability of the car finance industry. And, what does that mean for invest ability in that industry and for other investors and businesses looking to invest in the UK? There's real concern that this is going to create an invest ability issue,\" he said. \"Our concern is will the industry continue to function? Will it support all customers across the whole of the UK that need finance? Will other investors be looking at this and wondering whether the UK is a place they should invest, if retrospectively we can take away 20 years of profits?\""

OpenAI, the company behind the pioneering ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, has launched its new internet browser, called Atlas. It will feel familiar to users of the world's most used internet browsing portal, Google Chrome, with the use of tabs and the ability to go into an \"incognito\" mode so viewing activity is not recorded.   \"Atlas should feel very familiar,\" its product lead, Adam Fry, said. \"So it has all of your tabs, bookmarks, autofill for passwords, all the things you're used to.\" ChatGPT has been incorporated into the design of Atlas, not just \"bolted on\", another of its creators said. \n                  'Treat adult users like adults': ChatGPT to write erotica\n                 \n                  Family sue OpenAI over teenager's death after he confided in ChatGPT\n                 \n                  OpenAI releases long-awaited GPT-5 AI chatbot upgrade\n                 \"We wanted to make sure that Atlas didn't feel like your old browser, just with a chat button that was bolted on,\" its lead engineer Ben Goodger said. That means no need to copy and paste between tabs, with ChatGPT available on every page for any text box on the internet. Through the homepage, users can search their viewing history. Users' activity on Atlas will be embedded in the experience. \"It should really feel like a natural extension of myself,\" said OpenAI's Will Ellsworth, the research lead for the AI agent in Atlas. Use of an AI 'agent' means artificial intelligence could research, plan or book activities. So-called natural language controls mean people can access information by using prompts personal to them, such as \"re-open shoes I looked at yesterday\". Who can use it and when? It's currently available for Apple Mac users across the world. Even those signed up to the free version of ChatGPT can access Atlas. Those paying for ChatGPT via OpenAI's plus and pro packages can make use of the AI agent feature. A time for when Atlas will be available on Windows, the iPhone's iOS operating system and on Android has not been given. Why does it matter? Using an AI chatbot to search the internet is different and can yield different results than traditional search via a search engine. Increased use of generative AI for search could mean some websites lose out on traffic and could change the way people use the internet. While AI has become more energy efficient, it still uses far more electricity than traditional search. The rising adoption of AI has outpaced potential energy efficiency improvements. It is a serious challenger for Google, which had faced the threat of selling its Chrome browser after a US court found its search business was an illegal monopoly. Just the start OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman said: \"There's a lot more to add. This is still early days for this project.\" Google has been contacted for comment."

Its financial recovery and efforts to bolster infrastructure have consistently been damaged by fines for poor performance, including sewage spills. The company had sought a 53% increase to customer bills between 2025-30. Ofwat allowed 35%.  It had planned to appeal the regulator's final determination to the Competition and Markets Authority - the body which recently granted similar applications by five other suppliers. But Thames put its own appeal on hold in March, pending the outcome of its ownership talks. Thames said on Tuesday: \"Discussions between TWUL's senior creditors, the London and Valley Water Consortium (\"L&VW\"), Ofwat, and other regulators in relation to a potential market-led solution to the recapitalisation of the company are continuing. \"TWUL and Ofwat have agreed a further deferral of the Reference, which will provide an opportunity for these discussions to continue in the coming weeks. Given this, no deadline has been set for the end of the deferral period. \"This deferral is not a withdrawal of the request for the Reference and TWUL remains of the view that the Final Determination does not serve the interests of Thames Water's customers, communities and the environment.\" \"TWUL remains focused on delivering a recapitalisation transaction which delivers for its customers and the environment as soon as practicable.\" A spokesman for the consortium said: \"Today's announcement and the further extension agreed follows discussion with Ofwat, EA (Environment Agency) and DWI (Drinking Water Inspectorate) and continued progress to develop a sustainable solution which will deliver improvements for Thames Water's customers, employees and the environment. \"We will continue to work at pace with all stakeholders with a view to concluding discussions and agreeing the terms of a transaction as soon as possible, achieving an outcome that is first and foremost in customers' interests and avoids the unnecessary cost, risk and delay of a special administration.\""

Officers arrested 32 people and seized thousands of items, including food, make-up and electrical devices, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. More than 300 officers were involved in the blitz over two days this month targeting stores suspected of selling goods stolen from major retailers at discounted prices. Nine shops have been served with closure notices as part of Operation Zoridon. Superintendent Luke Baldock said: \"Shoplifting is not a victimless crime and the gangs involved are organised and have links to drugs and violence. \"Rogue shopkeepers who trade in stolen goods are funding criminal activity and driving up costs for everyone. \"They're keeping thieves in business at the expense of hard-working, law-abiding retailers.\" Seven people were arrested and around 2,000 phones seized in a raid on a shop in Woolwich, southeast London. Police body-worn footage shows officers entering the store before prying open an office door to discover \"loads and loads and loads\" of suspected stolen devices in cabinets. A room hidden behind a wall panel in the basement was also found to contain more phones and other devices, while a secret compartment contained around ¬£50,000 worth of gaming consoles. Apple confirmed some of the phones, accessories and packaging were fake. Other footage released by police shows officers finding razor blades, Starbucks travel cups, umbrellas from Waterstones and LEGO sets being sold in an off-licence in Willesden, northwest London. Three people were arrested and the shop was issued with a closure order from London Fire Brigade. The Met said the force is working with businesses to crack down on the most prolific shoplifters across the capital and have solved 92% more shoplifting cases this year. Officers on a stakeout operation in the Co-Op branch in Homerton High Street, north London, were filmed on CCTV pouncing on masked thieves as they carried out a raid in December last year.

Sky News has learnt that advisers to Unimetals Group have set a deadline of Wednesday for initial offers from prospective buyers of the business. Unimetals operates 27 sites across the UK, collecting, processing and shredding metallic waste to produce raw materials for copper, aluminium and steel producers both in Britain and abroad. A Whitehall source said the government was monitoring the crisis at the company because of its role, in particular, in the UK's steel supply chain. Alvarez & Marsal (A&M), which has been advising the company, is on standby to be appointed as administrator, potentially in the coming days. However, industry sources said a number of viable offers for Unimetals were expected to be submitted ahead of Wednesday's deadline.

On Monday, a Met spokesperson said the commissioner had been \"clear he doesn't believe officers should be policing toxic culture war debates, with current laws and rules on inciting violence online leaving them in an impossible position\". The force said the decision to no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents would now \"provide clearer direction for officers, reduce ambiguity and enable them to focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations\". Justice minister Sarah Sackman said it was \"welcome news\" the Met will now be focusing on crimes such as phone snatching, mugging, antisocial behaviour and violent crime. Asked if other forces should follow the Met's decision, she said: \"I think that other forces need to make the decisions that are right for their communities. \"But I'm sure that communities up and down the country would want that renewed focus on violent crime, on antisocial behaviour, and on actual hate crime.\" The Met said it will still record non-crime hate incidents to use as \"valuable pieces of intelligence to establish potential patterns of behaviour or criminality\"."

Economists forecast that consumer price inflation (CPI) will have reached double the Bank of England's target in September, driven up from the 3.8% recorded in August by rising fuel and food inflation. Speaking ahead of publication of the figures by the Office for National Statistics, a Treasury spokesman said that bringing down inflation was a priority, and the chancellor would convene a meeting of key cabinet colleagues on Thursday to stress its importance across government. The spokesman specified that action to bring down energy prices was among the options being considered, the strongest indication yet that action on soaring consumer bills will feature in next month's budget. Politics latest: Boris Johnson left in 'homicidal mood' after exam result fiasco  The chancellor is understood to be considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on bills to zero, a move that would save billpayers around ¬£80 a year and cost ¬£2.5bn to implement. Labour's manifesto promised it would cut bills by ¬£300 a year, but the last Ofgem price review saw a small increase driven by policy costs, leaving the government under pressure to reduce the impact of domestic energy rates that are the second-highest in Europe. The spokesman said: \"The chancellor's view is that tackling the cost of living is urgent, and everything is on the table - including measures to bring down energy bills. She's getting the whole of government to play its part, it's her number one focus.\" The chancellor's actions are a tacit acknowledgement that Wednesday's inflation figures will be a difficult moment for a government that came to power promising to bring down the cost of living. After peaking at more than 11% in October 2022, CPI returned to the Bank's target of 2% in May last year, two months before Labour took office. After briefly falling below 2% in September 2024 as higher energy prices from a year earlier dropped out of the calculation, it has marched steadily upwards, largely driven by energy and food prices. Read more analysis:First test of chancellor's 'securonomics' policy does not bode wellThe pros and cons of digital IDs - and do we need them? The Bank of England has forecast that this September's figures will mark the peak of this inflation cycle for the same reason, with the Ofgem energy cap rising less this October than a year ago. That underlines the importance of gas and electricity bills to household finances, the official figures and the government's energy policy. Campaigners and some energy companies have urged the government to bring down electricity bills by shifting levies for renewables and funding for social programs to general taxation, a move estimated to cost ¬£6bn. The Conservatives have said they would cut levies that currently pay for carbon taxes and older forms of renewable power subsidy, cutting bills by ¬£165 a year."

Albin Kurti said there is \"limited capacity\" in the small nation, which has a population of fewer than two million people, but that he expected a \"successful result\" from negotiations. Talks are under way, he confirmed, between officials from both countries about a migrant returns deal for those whose claims have been ruled ineligible by the UK, and are awaiting deportation to their country of origin. A Home Office team is exploring options for how one could work, Sky News understands, although no formal request has yet been made to Kosovo to host a facility. Mr Kurti, who is attending a Western Balkans Summit in London this week, said: \"We want to help the UK, we consider that that is our friendly and political duty. \"We have limited capacity but still we want to help, and as we speak, there is regular communication between our teams of state officials from our ministry of internal affairs and lawyers about how to do this smoothly for mutual benefit. \"Of course, we want, as a country, to benefit but we consider it first and foremost our obligation to help you because you helped us a great deal and will never forget that.\" Western Balkans key allies Sir Keir Starmer has identified the countries of the Western Balkans as key allies in the fight against irregular migration, with 22,000 people using this route to reach the UK last year. The UK government has signed agreements to tackle smuggling gangs with Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia and Kosovo. Keir Starmer said earlier this year that the government was in talks with unnamed countries about setting up \"return hubs\" which he called an \"important innovation\" for individuals who have exhausted all appeals in the UK system. Kosovo is the first to confirm these negotiations are under way, and further discussions about it are likely in the margins of this week's summit. The small eastern European nation and the UK have strong ties, with Sir Tony Blair feted in the country for his government's role in spearheading NATO airstrikes on Serbia in 1999, which helped end the Kosovo War. In June, Kosovo made an agreement with the US, negotiated under the Biden administration, to take up to 50 US deportees who met certain criteria. But it is understood only one or two have arrived due to legal issues. Kosovo would likely be seeking a defence agreement and UK investment in return, with the country concerned about Russian aggression and hostility from neighbouring Serbia. Read more:UK to ask Kosovo to take migrantsGovt considering sending failed asylum seekers to overseas migrant hubs Kosovo wants security support Mr Kurti added: \"We would like mainly to get support in security - be that through strategic agreements, or through equipment and projects we might do. Our two teams are working on this, but I think this will have a successful result.\" It is not expected the UK will make a formal request until further legal issues are worked through, which could be significant. A controversial deal made by Italy in 2023 to send thousands of migrants to two detention centres in Albania has cost millions of euros and been halted by multiple legal obstacles. Andi Hoxhaj, Balkan expert at King's College, said: \"Such a deal is unlikely to happen at the Summit. Nevertheless, I expect some statement indicating that the UK and one or two Western Balkan countries are close to reaching an agreement.\" \"Establishing an agreement with the UK would not be politically sensitive in Kosovo. The country continues to seek deeper ties with one of its strongest allies-one that played a crucial role in its path to independence.\" Kosovo has convict deal with Denmark Sir Keir was left embarrassed on a visit to the Albanian capital in May when he announced the UK was in talks about return hubs in the Balkans, only for Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to say he would not allow the UK to \"dump immigrants\" in his country when it is in a \"marriage\" with Italy. Under Yvette Cooper, the Foreign Office has shifted focus to migration - with more staff working on the issue, drawing up sanctions on people smugglers and pursuing returns agreements. Kosovo has also ratified a deal with Denmark - another active contributor to the NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping force - to take 300 convicts from its overcrowded prisons, due to start in 2027. Return hubs are different from offshore processing - which is what the Conservatives had proposed with the Rwanda scheme. It is proposed that individuals would only be sent to a return hub if their claim for asylum in the UK had been rejected - and they were awaiting deportation. By sending them to a third country, the government hopes it will prevent people trying to frustrate and delay the process of removal and that it could act as a deterrent to people coming in small boats. Only 3% of people of small boat arrivals in 2018-24, or around 5,000 people, were returned from the UK, according to the Oxford Migration Observatory, although removals of failed migrants from all routes has increased in the past year."

        "Content": " The government is facing increasing pressure to formally strip Prince Andrew of his dukedom. Andrew voluntarily gave up his titles last week but will technically continue to hold them unless they are removed by an Act of Parliament. Rachael Maskell - the independent MP for York Central - told Sky News that 88% of her constituents don't want the duke \"to carry a title bearing the name of our city\". On the Politics Hub With Darren McCaffrey, she confirmed she is advocating for a change in the law, and argued mechanisms should be in place to remove titles. \"My legislation would be able to be applied to anybody in the future as well, so we wouldn't have this situation ever having to occur again,\" Ms Maskell added.  Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has also warned new legislation must be put forward without \"any excuses and any further delay\". The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said: \"The public knows this is the right thing to do - and even more importantly, the victims at the heart of the Epstein scandal know that it's the right thing to do. \"Those implicated in the Epstein scandal have been able to escape justice because they have hidden behind their power and privilege.\" A proposed bill has been put forward that would also strip Lord Mandelson of his peerage - weeks after he was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US because of his own ties to the paedophile financier.

Read more:How Prince Andrew allegations unfoldedWhat title loss means for Andrew's family Accuser's memoir published today Pressure has been growing on Andrew amid continued reports of his relationship with Epstein, with the royal \"vigorously denying\" the allegations against him. The posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre - who had accused him of sexual assault and sued him in August 2021 - is being released today. She took her own life in April. Amy Wallace, who co-authored Nobody's Girl, said Ms Giuffre would have regarded Andrew relinquishing his titles as a \"victory\". She told BBC Newsnight: \"Virginia wanted all the men who she'd been trafficked to against her will to be held to account and this is just one of the men but ‚Ä¶ even though he continues to deny it, his life is being eroded because of his past behaviour as it should be.\"  The new memoir alleges that Andrew asked a royal close protection officer to \"dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre in 2021. A Buckingham Palace source told Sky's royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills these claims are \"being viewed with very serious and grave concern\" - and \"should be investigated in the proper and fullest ways\". 'Police gaslit my sister' Meanwhile, Ms Giuffre's brother and sister-in-law have urged the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review the Met's decision not to continue its investigations into the allegations she made against Prince Andrew. Sky and Amanda Roberts told Channel 4 News that Ms Giuffre had been \"gaslit\" by detectives - as well as British and American authorities - in what amounted to a \"kick in the stomach\" for her. In other developments, questions have been raised about whether Andrew should have the right to continue living at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Details of the financial arrangements surrounding his 30-bedroom mansion have come to light. A copy of the leasehold agreement shows he signed a 75-year lease on the property in 2003 at a cost of ¬£1m. Since then, he has paid \"one peppercorn\" of rent \"if demanded\" per year, a term used to describe a small payment that makes a contract legally binding."

I don't know the answer to that, nor can I answer... but the predictions were really grim.\" Education reporter Different stages posed different challenges within the pandemic with different types of school closures.\n\n In March 2020 schools closed with little provision or planning in place.\n\n There was no way of ensuring that children were engaging with resource materials being out online for them by their teachers.\n\n Children had no longer had a reason to get out of bed in the morning, as their daily routines underwent huge turmoil.\n\n The structure to their day was lost beyond recognition.\n\n In the absence of the social side of school, many children disappeared down the social media rabbit hole, many of whom have not yet returned.\n\n Many children suffered from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety as lockdown rules were imposed.\n\n Children are still living in the aftermath of COVID and for some it may be a while before they reach complete recovery, both mentally, and physically. To read more about what teaching was like during the pandemic, click here Mr Johnson faced a morning of questions as part of Module 8 of the inquiry, which is looking at the impact of the pandemic on children and young people. Protesters for charity Long Covid Kids gathered outside Dorland House, where the hearings are being held, and shouted \"shame on you\" as Mr Johnson left the building. Dan Paskins, executive director of UK Impact at Save the Children UK, said the actions of those in power during the pandemic \"damaged a generation of children\" and \"no amount of regret will undo the harm that has been done\". Mr Johnson denied a lack of planning when it came to closing schools, saying it was \"obvious\" this needed to be considered as part of lockdown measures as the virus spread across the globe in early 2020. One line of questioning regarded how much say the Department for Education (DfE) had around the cabinet table, after former education secretary Gavin Williamson said in his own evidence last week that Mr Johnson \"chose the NHS over children\" and \"many mistakes were made\". Asked whether children's interests were sufficiently well represented in decision making, Mr Johnson said he felt at the time that children were paying \"a huge huge price to protect the rest of society\" and \"I wish we could have found another solution\". Read More:The realities of the COVID classroom that Boris Johnson will need to explain Future lockdowns 'should be last resort' He also said that rules on social distancing \"probably did go too far\" in terms of their impact on children and \"we could have found a way of exempting\" them. He added: \"Hopefully this thing never happens again, but if we have to do anything like this again, I think we're really going to have to consider the whole NPI (non-pharmaceutical intervention) system, lockdowns, whether we want to go down that route at all, particularly whether we want to close schools. \"Because it really should be a measure of last resort in the budget of allowances that you speak of.\" The other topic that was discussed at length was the 2020 exam results fiasco - when teachers were asked to supply estimated grades and rankings of pupils in comparison to their peers before an algorithm was used to finalise results.  The algorithm was intended to prevent grade inflation but saw 40% of predicted results downgraded, resulting in public outcry and a government U-turn. The hearing was shown WhatsApp messages from the time between Mr Johnson and his then adviser Dominic Cummings, in which he described being in a \"homicidal mood\" because of the scandal and considered firing Mr Williamson. Mr Johnson acknowledged the algorithm was a \"disaster\" but said it was \"plainly not easy to come up with a substitute system\" after exams were cancelled. And while calm throughout most of the hearing - he appeared rattled as he defended the process. \"All I would say is - you try coming up with a system to give a fair exam result for people when they can't sit exams. It's not easy. OK?\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Victims and direct witnesses of crime who sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will no longer be gagged from speaking out, under government plans. The changes - which aim to tackle the misuse of NDAs as \"gagging orders\" to conceal crime - will ensure victims in England and Wales can talk about criminal conduct to anyone without fear of breaching the agreement. Accusers of Harvey Weinstein, the former film producer and convicted sex offender, are among many in recent years who had to breach such agreements in order to speak out. Announced on Monday, changes will apply to victims and direct witnesses of crime both inside and outside the workplace, and means they can share their experiences with anyone, for any purpose, including family, friends, employers and journalists, without fear of legal repercussions. An NDA is a broad term that describes any agreement that restricts what a signatory can say about something and was originally intended to protect commercially sensitive information. Previously, a business could take an employee to court and seek compensation if they thought an NDA had been broken. The amendment to the Victims and Courts Bill is part of a government plan to restore confidence in the justice system, stand up for victims, and help halve violence against women and girls. \n                  All police forces urged to stop recording non-crime hate incidents\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs¬†files to appeal against his conviction and sentence\n                 \n                  Gavin Plumb: Man jailed for plotting to rape and murder Holly Willoughby loses appeal against life sentence\n                 Zelda Perkins, Weinstein's former assistant and founder of Can't Buy My Silence UK, said the changes were \"hugely welcome\", and would \"underpin the integrity of law and protect victims\". She added: \"This sends a clear message to perpetrators that the time of hiding their criminal behaviour is over, and that this government is serious about keeping the British justice system a world leader in human rights.\" In 2017, Ms Perkins was the first woman to break a Weinstein-related NDA which she had signed a decade earlier. It was an action which helped expose the Miramax movie producer's predatory behaviour to the world. Read more: Campaigners call for NDA law changes as agreements remain 'rife' in entertainment The misuse of NDAs made headlines once again this year when hundreds of women came forward to make claims that NDAs had been used to silence victims of the late Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed. Victims and tackling violence against women and girls minister Alex Davies-Jones said: \"NDAs are too often used to sweep criminality under the carpet - trapping victims into silence and denying them justice. This must end. \"These changes will free victims from the murky world of confidentiality clauses, meaning they can speak to whoever they like about their experience without threat of legal action, helping them move on and rebuild their lives.\" The move builds on existing protections in the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024, which clarify that NDAs cannot stop victims from reporting crimes to the police and ensure that NDAs cannot stop victims from accessing legal advice and other support, including from victim support services. The change aligns with reforms in the Employment Rights Bill, which will void NDAs designed to silence workers about work-related harassment or discrimination."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  The maker of the world's most popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot has launched a web browser, potentially accelerating the change in how people search and access information. OpenAI, the company behind the pioneering ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, has launched its new internet browser, called Atlas. It will feel familiar to users of the world's most used internet browsing portal, Google Chrome, with the use of tabs and the ability to go into an \"incognito\" mode so viewing activity is not recorded.   \"Atlas should feel very familiar,\" its product lead, Adam Fry, said. \"So it has all of your tabs, bookmarks, autofill for passwords, all the things you're used to.\" ChatGPT has been incorporated into the design of Atlas, not just \"bolted on\", another of its creators said. \n                  'Treat adult users like adults': ChatGPT to write erotica\n                 \n                  Family sue OpenAI over teenager's death after he confided in ChatGPT\n                 \n                  OpenAI releases long-awaited GPT-5 AI chatbot upgrade\n                 \"We wanted to make sure that Atlas didn't feel like your old browser, just with a chat button that was bolted on,\" its lead engineer Ben Goodger said. That means no need to copy and paste between tabs, with ChatGPT available on every page for any text box on the internet. Through the homepage, users can search their viewing history. Users' activity on Atlas will be embedded in the experience. \"It should really feel like a natural extension of myself,\" said OpenAI's Will Ellsworth, the research lead for the AI agent in Atlas. Use of an AI 'agent' means artificial intelligence could research, plan or book activities. So-called natural language controls mean people can access information by using prompts personal to them, such as \"re-open shoes I looked at yesterday\". Who can use it and when? It's currently available for Apple Mac users across the world. Even those signed up to the free version of ChatGPT can access Atlas. Those paying for ChatGPT via OpenAI's plus and pro packages can make use of the AI agent feature. A time for when Atlas will be available on Windows, the iPhone's iOS operating system and on Android has not been given. Why does it matter? Using an AI chatbot to search the internet is different and can yield different results than traditional search via a search engine. Increased use of generative AI for search could mean some websites lose out on traffic and could change the way people use the internet. While AI has become more energy efficient, it still uses far more electricity than traditional search. The rising adoption of AI has outpaced potential energy efficiency improvements. It is a serious challenger for Google, which had faced the threat of selling its Chrome browser after a US court found its search business was an illegal monopoly. Just the start OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman said: \"There's a lot more to add. This is still early days for this project.\" Google has been contacted for comment."

Denise Bacon, 65, showed instant improvement in her finger movements as surgeons stimulated her brain with an electrical current. The retired speech and language therapist, from Crowborough, East Sussex, underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) after suffering Parkinson's symptoms, in a four-hour operation at London's King's College Hospital These symptoms included slowness of movement, rigidity and muscle stiffness. She had been diagnosed in 2014 and it has impacted her ability to walk, swim, dance and play her clarinet. But the operation led to instant improvements in her fingers, which allowed her to play the clarinet easily. Ms Bacon underwent a four-hour operation at King's College Hospital, where surgeons performed DBS to relieve the symptoms while she was awake. \n                  'Devastating' NHS decision on new drug vorasidenib dismays brain cancer patients\n                 \n                  Scientists develop first-ever blood test to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome\n                 \n                  Who can get COVID jab - as pharmacies turn people away over eligibility confusion\n                 'I'm already experiencing improvements' DBS, which is suitable for patients with disorders like Parkinson's, is a surgical procedure that allows that uses electrodes implanted in the brain. Ms Bacon, who played clarinet in the East Grinstead Concert Band up until five years ago but gave up because of her symptoms, was given a local anaesthetic to numb her scalp and skull. She said: \"I remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with. \"I'm already experiencing improvements in my ability to walk, and I'm keen to get back in the swimming pool, and on the dance floor to see if my abilities have improved there.\" 'Holes half the size of a five pence piece' Keyoumars Ashkan, a professor of neurosurgery who performed the procedure, said: \"Holes half the size of a five pence piece were made in Denise's skull after a frame with precise co-ordinates was placed on Denise's head, acting as a sat nav to guide us to the correct positions within the brain to implant the electrode. \"Once the electrodes were in place on the left side of Denise's brain, the current was switched on and an immediate improvement was noted in hand movements on her right side. \"The same happened on her left side when we implanted electrodes on the right side of her brain. \"As a keen clarinettist, it was suggested Denise bring her clarinet into the operating theatre to see whether the procedure would improve her ability to play, which was one of Denise's main goals for the surgery. \"We were delighted to see an instant improvement in her hand movements, and therefore her ability to play, once stimulation was delivered to the brain.\""

The music mogul was given a 50-month sentence and a $500,000 fine for flying people around the US and abroad for sexual encounters, including his then-girlfriend and male sex workers, in violation of prostitution laws. He was cleared of more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking that could have put him in jail for life. The two-page formal notice of appeal, seen by Sky News, was filed in Manhattan federal court on Monday, confirming he will be challenging both his conviction and his sentence. It lists Combs's defence council as Alexandra A E Shapiro, and shows a $605 (¬£450) docketing fee was paid to lodge the formal notice. More detailed filings are expected to follow. On the day of sentencing in early October the rapper's lawyers had signalled they intended to appeal. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentenced to more than four years in prison\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs admits 'past wrongs' in letter to judge - hours before his sentencing \n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentencing as it happened: Hip-hop mogul jailed for more than four years - and fined $500,000\n                 Combs, 55, has been in custody since his arrest last year.  His seven-week trial earlier this year included four days of testimony from Cassie, now Cassie Ventura Fine, who told the court she was coerced and sometimes blackmailed into sexual encounters with male sex workers, referred to as \"freak offs\". Jurors were also shown video clips of Combs dragging and beating her in a Los Angeles hotel hallway after one of those sessions in 2016. Ahead of the sentencing, Cassie also submitted a letter to the judge, calling Combs a \"manipulator\" and saying she would fear for her safety should he be immediately released. Ahead of his sentencing, Combs told the court he admitted his past behaviour was \"disgusting, shameful and sick\", and apologised personally to Cassie Ventura and \"Jane\", another former girlfriend who testified anonymously during the trial. He told the court he'd got \"lost in my excess and lost in my ego\", but since his time in prison he has been \"humbled and broken to my core,\" adding \"I hate myself right now... I am truly sorry for it all.\" Judge Arun Subramanian, who had rejected bail for the rapper several times before sentencing, told him that he would get through his time in prison and would still \"have a life afterwards,\" calling it \"a chance for renewal and redemption\". He was facing a maximum of 20 years in prison for the prostitution-related charges, so the sentence was towards the lower end of the scale. Prosecutors had argued he should spend at least 11 years behind bars, while Combs's lawyers had called for him to be freed almost immediately due to time already served since his arrest just over a year ago. Sky News has contacted Combs's lawyers for comment."

        "Content": "A security guard jailed for plotting to kidnap, rape and murder TV star Holly Willoughby has lost an appeal against his life sentence.  Gavin Plumb was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years last year after being convicted of soliciting murder and encouraging or assisting others to rape and kidnap. A trial at Chelmsford Crown Court heard that police found bottles of chloroform and an \"abduction kit\" with cable ties when officers raided the 38-year-old's flat in Harlow, Essex. Plumb's kidnap plan involved attempting to \"ambush\" Willoughby at her family home, jurors heard. Plumb argued in his defence that it was just online chat and fantasy. Reading out the Court of Appeal's judgment on Tuesday, Lord Justice Edis said Plumb's plans were \"horrifying and contained graphic detail of what the applicant proposed to do\" to Willoughby. \"They are distressing, even for seasoned professionals, to read,\" he continued. Dismissing Plumb's appeal, Lord Edis said: \"This is a case where the offender clearly is dangerous and where there is no way of knowing when or if ever that will cease to be the case.\" He added that the decision of the sentencing judge was \"unimpeachable\".

He was caught after an undercover police officer in the US infiltrated an online group called Abduct Lovers. He told the officer, who used the pseudonym David Nelson, that he was \"definitely serious\" about his plot to kidnap the former This Morning host, leaving him with the impression that there was an \"imminent threat\" to Willoughby. Due to the officer's concern over Plumb's post, evidence was passed to the FBI, who then contacted police in the UK. Willoughby, who asked for her victim personal statement to be private, waived her right to anonymity in connection with the charge against Plumb of assisting or encouraging rape."

        "Content": "Two more men have been arrested over the death of paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins. Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year jail term for multiple sexual offences, including serious crimes against young children and babies at HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire. He was attacked in prison with a knife earlier this month, sources confirmed. The two men, aged 23 and 39, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and are in police custody. Detective Chief Inspector James Entwistle of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team said: \"Extensive enquiries remain ongoing in relation to the murder of Ian Watkins and these arrests form part of that. \"Ian Watkins‚Äô family are being updated as the investigation progresses. However, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.\" Last week, Rashid Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43, were charged with murder in relation to the incident. No bail applications were made at Leeds Crown Court, and both men were remanded in custody until their next appearance for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 12 November. Judge Guy Kearl, the Recorder of Leeds, set a provisional date of 5 May for the trial, which is expected to take two to three weeks. Watkins was jailed for 29 years in December 2013 with a further six years on licence after admitting a string of sex offences. The singer was arrested following the execution of a drugs warrant at his Pontypridd home in September 2012 when a large number of computers, mobile phones and storage devices were seized. Analysis of the equipment uncovered his depraved behaviour.

At the time, police said his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. In 2019, he was jailed for 10 months on top of the sentence he was serving for child sex offences after he was found guilty of possessing a mobile phone in prison. Watkins claimed two inmates forced him to hold on to the phone so they could contact women who sent him fan mail in order to use them as a \"revenue stream\". In 2014, Watkins was told he could not appeal against the length of his sentence."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Victims and direct witnesses of crime who sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will no longer be gagged from speaking out, under government plans. The changes - which aim to tackle the misuse of NDAs as \"gagging orders\" to conceal crime - will ensure victims in England and Wales can talk about criminal conduct to anyone without fear of breaching the agreement. Accusers of Harvey Weinstein, the former film producer and convicted sex offender, are among many in recent years who had to breach such agreements in order to speak out. Announced on Monday, changes will apply to victims and direct witnesses of crime both inside and outside the workplace, and means they can share their experiences with anyone, for any purpose, including family, friends, employers and journalists, without fear of legal repercussions. An NDA is a broad term that describes any agreement that restricts what a signatory can say about something and was originally intended to protect commercially sensitive information. Previously, a business could take an employee to court and seek compensation if they thought an NDA had been broken. The amendment to the Victims and Courts Bill is part of a government plan to restore confidence in the justice system, stand up for victims, and help halve violence against women and girls. \n                  All police forces urged to stop recording non-crime hate incidents\n                 \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs¬†files to appeal against his conviction and sentence\n                 \n                  Gavin Plumb: Man jailed for plotting to rape and murder Holly Willoughby loses appeal against life sentence\n                 Zelda Perkins, Weinstein's former assistant and founder of Can't Buy My Silence UK, said the changes were \"hugely welcome\", and would \"underpin the integrity of law and protect victims\". She added: \"This sends a clear message to perpetrators that the time of hiding their criminal behaviour is over, and that this government is serious about keeping the British justice system a world leader in human rights.\" In 2017, Ms Perkins was the first woman to break a Weinstein-related NDA which she had signed a decade earlier. It was an action which helped expose the Miramax movie producer's predatory behaviour to the world. Read more: Campaigners call for NDA law changes as agreements remain 'rife' in entertainment The misuse of NDAs made headlines once again this year when hundreds of women came forward to make claims that NDAs had been used to silence victims of the late Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed. Victims and tackling violence against women and girls minister Alex Davies-Jones said: \"NDAs are too often used to sweep criminality under the carpet - trapping victims into silence and denying them justice. This must end. \"These changes will free victims from the murky world of confidentiality clauses, meaning they can speak to whoever they like about their experience without threat of legal action, helping them move on and rebuild their lives.\" The move builds on existing protections in the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024, which clarify that NDAs cannot stop victims from reporting crimes to the police and ensure that NDAs cannot stop victims from accessing legal advice and other support, including from victim support services. The change aligns with reforms in the Employment Rights Bill, which will void NDAs designed to silence workers about work-related harassment or discrimination."

        "Content": "Bob Vylan's frontman has said he does not regret chanting \"death, death to the IDF\" at Glastonbury - and would do it again. The outspoken punk duo sparked controversy with their performance at the festival in June, with the broadcast also leading to fierce criticism of the BBC. But speaking on The Louis Theroux podcast, Bobby Vylan said he stood by the chant, adding: \"I'd do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays.\"  The US condemned the act's \"hateful tirade\" and revoked their visas, with several festivals cancelling their upcoming appearances. Vylan claimed this backlash is \"minimal\" compared with what the people of Palestine are going through - with many losing members of their family or forced to flee their homes. He said: \"If I have their support, they're the people that I'm doing it for, they're the people that I'm being vocal for, then what is there to regret. Oh, because I've upset some right-wing politician or some right-wing media?\" The musician revealed he was taken aback by the uproar caused by the chant, which was described by the prime minister as \"appalling hate speech\". Vylan added: \"It wasn't like we came off stage, and everybody was like (gasps). It's just normal. We come off stage. It's normal. Nobody thought anything. Nobody. Even staff at the BBC were like: 'That was fantastic! We loved that!'\" A spokesperson at Mindhouse Productions - which was founded by Theroux and produces The Louis Theroux podcast - told Sky News: \"Louis is a journalist with a long history of speaking to controversial figures who may divide opinion. We would suggest people watch or listen to the interview in its entirety to get the full context of the conversation.\"  'The response was disproportionate' The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has since found that the broadcast of Bob Vylan's set breached editorial standards related to harm and offence. Theroux asked Vylan what he meant by chanting \"death to the IDF\" - with the musician replying: \"It's so unimportant, and the response to it was so disproportionate. \"What is important is the conditions that exist to allow that chant to even take place on that stage. And I mean, the conditions that exist in Palestine. Where the Palestinian people are being killed at an alarming rate.\" Read more from Sky News:Maccabi fans will not be able to buy tickets to Villa matchNo more investigations into 'non-hate crime incidents', Met saysVictim of Manchester synagogue attack speaks out He said he wanted an end to the oppression that the Palestinian people are facing - but argued chanting \"end, end the IDF\" wouldn't have caught on because it doesn't rhyme. \"We are there to entertain, we are there to play music,\" Vylan added. \"I am a lyricist. 'Death, death to IDF' rhymes. Perfect chant.\" He went on to reject claims that their set had contributed to a spike in antisemitic incidents that were reported a couple of days later. \"I don't think I have created an unsafe atmosphere for the Jewish community. If there were large numbers of people going out and going like 'Bob Vylan made me do this'. I might go, 'oof, I've had a negative impact here'.\" Vylan's conversation with Theroux was recorded on 1 October - before the Manchester synagogue attack, and prior to the ceasefire in Gaza coming into effect."
