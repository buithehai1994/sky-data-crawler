        "Content": " Emmanuel Macron has said a peace deal with Russia \"must not mean a surrender of Ukraine\" - as Donald Trump claimed Vladimir Putin's forces \"want to end this war\". The US and French presidents met amid fragile relations between America and Europe and after Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meeting in the White House on the third anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine, the French president said he and Mr Trump \"made substantive steps forward during our discussions\". Mr Macron told reporters that Europe should do more to bolster defence in the continent. However, he stressed Russia \"is the aggressor\" in the conflict and added: \"President Putin violated the peace.\"  Peace must allow Kyiv 'sovereignty' The French leader then said: \"We want peace, he wants peace. We want peace swiftly, but we don't want an agreement that is weak.\" \"This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine or a ceasefire without guarantees,\" he added. \"It must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues that affect it. \"It is also a country in which we need to shoulder our responsibilities so that we ensure security and stability for Ukraine and for the entire region. \"For Europeans, this is an existential issue.\" Read more:Trump and Macron's careful dance side-stepped divisions 'Get this war stopped' At a news conference following the talks, Mr Macron said he \"fully believes\" there is a path forward in negotiations. He also agreed \"there is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin\" - a week after the leaders had a 90-minute-long phone call. Mr Trump added Russia would accept European troops in Ukraine as part of peacekeeping efforts, adding: \"I specifically asked him (Putin) that question. He has no problem with it.\" He told reporters: \"When I got here, one of the first calls I made was to Putin and it was made with great respect. They want to end this war.\" Mr Trump then explained he wants to \"get this war stopped,\" whether that's through a ceasefire or a direct agreement - but when asked if Ukraine should give up territory as part of any deal, he said: \"We'll see.\" The news conference came as Mr Putin said he is ready to discuss Russia cutting its defence budget alongside the US, saying a mutual drop of 50% would be a \"good idea\". The Russian president also touted a possible economic deal with the US, offering talks on a deal for its own rare earth metal supplies and for the sale of aluminium to American firms. The US president is due to meet Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday, after the prime minister warned Mr Trump that a bad peace deal would be a \"disaster for everyone\".

Just last week, in a bitter exchange of words, Mr Trump called Ukraine's leader a \"dictator\" and said he \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" after Mr Zelenskyy had accused him of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\"."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Insults hurled by Donald Trump at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are \"ghastly to hear\" and \"complete untruths\", former British prime minister Boris Johnson has said. A friend of both men, however, he said he was \"optimistic\" Kyiv and Washington would agree an \"economic partnership\" that would benefit both sides. Speaking to Sky News on a trip to Kyiv, Mr Johnson also said Sir Keir Starmer should hike UK defence spending up to 3% of national income \"very quickly\" - at least by 2030 \"if not sooner\". He also said the best way for the prime minister to demonstrate UK credibility on defence would be to use a meeting with Mr Trump in Washington this week to set out a plan for an \"Anglo-French\" force to help provide security for Ukraine. Mr Johnson described this as the start of a \"steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\", saying it should be up to 30,000-strong, including troops from across Europe.  The former prime minister, who led the UK response to Russia's full-scale war and is viewed as a hero by many in Ukraine, said it is \"horrendous\" to think the conflict is still raging. \"I really grieve for the suffering of Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine I'm particularly pained,\" he said. \n                  Boris Johnson brands Vladimir Putin a 'f****** idiot' over alleged imperial ambitions\n                 \n                  Carrie Johnson treated in hospital for 'nasty chest infection' after contracting flu and pneumonia\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer puts UK economy first as he defies critics of Saudi Arabia trip\n                 But he was critical of a series of verbal attacks by Mr Trump against Mr Zelenskyy, which included calling him a \"dictator without elections\" and suggesting Ukraine was to blame for the war. \"It's ghastly to hear, some of the language that's been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator,\" Mr Johnson said, speaking bluntly. \"We all know that these are complete untruths.\" Read more from Sky News: Jailed MP will still get £91,000 salary while in prisonThieves stole £2.8m gold toilet in just five minutes, court hears But the former prime minister signalled he believed the US leader was still on Kyiv's side and he would not want Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold power over Ukraine's future. \"I remain actually optimistic about Ukraine and about their chances of success,\" he said.  Mr Johnson pointed to a deal that Washington wants to sign with Kyiv that will give the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth - though the Ukrainians want US security guarantees in return. Referring to a draft text, he said it contained lines such as \"America committed to a free, sovereign, secure Ukraine. \"Money to go to building up Ukraine's future security. America committing to long-term financial support\". He said a commitment to Ukraine's long-term security was also needed but he did not expect that to be included in the initial document. \"I think what needs to happen is that we, us, the Brits, the French… need to step up and show to Donald Trump, that we are willing to do what he keeps asking for and to take more of the burden ourselves,\" he said. Mr Johnson said he hoped Sir Keir would use his trip to Washington to \"set out an Anglo-French deterrent force that can begin to provide the steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\". Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron - who was in Washington on Monday - have been developing a plan with other European and Western allies to build a force of up to 30,000 troops to provide reassurance to Ukraine following a ceasefire. Mr Johnson said this would be an important demonstration of European strength in the eyes of the American leader. \"I think an Anglo-French plan for a deterrent force - I'm not talking about war fighting, I'm talking about forces that go in to help with logistics, to help backfilling, to help with training…. perhaps maximum 30,000 from the whole of Europe. \"It would be symbolic, but it would be exactly what [Vladimir] Putin doesn't want and what he thinks that he can forbid.\" The former British leader said the Russian president wants to block Ukraine from having British troops on its land or from joining NATO. \"But I don't think that Donald Trump can possibly accept that outcome. I know, he won't accept that outcome,\" Mr Johnson said. \"He doesn't want Putin to win any more than anybody else here in Kyiv does.\" Sir Keir is expected to set a timeframe as early as this week for when Britain will lift its defence budget to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% - but Mr Johnson signalled that Mr Trump would be expecting a \"bigger number\". \"I think he needs to go higher…. I think in the United States, they're going to want to hear a bigger number,\" he said."

        "Headline": "The bodies of Nicholas Prosper's mother and his two siblings were found at a flat last September. ",
        "Content": "A teenager who admitted killing his mother and two younger siblings was plotting a school shooting, it can now be reported. Nicholas Prosper, 19, appeared at Luton Crown Court over the deaths of Juliana Falcon, 48, Giselle Prosper, 13, and Kyle Prosper, 16. Their bodies were found at a flat in Leabank, off Wauluds Bank Drive, Luton, in September. He was also planning a shooting at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Luton, where he and his siblings had all been pupils. Headteacher Maureen Murphy said staff were \"very shocked\" to learn of the plot, but that there is no threat to the school. Prosper's harrowing plan, said to have left investigators \"in shock and disbelief\", was foiled by police who spotted him in the street immediately after the murders. He was stopped in nearby Bramingham Road, and a loaded shotgun was found hidden in bushes nearby, along with more than 30 cartridges. As he appeared in court on Monday, Prosper spoke to confirm his identity and to plead guilty to three charges of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Khanna, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"In all my years working on murder investigations, I have never known a case quite like this. \"Not only were three innocent lives taken in such brutal circumstances, but we then learnt of Prosper's plans to carry out a shooting at a school, something which left our whole investigation team in shock and disbelief. \"We cannot even begin to comprehend why someone would plan to kill innocent children and are so grateful to those arresting officers who helped prevent this from taking place.\" Leader of Luton Council, Hazel Simmons MBE, branded the murders as \"senseless\" and said their thoughts were with the victims, their family and friends. The councillor sought to reassure parents by saying \"our schools have robust systems in place to keep children safe and security is constantly reviewed and monitored\". After recently asking schools to review their security, Ms Simmons said schools will be asked to further review their measures in light of what emerged from court on Monday. \"On behalf of the town I would like to thank and praise the excellent work of Bedfordshire Police for apprehending the perpetrator before he attempted to cause more harm. \"However, we know this case will be unsettling for parents which is why the council is working with schools to put support in place in our schools to anyone who needs it.\" Prosper also admitted a number of other offences, including purchasing a shotgun without a certificate, possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life and possession of a kitchen knife in a public place. He will be sentenced on 5 March and has been remanded in custody. 'A cold-blooded attack' Chris Derrick, a deputy chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the victims' lives \"were stolen in a cold-blooded attack\". Mr Derrick said in a statement \"the full extent of Prosper's actions will be laid bare when he is sentenced, and he can expect to face a very long time behind bars\". He added: \"We hope today's conviction offers some solace to those who loved and cared for them, as they mourn their loss.\" A friend of Ms Falcon previously described her as someone who \"lived for her children\" and said she was \"a positive person who will be so terribly missed\". A previous statement on X from the headteacher at Lea Manor High School said they were \"deeply shocked\" by the death of Giselle. \"Giselle was a beautiful soul and a model pupil, she excelled in all her subjects and will be sorely missed, particularly by her friends in Year 9.\" Read more from Sky News: Girl, 3, who died in crash involving van and tram namedChildren 'screaming in sheer terror' after van filled with fireworks set alight Kyle's school described the incident as \"devastating\" and offered \"heartfelt condolences\" to his family.

The Pope, 88, has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since 14 February and is being treated for double pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. In a statement on Monday evening, the Vatican said: \"The clinical conditions of the Holy Father, in their critical state, show a slight improvement. \"Even today there were no episodes of asthmatic respiratory crises; some laboratory tests improved. \"Monitoring of mild renal failure is not a cause for concern. Oxygen therapy continues, although with slightly reduced flow and oxygen percentage. \"The doctors, considering the complexity of the clinical picture, are prudently not releasing the prognosis yet. In the morning he received the Eucharist, while in the afternoon he resumed work activity. \"In the evening he called the Parish Priest of the Parish of Gaza to express his paternal closeness. Pope Francis thanks all the people of God who have gathered in these days to pray for his health.\" Over the weekend, the pontiff suffered a \"prolonged respiratory crisis\" that required a high flow of oxygen, as well as an \"initial, mild\" kidney problem. The Vatican also said he had blood transfusions after tests revealed thrombocytopenia, which is associated with anaemia. Doctors said on Friday that he was \"not out of danger\" and was expected to remain in hospital for at least another week. They warned the main threat he faced was sepsis, which can occur as a complication of pneumonia, and lead to organ failure and death.

In a mesage from Francis which was released on Sunday, the pontiff asked people to pray for him. \"In recent days I have received many messages of affection, and I have been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children\" he said. \"Thank you for this closeness, and for the prayers of comfort I have received from all over the world! I entrust you all to the intercession of Mary, and I ask you to pray for me.\""

        "Headline": "One of the top recording artists of the 1970s, Roberta Flack saw a career resurgence in the mid 1990s after The Fugees covered her hit, Killing Me Softly.",
        "Content": " Grammy-award winning singer Roberta Flack has died at the age of 88, her publicist has announced. The American singer was best known for her hit songs Killing Me Softly With His Song and The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. One of the top recording artists of the 1970s, she died on Monday surrounded by her family, her publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. In 2022, Flack announced she was suffering from motor neurone disease (MND), and could no longer sing. Rising to fame in her early 30s, Flack became an overnight success after Clint Eastwood chose her song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, as the soundtrack for the explicit love scenes of his 1971 movie Play Misty For Me. The track topped the US charts in 1972, and Flack was rewarded with a Grammy. The following year she took the coveted Record of the Year prize at the Grammys for a second time with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist ever to do so. Discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, Flack was a classically trained pianist, receiving a full scholarship to study at Howard University at just 15. McCann later wrote of Flack: \"Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" A shining light in the social and civil rights movement of the time, Flack was friends with both Reverend Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis whom Flack visited in prison when Davis faced charges - for which she was acquitted - for murder and kidnapping. Flack also sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first black player. Living on the same floor of the famous Dakota apartment building as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Flack also became friends with the Beatle, later releasing an album of Beatles covers. Born Roberta Cleopatra Flack, to musician parents in Black Mountain, North Carolina, in 1937, she was raised in Arlington, Virginia. She was married to jazz musician Stephen Novosel between 1966 and 1972. Flack's other hits from the 1970s included Feel Like Makin' Love and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, Where Is the Love and The Closer I Get to You. Sadly, their partnership ended in tragedy, after he fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan in 1979, after suffering a breakdown while they were recording an album of duets together. While Flack never matched her first run of success, she had a follow-up hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet Tonight, I Celebrate My Love and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet Set The Night To Music. In the mid-90s, she received a wave of new attention after the Fugees covered Killing Me Softly. She would go on to perform with the hip-hop band on stage. A five-time Grammy winner, Flack received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020. Contemporary stars to praise her include Beyoncé, John Legend and Ariana Grande. Working as a high-school teacher in her 20s, while gigging in clubs during the evenings, Flack proved a canny educator, telling the Tampa Bay Times in 2012: \"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, DC It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. \"I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. [I'd sing]: 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\""

        "Content": "The chief executive of the Countess of Chester Hospital was worried about a \"wrongful conviction\" after Lucy Letby was arrested, a public inquiry has heard. Tony Chambers was said to have had concerns about Letby's initial detention by Cheshire Constabulary in July 2018 over several unexplained and unexpected collapses of babies in the hospital's neonatal unit, according to Dr Susan Gilby. Dr Gilby joined the Countess of Chester as the new deputy chief executive and medical director weeks after Letby's arrest, and said she had a \"quite bizarre\" discussion with Mr Chambers at that time. Giving evidence to the Thirlwall Inquiry into the events surrounding Letby's crimes, Dr Gilby said she expected the hospital's executive team would be \"absolutely reeling\" that a staff member had been arrested on suspicion of committing multiple murders and attempted murders \"under their watch\". She said: \"What I found, and what Tony wanted to discuss with me, was his concern that actually he still believed, despite the arrest, that no deliberate harm had been caused. \"He kept repeating that there was no single cause found, and I said to him 'well it's not for you to find the cause, you have unexpected and unexplained collapses and deaths of patients and even one of those is a cause of concern'. \"And he just was very focused on the worry that the paediatricians may have caused this nurse harm, and his worry was a wrongful conviction. \"But he was still confident, even though she had been arrested, there would be no progress and there wouldn't ultimately be a charge.\" Read more from Sky News:'No evidence of murder' in Letby caseSenior Tory MP calls for Letby retrialLetby's father 'threatened hospital boss' Letby was moved out of the neonatal unit to non-clinical duties in June 2016, shortly after consultant paediatricians told bosses they feared she may be deliberately harming babies.  Hospital executives, including Mr Chambers and then medical director Ian Harvey, opted to commission several independent probes into the increased mortality. Police were not called in to investigate until May 2017. Dr Gilby said she sensed that both men believed the paediatricians were wrong about their concerns, and that no evidence of deliberate harm had been found in their reviews. \"On a number of occasions it was said to me, [the paediatricians] were just looking for somebody to blame,\" she said. \"They just felt the paediatricians were unable to accept they weren't the best and so when outcomes were poor they were looking for somebody to blame. \"I was being given the impression that I had some 'problem doctors' that needed dealing with.\" Dr Gilby later replaced Mr Chambers, who stepped down in September 2018. Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. Earlier this month an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists told reporters that bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths. Their evidence has been passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hope her case will be referred back to the Court of Appeal. The public inquiry will reconvene at Liverpool Town Hall on 17 March for closing submissions, and the findings of Lady Justice Thirlwall are expected this autumn."

His wife Lisa McCubbin Hill, a journalist who met Mr Hill while writing 2012's The Kennedy Detail: JFK's Secret Service Agents Break Their Silence, said on Instagram: \"From the moment we met, there was an undeniable spark between us. \"We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for - a relationship filled with passion, respect, admiration, and the pure joy of being together. \"I am eternally grateful for every day and every moment of the past 15 years we shared. To us, forever. Rest in Peace my Sweet Prince.\" On 22 November 1963, Mr Hill - part of first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's security detail on the day of the assassination - leapt from a Secret Service car to the US president's after Mr Kennedy was shot. Footage filmed by eyewitness Abraham Zapruder showed the agent grabbing a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulling himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He then forced Mrs Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. While Mr Hill was commended for his actions and became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail, he blamed himself for Mr Kennedy's death and retired from the Secret Service in 1975 - aged 43. He told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes that year: \"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave.\" Mr Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He then attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the US president and first family.

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n Celebrating its best-ever result, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has made extraordinary gains in the last few years.  It has doubled its vote share since 2021 with more than 10 million people picking them in this year's federal election. You only have to look at a map of Germany to see where much of its support comes from. Almost all of the old East Germany has turned AfD blue. Read more:Conservatives win German election - as AfD makes historic gains The party has always been more popular in German areas that were once under Soviet rule, but this year has tightened its grip. In the stronghold state of Thuringia, the party got more than 38% of the vote. Feeling fed up and ignored by mainstream parties, many have flocked to the far right. Some of that support is fuelled by resentment that 35 years after Germany reunified, wages in the east are still lower than the west. After Germany lost in World War Two, the country was split into four zones of occupation that were controlled by the UK, US, France and the Soviet Union. The American, British and French sectors formed West Germany in 1949, while the Soviet sector was East Germany.  Berlin was also split four ways even though it was in the Soviet zone, with the famous Berlin Wall signifying the divide.  Over the second half of the 20th century, East and West Germany reflected the Cold War ideologies of Russia and the US. West Germany was a capitalist democracy with a prosperous economy, while East Germany was a communist country with a very poor economy. The border between East and West Germany shut in 1952, with the divide in Berlin closing in 1961 - separating families and communities overnight. The borders remained shut until the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, with Germany reuniting in October 1990. The wall came down amid unrest in East Germany and a wave of revolutions in the countries of the Soviet bloc. The Soviet Union eventually collapsed in 1991. The almost four decades of very different levels of economic growth was clear after reunification. East Germany's centrally planned economy had far lower living standards, stagnant productivity and poor consumer choice compared to the more advanced, capitalist West Germany. The East German economy was so underdeveloped in the years since reunification, and that part of the country has never caught up to the more prosperous west. While the gap has narrowed in recent years, it stubbornly remains. Median gross pay for eastern workers was €3,013 (£2,497) per month in 2024, versus €3,655 (£3,029) in the west, according to the Reuters news agency. Unemployment is also higher in the east, while 98% of Germany's inheritance tax is paid in the west, Reuters said. People are increasingly disconnected from centrist politicians they feel don't understand them. On a recent road trip to AfD heartlands, people told me that migration, the economy, and the war in Ukraine were all reasons why they were supporting the party.  Initial statistics show the AfD is now the most popular party among young men. It also managed to successfully convert nearly two million non-voters to its cause. While it is strongest in the east, it has made gains in the west and, in total, took almost a million votes from the leading Christian Democrats. If centrist parties fail to solve the issues worrying Germans, the far right is waiting in the wings ready to seize power at the next election in 2029."

But he said he regards himself as not guilty of those crimes in some of the cases. \"I am aware that these injuries are irreparable,\" he said. \"I cannot go back in time but I owe it to all of these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions.\"  Read more:Diaries of a monster Le Scouarnec is alleged to be the most prolific child abuser ever apprehended in France. His crimes finally came to light when his six-year-old neighbour told her mother he had sexually abused her while she was playing in the garden of her home, in the town of Jonzac in southwest France. The investigations that followed led to his conviction and imprisonment for raping and sexually assaulting four young girls in 2020. But evidence recovered by the police during that investigation revealed abuse on a far wider scale. When searching Le Scouarnec's home, police found 300,000 indecent photos and videos of children (some hard copies and some on computers), 70 child-sized dolls - some of which were chained up - wigs and, crucially, hundreds of notebooks and diaries detailing his acts of abuse.

        "Content": "A teenager who admitted killing his mother and two younger siblings was plotting a school shooting, it can now be reported. Nicholas Prosper, 19, appeared at Luton Crown Court over the deaths of Juliana Falcon, 48, Giselle Prosper, 13, and Kyle Prosper, 16. Their bodies were found at a flat in Leabank, off Wauluds Bank Drive, Luton, in September. He was also planning a shooting at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Luton, where he and his siblings had all been pupils. Headteacher Maureen Murphy said staff were \"very shocked\" to learn of the plot, but that there is no threat to the school. Prosper's harrowing plan, said to have left investigators \"in shock and disbelief\", was foiled by police who spotted him in the street immediately after the murders. He was stopped in nearby Bramingham Road, and a loaded shotgun was found hidden in bushes nearby, along with more than 30 cartridges. As he appeared in court on Monday, Prosper spoke to confirm his identity and to plead guilty to three charges of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Khanna, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"In all my years working on murder investigations, I have never known a case quite like this. \"Not only were three innocent lives taken in such brutal circumstances, but we then learnt of Prosper's plans to carry out a shooting at a school, something which left our whole investigation team in shock and disbelief. \"We cannot even begin to comprehend why someone would plan to kill innocent children and are so grateful to those arresting officers who helped prevent this from taking place.\" Leader of Luton Council, Hazel Simmons MBE, branded the murders as \"senseless\" and said their thoughts were with the victims, their family and friends. The councillor sought to reassure parents by saying \"our schools have robust systems in place to keep children safe and security is constantly reviewed and monitored\". After recently asking schools to review their security, Ms Simmons said schools will be asked to further review their measures in light of what emerged from court on Monday. \"On behalf of the town I would like to thank and praise the excellent work of Bedfordshire Police for apprehending the perpetrator before he attempted to cause more harm. \"However, we know this case will be unsettling for parents which is why the council is working with schools to put support in place in our schools to anyone who needs it.\" Prosper also admitted a number of other offences, including purchasing a shotgun without a certificate, possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life and possession of a kitchen knife in a public place. He will be sentenced on 5 March and has been remanded in custody. 'A cold-blooded attack' Chris Derrick, a deputy chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the victims' lives \"were stolen in a cold-blooded attack\". Mr Derrick said in a statement \"the full extent of Prosper's actions will be laid bare when he is sentenced, and he can expect to face a very long time behind bars\". He added: \"We hope today's conviction offers some solace to those who loved and cared for them, as they mourn their loss.\" A friend of Ms Falcon previously described her as someone who \"lived for her children\" and said she was \"a positive person who will be so terribly missed\". A previous statement on X from the headteacher at Lea Manor High School said they were \"deeply shocked\" by the death of Giselle. \"Giselle was a beautiful soul and a model pupil, she excelled in all her subjects and will be sorely missed, particularly by her friends in Year 9.\" Read more from Sky News: Girl, 3, who died in crash involving van and tram namedChildren 'screaming in sheer terror' after van filled with fireworks set alight Kyle's school described the incident as \"devastating\" and offered \"heartfelt condolences\" to his family.

        "Content": "The chief executive of the Countess of Chester Hospital was worried about a \"wrongful conviction\" after Lucy Letby was arrested, a public inquiry has heard. Tony Chambers was said to have had concerns about Letby's initial detention by Cheshire Constabulary in July 2018 over several unexplained and unexpected collapses of babies in the hospital's neonatal unit, according to Dr Susan Gilby. Dr Gilby joined the Countess of Chester as the new deputy chief executive and medical director weeks after Letby's arrest, and said she had a \"quite bizarre\" discussion with Mr Chambers at that time. Giving evidence to the Thirlwall Inquiry into the events surrounding Letby's crimes, Dr Gilby said she expected the hospital's executive team would be \"absolutely reeling\" that a staff member had been arrested on suspicion of committing multiple murders and attempted murders \"under their watch\". She said: \"What I found, and what Tony wanted to discuss with me, was his concern that actually he still believed, despite the arrest, that no deliberate harm had been caused. \"He kept repeating that there was no single cause found, and I said to him 'well it's not for you to find the cause, you have unexpected and unexplained collapses and deaths of patients and even one of those is a cause of concern'. \"And he just was very focused on the worry that the paediatricians may have caused this nurse harm, and his worry was a wrongful conviction. \"But he was still confident, even though she had been arrested, there would be no progress and there wouldn't ultimately be a charge.\" Read more from Sky News:'No evidence of murder' in Letby caseSenior Tory MP calls for Letby retrialLetby's father 'threatened hospital boss' Letby was moved out of the neonatal unit to non-clinical duties in June 2016, shortly after consultant paediatricians told bosses they feared she may be deliberately harming babies.  Hospital executives, including Mr Chambers and then medical director Ian Harvey, opted to commission several independent probes into the increased mortality. Police were not called in to investigate until May 2017. Dr Gilby said she sensed that both men believed the paediatricians were wrong about their concerns, and that no evidence of deliberate harm had been found in their reviews. \"On a number of occasions it was said to me, [the paediatricians] were just looking for somebody to blame,\" she said. \"They just felt the paediatricians were unable to accept they weren't the best and so when outcomes were poor they were looking for somebody to blame. \"I was being given the impression that I had some 'problem doctors' that needed dealing with.\" Dr Gilby later replaced Mr Chambers, who stepped down in September 2018. Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. Earlier this month an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists told reporters that bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths. Their evidence has been passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hope her case will be referred back to the Court of Appeal. The public inquiry will reconvene at Liverpool Town Hall on 17 March for closing submissions, and the findings of Lady Justice Thirlwall are expected this autumn."

How the Ukraine-Russia deal is struck will affect not just Ukraine's security, but the whole of Europe. Politics latest: 'Alarm bells ringing for Labour' It is, in the words of the prime minister, a generational moment - and he is the man who has to try to meet that moment in a week that could prove defining for his premiership. His task is to try to persuade the US to offer security guarantees for Ukraine and contain rather than embolden an aggressive Russia. He also has to use his trip to try to strengthen the trade relationship with the US and persuade Donald Trump to pause any potential tariffs for the UK. His team have been war gaming all the scenarios, and the prime minister will go with a clear message on what the UK is asking of the US and what it can offer.  How can PM woo Trump over Ukraine? Sir Keir has already offered to put UK troops on the ground as part of any peacekeeping force and promised to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Trump is demanding markedly more from NATO allies, suggesting they should hit 5%, as expectations rise over the UK's commitments on defence (Number 10 are refusing to comment, for now). The prime minister will also, in a nod to Trump's tilt to the Indo-Pacific, reiterate the UK's commitment to AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership between the US, UK, and Australia. What Sir Keir and Europe need from Trump is some sort of US security backstop for Ukraine in any deal with Russia. Up to now, Trump has parroted Vladimir Putin's playbook, accusing Ukraine of starting the war (untrue) and Volodymyr Zelenskyy being a dictator (also untrue), while also ruling out Kyiv joining NATO and promising to normalise relations with Russia. From the phone call with Putin, to cutting Europe and Ukraine out negotiations in Saudi Arabia last week, Trump has played the role of a strongman carving up the world according to spheres of influence. Part of Sir Keir's job on Thursday will be to persuade Trump that in this vein of \"great power transactional diplomacy\", Putin is not his equal and playing into his hands will not secure a stable peace. Read more:Trump makes Starmer's life harderTrump's falsehoods should be called out  From MAGA to MEGA On trade, new ambassador Lord Mandelson is talking up a \"MEGA\" deal (Make our Economies Great Again) by working up a proposal for increasing the £300bn worth of trade between the UK and US. The hope is for the prime minister to come away from the White House with a commitment to begin a process of deepening trade and economic ties between London and Washington, which leads to a series of individual trade arrangements rather than a big bang deal that could take years to negotiate. But if those are the aims, there is plenty of jeopardy for a UK government and the Number 10 team trying to plan a trip against the backdrop of a president they simply can't predict. Could a rift open between old allies? When I asked one insider whether they thought Trump's attacks on Zelenskyy were a ploy to bring Putin to the table, or the president's real views, they said: \"The honest answer is we don't know and that is part of where we are right now. \"We need to get over there and get a better sense of the president's red lines.\" Never miss an episode of Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts. For now, the Number 10 team are focused less on what Trump says and more on what he does, with the understanding that if his starting position really is his endgame, there will be a rift between two old allies. Sir Keir's problems were already piling up before Trump's entry into the White House, and he goes to Washington knowing further instability in Europe - and potential trade barriers with the UK's second-biggest trading partner - only makes his already difficult task of delivering a \"decade of national renewal\" harder still. The stakes couldn't be higher, or more unpredictable."

The toilet, an artwork by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was fully functioning while on exhibit at Blenheim Palace - the Oxfordshire country house where Sir Winston Churchill was born - when it was stolen in September 2019. The 18-carat gold toilet, titled America, weighed approximately 98kg and had been insured for the price of $6m (£4.75 m), the prosecution told Oxford Crown Court. The gold in itself was believed to be worth about £2.8m at the time of the theft. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, pleaded not guilty in January to stealing artwork in an overnight raid in the early hours of 14 September 2019. Frederick Sines, 36, also known as Frederick Doe, of Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, and Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, each deny one count of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. The court heard that the sledgehammers were left at the scene. Prosecutor Julian Christopher KC said within days of the raid, two men were using \"car\" as a codeword for the stolen gold and contact was made with a Hatton Garden jeweller. \"The burglary was carefully planned and swiftly carried out,\" Mr Christopher said. \"The men, five of them it appears, drove through locked wooden gates into the grounds of Blenheim Palace shortly before 5am in two stolen vehicles, an Isuzu truck and a VW Golf. \"They drove across a field, up to the front steps and smashed and broke in through a window. \"They knew precisely where to go, broke down the wooden door to the cubicle where the toilet was fully plumbed in, removed it, leaving water pouring out of the pipes, and drove away. \"All in all they spent just five minutes in the building. \"Clearly such an audacious raid would not have been possible without lots of preparation.\" Read more from Sky News:King enjoys 'a slurp' of beer in brewery tasting sessionRoberta Flack dies aged 88 Mr Christopher added: \"The work of art was never recovered.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The jailing of Mike Amesbury for 10 weeks for assault means Sir Keir Starmer potentially faces his first by-election test since becoming prime minister. Officially, the 55-year-old former Labour MP for Runcorn and Helsby now faces a recall petition, but realistically he's under enormous pressure to resign without delay. Politics latest: 'Alarm bells ringing' for Labour Amesbury was immediately disowned by the Labour Party, which condemned his actions in the assault as \"completely unacceptable\" and said it was time for a new MP. \"Local residents in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency deserved better, and we look forward to them getting the representation they deserved in the future with a new MP,\" said a party spokesperson. However, if Amesbury appeals against his sentence, as it's being suggested he may, that would delay a by-election as a writ can't be moved unless appeals are exhausted, or he stands down voluntarily. Amesbury held the Cheshire seat with a seemingly healthy 14,696 majority at the July 2024 general election. But in a potential nightmare for Sir Keir, it was Reform UK - not the Conservatives - in second place. A challenge for Labour - but Tories in disarray The current state of opinion polls, with Nigel Farage's party edging ahead of Labour, suggests Reform will be in contention in a by-election and could pull off a sensational victory. And so predictably it was Reform's chairman Zia Yusuf who led calls from opponents for Amesbury to resign, followed by a handful of Tory backbenchers - but not by Kemi Badenoch yet. \"The great people of Runcorn deserve far better than waiting six weeks for a recall petition to take place,\" said Mr Yusuf. \"We call on Mike Amesbury to do the honourable thing and resign immediately.\" The risk of humiliation by Mr Farage may deter Labour big hitter Jonathan Ashworth - one of five Labour MPs defeated in July last year - from gambling on a quick return to Westminster in this seat. The Conservatives appear to be in disarray over a potential by-election. Sky News can reveal that party HQ last week invited applications to be Tory candidate, with a deadline fast approaching. \"We are writing to invite applications for Runcorn and Helsby,\" said a letter from the party's candidates team. \"We are particularly keen to see applications from people with links to the constituency. \"If you are eligible to stand and interested in applying, please apply through the Microsoft Form here and apply by no later than Tuesday 25th February at 12pm.\" Read more:Trump makes Starmer's life harderNet zero push provides bump in salaries When could a by-election happen? A recall petition happens if an MP is jailed or receives a suspended sentence of a year or less. It lasts six weeks and if 10% of electors sign it, there's a by-election - though the recalled MP can stand. The last MP to be jailed was Tory Imran Ahmad Khan, former MP for Wakefield, who was sentenced to 18 months after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-yar-old boy. Labour won that by-election. Although Sir Keir and the Labour high command have acknowledged since Amesbury pleaded guilty that a by-election in Runcorn and Helsby was almost inevitable, the party faces a dilemma over the timing of a poll. Labour's statement looking forward to a new MP suggests the party favours a speedy by-election, without the delay of a recall petition, rather than waiting until the local elections on 1 May or even later. But there are dangers in a quick poll, as Sir Keir will recall. He was advised to rush the Hartlepool by-election in 2021, with disastrous results, and he has admitted he considered quitting after that humiliating defeat. The numbers in Runcorn and Helsby last July were Labour on 22,358 votes (52.94%), Reform 7,662, (18.14%), Conservatives 6,756, (16%), Greens 2,715, (6.43%) and Liberal Democrats 2,149, (5.09%). Runcorn is on the southern bank of the River Mersey and has expanded as a new town since 1964, and dominates the constituency with a population of 61,000. There are two smaller towns, Frodsham and Helsby. Amesbury became MP for the processor seat of Weaver Vale in 2017. He was a shadow minister for work and pensions under Jeremy Corbyn, and for housing, communities and local government under Sir Keir until 2022."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Insults hurled by Donald Trump at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are \"ghastly to hear\" and \"complete untruths\", former British prime minister Boris Johnson has said. A friend of both men, however, he said he was \"optimistic\" Kyiv and Washington would agree an \"economic partnership\" that would benefit both sides. Speaking to Sky News on a trip to Kyiv, Mr Johnson also said Sir Keir Starmer should hike UK defence spending up to 3% of national income \"very quickly\" - at least by 2030 \"if not sooner\". He also said the best way for the prime minister to demonstrate UK credibility on defence would be to use a meeting with Mr Trump in Washington this week to set out a plan for an \"Anglo-French\" force to help provide security for Ukraine. Mr Johnson described this as the start of a \"steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\", saying it should be up to 30,000-strong, including troops from across Europe.  The former prime minister, who led the UK response to Russia's full-scale war and is viewed as a hero by many in Ukraine, said it is \"horrendous\" to think the conflict is still raging. \"I really grieve for the suffering of Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine I'm particularly pained,\" he said. \n                  Boris Johnson brands Vladimir Putin a 'f****** idiot' over alleged imperial ambitions\n                 \n                  Carrie Johnson treated in hospital for 'nasty chest infection' after contracting flu and pneumonia\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer puts UK economy first as he defies critics of Saudi Arabia trip\n                 But he was critical of a series of verbal attacks by Mr Trump against Mr Zelenskyy, which included calling him a \"dictator without elections\" and suggesting Ukraine was to blame for the war. \"It's ghastly to hear, some of the language that's been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator,\" Mr Johnson said, speaking bluntly. \"We all know that these are complete untruths.\" Read more from Sky News: Jailed MP will still get £91,000 salary while in prisonThieves stole £2.8m gold toilet in just five minutes, court hears But the former prime minister signalled he believed the US leader was still on Kyiv's side and he would not want Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold power over Ukraine's future. \"I remain actually optimistic about Ukraine and about their chances of success,\" he said.  Mr Johnson pointed to a deal that Washington wants to sign with Kyiv that will give the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth - though the Ukrainians want US security guarantees in return. Referring to a draft text, he said it contained lines such as \"America committed to a free, sovereign, secure Ukraine. \"Money to go to building up Ukraine's future security. America committing to long-term financial support\". He said a commitment to Ukraine's long-term security was also needed but he did not expect that to be included in the initial document. \"I think what needs to happen is that we, us, the Brits, the French… need to step up and show to Donald Trump, that we are willing to do what he keeps asking for and to take more of the burden ourselves,\" he said. Mr Johnson said he hoped Sir Keir would use his trip to Washington to \"set out an Anglo-French deterrent force that can begin to provide the steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\". Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron - who was in Washington on Monday - have been developing a plan with other European and Western allies to build a force of up to 30,000 troops to provide reassurance to Ukraine following a ceasefire. Mr Johnson said this would be an important demonstration of European strength in the eyes of the American leader. \"I think an Anglo-French plan for a deterrent force - I'm not talking about war fighting, I'm talking about forces that go in to help with logistics, to help backfilling, to help with training…. perhaps maximum 30,000 from the whole of Europe. \"It would be symbolic, but it would be exactly what [Vladimir] Putin doesn't want and what he thinks that he can forbid.\" The former British leader said the Russian president wants to block Ukraine from having British troops on its land or from joining NATO. \"But I don't think that Donald Trump can possibly accept that outcome. I know, he won't accept that outcome,\" Mr Johnson said. \"He doesn't want Putin to win any more than anybody else here in Kyiv does.\" Sir Keir is expected to set a timeframe as early as this week for when Britain will lift its defence budget to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% - but Mr Johnson signalled that Mr Trump would be expecting a \"bigger number\". \"I think he needs to go higher…. I think in the United States, they're going to want to hear a bigger number,\" he said."

There were also 93 votes in favour of this resolution, while 65 abstained and 18 voted against it. The UK, France and Germany were among the countries that voted in favour of the Ukraine-backed resolution, which called for a \"comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine\". The US, Russia, Belarus and North Korea were among those that opposed it. The duelling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the US and Ukraine after Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the US' relationship with Europe over the Trump administration's decision to engage with Moscow. The outcome marks a setback for the Trump administration in the UN General Assembly, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. However, later in the day, the UN Security Council approved the US resolution calling for an end to war in Ukraine - but without mentioning Russia's aggression. The resolution received 10 votes in favour, while the remaining five members - including France and the UK - abstained. Dame Barbara Woodward, the UK's ambassador to the United Nations, said after the UN Security Council approved the motion: \"What, how and on what terms this war ends can only be decided by negotiations with Ukraine. \"No peace will be sustainable without Ukraine's consent. \"We regret that our proposals making these points clear were not taken on board, and as such we could not support this resolution. \"But we share the ambition to find a lasting end to this war, supported by robust security arrangements that ensure Ukraine never again has to face Russia's attack.\" It came after the results in the General Assembly had showed some diminished support for Ukraine - as more than 140 nations had voted to condemn Russia's aggression in previous votes. The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favour of its proposal, according to a US official and a European diplomat. US deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous UN resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond\". \"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all UN member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Ms Shea said.

Mr Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\". Mr Zelenskyy responded by saying the US president was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\". Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is at the White House holding talks with Mr Trump to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine. At the start of the meeting, Mr Trump told reporters Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the war in the country. Mr Trump and Mr Macron have been meeting after the pair had earlier joined a call between G7 leaders.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who will meet with Mr Trump at the White House on Thursday, appeared virtually and said G7 nations should be ready to \"take on more risk\". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Kyiv, called Russia's aggression a war on \"our way of life\". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Europe's \"first priority\" is to strengthen Ukraine's resistance. She said this includes speeding up the delivery of weapons and increasing investment, announcing a further €3.5bn (about £3bn) in aid for Ukraine."

        "Content": " Pope Francis's health has shown a \"slight improvement\" but he remains in a critical condition, the Vatican has said. The Pope, 88, has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since 14 February and is being treated for double pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. In a statement on Monday evening, the Vatican said: \"The clinical conditions of the Holy Father, in their critical state, show a slight improvement. \"Even today there were no episodes of asthmatic respiratory crises; some laboratory tests improved. \"Monitoring of mild renal failure is not a cause for concern. Oxygen therapy continues, although with slightly reduced flow and oxygen percentage. \"The doctors, considering the complexity of the clinical picture, are prudently not releasing the prognosis yet. In the morning he received the Eucharist, while in the afternoon he resumed work activity. \"In the evening he called the Parish Priest of the Parish of Gaza to express his paternal closeness. Pope Francis thanks all the people of God who have gathered in these days to pray for his health.\" Over the weekend, the pontiff suffered a \"prolonged respiratory crisis\" that required a high flow of oxygen, as well as an \"initial, mild\" kidney problem. The Vatican also said he had blood transfusions after tests revealed thrombocytopenia, which is associated with anaemia. Doctors said on Friday that he was \"not out of danger\" and was expected to remain in hospital for at least another week. They warned the main threat he faced was sepsis, which can occur as a complication of pneumonia, and lead to organ failure and death. The Pope has a history of respiratory illness, having lost part of one of his lungs to pleurisy as a young man. He also had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023.

His condition has given rise to speculation over a possible resignation - which the Vatican has not commented on. In a mesage from Francis which was released on Sunday, the pontiff asked people to pray for him. \"In recent days I have received many messages of affection, and I have been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children\" he said. \"Thank you for this closeness, and for the prayers of comfort I have received from all over the world! I entrust you all to the intercession of Mary, and I ask you to pray for me.\""

        "Content": "\n          Military analyst\n        In a strictly military sense, the war in Ukraine is not going so badly for Kyiv.  Russian territorial gains on the ground have slowed to a crawl since last November for which they are losing, on average, some 1,500 men every day. They have almost - but still not quite - taken Toretsk. And after months of being on the verge of overwhelming the other key strategic towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk, Russian forces still remain outside them. Russia's massive air bombing campaign against the Ukrainian power grid, its critical infrastructure and civilian targets has not brought Kyiv to its knees, though this has been far and away the toughest winter of Russia's air offensive against Ukraine. Follow Ukraine war latest And in the Black Sea, Ukraine has chased the Russian navy away from its western waters and thus kept its vital shipping routes open from the Odesa ports to the Mediterranean and the Danube Basin. This is a strategic battle Ukraine has unquestionably won. But with so much material help from Iran, North Korea and China, Russia is obviously prepared to carry on the war, even though on current trends, its own economy will be pretty shaky by the end of this year. If Western powers, particularly the United States, continued with their previous levels of support, then Ukraine could carry on as well, if it were minded to keep fighting, even with its more limited pool of manpower. But the battlefield doesn't matter much any more. The political ground has dramatically shifted under Kyiv and its principal backers in Europe. The US seems to have suddenly reversed its position under President Trump, and it is driving Ukraine into a very rapid, so-called 'peace deal'. Serious negotiations have not yet begun, but top US decision-makers seem to want to give Moscow more than it could ever have dreamed of when its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine went so spectacularly wrong three years ago.  Moscow now feels it has a very good chance of keeping all its military gains, getting even parts of the Ukrainian regions it hasn't yet conquered, getting some relief from sanctions, US investment in its economy and re-entry into the G7, which would go back to being a G8. It will also be making demands on what Kyiv will and will not be allowed to do and what NATO should do to \"reassure\" Moscow that it won't have to invade anyone else in an act of self-defence. Most of all, the US is holding out the tantalizing prospect to Russia that NATO's \"transatlantic dimension\" may be militarily finished under the Trump administration. That implies that if the Europeans end up fighting Russia in the future, the US will stand aside. That prospect is the greatest free gift Washington could ever give Moscow. Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, even Gorbachev and Yeltsin, fervently wished for it but never even got close. Putin may feel it is now within his grasp, whatever happens next in Ukraine."

        "Content": " Friedrich Merz, who is set to become the new German chancellor, has vowed to \"create unity\" in Europe as it adjusts to the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine. Mr Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats of outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz, who will remain in office for the immediate future. He has repeatedly pledged not to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, despite its second-place finish but which is under observation by the country's intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism. Mr Merz's conservative Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, which won with 28.5% of the votes, and the Social Democrats have a combined 328 seats in the 630-seat parliament.  The 69-year-old, who put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign, said he hopes to complete a deal by Easter. Experts believe this could prove to be a challenging timescale as the rivals try to find common ground over key policies. Co-leader of the Social Democrats, Lars Klingbeil, indicated a deal with Mr Merz is not a formality.  He said: \"The ball is in Friedrich Merz's court. Only the course of any talks will show whether a government can be formed.\" With US President Donald Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Mr Merz wants to unify Europe in the face of challenges from the US and Russia. \"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\" Read more: Who is Friedrich Merz - the trained pilot?The woman at the top of Germany's far-right AfD party At a media conference later, he added: \"There are three topics we need to talk about. Of course, external and security policy - especially following the statements coming out of Washington. \"It is clear that we as Europeans need to be able to act swiftly. We need to be able to defend ourselves. That is a topic that is a top priority in the next few weeks.\" Mr Merz said he remains \"hopeful\" of maintaining the transatlantic relationship, but warned if it \"is destroyed, it will not only be to the detriment of Europe, it will also be to the detriment of America\". On the other key issues, he added: \"Another important topic is the immigration - that is an area where we have proposals. I suppose the Social Democrats will be prepared to talk to us about this as well. \"The third topic is the economic situation. We have to protect work in the industrial sector in Germany.\" He also earlier used social media to say \"Europe stands unwaveringly by Ukraine's side\" and how \"we must put Ukraine in a position of strength\"."

Vietnam's foreign ministry announced the baseline - used to determine limits to territorial waters and exclusive economic zones - on Friday, saying it was to help protect and enforce its sovereign rights. China's Maritime Safety Administration said the live-fire exercises would be focused on the Beibu Gulf area, closer to the Chinese side of the Gulf of Tonkin, and would run through to Thursday evening. Vietnam has not publicly responded to the Chinese drills. In March last year, China announced its baseline in the Gulf of Tonkin. In response, Vietnam said international law and the rights and interests of other countries must be respected. Baselines are a sensitive subject in the South China Sea - where China, Vietnam and other countries in the region including the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan, have conflicting claims. The waters include two island chains - the Spratlys and Paracels - as well as a number of reefs. China and Vietnam have long had a maritime agreement governing the Gulf of Tonkin, but have been locked in competing claims over the islands and maritime areas. China has been growing aggressive in pursuing those claims, and in October, 10 Vietnamese fishermen were assaulted near the Paracel Islands. China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own, though it has not publicly released exact coordinates of its claim other than a map with 10 dashed lines broadly demarcating what it calls its territory.

She wrote to the Russian president demanding an explanation as to why an 18-year-old conscript was involved in combat. Throughout the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin promised that conscripts wouldn't be sent to war. But in Valentin's case, the war came to him. He had been deployed to the Kursk region as part of his military service and stationed on the border. But it was there that Ukrainian forces launched their cross-border incursion in August and one month after it began, Valentin was killed after receiving a shrapnel wound to the head. \"It should be specially trained people there, not children,\" Elena says. \"They were taken from home, from a mother's nest, and brought to some unknown place, where there is shooting. \n                  A gift any Russian leader could only dream of is in Putin's grasp - a NATO without US military support\n                 \n                  Explosion at Russian consulate in France after plastic bottles thrown\n                 \n                  The rupture in diplomatic norms has left Ukraine and Europe reeling - as Russia's full-scale invasion reaches three-year mark\n                 \"What kind of warrior is he? He's not a warrior.\" Like other fallen soldiers, Russia views Valentin as a hero, but that's no comfort to Elena. All she has are questions, which she wasn't afraid to put to Mr Putin directly. \"The most important question was: 'What were our children doing there?' But I didn't get any response,\" she says. \"At that moment I just wanted to take the whole world and turn it upside down. \"Whoever says they are obligated for military service, what do they owe? What did my son take from the Motherland to pay a debt with his life?\" Read more:Russian oligarchs with links to Kremlin face UK banZelenskyy on why he would give up presidencyFact-checking Trump's claims on Zelenskyy and Ukraine Valentin was a few weeks short of his 19th birthday when he died, and nearly a year into his military service.

Pictures of him in his parade uniform are everywhere in her apartment in Rybinsk, a town 160 miles northeast of Moscow. His blue beret is perched on a shelf. And Elena still hopes that one day he'll walk through the door. \"I still wait for him to come back home, even though I saw his body. I still can't believe it,\" she says, tears running down her face. \"Sometimes I sit and think who my grandchildren could have been. It's impossible to live like this. It's not life.\" Russia doesn't publish its casualty figures but the UK estimates that more than 750,000 Russian troops have either been killed or wounded in the three years since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion began. Valentin is buried in a cemetery on the outskirts of Rybinsk - a 20-minute bus ride for Elena. There are dozens and dozens of military graves there, each one marked with flags. The grave next to Valentin is for a serviceman killed on the same day as him. It's rare for anyone to speak openly in Russia about the war because criticising it can land you in prison. But Elena is determined to prevent other mothers from suffering the same experience. \"I want only one thing - for all children to come home,\" she said. \"I want them to hear us and give us back our children in the same state we gave them, not cold.\""

The airline did not clarify what the security issue was, but a source familiar with the situation told Sky News' US partner network NBC News it was a bomb threat sent via email.

The retired German midfielder, 36, was named on the ruling AK Party's (AKP) Central Decision and Management Board during a party congress on Sunday. Ozil, who is of Turkish descent, received criticism later in his career due to his relationship with Mr Erdogan. He retired from the German national team in 2018, five years before his wider retirement from the game, after a photo of him meeting the Turkish president in London caused uproar. Reinhard Grindel, who was the head of Germany's soccer federation at the time, accused the players of allowing themselves to be \"exploited\" by Mr Erdogan for political purposes. Some German politicians questioned Ozil's loyalty to Germany, suggesting he should be removed from the national squad ahead of the World Cup in 2018.

Ozil got married to Amine Gulse in Istanbul the following summer, with Mr Erdogan present at the wedding.  Mr Erdogan has presided over Turkey for more than two decades - as prime minister since 2003 and president since 2014. His critics say he has turned Turkey into an autocracy and eroded people's rights, having introduced a new system in 2018 that abolished the office of the prime minister and concentrated most powers in the hands of the president. Ozil, who won the World Cup with Germany in 2014, left Arsenal for Turkish side Fenerbahce in 2021 before moving to Istanbul Basaksehir in 2022, where he retired a year later. A history of sportspeople turning to politics Ozil is just the latest sportsperson to try his hand at politics. Another highly decorated footballer who transitioned is former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and AC Milan striker George Weah, who became the president of Liberia in 2018. The then-51-year-old was the country's first democratically-elected leader since 1944, having run on a mandate to stop corruption and create jobs. He lost the next election to 79-year-old Joseph Boakai last month. Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan, who was last month given a 14-year jail sentence in a land corruption case, initially rose to prominence as a cricketer in the 1970s. The controversial 72-year-old captained Pakistan to World Cup glory in 1992, famously telling his teammates to fight like \"cornered tigers\". Multiple world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko was elected as the mayor of Ukrainian capital Kyiv in 2014, just a year after hanging up his gloves. The 53-year-old has remained in the post as the country has defended itself against Russian aggression for three years. In 2021, boxing legend Manny Pacquiao retired from the sport to focus on his campaign to be president of the Philippines. The now 46-year-old had less success than the aforementioned sportsmen, conceding the 2022 presidential race to Bongbong Marcos. Romario, one of the most prolific goalscorers in football history for Brazil, has been a member of the country's Senate since 2015, having ended his lengthy playing career in 2008. He did so having supposedly scored around 1,000 goals over his 23-year career and won the 1994 World Cup."

His crimes finally came to light when his six-year-old neighbour told her mother he had sexually abused her while she was playing in the garden of her home, in the town of Jonzac in southwest France. The investigations that followed led to his conviction and imprisonment for raping and sexually assaulting four young girls in 2020. But evidence recovered by the police during that investigation revealed abuse on a far wider scale. When searching Le Scouarnec's home, police found 300,000 indecent photos and videos of children (some hard copies and some on computers), 70 child-sized dolls - some of which were chained up - wigs and, crucially, hundreds of notebooks and diaries detailing his acts of abuse.

I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\" one of the victims recalled of her time in the hospital when she was nine years old in 1991. \"I cried a lot.\" Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year."

        "Content": " Emmanuel Macron has said a peace deal with Russia \"must not mean a surrender of Ukraine\" - as Donald Trump claimed Vladimir Putin's forces \"want to end this war\". The US and French presidents met amid fragile relations between America and Europe and after Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meeting in the White House on the third anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine, the French president said he and Mr Trump \"made substantive steps forward during our discussions\". Mr Macron told reporters that Europe should do more to bolster defence in the continent. However, he stressed Russia \"is the aggressor\" in the conflict and added: \"President Putin violated the peace.\"  Peace must allow Kyiv 'sovereignty' The French leader then said: \"We want peace, he wants peace. We want peace swiftly, but we don't want an agreement that is weak.\" \"This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine or a ceasefire without guarantees,\" he added. \"It must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues that affect it. \"It is also a country in which we need to shoulder our responsibilities so that we ensure security and stability for Ukraine and for the entire region. \"For Europeans, this is an existential issue.\" Read more:Trump and Macron's careful dance side-stepped divisions 'Get this war stopped' At a news conference following the talks, Mr Macron said he \"fully believes\" there is a path forward in negotiations. He also agreed \"there is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin\" - a week after the leaders had a 90-minute-long phone call. Mr Trump added Russia would accept European troops in Ukraine as part of peacekeeping efforts, adding: \"I specifically asked him (Putin) that question. He has no problem with it.\" He told reporters: \"When I got here, one of the first calls I made was to Putin and it was made with great respect. They want to end this war.\" Mr Trump then explained he wants to \"get this war stopped,\" whether that's through a ceasefire or a direct agreement - but when asked if Ukraine should give up territory as part of any deal, he said: \"We'll see.\" The news conference came as Mr Putin said he is ready to discuss Russia cutting its defence budget alongside the US, saying a mutual drop of 50% would be a \"good idea\". The Russian president also touted a possible economic deal with the US, offering talks on a deal for its own rare earth metal supplies and for the sale of aluminium to American firms. The US president is due to meet Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday, after the prime minister warned Mr Trump that a bad peace deal would be a \"disaster for everyone\".

A notably prolonged handshake, reflecting the complex dynamic between the President of the United States and his French counterpart. Donald Trump may have hoped to see a full turn by Emmanuel Macron - but got a pirouette. Follow latest: 'Good reason'' to re-engage with Putin, Macron says A half-turn, in a carefully choreographed dance, the US leader asserting optimism, the French one, much more cautious in response. President Trump repeated his view that the war in Ukraine would soon end. He signalled a dramatic shift by Russia, suggesting President Putin might accept the deployment of European peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine. But Emmanuel Macron cautioned that any peace agreement must respect Ukraine's sovereignty. Trump claimed Ukraine's president would be in Washington soon, to sign a deal granting the US access to rare earth minerals to offset US war aid. Again, the French president gently stressed the need for security guarantees. Neither side wanted a diplomatic spat, side-stepping the divisions laid bare by events in Kyiv and New York on the third anniversary of the war. The United States was notably absent when Western leaders convened in Ukraine. And the United States voted against an amendment to a UN resolution replacing the word \"conflict\" with the words \"full-scale invasion\". There is a world of difference between Trump's approach and Macron's. In his trademark pragmatic style, the US president seeks a swift end to the war, with economic benefits, even if it risks longstanding alliances. President Macron's focus on Ukraine's sovereignty, prioritising stability and mutual co-operation, represents a more traditional diplomatic stance.

It also made no mention of Ukraine's territorial integrity.

It was also amended to include references to Ukraine's sovereignty.

There were also 93 votes in favour of this resolution, while 65 abstained and 18 voted against it. The UK, France and Germany were among the countries that voted in favour of the Ukraine-backed resolution, which called for a \"comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine\". The US, Russia, Belarus and North Korea were among those that opposed it. The duelling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the US and Ukraine after Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the US' relationship with Europe over the Trump administration's decision to engage with Moscow. The outcome marks a setback for the Trump administration in the UN General Assembly, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. However, later in the day, the UN Security Council approved the US resolution calling for an end to war in Ukraine - but without mentioning Russia's aggression. The resolution received 10 votes in favour, while the remaining five members - including France and the UK - abstained. Dame Barbara Woodward, the UK's ambassador to the United Nations, said after the UN Security Council approved the motion: \"What, how and on what terms this war ends can only be decided by negotiations with Ukraine. \"No peace will be sustainable without Ukraine's consent. \"We regret that our proposals making these points clear were not taken on board, and as such we could not support this resolution. \"But we share the ambition to find a lasting end to this war, supported by robust security arrangements that ensure Ukraine never again has to face Russia's attack.\" It came after the results in the General Assembly had showed some diminished support for Ukraine - as more than 140 nations had voted to condemn Russia's aggression in previous votes. The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favour of its proposal, according to a US official and a European diplomat. US deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous UN resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond\". \"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all UN member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Ms Shea said.

Mr Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\". Mr Zelenskyy responded by saying the US president was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\". Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is at the White House holding talks with Mr Trump to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine. At the start of the meeting, Mr Trump told reporters Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the war in the country. Mr Trump and Mr Macron have been meeting after the pair had earlier joined a call between G7 leaders.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who will meet with Mr Trump at the White House on Thursday, appeared virtually and said G7 nations should be ready to \"take on more risk\". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Kyiv, called Russia's aggression a war on \"our way of life\". European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Europe's \"first priority\" is to strengthen Ukraine's resistance. She said this includes speeding up the delivery of weapons and increasing investment, announcing a further €3.5bn (about £3bn) in aid for Ukraine."

        "Content": "Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leapt onto John F Kennedy's limousine after he was shot, has died aged 93. According to his publisher Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, the former security official died on Friday at his home in Belvedere, California. His wife Lisa McCubbin Hill, a journalist who met Mr Hill while writing 2012's The Kennedy Detail: JFK's Secret Service Agents Break Their Silence, said on Instagram: \"From the moment we met, there was an undeniable spark between us. \"We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for - a relationship filled with passion, respect, admiration, and the pure joy of being together. \"I am eternally grateful for every day and every moment of the past 15 years we shared. To us, forever. Rest in Peace my Sweet Prince.\" On 22 November 1963, Mr Hill - part of first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's security detail on the day of the assassination - leapt from a Secret Service car to the US president's after Mr Kennedy was shot. Footage filmed by eyewitness Abraham Zapruder showed the agent grabbing a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulling himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He then forced Mrs Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. While Mr Hill was commended for his actions and became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail, he blamed himself for Mr Kennedy's death and retired from the Secret Service in 1975 - aged 43. He told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes that year: \"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave.\" Mr Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He then attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the US president and first family.

A friend of both men, however, he said he was \"optimistic\" Kyiv and Washington would agree an \"economic partnership\" that would benefit both sides. Speaking to Sky News on a trip to Kyiv, Mr Johnson also said Sir Keir Starmer should hike UK defence spending up to 3% of national income \"very quickly\" - at least by 2030 \"if not sooner\". He also said the best way for the prime minister to demonstrate UK credibility on defence would be to use a meeting with Mr Trump in Washington this week to set out a plan for an \"Anglo-French\" force to help provide security for Ukraine. Mr Johnson described this as the start of a \"steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\", saying it should be up to 30,000-strong, including troops from across Europe.  The former prime minister, who led the UK response to Russia's full-scale war and is viewed as a hero by many in Ukraine, said it is \"horrendous\" to think the conflict is still raging. \"I really grieve for the suffering of Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine I'm particularly pained,\" he said. \n                  Boris Johnson brands Vladimir Putin a 'f****** idiot' over alleged imperial ambitions\n                 \n                  Carrie Johnson treated in hospital for 'nasty chest infection' after contracting flu and pneumonia\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer puts UK economy first as he defies critics of Saudi Arabia trip\n                 But he was critical of a series of verbal attacks by Mr Trump against Mr Zelenskyy, which included calling him a \"dictator without elections\" and suggesting Ukraine was to blame for the war. \"It's ghastly to hear, some of the language that's been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator,\" Mr Johnson said, speaking bluntly. \"We all know that these are complete untruths.\" Read more from Sky News: Jailed MP will still get £91,000 salary while in prisonThieves stole £2.8m gold toilet in just five minutes, court hears But the former prime minister signalled he believed the US leader was still on Kyiv's side and he would not want Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold power over Ukraine's future. \"I remain actually optimistic about Ukraine and about their chances of success,\" he said.  Mr Johnson pointed to a deal that Washington wants to sign with Kyiv that will give the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth - though the Ukrainians want US security guarantees in return. Referring to a draft text, he said it contained lines such as \"America committed to a free, sovereign, secure Ukraine. \"Money to go to building up Ukraine's future security. America committing to long-term financial support\". He said a commitment to Ukraine's long-term security was also needed but he did not expect that to be included in the initial document. \"I think what needs to happen is that we, us, the Brits, the French… need to step up and show to Donald Trump, that we are willing to do what he keeps asking for and to take more of the burden ourselves,\" he said. Mr Johnson said he hoped Sir Keir would use his trip to Washington to \"set out an Anglo-French deterrent force that can begin to provide the steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\". Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron - who was in Washington on Monday - have been developing a plan with other European and Western allies to build a force of up to 30,000 troops to provide reassurance to Ukraine following a ceasefire. Mr Johnson said this would be an important demonstration of European strength in the eyes of the American leader. \"I think an Anglo-French plan for a deterrent force - I'm not talking about war fighting, I'm talking about forces that go in to help with logistics, to help backfilling, to help with training…. perhaps maximum 30,000 from the whole of Europe. \"It would be symbolic, but it would be exactly what [Vladimir] Putin doesn't want and what he thinks that he can forbid.\" The former British leader said the Russian president wants to block Ukraine from having British troops on its land or from joining NATO. \"But I don't think that Donald Trump can possibly accept that outcome. I know, he won't accept that outcome,\" Mr Johnson said. \"He doesn't want Putin to win any more than anybody else here in Kyiv does.\" Sir Keir is expected to set a timeframe as early as this week for when Britain will lift its defence budget to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% - but Mr Johnson signalled that Mr Trump would be expecting a \"bigger number\". \"I think he needs to go higher…. I think in the United States, they're going to want to hear a bigger number,\" he said."

        "Content": " Grammy-award winning singer Roberta Flack has died at the age of 88, her publicist has announced. The American singer was best known for her hit songs Killing Me Softly With His Song and The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. One of the top recording artists of the 1970s, she died on Monday surrounded by her family, her publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. In 2022, Flack announced she was suffering from motor neurone disease (MND), and could no longer sing. Rising to fame in her early 30s, Flack became an overnight success after Clint Eastwood chose her song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, as the soundtrack for the explicit love scenes of his 1971 movie Play Misty For Me. The track topped the US charts in 1972, and Flack was rewarded with a Grammy. The following year she took the coveted Record of the Year prize at the Grammys for a second time with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist ever to do so. Discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, Flack was a classically trained pianist, receiving a full scholarship to study at Howard University at just 15. McCann later wrote of Flack: \"Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" A shining light in the social and civil rights movement of the time, Flack was friends with both Reverend Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis whom Flack visited in prison when Davis faced charges - for which she was acquitted - for murder and kidnapping. Flack also sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first black player. Living on the same floor of the famous Dakota apartment building as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Flack also became friends with the Beatle, later releasing an album of Beatles covers. Born Roberta Cleopatra Flack, to musician parents in Black Mountain, North Carolina, in 1937, she was raised in Arlington, Virginia. She was married to jazz musician Stephen Novosel between 1966 and 1972. Flack's other hits from the 1970s included Feel Like Makin' Love and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, Where Is the Love and The Closer I Get to You. Sadly, their partnership ended in tragedy, after he fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan in 1979, after suffering a breakdown while they were recording an album of duets together. While Flack never matched her first run of success, she had a follow-up hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet Tonight, I Celebrate My Love and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet Set The Night To Music. In the mid-90s, she received a wave of new attention after the Fugees covered Killing Me Softly. She would go on to perform with the hip-hop band on stage.

Flight 292 landed at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport \"due to a possible security issue,\" the airline said in a statement on Sunday, adding later the threat \"was determined to be non-credible\". The airline did not clarify what the security issue was, but a source familiar with the situation told Sky News' US partner network NBC News it was a bomb threat sent via email. The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported the security issue. \"Safety and security are our top priorities, and we apologise to our customers for the inconvenience,\" the airline said in a statement. The flight requested a diversion to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport at around 2pm local time, Roberto Rao, a spokesperson for the airport. \"We immediately agreed and organised a safe landing,\" Mr Rao told NBC News. \"We don't know what the security concern was, but my opinion is that it was serious enough to divert the plane, but not urgent, because we received the alert when the plane was over the Caspian Sea, a three hours' flight from Rome.\" Once in Italian airspace, the plane was escorted by two Italian air force fighter jets and landed in Rome at around 5.30pm local time. 'What's going on here?' Neeraj Chopra, one of the 199 passengers on board, said the captain announced the plane had to turn around about three hours before it was supposed to land in New Delhi because of a change in \"security status\". Mr Chopra, who was traveling to India to visit family, described the mood on board as calm until the captain later announced that fighter jets would be escorting their plane to Rome. \"I felt a little panic of, okay, what's going on here?\" Mr Chopra told the Associated Press. \"There's got to be like something bigger going on here.\" Read more from Sky News:Pay back the billions of aid, Trump tells UkraineDozens turn out in support of Luigi Mangione Jonathan Bacon, 22, added that once on the ground, all passengers were loaded on to buses and taken to the terminal, where each passenger and their personal items underwent additional security screenings that were time-consuming and felt \"slightly heightened\". More than two hours after landing, Mr Bacon and his friend said they were still waiting for their checked baggage. \"It was definitely the longest flight to Europe I've ever taken,\" he said. American Airlines said the plane was inspected and cleared to depart again for New Delhi \"as soon as possible\" on Monday, after the crew gets some rest."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       Donald Trump has named right-wing commentator Dan Bongino as his pick for deputy FBI director. The former Fox News host, who now runs a successful podcast, will lead the bureau alongside Kash Patel, who was narrowly confirmed as FBI director by the Senate last week. It's an unorthodox appointment that breaks the longstanding tradition of having someone with direct FBI experience occupying the role. But who is Mr Bongino, what has his career looked like so far and what has Donald Trump said about his appointment? From law enforcement to political pundit Bongino, 50, worked for the New York Police Department for several years in the 1990s before joining the Secret Service as an agent, serving on the presidential details for then-presidents Barack Obama and George Bush. He began doing commentary on Fox News more than a decade ago, and had a Saturday night show with the network from 2021 to 2023. \n                  Macron says Ukraine ceasefire 'must not mean surrender' - as Trump claims Russia wants 'to end this war'\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: There is 'good reason' to re-engage with Putin, Macron says - as Trump says Russia going 'all-out' to end war\n                 \n                  Trump's optimism meets Macron's caution in carefully choreographed dance side-stepping divisions\n                 His appointment, which does not need to be confirmed by the Senate, means he is one of nearly two dozen former Fox News personnel to join the Trump Administration. He has ventured into politics several times, having run for a US Senate seat in Maryland in 2012 and for congressional seats in 2014 and 2016 in Maryland and Florida. He ultimately lost the three races. His most recent success has come through his podcast, The Dan Bongino Show, which Spotify says is one of the most popular on the platform. Bongino has helped pedal pro-Trump narratives The incoming deputy FBI director became one of the leading personalities in the Make America Great Again political movement which spread false information about the 2020 election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud. Bongino has also advanced baseless theories about the FBI, including a claim earlier this year that the bureau lied when it announced it still had not identified a suspect in the placement of pipe bombs outside of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee (DNC) a day before the Jan 6 Capitol riot in 2021. The FBI released a new video last month of an individual placing one of the bombs near the DNC as part of renewed efforts to track down a suspect. Mr Bongino reacted in a podcast episode, saying: \"If the video has been sitting in the FBI evidence locker for four years now, it's almost like someone in the FBI knows the identity of this bomber and that Trump is going to find out.\" He called the bureau's inability to provide a name or other identifying information for the suspect \"the biggest scandal of our time\". He was among the Trump loyalists who perpetuated conspiracies regarding the 2022 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified documents, suggesting it was an attempt by then-president Joe Biden's administration to assassinate Mr Trump. \"EVERYONE involved in this DOJ/FBI abomination, from the management down to the agents, must be immediately terminated when the tyrants are thrown out of office,\" Mr Bongino said in a social media post at the time. During an interview last year, Mr Bongino urged Mr Trump to commit to forming a commission to reform the Secret Service, calling it a \"failed\" agency and criticising it for the two assassination attempts aimed at him last year. \"That guy should have been nowhere near you,\" Mr Bongino said about the man who authorities say camped outside Mr Trump's golf course in Florida before he was spotted with a rifle. Trump: Bongino has incredible love and passion for our country In a social media post confirming Mr Bongino's appointment, Mr Trump wrote: \"Dan Bongino, a man of incredible love and passion for our Country, has just been named the next DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, by the man who will be the best ever Director, Kash Patel. \"Working with our great new United States Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and Director Patel, Fairness, Justice, Law and Order will be brought back to America, and quickly. Congratulations Dan!\" Responding to the post on X, where Mr Bongino has some 6.6 million followers, the incoming deputy FBI director thanked the president, along with Ms Bondi and Mr Patel. Bongino announcement sparks concerns Several in the intelligence community have expressed concern over Mr Bongino's lack of experience and support for conspiracy theories, according to Sky News' US partner NBC News. It says two current FBI officials who spoke to the publication voiced their concerns, noting the deputy FBI director typically runs the bureau's operations and oversees the special agents that lead its 55 field offices across the country. Read more:Think business, not politics: Trump's approach to peacemakingMusk says US federal employees must justify their work or resign The FBI Agents Association, a non-profit organisation aimed at supporting current and retired agents, has not commented on Mr Bongino's appointment, but has created a memo seen by NBC News that appeared to suggest he was not qualified for the position. Without naming anyone specifically, the memo read: \"The FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent - as has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons, including operational expertise and experience, as well as the trust of our Special Agent population.\" Bongino appointment comes at time of FBI overhaul Mr Bongino's leadership of the FBI, alongside Mr Patel, comes after its former director Christopher Wray stepped down. Mr Wray, who was seven years into a 10-year term that started under Mr Trump's first administration, announced he was stepping down in December, admitting it was to get ahead of an imminent sacking which he believed would have further politicised the FBI and dragged it \"deeper into the fray\". At that point, Mr Trump had already criticised Mr Wray and the FBI for \"invading\" his home, in reference to the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property as part of a federal investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents - a case that has since been dropped. The FBI had also carried out the sprawling January 6 probe, which led to more than a thousand Trump supporters involved in the capitol riots being jailed. Mr Trump frequently referred to those jailed over January 6 as \"hostages\" and on his first day back in the White House, he issued a sweeping clemency order, granting pardons to more than 1,500 defendants. His government has also forced out half a dozen of the FBI's most senior executives and multiple heads of FBI field offices around the country. Mr Trump said this month that he plans to \"fire some\" FBI personnel who worked on the capitol riot cases amid concerns of mass layoffs at the bureau, after his justice department demanded the names of thousands of agents who participated in the investigations. Mr Patel and and Mr Bongino will succeed the two acting FBI leaders, Brian Driscoll and Robert Kissane, who have led the bureau since the departure of Mr Wray in January."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The net zero sector has grown by 10% over the past year - adding £83bn to the UK economy, a new study suggests. Employment in green businesses and industry has also climbed 10%, supporting the equivalent of 951,000 full-time jobs (2.9% of total UK employment). Politics latest: PM warns of 'crucial moment' in Ukraine war The study - commissioned by thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) - found for every £1 of value generated by the net zero economy, an additional £1.89 was created in the wider economy. It report was published as the government increases efforts to meet a legally binding goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero overall (that's net zero) by 2050. Some Conservative and Reform MPs have criticised net zero, electric cars and renewables, suggesting efforts to curb climate change are to blame for higher energy bills and the deindustrialisation of Britain. But the report, with analysis from CBI Economics and the Data City, suggests the UK's net zero economy is a significant driver of growth, innovation, and productivity.  Where is the growth happening? Renewables, electric vehicles, low carbon heating, recycling and green finance are all part of the net zero sector. Small and medium businesses with fewer than 250 employees are the main drivers of growth, and salaries are 15% higher than the UK average (£43,100, compared with £37,430). Regions beyond London and the South East are where the net zero economy is growing significantly, the report found, boosting some of the country's most deprived areas. The West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and southwest England were the largest contributors, each more than 5% of the national total, while Scotland's net zero economy has grown by 21.3% since 2022 - now worth £9.1bn. Read more:Scientists condemn Reform MPWarning over 'unproven' carbon capture Tyne and Teesside was also highlighted as a hotspot thanks to a £1bn Nissan electric vehicle project, which includes a gigafactory for next-gen batteries. It is creating 6,200 jobs. London and the South East are still leading the way, with £16.2bn and £13.1bn of green investment respectively. Overall, the sector attracted £23bn of public, private and foreign direct investment - and each full-time job generated £105,000 in economic value, well above the UK average, the report found. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has described herself as a \"net zero sceptic\" and her voting record shows she has largely opposed efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She has also voted against banning fracking and called net zero targets \"arbitrary\", saying they would \"bankrupt\" the UK. The Conservatives' manifesto from the 2024 election, when Rishi Sunak was leader, said the party was committed to a \"pragmatic and proportionate\" approach to net zero by 2050.\n It said the party would invest £6bn in energy efficiency over three years to make one million homes warmer. Reform has said it would impose taxes on the renewable energy sector and wants to scrap \"net stupid zero\" targets. The party blames net zero policies for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK and believe green initiatives will make \"zero difference to climate change\". Deputy leader Richard Tice called renewable energy a \"massive con\" and promised Reform would recover subsidies paid to wind and solar companies. 'You can't have growth without green' Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the findings showed \"net zero is essential to growth, a strong economy, and money in working people's pockets\". Making Britain \"a clean energy superpower\" will provide \"energy security, good jobs, and investment in our communities\", he added. Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, said \"there are huge emerging markets for green technologies that the UK must capitalise on\". \"It is clear, you can't have growth without green,\" she said."

        "Content": "Waspi campaigners have threatened legal action against the government unless it reconsiders its decision to reject compensation. In December, the government said it would not be compensating millions of women born in the 1950s - known as Waspi women - who say they were not given sufficient warning of the state pension age for women being lifted from 60 to 65. It was due to be phased in over 10 years from 2010, but in 2011 was sped up to be reached by 2018, then rose to the age of 66 in 2020. A watchdog had recommended that compensation be paid to those affected, but Sir Keir Starmer said at the time that taxpayers could not afford what could have been a £10.5bn package.  On Monday, the Waspi campaign said it had sent a \"letter before action\" to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) warning the government of High Court proceedings if no action is taken. Angela Madden, chair of Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign group, said members will not allow the DWP's \"gaslighting\" of victims to go \"unchallenged\". She said: \"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice. We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong. \"We have been successful before and we are confident we will be again. But what would be better for everyone is if the Secretary of State (Liz Kendall) now saw sense and came to the table to sort out a compensation package. \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\" The group has launched a £75,000 CrowdJustice campaign to fund legal action, and said the government has 14 days to respond before the case is filed. Read more:What is a Waspi woman and what happened to them? In the mid-1990s, the government passed a law to raise the retirement age for women over a 10-year period to make it equal to men. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in the early 2010s under David Cameron and Nick Clegg then sped up the timetable as part of its cost-cutting measures. In 2011, a new Pensions Act was introduced that not only shortened the timetable to increase the women's pension age to 65 by two years but also raised the overall pension age to 66 by October 2020 - saving the government around £30bn. About 3.6 million women in the UK were affected - as many complained they weren't appropriately notified of the changes and some only received letters about it 14 years after the legislation passed. While in opposition, Rachel Reeves, now the chancellor, and Liz Kendall, now pensions secretary, were among several Labour MPs who supported the Waspi women's campaign. The now-Chancellor said in a 2016 debate that women affected by the increase in state pension age had been \"done and injustice\" and urged the government to \"think again\".

For these and other reasons, the government cannot justify paying for a £10.5 billion compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer.\""

The Home Office said \"elites\" linked to the Russian state can now be prevented from entering the UK under the new sanctions. Those who could be banned include anyone who provides \"significant support\" to the Kremlin, those who owe their \"significant status or wealth\" to the Russian state, and those \"who enjoy access to the highest levels\" of the regime.

Sir Keir has backed Mr Zelenskyy on that so all eyes will be on the prime minister when he visits Mr Trump in Washington DC this week."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n One of the world's largest private equity investors has made an approach to buy Chemring, the FTSE 250 defence group – the latest in a continuing slew of takeover bids for London-listed companies. Sky News has learnt that Bain Capital has lodged at least one proposal to acquire Chemring in recent weeks. One source close to the situation suggested that an initial offer may have been tabled at 390p-a-share, a modest premium to the 356p at which the stock was trading on Monday morning. Money latest: I work a 34-hour week and regularly finish at 1.30pm  They added that a second offer had been under preparation by Bain, although it was unclear whether it had been submitted to the company's board, which is chaired by the former Meggitt and Rolls-Royce Holdings executive Tony Wood. Another insider said there was uncertainty about how aggressively Bain was prepared to pursue the company. \n                  Money blog: Major bank set to hike credit card interest rates by up to 50% in weeks\n                 \n                  How net zero push is impacting Britain's economy - including some nice salary bumps\n                 \n                  Waspi women threaten government with legal action over refusal to pay compensation\n                 Chemring is heavily exposed to the fortunes of the defence and aerospace sectors, making high-tech products and providing services to organisations such as NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. Its defence products include infrared devices aimed at repelling enemy attacks. It employs roughly 2,700 people, according to its most recent results announcement published in mid-December. Shares in Chemring fell sharply on the day of that statement after it disclosed the impact on profit margins of problems at a US factory. That was despite the news of a record order book, as defence manufacturers benefit from an explosion in spending by governments in the wake of Donald Trump's election for a second term as US president. NATO members have committed to increase defence spending, although there remains some uncertainty about the extent to which those commitments are deliverable. Michael Ord, Chemring's chief executive, described its outlook as \"increasingly robust\". \"A lot of commentators will say the age of globalisation is over and we are now in an age of great power competition, certainly in our conversations with our customers that feels the case,\" he added. Nevertheless, its stock is broadly flat on a year ago. Chemring has a market capitalisation of about £975m, meaning that a typical takeover premium of roughly 30% would mean a buyout valuing its shares at about £1.3bn. In recent months, listed companies including Learning Technologies Group, which agreed to be taken private by the buyout firm General Atlantic, have been targeted by buyout firms, while the likes of BP and ITV are at the centre of mounting bid speculation. Britvic and Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services, were both taken over late last year. Part of the trend is being driven by the growing prominence of activist investors on UK company share registers, while London-quoted stocks remain cheap by comparison with international peers. Elsewhere, Amsterdam-listed Just Eat Takeaway, which recently cancelled its London listing, recommended a €4.1bn takeover offer from the technology investor Prosus on Monday morning. Bain Capital's private equity portfolio includes companies such as the insurance group esure, which is up for sale, and a stake in Sir Richard Branson's cruises operator, Virgin Voyages. On Monday morning, Bain Capital and Chemring both declined to comment."

The Runcorn and Helsby MP pleaded guilty in January to assault by beating of 45-year-old Paul Fellows in Main Street, Frodsham, Cheshire, in the early hours of 26 October. Politics latest: 'Alarm bells ringing' for Labour As well as a 10-week jail sentence, Amesbury, 55, must pay £200 compensation to Mr Fellows. He will also not be allowed back into the Labour Party, which suspended him shortly after the incident. Parliament has since confirmed that, under the Parliamentary Standards Act, MPs continue to receive their salary until they cease to be MPs. There is currently no mechanism to stop pay for MPs, unless they are suspended from the House of Commons, which has not yet happened in Amesbury's case. Amesbury had been drinking in the town in his constituency where he lives before arriving at a taxi rank, where Mr Fellows approached him to complain about the closure of the Sutton Weaver swing bridge. The court heard how, after punching Mr Fellows in the head and knocking him to the ground, Amesbury punched him a further five times on the ground before members of the public intervened. As he was being held back, he told Mr Fellows: \"You won't threaten your MP again, will you?\" The victim suffered a lump on his head and a graze on his elbow in what the Crown Prosecution Service said was a \"persistent assault\". Labour and Reform call for by-election Amesbury's future as an MP remains under question as his lawyer indicated he will appeal the sentence. Otherwise, MPs who receive a custodial sentence, even if it is suspended, automatically trigger a recall petition which could result in a by-election if 10% of constituents sign it. This will have to wait until the appeal period is over. Amesbury has been sitting as an independent MP in the Commons ever since he was suspended by Labour in October. They have said he will not be admitted back in and called for a by-election, saying his constituents \"deserved better\" after his \"completely unacceptable actions\". Reform UK also called for Amesbury \"to do the honourable thing and resign immediately\". 'Alarm bells will be ringing' for PM Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig said while Labour won the seat at last year's election with a \"fairly healthy majority\" of more than 14,000, there will be \"real nervousness\" within the party about holding it. Reform came second in Runcorn and Helsby at the general election and - given their lead in the national polls - Craig said \"alarm bells will be ringing\" for Sir Keir Starmer. Tap here to read Jon Craig's full analysis. 'A necessary punishment' Sentencing Amesbury, deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram said an immediate custodial sentence was \"necessary as a punishment and a deterrent\". The judge added Amesbury, who has been an MP since 2017, would serve 40% of his sentence in custody and will remain on licence for 12 months after his release. Amesbury's lawyer requested the judge return to the court moments after he was taken to the cells by two security guards, as he wanted to make a bail application while they appeal his sentence. The judge returned to court, sat down, paused briefly and said: \"Application refused.\" Read more:Trump makes Starmer's life harderNet zero push provides bump in salaries Amesbury will be taken to HMP Altcourse in Liverpool. Unlike many defendants, he did not appear to have a bag of belongings with him. After pleading guilty, he described the incident as \"highly regrettable\" and apologised to Mr Fellows and his family outside the court. Alison Storey, senior specialist prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime division, said Amesbury's victim did not react aggressively and was alone at the time of the assault."

        "Content": "The former leader of Reform UK in Wales has appeared in court after he was accused of making favourable statements about Russia in the European Parliament in exchange for bribes. Nathan Gill, 51, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery under the Criminal Law Act 1977, and with eight counts of bribery under the Bribery Act, 2010, the Metropolitan Police said. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Gill allegedly made statements in the European Parliament and in opinion pieces to news outlets, such as 112 Ukraine, which were \"supportive of a particular narrative\" and would \"benefit Russia regarding events in Ukraine\". Gill - who was an MEP for almost six years and a member of the Welsh parliament, the Senedd, between 2016 and 2017 - is alleged to have been asked by former Ukrainian politician Oleg Voloshyn to make specific statements about Russia in return for money on at least eight occasions. The conspiracy to commit bribery charge relates to allegations that Gill conspired with Voloshyn and \"others\" between 1 January 2018 and 1 February 2020. It claims he accepted \"quantities of money in cash\" which was \"improper performance by him of his function or activity as the holder\" of a position as an MEP. The other bribery offences are alleged to have taken place between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Gill, from Llangefni on Anglesey, was previously a member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), leading the Welsh wing of the party between 2014 and 2016. He left UKIP in 2019, and the same year he joined Nigel Farage's Brexit Party - later Reform UK - and was elected as a Brexit Party MEP. Gill was confirmed as leader of Reform UK Wales in 2021 ahead of Senedd elections, but reports suggest he left the party months later when he failed to win a seat. Read more on Sky News:Labour and Reform call for by-election after MP jailed for assaultThe right-wing podcaster picked for leading FBI role A spokesperson for Reform UK Wales confirmed Gill was no longer a member, and said the party would not be commenting. Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport on 13 September 2021 under the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, the court also heard. The Crown Prosecution Service said charges have been authorised against Voloshyn but he is not in the jurisdiction. Gill was granted bail on the condition that he surrender his passport, does not obtain international travel documents and does not contact Voloshyn. He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 14 March."

A friend of both men, however, he said he was \"optimistic\" Kyiv and Washington would agree an \"economic partnership\" that would benefit both sides. Speaking to Sky News on a trip to Kyiv, Mr Johnson also said Sir Keir Starmer should hike UK defence spending up to 3% of national income \"very quickly\" - at least by 2030 \"if not sooner\". He also said the best way for the prime minister to demonstrate UK credibility on defence would be to use a meeting with Mr Trump in Washington this week to set out a plan for an \"Anglo-French\" force to help provide security for Ukraine. Mr Johnson described this as the start of a \"steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\", saying it should be up to 30,000-strong, including troops from across Europe.  The former prime minister, who led the UK response to Russia's full-scale war and is viewed as a hero by many in Ukraine, said it is \"horrendous\" to think the conflict is still raging. \"I really grieve for the suffering of Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine I'm particularly pained,\" he said. \n                  Boris Johnson brands Vladimir Putin a 'f****** idiot' over alleged imperial ambitions\n                 \n                  Carrie Johnson treated in hospital for 'nasty chest infection' after contracting flu and pneumonia\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer puts UK economy first as he defies critics of Saudi Arabia trip\n                 But he was critical of a series of verbal attacks by Mr Trump against Mr Zelenskyy, which included calling him a \"dictator without elections\" and suggesting Ukraine was to blame for the war. \"It's ghastly to hear, some of the language that's been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator,\" Mr Johnson said, speaking bluntly. \"We all know that these are complete untruths.\" Read more from Sky News: Jailed MP will still get £91,000 salary while in prisonThieves stole £2.8m gold toilet in just five minutes, court hears But the former prime minister signalled he believed the US leader was still on Kyiv's side and he would not want Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold power over Ukraine's future. \"I remain actually optimistic about Ukraine and about their chances of success,\" he said.  Mr Johnson pointed to a deal that Washington wants to sign with Kyiv that will give the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth - though the Ukrainians want US security guarantees in return. Referring to a draft text, he said it contained lines such as \"America committed to a free, sovereign, secure Ukraine. \"Money to go to building up Ukraine's future security. America committing to long-term financial support\". He said a commitment to Ukraine's long-term security was also needed but he did not expect that to be included in the initial document. \"I think what needs to happen is that we, us, the Brits, the French… need to step up and show to Donald Trump, that we are willing to do what he keeps asking for and to take more of the burden ourselves,\" he said. Mr Johnson said he hoped Sir Keir would use his trip to Washington to \"set out an Anglo-French deterrent force that can begin to provide the steel-quilled porcupine of future Ukrainian security\". Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron - who was in Washington on Monday - have been developing a plan with other European and Western allies to build a force of up to 30,000 troops to provide reassurance to Ukraine following a ceasefire. Mr Johnson said this would be an important demonstration of European strength in the eyes of the American leader. \"I think an Anglo-French plan for a deterrent force - I'm not talking about war fighting, I'm talking about forces that go in to help with logistics, to help backfilling, to help with training…. perhaps maximum 30,000 from the whole of Europe. \"It would be symbolic, but it would be exactly what [Vladimir] Putin doesn't want and what he thinks that he can forbid.\" The former British leader said the Russian president wants to block Ukraine from having British troops on its land or from joining NATO. \"But I don't think that Donald Trump can possibly accept that outcome. I know, he won't accept that outcome,\" Mr Johnson said. \"He doesn't want Putin to win any more than anybody else here in Kyiv does.\" Sir Keir is expected to set a timeframe as early as this week for when Britain will lift its defence budget to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% - but Mr Johnson signalled that Mr Trump would be expecting a \"bigger number\". \"I think he needs to go higher…. I think in the United States, they're going to want to hear a bigger number,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The net zero sector has grown by 10% over the past year - adding £83bn to the UK economy, a new study suggests. Employment in green businesses and industry has also climbed 10%, supporting the equivalent of 951,000 full-time jobs (2.9% of total UK employment). Politics latest: PM warns of 'crucial moment' in Ukraine war The study - commissioned by thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) - found for every £1 of value generated by the net zero economy, an additional £1.89 was created in the wider economy. It report was published as the government increases efforts to meet a legally binding goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero overall (that's net zero) by 2050. Some Conservative and Reform MPs have criticised net zero, electric cars and renewables, suggesting efforts to curb climate change are to blame for higher energy bills and the deindustrialisation of Britain. But the report, with analysis from CBI Economics and the Data City, suggests the UK's net zero economy is a significant driver of growth, innovation, and productivity.  Where is the growth happening? Renewables, electric vehicles, low carbon heating, recycling and green finance are all part of the net zero sector. Small and medium businesses with fewer than 250 employees are the main drivers of growth, and salaries are 15% higher than the UK average (£43,100, compared with £37,430). Regions beyond London and the South East are where the net zero economy is growing significantly, the report found, boosting some of the country's most deprived areas. The West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and southwest England were the largest contributors, each more than 5% of the national total, while Scotland's net zero economy has grown by 21.3% since 2022 - now worth £9.1bn. Read more:Scientists condemn Reform MPWarning over 'unproven' carbon capture Tyne and Teesside was also highlighted as a hotspot thanks to a £1bn Nissan electric vehicle project, which includes a gigafactory for next-gen batteries. It is creating 6,200 jobs. London and the South East are still leading the way, with £16.2bn and £13.1bn of green investment respectively. Overall, the sector attracted £23bn of public, private and foreign direct investment - and each full-time job generated £105,000 in economic value, well above the UK average, the report found. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has described herself as a \"net zero sceptic\" and her voting record shows she has largely opposed efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She has also voted against banning fracking and called net zero targets \"arbitrary\", saying they would \"bankrupt\" the UK. The Conservatives' manifesto from the 2024 election, when Rishi Sunak was leader, said the party was committed to a \"pragmatic and proportionate\" approach to net zero by 2050.\n It said the party would invest £6bn in energy efficiency over three years to make one million homes warmer. Reform has said it would impose taxes on the renewable energy sector and wants to scrap \"net stupid zero\" targets. The party blames net zero policies for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK and believe green initiatives will make \"zero difference to climate change\". Deputy leader Richard Tice called renewable energy a \"massive con\" and promised Reform would recover subsidies paid to wind and solar companies. 'You can't have growth without green' Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the findings showed \"net zero is essential to growth, a strong economy, and money in working people's pockets\". Making Britain \"a clean energy superpower\" will provide \"energy security, good jobs, and investment in our communities\", he added. Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, said \"there are huge emerging markets for green technologies that the UK must capitalise on\". \"It is clear, you can't have growth without green,\" she said."

His team have been war gaming all the scenarios, and the prime minister will go with a clear message on what the UK is asking of the US and what it can offer.  How can PM woo Trump over Ukraine? Sir Keir has already offered to put UK troops on the ground as part of any peacekeeping force and promised to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Trump is demanding markedly more from NATO allies, suggesting they should hit 5%, as expectations rise over the UK's commitments on defence (Number 10 are refusing to comment, for now). The prime minister will also, in a nod to Trump's tilt to the Indo-Pacific, reiterate the UK's commitment to AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership between the US, UK, and Australia. What Sir Keir and Europe need from Trump is some sort of US security backstop for Ukraine in any deal with Russia. Up to now, Trump has parroted Vladimir Putin's playbook, accusing Ukraine of starting the war (untrue) and Volodymyr Zelenskyy being a dictator (also untrue), while also ruling out Kyiv joining NATO and promising to normalise relations with Russia. From the phone call with Putin, to cutting Europe and Ukraine out negotiations in Saudi Arabia last week, Trump has played the role of a strongman carving up the world according to spheres of influence. Part of Sir Keir's job on Thursday will be to persuade Trump that in this vein of \"great power transactional diplomacy\", Putin is not his equal and playing into his hands will not secure a stable peace. Read more:Trump makes Starmer's life harderTrump's falsehoods should be called out  From MAGA to MEGA On trade, new ambassador Lord Mandelson is talking up a \"MEGA\" deal (Make our Economies Great Again) by working up a proposal for increasing the £300bn worth of trade between the UK and US. The hope is for the prime minister to come away from the White House with a commitment to begin a process of deepening trade and economic ties between London and Washington, which leads to a series of individual trade arrangements rather than a big bang deal that could take years to negotiate. But if those are the aims, there is plenty of jeopardy for a UK government and the Number 10 team trying to plan a trip against the backdrop of a president they simply can't predict. Could a rift open between old allies? When I asked one insider whether they thought Trump's attacks on Zelenskyy were a ploy to bring Putin to the table, or the president's real views, they said: \"The honest answer is we don't know and that is part of where we are right now. \"We need to get over there and get a better sense of the president's red lines.\" Never miss an episode of Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts. For now, the Number 10 team are focused less on what Trump says and more on what he does, with the understanding that if his starting position really is his endgame, there will be a rift between two old allies. Sir Keir's problems were already piling up before Trump's entry into the White House, and he goes to Washington knowing further instability in Europe - and potential trade barriers with the UK's second-biggest trading partner - only makes his already difficult task of delivering a \"decade of national renewal\" harder still. The stakes couldn't be higher, or more unpredictable."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The jailing of Mike Amesbury for 10 weeks for assault means Sir Keir Starmer potentially faces his first by-election test since becoming prime minister. Officially, the 55-year-old former Labour MP for Runcorn and Helsby now faces a recall petition, but realistically he's under enormous pressure to resign without delay. Politics latest: 'Alarm bells ringing' for Labour Amesbury was immediately disowned by the Labour Party, which condemned his actions in the assault as \"completely unacceptable\" and said it was time for a new MP. \"Local residents in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency deserved better, and we look forward to them getting the representation they deserved in the future with a new MP,\" said a party spokesperson. However, if Amesbury appeals against his sentence, as it's being suggested he may, that would delay a by-election as a writ can't be moved unless appeals are exhausted, or he stands down voluntarily. Amesbury held the Cheshire seat with a seemingly healthy 14,696 majority at the July 2024 general election. But in a potential nightmare for Sir Keir, it was Reform UK - not the Conservatives - in second place. A challenge for Labour - but Tories in disarray The current state of opinion polls, with Nigel Farage's party edging ahead of Labour, suggests Reform will be in contention in a by-election and could pull off a sensational victory. And so predictably it was Reform's chairman Zia Yusuf who led calls from opponents for Amesbury to resign, followed by a handful of Tory backbenchers - but not by Kemi Badenoch yet. \"The great people of Runcorn deserve far better than waiting six weeks for a recall petition to take place,\" said Mr Yusuf. \"We call on Mike Amesbury to do the honourable thing and resign immediately.\" The risk of humiliation by Mr Farage may deter Labour big hitter Jonathan Ashworth - one of five Labour MPs defeated in July last year - from gambling on a quick return to Westminster in this seat. The Conservatives appear to be in disarray over a potential by-election. Sky News can reveal that party HQ last week invited applications to be Tory candidate, with a deadline fast approaching. \"We are writing to invite applications for Runcorn and Helsby,\" said a letter from the party's candidates team. \"We are particularly keen to see applications from people with links to the constituency. \"If you are eligible to stand and interested in applying, please apply through the Microsoft Form here and apply by no later than Tuesday 25th February at 12pm.\" Read more:Trump makes Starmer's life harderNet zero push provides bump in salaries When could a by-election happen? A recall petition happens if an MP is jailed or receives a suspended sentence of a year or less. It lasts six weeks and if 10% of electors sign it, there's a by-election - though the recalled MP can stand. The last MP to be jailed was Tory Imran Ahmad Khan, former MP for Wakefield, who was sentenced to 18 months after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-yar-old boy. Labour won that by-election. Although Sir Keir and the Labour high command have acknowledged since Amesbury pleaded guilty that a by-election in Runcorn and Helsby was almost inevitable, the party faces a dilemma over the timing of a poll. Labour's statement looking forward to a new MP suggests the party favours a speedy by-election, without the delay of a recall petition, rather than waiting until the local elections on 1 May or even later. But there are dangers in a quick poll, as Sir Keir will recall. He was advised to rush the Hartlepool by-election in 2021, with disastrous results, and he has admitted he considered quitting after that humiliating defeat. The numbers in Runcorn and Helsby last July were Labour on 22,358 votes (52.94%), Reform 7,662, (18.14%), Conservatives 6,756, (16%), Greens 2,715, (6.43%) and Liberal Democrats 2,149, (5.09%). Runcorn is on the southern bank of the River Mersey and has expanded as a new town since 1964, and dominates the constituency with a population of 61,000. There are two smaller towns, Frodsham and Helsby. Amesbury became MP for the processor seat of Weaver Vale in 2017. He was a shadow minister for work and pensions under Jeremy Corbyn, and for housing, communities and local government under Sir Keir until 2022."

        "Content": "Waspi campaigners have threatened legal action against the government unless it reconsiders its decision to reject compensation. In December, the government said it would not be compensating millions of women born in the 1950s - known as Waspi women - who say they were not given sufficient warning of the state pension age for women being lifted from 60 to 65. It was due to be phased in over 10 years from 2010, but in 2011 was sped up to be reached by 2018, then rose to the age of 66 in 2020. A watchdog had recommended that compensation be paid to those affected, but Sir Keir Starmer said at the time that taxpayers could not afford what could have been a £10.5bn package.  On Monday, the Waspi campaign said it had sent a \"letter before action\" to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) warning the government of High Court proceedings if no action is taken. Angela Madden, chair of Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign group, said members will not allow the DWP's \"gaslighting\" of victims to go \"unchallenged\". She said: \"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice. We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong. \"We have been successful before and we are confident we will be again. But what would be better for everyone is if the Secretary of State (Liz Kendall) now saw sense and came to the table to sort out a compensation package. \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\" The group has launched a £75,000 CrowdJustice campaign to fund legal action, and said the government has 14 days to respond before the case is filed. Read more:What is a Waspi woman and what happened to them? In the mid-1990s, the government passed a law to raise the retirement age for women over a 10-year period to make it equal to men. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in the early 2010s under David Cameron and Nick Clegg then sped up the timetable as part of its cost-cutting measures. In 2011, a new Pensions Act was introduced that not only shortened the timetable to increase the women's pension age to 65 by two years but also raised the overall pension age to 66 by October 2020 - saving the government around £30bn. About 3.6 million women in the UK were affected - as many complained they weren't appropriately notified of the changes and some only received letters about it 14 years after the legislation passed. While in opposition, Rachel Reeves, now the chancellor, and Liz Kendall, now pensions secretary, were among several Labour MPs who supported the Waspi women's campaign. The now-Chancellor said in a 2016 debate that women affected by the increase in state pension age had been \"done and injustice\" and urged the government to \"think again\".

For these and other reasons, the government cannot justify paying for a £10.5 billion compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer.\""

        "Content": " Grammy-award winning singer Roberta Flack has died at the age of 88, her publicist has announced. The American singer was best known for her hit songs Killing Me Softly With His Song and The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. One of the top recording artists of the 1970s, she died on Monday surrounded by her family, her publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. In 2022, Flack announced she was suffering from motor neurone disease (MND), and could no longer sing. Rising to fame in her early 30s, Flack became an overnight success after Clint Eastwood chose her song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, as the soundtrack for the explicit love scenes of his 1971 movie Play Misty For Me. The track topped the US charts in 1972, and Flack was rewarded with a Grammy. The following year she took the coveted Record of the Year prize at the Grammys for a second time with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist ever to do so. Discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, Flack was a classically trained pianist, receiving a full scholarship to study at Howard University at just 15. McCann later wrote of Flack: \"Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" A shining light in the social and civil rights movement of the time, Flack was friends with both Reverend Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis whom Flack visited in prison when Davis faced charges - for which she was acquitted - for murder and kidnapping. Flack also sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first black player. Living on the same floor of the famous Dakota apartment building as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Flack also became friends with the Beatle, later releasing an album of Beatles covers. Born Roberta Cleopatra Flack, to musician parents in Black Mountain, North Carolina, in 1937, she was raised in Arlington, Virginia. She was married to jazz musician Stephen Novosel between 1966 and 1972. Flack's other hits from the 1970s included Feel Like Makin' Love and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, Where Is the Love and The Closer I Get to You. Sadly, their partnership ended in tragedy, after he fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan in 1979, after suffering a breakdown while they were recording an album of duets together. While Flack never matched her first run of success, she had a follow-up hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet Tonight, I Celebrate My Love and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet Set The Night To Music. In the mid-90s, she received a wave of new attention after the Fugees covered Killing Me Softly. She would go on to perform with the hip-hop band on stage. A five-time Grammy winner, Flack received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020. Contemporary stars to praise her include Beyoncé, John Legend and Ariana Grande. Working as a high-school teacher in her 20s, while gigging in clubs during the evenings, Flack proved a canny educator, telling the Tampa Bay Times in 2012: \"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, DC It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. \"I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. [I'd sing]: 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\""

        "Content": "The winners of this year's Screen Actors Guild Awards (SAG) have been revealed - a major predictor of the Oscars, with just a week to go.  Demi Moore continued her run of success to be named best actress for her performance in body horror The Substance, while Timothee Chalamet picked up the award for best actor for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. While not a complete shock, before this Adrien Brody had probably just nudged it as favourite for an Oscar win for his performance in post-war epic The Brutalist.  Now, the race is closer than it has been in years - and both Chalamet, 29, and Moore, 62, could be on course for their first Academy Awards.  Following a BAFTA win earlier this month, papal thriller Conclave was honoured with the top film prize, for best ensemble. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and Stanley Tucci, the film follows the drama of the selection process for a new pope. During the ceremony, Rossellini said the film's cast wanted to send their best wishes to Pope Francis, who is being treated in hospital for pneumonia and bronchitis, and wish him \"a quick recovery\". Elsewhere, the supporting categories were true to 2025 awards season form - Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldana continued their runs of success with wins for performances in A Real Pain and Emilia Perez respectively. 'I want to be one of the greats' The awards are voted for by members of the SAG-AFTRA union and are held as a celebration of actors honoured by their peers. For the best male actor announcement, Chalamet looked visibly surprised as his name was called. After being accompanied by girlfriend Kylie Jenner to the BAFTAs last week, this time round he was celebrating with his mum, Nicole Flender. \"The truth is, this was five-and-a-half years of my life. I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan, a true American hero,\" he said on stage. \"It was the honour of a lifetime playing him.\" Making no secret of his ambitions, he added: \"The truth is I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats.\" Moore said joining SAG-AFTRA as a teenager in 1978 gave her meaning as \"a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life\". Actress and activist Jane Fonda, 87, provided the ceremony's most passionate political moment as she was honoured with a lifetime achievement prize. \"We are in our documentary moment,\" she said. \"This is it. And it's not a rehearsal.\" The word \"woke\", she added, \"just means you give a damn\" about others. The TV winners The SAG Awards also include TV categories, with Japanese historical drama Shogun picking up the gong for best ensemble and its stars, Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai, named best actor and actress. Only Murders In The Building took home the prize for best comedy ensemble, with star Martin Short named best actor in a comedy series. Jean Smart, who had previously called for cancelling the awards shows due to the wildfires that hit LA in January, was named best actress in a comedy, for her role in Hacks. She did not attend, but gave a recorded introduction. In the limited series category, British star Jessica Gunning was named best actress for Baby Reindeer, while Irish star Colin Farrell was named best actor for The Penguin."

        "Content": "Sledgehammer-wielding thieves who smashed their way into Blenheim Palace managed to steal a £2.8m gold toilet in just five minutes, a court has heard. The toilet, an artwork by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was fully functioning while on exhibit at Blenheim Palace - the Oxfordshire country house where Sir Winston Churchill was born - when it was stolen in September 2019. The 18-carat gold toilet, titled America, weighed approximately 98kg and had been insured for the price of $6m (£4.75 m), the prosecution told Oxford Crown Court. The gold in itself was believed to be worth about £2.8m at the time of the theft. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, pleaded not guilty in January to stealing artwork in an overnight raid in the early hours of 14 September 2019. Frederick Sines, 36, also known as Frederick Doe, of Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, and Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, each deny one count of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. The court heard that the sledgehammers were left at the scene. Prosecutor Julian Christopher KC said within days of the raid, two men were using \"car\" as a codeword for the stolen gold and contact was made with a Hatton Garden jeweller. \"The burglary was carefully planned and swiftly carried out,\" Mr Christopher said. \"The men, five of them it appears, drove through locked wooden gates into the grounds of Blenheim Palace shortly before 5am in two stolen vehicles, an Isuzu truck and a VW Golf. \"They drove across a field, up to the front steps and smashed and broke in through a window. \"They knew precisely where to go, broke down the wooden door to the cubicle where the toilet was fully plumbed in, removed it, leaving water pouring out of the pipes, and drove away. \"All in all they spent just five minutes in the building. \"Clearly such an audacious raid would not have been possible without lots of preparation.\" Read more from Sky News:King enjoys 'a slurp' of beer in brewery tasting sessionRoberta Flack dies aged 88 Mr Christopher added: \"The work of art was never recovered.

Jurors were told a fourth defendant, Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, has previously pleaded guilty to burglary. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property, at Oxford Crown Court in April 2024. The trial continues."
