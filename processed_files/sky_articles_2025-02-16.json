        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to put \"our own troops on the ground if necessary\" in Ukraine if there is a deal to end the war with Russia. Ahead of an \"emergency meeting\" of European leaders on Monday, the prime minister said he was \"ready and willing\" to put British troops into a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, the prime minister also said the UK was \"ready to play a leading role\" in Ukraine's defence and security, by committing £3bn a year until 2030. It comes as Emmanuel Macron rallies the likes of Sir Keir and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at a hastily-arranged Paris summit to discuss Ukraine's next steps. The French president will look to recapture Ukraine's future at the informal meeting, which has been swiftly put together following announcements from the United States. It will take place as the US sends senior officials to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Russia - which representatives from Europe have not been invited to. It is unclear if Ukraine will take part.  A delegation from Ukraine is in Saudi Arabia to pave the way for a possible visit from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one Ukrainian official said on Sunday. However, less than 24 hours prior, a top Zelenskyy adviser had denied Ukraine would take part in the discussions. \"There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,\" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a TV interview. Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Donald Trump said of Mr Putin: \"I think he wants to stop fighting. \"They [Russia] have a big powerful machine, you understand that. They defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. They've been fighting a long time.\" Mr Macron's meeting is expected to be attended by British Prime Minister Sir Keir, Germany's Mr Scholz, Danish PM Mette Frederiksen and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, alongside other European leaders. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and NATO chief Mark Rutte are also expected at the Paris summit. The goal of the discussions is to \"bring together all partners interested in peace and security in Europe\", a French statement said.

The discussions are expected to begin in Riyadh on Tuesday, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant. Mr Trump's push for a quick way out of Russia's war on Ukraine has stirred concern and uncertainty from European leaders. After a recent phone call with Mr Putin, Mr Trump has - on multiple occasions - said he and the Russian president will meet soon to discuss a peace deal over Ukraine. He has assured Mr Zelenskyy he will have a seat at the table, but it is unclear if European officials will be invited. The Ukrainian president has previously said he will not accept any negotiations that do not include his country."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Not invited to American talks with Russia on the future of Ukraine, European leaders are holding a hastily convened meeting of their own on Monday. After years of exasperation from the US over Europe's more relaxed attitude to defence spending - nothing quite makes the point about military irrelevance than being left out of the room where the future of Ukraine is likely to be decided. President Macron's scrambled plan to get European leaders to drop everything and come to Paris for talks demonstrates the high level of alarm at the new world order. As well as the UK, Paris has confirmed those on the invite list for the \"informal\" meeting include Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark - as well as the president of the European Council, the president of the European Commission and the secretary general of NATO.  Politics Live: UK 'disagrees' with JD Vance on free speech comments  \n                  'Whole cabinet' recognises need to spend more on defence, minister says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer to urge EU nations to 'shoulder more of the burden' on defence spending\n                 \n                  UK to 'war-game' how frontline British troops could be equipped with weapons amid supply chain disruption\n                 Sir Keir Starmer will be attending, describing it as \"a once in a generation moment for our national security… we cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face\". Donald Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, General Kellogg, has laid down the gauntlet to Europe's leaders to come up with their own contributions to the Ukrainian peace process, calling on them to \"participate in the debate, not by complaining about being at the table or not, but by presenting concrete proposals, ideas, by increasing spending.\" And that is exactly what will be on the table at Monday's meeting. While it seems unlikely the leaders will be either willing or practically able to develop a new European army of the kind requested by President Zelenskyy, their discussions will surely focus on the options for a future peacekeeping force in Ukraine, how best to bolster Ukraine's existing fighting capabilities, and underlying everything - the level of future defence spending. The figures tell a clear story. As the top three military powers in NATO, the US spends $967.71bn on defence, Germany $97.69bn and the UK $82.11bn  President Trump has called for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defence spending - and for Europe to take over responsibility for its own defence. The UK has been effusively nodding along with that argument in principle, with the PM arguing \"it's clear Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\" while continuing to work with the US. The government has pledged to increase defence spending from around 2.3% to 2.5%, but we're still waiting to find out when and how that target will be met, let alone surpassed. Just meeting the original 2.5% target is set to cost £5bn - a figure which is difficult for the chancellor to justify while keeping within her self-imposed fiscal rules and under pressure to make cuts to government spending elsewhere. Sunday's papers are full of speculation about cabinet division over the issue. Could the chancellor break her rule on not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, and borrow to pay for rearmament? The foreign secretary made the point at Munich on Saturday that the UK spent 7% on defence at the height of the Cold War - and that the costs of Ukraine falling to Russia would ultimately be far higher. Whatever the European leaders agree to on Monday, Sir Keir Starmer is likely to act as a kind of envoy to the Americans when he flies out to meet Donald Trump at the White House next week. We understand the Europeans will then reconvene following his return, alongside President Zelenskyy. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told Sky's Trevor Phillips this morning \"there is a role the United Kingdom can play, which is in that bridge between European allies and our US allies\". That bridge is in danger of becoming something of a tightrope given the growing transatlantic distance between the US and Europe. Divisions are growing not just on how to handle the conflict in Ukraine and the future of NATO, but on broader issues of society and democracy too, following the US vice president's broadside against European countries including the UK and Germany over supposed issues of free speech and religious freedom. The special relationship will be doing a lot of heavy lifting."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a \"milestone\" in his plan to fix the NHS as figures show an extra two million appointments were delivered during Labour's first five months in office. New figures published by NHS England reveal that between July and November 2024, the health service delivered almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared with the same period the previous year. This includes for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endoscopy, and diagnostic tests, which were possible in part because of staff working extra weekend and evening shifts, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also pointed to the end of NHS strikes, extra flu vaccinations and £1.8bn of funding into elective appointments since Labour took office. The extra appointments come on top of figures last week showing total NHS waiting lists fell in December for the fourth month in a row - though challenges remain in other areas. The prime minister said: \"Two million extra NHS appointments and a waiting list on its way down - we're delivering on our promise to fix the NHS and make sure people get the care they need, when they need it. \"We said we'd turn this around and that's exactly what we're doing - this milestone is a shot in the arm for our plan to get the NHS back on its feet and cut waiting times.\" \n                  Ozempic helps to reduce alcohol consumption and smoking, new study finds\n                 \n                  'People will die': Chaos and mounting fear in Uganda as USAID cuts lead to 'total panic' and HIV clinic closures\n                 \n                  NHS warns hospitals are 'close to full' as norovirus cases surge\n                 During the general election campaign, polls suggested the NHS was the second most important issue to voters after the economy. The extra appointments mean Labour's manifesto commitment for two million a year was met seven months early.  Labour have also pledged to end hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The figures last week showed the number of people waiting 18 weeks or more for elective care has started to fall. The number who have been on the list for more than a year is also down. Overall, an estimated 7.46 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of December in England, down from 7.48 million treatments at the end of November. However, pressure remains in other areas. Sky News found the number of patients waiting for 12 hours in A&E after a decision has been made to admit them - known as a \"trolley-wait\" - rose above 60,000 for the first time in January. Waits of this length, usually indicative of a lack of available beds in the hospital, were almost non-existent before the pandemic. The January total - equivalent to more than 15% of all patients admitted via A&E - is more than the total recorded in over 11 years from August 2010 to October 2021. As Sky News' health correspondent Ashish Joshi reports that health anxiety - not emergencies - is clogging up A&E. There are also problems facing social care, with a lack of availability often preventing medically fit people from being discharged. Sir Keir acknowledged there was more to do, saying \"we're not complacent and we know the job isn't done\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the next steps on the Plan for Change include \"opening new surgical hubs, community diagnostics centres at evenings and weekends, and using private sector capacity to cut waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks\". He added: \"We have wasted no time in getting to work to cut NHS waiting times and end the agony of millions of patients suffering uncertainty and pain.\"Because we ended the strikes, invested in the NHS, and rolled out reformed ways of working, we are finally putting the NHS on the road to recovery.\" The government has also announced a £40m funding pot for trusts that make the most improvements, which will be available for hospitals from next year to spend on capital projects such repairs to their estates or new tech such as AI scanners. Sir Keir has previously promised more funding for trusts who make the fastest improvements in cutting waiting times but it was not clear how much. More detail on how the funds will be allocated will be set out \"in due course\", the government said."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Conclave has taken the top prize at this year's BAFTA film awards, winning best film as well as outstanding British film. Based on Robert Harris's 2016 novel of the same name, and centred around the selection of a new pope, the movie also won best adapted screenplay and best editing. Thanking his ensemble cast as he accepted the award, director Edward Berger said: \"What you did to me on set when I watched you was pure magic, it was beyond my grasp or understanding.\" It's not the first BAFTA success for the German filmmaker, who swept the board two years ago with his remake of All Quiet On The Western Front, taking seven prizes. Conclave is his first English-language film. BAFTA Awards 2025: The full list of winners Despite being the most nominated movie of the night, Conclave did not take any acting prizes, with its star Ralph Fiennes losing out to The Brutalist lead Adrien Brody in the hotly contested best actor category. Brody's portrayal of Hungarian architect Lazlo Toth saw the 51-year-old actor bag his first BAFTA statuette. \n                  BAFTA Awards 2025: The full list of winners\n                 \n                  Demi Moore 'took many risks' - director Coralie Fargeat on making The Substance\n                 \n                  BAFTA red carpet 2025: All the best looks from the nominees and guests\n                 New York-born Brody said the gong was \"incredibly meaningful\", adding: \"England has felt quite a bit like home lately.\" The three-and-a-half-hour-long epic, which is largely set in America following World War II, also took best director, best original score and best cinematography. Accepting his director award, Brady Corbet, told the audience that despite being \"humbled\" and \"grateful\" for his win, there really was \"no such thing\" as best director. Conclave and The Brutalist were joint winners across the night, taking four gongs each. Anora, about a Brooklyn sex worker who marries into money, saw its break-out lead star, Mikey Madison take the top prize, after many had forecast a win for Demi Moore. Accepting her award, the 25-year-old actress took her moment on the stage to honour the sex worker community, who she said had helped her immeasurably in her preparation for the role, telling them: \"I see you. You deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally.\" Anora also took the casting prize.  Emilia Perez, which has come under fire in recent weeks following resurfaced tweets from its lead star Karla Sofia Gascon, took best film not in the English language. Gascon was not at the event. An emotional Zoe Saldaña, took best supporting actress for her outstanding performance in the musical - in which she acts, sings and dances - telling the audience her win was \"so validating\" and \"a true honour\". As she accepted her prize the 46-year-old star said: \"I was told not to cry by my children, so I'm going to try. This is so validating because the very few times I tried to go for roles with a British accent I was told this isn't going to happen.\" She ended her emotional speech by saying: \"Films are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds and I hope Emilia Perez did something like this, because voices need to be heard, just not my English accent.\" Saldana, who won in the same category at the Golden Globes last month will be hoping to follow up her success with an Oscar in March. An early front-runner in awards season, mostly Spanish language movie Emilia Perez had already been under fire from parts of the trans community for what some considered to be a retrograde step in representation, as well as those who objected to stereotypical depictions of Mexicans, as well as its handling of the sensitive topic of narcotics crime, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Going into the night with 11 nominations, it took two overall. Kieran Culkin, 42, won best supporting actor for his role in comedy A Real Pain, with his co-star and the film's writer Jesse Eisenberg accepting the gong on his behalf due to a member of Culkin's family being unwell, meaning he stayed in New York to be by their side. The movie, about two cousins revisiting their family history in Poland, also took best original screenplay. Body horror The Substance took a well-deserved win for best makeup and hair, despite Moore missing out on the best actress win. Back to host for a second year running, Scottish actor David Tennant opened the show singing The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), before encouraging members of the starry audience to get involved.  With 42 gongs to hand out, from a host of well-known presenters, the first award of the night went to Dune: Part Two which took special visual effects. It also won best sound. Elsewhere, Wallace And Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl bagged best children's and family film as well a best animated feature. Accepting his second prize, Aardman director Nick Park joked: \"I didn't actually write a second speech.\" Republican Irish-language band Kneecap lived up to their promise, giving it plenty of attitude on the red carpet, and with the film's director Rich Peppiatt taking outstanding debut. The music biopic about Mo Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai (who wore his trademark balaclava in the colours of the Irish flag) had been up for six BAFTAs, despite failing to make it onto the Oscars shortlist last month. While it was up for seven awards, BAFTA voters didn't seem to be feeling too much of the Wicked magic, with the Wizard Of Oz prequel taking just two prizes - best production design and best costume design. Despite being up for six awards, A Complete Unknown, went home empty-handed. Lack of gongs aside, the movie's star Timothée Chalamet still managed to cause plenty of buzz on the night, thanks to the fact he was accompanied to the ceremony with his girlfriend Kylie Jenner - part of the ubiquitous Kardashian clan.  In a pre-announced win, British star Warwick Davis, best known for fantasy film Willow and the Harry Potter movies, was awarded the prestigious BAFTA film fellowship for both his performing and advocacy work. The In Memoriam section of the night was led by Wicked star Jeff Goldblum playing As Time Goes By on the piano as late stars including Dame Maggie Smith, David Lynch and Dame Joan Plowright were honoured. MediCinema was awarded the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema award, and Alien Romulus actor David Jonsson won the only publicly voted award of the night, the rising star, which celebrates up-and-coming talent. And in a balloon-filled performance, Take That's current line up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen performed their 2008 hit Greatest Day, a track which has been given a new lease of life thanks to its prominence in Anora."

        "Content": "Temperatures could hit 14C by the middle of the week after a period of persistent gloom. The Met Office said people could see sunshine return as soon as Monday in some parts of the country. It will come as a relief after an \"anticyclonic gloom\" brought dull skies and bitter weather to much of the country. The weekend arrived with warnings of sleet, snow and rare freezing rain in parts of England. Parts of the UK could continue to see snowfall throughout Sunday evening and into Monday - but then things are starting to look up. The predicted temperatures of 14C by mid-week are well above February's average, with 6C the usual monthly average in Scotland and 9C in southern England. This will be a \"noticeable shift\" after the last fortnight, which was below average, Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said. Don't expect the temperatures to break records, though. February's highest temperature was 21.2C recorded in 2019 in Kew Gardens, Mr Vautrey added. Read more from Sky News:BAFTAs 2025 latest: Films stars descend on LondonJockey Michael O'Sullivan dies aged 24 after fall in race An anticylonic gloom happens when \"high pressure traps a layer of moisture near to the Earth's surface\", Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon explains. \"That brings a prolonged period of dull and cloudy weather, but with pockets of mist and fog as well.\" Weather producer Jo Robinson says anticyclones typically result in stable, fine weather, often with sunny skies in summer. Sometimes in autumn and winter, when the sun isn't as strong, moisture can get trapped in the anticyclone as winds are light. This brings a layer of cloud near the surface, along with some fog and drizzle. The cloud can often thicken overnight too as moisture condenses. It often leads to higher levels of pollution as aerosols also become trapped. However, some areas could go 10 days without any sunshine, which is \"near record-breaking\", Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said. If Lyneham in Wiltshire remains cloudy on Sunday, it will equal the site's February record for consecutive days without any sunshine. More western areas are likely to see some rain during the week, while eastern areas are forecast to stay drier. Rain and potentially snow are expected in some places, particularly around East Anglia and Lincolnshire over the weekend, and into Scotland towards the beginning of next week.  Mr Morgan said: \"We've basically got this battleground taking place over this weekend between cold air across Scandinavia and Central Europe, which is affecting eastern parts of the UK, but towards the west is a little bit milder. \"The Atlantic is trying to shift that cold air out of the way, pushing from west to east across the UK, but it's a very slow process and it will take until the middle of the coming week for conditions to turn much milder nationwide.\" He explained the gloom \"dominating\" the UK over the last two weeks has been caused by a \"large anticyclone\", or high-pressure system, which has been sitting over Scandinavia, bringing cold wind from the east. \"Those cold conditions have picked up a lot of moisture across the Baltic and North seas, and those moist conditions have led to a lot of clouds,\" he added."

        "Content": " US secretary of state Marco Rubio has fully endorsed Israel's war aims in the Gaza Strip – throwing the region's fragile ceasefire into further doubt. Mr Rubio met with top Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday as he started a tour of the Middle East which will likely see him face pushback from Arab leaders over Donald Trump's plan to \"take over\" and redevelop Gaza. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire began on 19 January and the first phase comes to an end in two weeks' time. The second phase is yet to be negotiated. Mr Rubio said Hamas cannot continue as either a military or government force - using language which could complicate the talks. \"As long as it stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,\" he said. \"It must be eradicated.\"  Hamas reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire began and has been releasing hostages taken during its attack on 7 October 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. \n                  Gazans are resilient but they have been left with a hellscape\n                 \n                  Hamas names three Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners\n                 \n                  Hamas says it will release Israeli hostages as planned amid fears over collapse of ceasefire\n                 Mr Rubio's comments came as the Israel military said it carried out an airstrike on Sunday on people who had approached its forces in southern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run Interior Ministry had said three of its police officers were killed while they secured the entry of aid trucks on the Egyptian border. Hamas said the attack was a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire agreement.  Mr Netanyahu - who has welcomed Mr Trump's plan for Gaza - has signalled a readiness to war after the current phase of the ceasefire. He has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile - which has been rejected by the group. While each of the phase one hostage releases have so far taken place as planned, they haven't been without their issues. Read more from Sky News:Trump administration trying to un-fire nuclear safety workersTupac trial: Alternative cause of deathJockey Michael O'Sullivan dies aged 24 Earlier this week, Hamas threatened to delay a release because Mr Netanyahu was yet to approve the entry of mobile homes and heavy machinery into Gaza, as required by the ceasefire agreement. In response, Israel - with the backing of Mr Trump - threatened to renew its offensive if the hostages were not freed. Mr Rubio's tour will see him visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, but he is skipping Egypt and Jordan - two long-time US allies which have refused to accept any influx of Palestinian refugees."

Shakira has been a trailblazer for Latin artists crossing over into the English-speaking market although she faced controversy in recent years. In 2023, the singer settled a tax fraud case with the Spanish authorities where she eventually ended up paying a €7.5m (£6.5m) fine and accusing tax authorities of draining her \"energy, time, and tranquillity\". The singer's next show in Lima is booked for Monday after starting her tour in Brazil last week. Her tour is in support of her Grammy-winning album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, centred around her highly-publicised split from Spanish footballer Gerard Piqué. Shakira took home her fourth Grammy for the album after winning Latin Pop Album earlier this month. From Lima, she heads to her home country of Colombia before touring until the end of June."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a \"milestone\" in his plan to fix the NHS as figures show an extra two million appointments were delivered during Labour's first five months in office. New figures published by NHS England reveal that between July and November 2024, the health service delivered almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared with the same period the previous year. This includes for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endoscopy, and diagnostic tests, which were possible in part because of staff working extra weekend and evening shifts, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also pointed to the end of NHS strikes, extra flu vaccinations and £1.8bn of funding into elective appointments since Labour took office. The extra appointments come on top of figures last week showing total NHS waiting lists fell in December for the fourth month in a row - though challenges remain in other areas. The prime minister said: \"Two million extra NHS appointments and a waiting list on its way down - we're delivering on our promise to fix the NHS and make sure people get the care they need, when they need it. \"We said we'd turn this around and that's exactly what we're doing - this milestone is a shot in the arm for our plan to get the NHS back on its feet and cut waiting times.\" \n                  Ozempic helps to reduce alcohol consumption and smoking, new study finds\n                 \n                  'People will die': Chaos and mounting fear in Uganda as USAID cuts lead to 'total panic' and HIV clinic closures\n                 \n                  NHS warns hospitals are 'close to full' as norovirus cases surge\n                 During the general election campaign, polls suggested the NHS was the second most important issue to voters after the economy. The extra appointments mean Labour's manifesto commitment for two million a year was met seven months early.  Labour have also pledged to end hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The figures last week showed the number of people waiting 18 weeks or more for elective care has started to fall. The number who have been on the list for more than a year is also down. Overall, an estimated 7.46 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of December in England, down from 7.48 million treatments at the end of November. However, pressure remains in other areas. Sky News found the number of patients waiting for 12 hours in A&E after a decision has been made to admit them - known as a \"trolley-wait\" - rose above 60,000 for the first time in January. Waits of this length, usually indicative of a lack of available beds in the hospital, were almost non-existent before the pandemic. The January total - equivalent to more than 15% of all patients admitted via A&E - is more than the total recorded in over 11 years from August 2010 to October 2021. As Sky News' health correspondent Ashish Joshi reports that health anxiety - not emergencies - is clogging up A&E. There are also problems facing social care, with a lack of availability often preventing medically fit people from being discharged. Sir Keir acknowledged there was more to do, saying \"we're not complacent and we know the job isn't done\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the next steps on the Plan for Change include \"opening new surgical hubs, community diagnostics centres at evenings and weekends, and using private sector capacity to cut waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks\". He added: \"We have wasted no time in getting to work to cut NHS waiting times and end the agony of millions of patients suffering uncertainty and pain.\"Because we ended the strikes, invested in the NHS, and rolled out reformed ways of working, we are finally putting the NHS on the road to recovery.\" The government has also announced a £40m funding pot for trusts that make the most improvements, which will be available for hospitals from next year to spend on capital projects such repairs to their estates or new tech such as AI scanners. Sir Keir has previously promised more funding for trusts who make the fastest improvements in cutting waiting times but it was not clear how much. More detail on how the funds will be allocated will be set out \"in due course\", the government said."

The newspaper cited a senior Treasury source saying Ms Reeves was not willing to hand over any more cash for defence this year. However, an ally of Sir Keir reportedly said he will make the final decision and is prepared to override his chancellor. The UK's target is 2.5%, but it is currently at around 2.3% - with no timetable for when spending might increase. Mr Reynolds said Ms Reeves's June spending review \"will set out the roadmap towards that target\".

Mr Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, has also said European leaders will not have a place at the negotiating table in a discussion to end the war.  Rachel Ellehuus, the head of defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News that with Washington shifting its focus away from Europe, all NATO members should increase defence spending and the alliance's 2% target is not enough. She said the issue should be treated with \"urgency\" and called on the UK government to \"find the headroom to invest in conventional capabilities as well as innovation - to continue to invest in people, recruitment, personnel\". It comes ahead of an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss Ukraine, organised by French President Emmanuel Macron which Sir Keir is expected to attend in Paris on Monday. In a statement issued on Saturday night, the prime minister spoke of a \"once in a generation moment\" for the UK, US and Europe to work together and warned against \"divisions\" within the alliance. He also said it was clear \"Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\". Sir Keir will take messages from the meeting to Washington DC when he meets Mr Trump the following week, according to Downing Street sources."

Based on Robert Harris's 2016 novel of the same name, and centred around the selection of a new pope, the movie also won best adapted screenplay and best editing. Thanking his ensemble cast as he accepted the award, director Edward Berger said: \"What you did to me on set when I watched you was pure magic, it was beyond my grasp or understanding.\" It's not the first BAFTA success for the German filmmaker, who swept the board two years ago with his remake of All Quiet On The Western Front, taking seven prizes. Conclave is his first English-language film. BAFTA Awards 2025: The full list of winners Despite being the most nominated movie of the night, Conclave did not take any acting prizes, with its star Ralph Fiennes losing out to The Brutalist lead Adrien Brody in the hotly contested best actor category.

Accepting his director award, Brady Corbet, told the audience that despite being \"humbled\" and \"grateful\" for his win, there really was \"no such thing\" as best director. Conclave and The Brutalist were joint winners across the night, taking four gongs each. Anora, about a Brooklyn sex worker who marries into money, saw its break-out lead star, Mikey Madison take the top prize, after many had forecast a win for Demi Moore. Accepting her award, the 25-year-old actress took her moment on the stage to honour the sex worker community, who she said had helped her immeasurably in her preparation for the role, telling them: \"I see you. You deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally.\" Anora also took the casting prize.  Emilia Perez, which has come under fire in recent weeks following resurfaced tweets from its lead star Karla Sofia Gascon, took best film not in the English language. Gascon was not at the event. An emotional Zoe Saldaña, took best supporting actress for her outstanding performance in the musical - in which she acts, sings and dances - telling the audience her win was \"so validating\" and \"a true honour\". As she accepted her prize the 46-year-old star said: \"I was told not to cry by my children, so I'm going to try. This is so validating because the very few times I tried to go for roles with a British accent I was told this isn't going to happen.\" She ended her emotional speech by saying: \"Films are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds and I hope Emilia Perez did something like this, because voices need to be heard, just not my English accent.\" Saldana, who won in the same category at the Golden Globes last month will be hoping to follow up her success with an Oscar in March. An early front-runner in awards season, mostly Spanish language movie Emilia Perez had already been under fire from parts of the trans community for what some considered to be a retrograde step in representation, as well as those who objected to stereotypical depictions of Mexicans, as well as its handling of the sensitive topic of narcotics crime, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Going into the night with 11 nominations, it took two overall. Kieran Culkin, 42, won best supporting actor for his role in comedy A Real Pain, with his co-star and the film's writer Jesse Eisenberg accepting the gong on his behalf due to a member of Culkin's family being unwell, meaning he stayed in New York to be by their side. The movie, about two cousins revisiting their family history in Poland, also took best original screenplay. Body horror The Substance took a well-deserved win for best makeup and hair, despite Moore missing out on the best actress win. Back to host for a second year running, Scottish actor David Tennant opened the show singing The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), before encouraging members of the starry audience to get involved.  With 42 gongs to hand out, from a host of well-known presenters, the first award of the night went to Dune: Part Two which took special visual effects. It also won best sound. Elsewhere, Wallace And Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl bagged best children's and family film as well a best animated feature. Accepting his second prize, Aardman director Nick Park joked: \"I didn't actually write a second speech.\" Republican Irish-language band Kneecap lived up to their promise, giving it plenty of attitude on the red carpet, and with the film's director Rich Peppiatt taking outstanding debut. The music biopic about Mo Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai (who wore his trademark balaclava in the colours of the Irish flag) had been up for six BAFTAs, despite failing to make it onto the Oscars shortlist last month. While it was up for seven awards, BAFTA voters didn't seem to be feeling too much of the Wicked magic, with the Wizard Of Oz prequel taking just two prizes - best production design and best costume design. Despite being up for six awards, A Complete Unknown, went home empty-handed. Lack of gongs aside, the movie's star Timothée Chalamet still managed to cause plenty of buzz on the night, thanks to the fact he was accompanied to the ceremony with his girlfriend Kylie Jenner - part of the ubiquitous Kardashian clan.  In a pre-announced win, British star Warwick Davis, best known for fantasy film Willow and the Harry Potter movies, was awarded the prestigious BAFTA film fellowship for both his performing and advocacy work. The In Memoriam section of the night was led by Wicked star Jeff Goldblum playing As Time Goes By on the piano as late stars including Dame Maggie Smith, David Lynch and Dame Joan Plowright were honoured. MediCinema was awarded the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema award, and Alien Romulus actor David Jonsson won the only publicly voted award of the night, the rising star, which celebrates up-and-coming talent. And in a balloon-filled performance, Take That's current line up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen performed their 2008 hit Greatest Day, a track which has been given a new lease of life thanks to its prominence in Anora."

        "Content": "Temperatures could hit 14C by the middle of the week after a period of persistent gloom. The Met Office said people could see sunshine return as soon as Monday in some parts of the country. It will come as a relief after an \"anticyclonic gloom\" brought dull skies and bitter weather to much of the country. The weekend arrived with warnings of sleet, snow and rare freezing rain in parts of England. Parts of the UK could continue to see snowfall throughout Sunday evening and into Monday - but then things are starting to look up. The predicted temperatures of 14C by mid-week are well above February's average, with 6C the usual monthly average in Scotland and 9C in southern England. This will be a \"noticeable shift\" after the last fortnight, which was below average, Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said. Don't expect the temperatures to break records, though. February's highest temperature was 21.2C recorded in 2019 in Kew Gardens, Mr Vautrey added. Read more from Sky News:BAFTAs 2025 latest: Films stars descend on LondonJockey Michael O'Sullivan dies aged 24 after fall in race An anticylonic gloom happens when \"high pressure traps a layer of moisture near to the Earth's surface\", Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon explains. \"That brings a prolonged period of dull and cloudy weather, but with pockets of mist and fog as well.\" Weather producer Jo Robinson says anticyclones typically result in stable, fine weather, often with sunny skies in summer. Sometimes in autumn and winter, when the sun isn't as strong, moisture can get trapped in the anticyclone as winds are light. This brings a layer of cloud near the surface, along with some fog and drizzle. The cloud can often thicken overnight too as moisture condenses. It often leads to higher levels of pollution as aerosols also become trapped. However, some areas could go 10 days without any sunshine, which is \"near record-breaking\", Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said. If Lyneham in Wiltshire remains cloudy on Sunday, it will equal the site's February record for consecutive days without any sunshine. More western areas are likely to see some rain during the week, while eastern areas are forecast to stay drier. Rain and potentially snow are expected in some places, particularly around East Anglia and Lincolnshire over the weekend, and into Scotland towards the beginning of next week.  Mr Morgan said: \"We've basically got this battleground taking place over this weekend between cold air across Scandinavia and Central Europe, which is affecting eastern parts of the UK, but towards the west is a little bit milder. \"The Atlantic is trying to shift that cold air out of the way, pushing from west to east across the UK, but it's a very slow process and it will take until the middle of the coming week for conditions to turn much milder nationwide.\" He explained the gloom \"dominating\" the UK over the last two weeks has been caused by a \"large anticyclone\", or high-pressure system, which has been sitting over Scandinavia, bringing cold wind from the east. \"Those cold conditions have picked up a lot of moisture across the Baltic and North seas, and those moist conditions have led to a lot of clouds,\" he added."

Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) was notified about the case on Friday. It has now been decided that all birds at the farm - in Dungannon, County Tyrone - will be culled as a \"precautionary measure\", Northern Ireland's chief veterinary officer Brian Dooher has said. A temporary control zone (TCZ) has also been put in place and samples from the farm have been sent for testing.   Protection measures will be stepped up if results confirm the case is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), more commonly known as avian or bird flu. Mr Dooher said: \"The disease control measures have been taken to limit any potential spread of disease and I appeal to all bird owners - backyard and commercial - to take all necessary steps to protect your flock.\" Stormont's minister of agriculture, environment and rural affairs, Andrew Muir, added: \"This suspected incursion of HPAI, following the recently confirmed case at a captive bird premises near Magherafelt further shows we cannot afford to be complacent. \"It is crucial that all bird owners - from backyard hobbyists to commercial flock keepers with thousands of birds - adhere to all biosecurity measures to protect their flocks and report any suspect cases to the department as soon as possible.\" There have already been several confirmed cases of HPAI in wild birds across NI.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Tears, laughter and some Take That fangirling from a best actress nominee - this year's BAFTA Film Awards had it all. Conclave and The Brutalist were the night's big winners, taking home four awards each - including best picture and outstanding British film for Conclave, and best actor for The Brutalist star Adrien Brody and directing award for its filmmaker, Brady Corbet. But as always with these big entertainment awards ceremonies, there were plenty of moments to remember outside the big prizes. Here are our BAFTA 2025 key talking points. The return of Tennant Hosts can make or break an awards ceremony, so when you get a good 'un you want to keep them. After a successful stint in 2024, Doctor Who and Rivals star David Tennant was back to take the helm once again. This time round, the Scottish actor, sporting a kilt and sporran at first, kicked things off by calling on the \"BAFTA gods\" - acting legends Dame Helen Mirren, Jim Broadbent and Brian Cox, naturally - before a sketch performance of The Proclaimers' hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles). Of course, this needed some audience participation - including from US stars Camila Cabello, Colman Domingo and Anna Kendrick, who probably didn't have a clue what was going on but joined in with gusto. Tennant joked about actors \"freshening up\" while they age, after referencing that Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa took on his role in the BBC series, as well as the length of films such as The Brutalist (three-and-a-half hours). \"Who doesn't like a chance to have a wee halfway through?\" he asked, while talking about the film's much-needed intermission. Emilia Perez awards despite controversy - and Saldana's speech It went into awards season as one of the favourites, but Emilia Perez has been surrounded by controversy in recent weeks. As stars Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez enjoyed the show, leading actress Karla Sofia Gascon was notably absent from the ceremony following the resurgence of offensive tweets, and the film has also come under fire for its portrayal of Mexico and of trans people. Despite this, it picked up the BAFTAs for best film not in the English language and best supporting actress for Saldana. Earlier this month, director Jacques Audiard said Gascon's tweets were \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"very sad\" to see the issue \"taking up all the space\" around the film. However, collecting the BAFTA for best film not in the English language, the French filmmaker namechecked all his stars, including Gascon - and blew her a kiss through his translator. \"I'm deeply proud of what we have all achieved together - long live Emilia Perez,\" he said. Read more:The full list of winnersThe BAFTA red carpet in pictures In her speech, an emotional Saldana said the film defied categorisation and also paid tribute to her co-stars, before realising she was taking too long and being given a countdown. \"F***, f***, f***\", she panicked, before continuing with her speech anyway. Thanking her mother for \"being such a selfless person\", she broke down in tears, and added: \"Films are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds and I hope Emilia Perez did something like this, because voices need to be heard.\" Kylie Jenner sneaks in  We didn't see her on the red carpet, but sneaky old Kylie Jenner, girlfriend of Timothee Chalamet, was most definitely in attendance to show her support. The Kardashians star was in the audience next to Chalamet, who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. During a break from awards announcements, Tennant spent time joking with some of the A-listers in the crowd, and the couple didn't escape from his mic (or the cameras), despite their efforts to keep their appearance lowkey. Referencing the Chalamet lookalike competition that made headlines in New York last year, Tennant joked about what a good likeness the \"second place\" doppelganger before him was - and how nice it was to have a Jenner lookalike, too. Take That perform - and Saoirse Ronan fangirls If you've seen Anora, you'll know the filmmakers behind it are fans of Take That, specifically the 2008 hit Greatest Day. The band, now a trio of Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, performed the hit remix used in the film on stage at the ceremony. As host Tennant made his way through the crowd afterwards, he came across best actress nominee Saoirse Ronan and her husband Jack Lowden. Is Ronan a Take That fan? \"I've seen you twice,\" she shouted at the boys as they made their way off stage. That's a yes, then. Kieran Culkin couldn't attend - so Jesse Eisenberg stepped up Following best supporting actor wins at earlier ceremonies including the Golden Globes, Kieran Culkin has been a favourite when it comes to speeches this awards season. It was no surprise to see him honoured at the BAFTAs, but as he sadly couldn't attend the ceremony in person, his co-star and director Jesse Eisenberg stepped up - not only collecting the award on his behalf but also delivering the laughs, too. In A Real Pain, the pair play two very different cousins on a trip exploring their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland. The BAFTA was \"like the fifth\" award Eisenberg has picked up for Culkin, he told the audience. \"We have a similar life, but his is 20% better than mine,\" he added. Accepting the award for best original screenplay, Eisenberg also joked that his wife had not attended the ceremony as she did not think he would win. Breakthrough star pays tribute to sex workers After gaining a lot of support throughout the awards ceremony, Demi Moore was a favourite for a prize for her performance in The Substance. However, Mikey Madison had also gained momentum in recent weeks thanks to her breakout role as a young sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch in Anora. This one is a particularly exciting win as Madison, 25, was also up for the rising star award for up-and-coming talent. Being nominated in a major category in the same year is quite a feat in itself - winning it even more so. On stage, Madison thanked her mother for driving her \"to so many auditions\", as well as her fellow castmates. She also paid tribute to the sex worker community, after working with many women in the industry to perfect her performance. \"I want to take a second to recognise the sex worker community,\" Madison said. \"You deserve respect and decency, and I... (urge) others to do the same... I will always be a friend and an ally.\" Kneecap: 'It's a movement' Irish-language film Kneecap, a semi-autobiographical story starring a trio of rappers of the same name from Belfast, picked up the award for outstanding debut for a British filmmaker. Band member JJ O Dochartaigh always wears a balaclava featuring the Irish flag - but for the BAFTAs he went all out, matching his suit. The award went to director and writer Rich Peppiatt, who collected the prize on stage. \"Within two weeks of moving to Belfast I met Kneecap and now I'm standing here,\" he told the audience, saying his movie was \"more than a film, it's a movement - about how everyone should have their language respected, their culture respected, their homeland respected. \"This award is dedicated to everyone out there fighting that fight.\" British success and a new collab? Here's a look backstage at US singer-songwriter Camila Cabello and the Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl filmmakers Nick Park, left, and Merlin Crossingham. The pair picked up the prize for best children's and family film, becoming the first ever recipients of the award, which was presented by Cabello. We're hoping this could be the start of a new partnership. Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl also took home the animated film trophy, with Park joking on stage: \"I didn't actually write a second speech.\" And there was more recognition for British technical creatives in other categories, too. Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales picked up the award for best production design, for their incredible visual work on the blockbuster smash Wicked. Paul Lambert was on the team awarded the BAFTA for best visual effects, for his work on the science fiction blockbuster Dune: Part Two - which also won best sound, with a winning team including British mixer and engineer Gareth John. Warwick Davis's emotional speech Honoured with the prestigious BAFTA fellowship award, Warwick Davis dedicated the prize to his late wife Samantha, who died in March last year. Davis, who is known for fantasy film Willow and the Harry Potter movies, received the organisation's highest honour for his performing and advocacy work. \"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me - and I've been in Star Wars,\" he joked at the start of his speech, before getting emotional as he talked about his wife and referenced his children, Annabelle and Harrison, who were in the audience. \"Thank you to the support of our wonderful children, I've been able to keep engaging in life,\" he said. Davis was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare bone disorder that results in dwarfism. Previous recipients of the fellowship include Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Stanley Kubrick, Billy Wilder, Ken Loach, Sir Michael Caine, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Lord Laurence Olivier and Dame Judi Dench. Look out for David Jonsson British actor David Jonsson was named this year's BAFTA rising star - the only award voted for by the public. The 31-year-old recently starred in the film Alien: Romulus and his credits also include TV series Industry as well as the 2023 romantic comedy Rye Lane. \"I've got to be honest, this isn't why I do it,\" he told the BAFTA audience in his speech. \"Do you know what I mean? I'm just an east London boy. \"I didn't really see a space for me in this industry. But this award is about people and as long as we can keep telling stories about people I think there's got to be a space for me.\" Jonsson saw off competition from his fellow Industry and Back To Black star Marisa Abela, American actor Jharrel Jerome, Anora's Madison and Informer star Nabhaan Rizwan. Previous winners include Kristen Stewart, Daniel Kaluuya, John Boyega and Tom Hardy, all before they became big names in the industry. Sing Sing stars visas denied, filmmakers say This wasn't a moment from the ceremony, but on the red carpet ahead of the awards the filmmakers behind Sing Sing, which tells the true story of a group of men who take part in an arts rehabilitation project at a maximum security prison, spoke to Sky News on the red carpet. While Colman Domingo, an established Hollywood star who was nominated for best actor, was able to attend the ceremony, the real-life person he portrayed in the film, Divine G Whitfield, was not - and neither was his co-star Clarence Maclin. Maclin is a former inmate who played himself in the film, after being rehabilitated through the programme, and was nominated for best supporting actor. Both were denied denied entry to the UK earlier this week due to their previous convictions, filmmakers Greg Kwedar and Clint Bentley said. \"Their visas were denied to enter the country because they have served prison time, which goes against the grain of everything this movie stands for,\" Kwedar told us. \"It shows that people have the capacity to grow and to come back into their communities when they leave prison. \"These two particular men have such courage, vulnerability, integrity - and they're not here tonight and they should be. The story is about them, it was built with them.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Not invited to American talks with Russia on the future of Ukraine, European leaders are holding a hastily convened meeting of their own on Monday. After years of exasperation from the US over Europe's more relaxed attitude to defence spending - nothing quite makes the point about military irrelevance than being left out of the room where the future of Ukraine is likely to be decided. President Macron's scrambled plan to get European leaders to drop everything and come to Paris for talks demonstrates the high level of alarm at the new world order. As well as the UK, Paris has confirmed those on the invite list for the \"informal\" meeting include Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark - as well as the president of the European Council, the president of the European Commission and the secretary general of NATO.  Politics Live: UK 'disagrees' with JD Vance on free speech comments  \n                  'Whole cabinet' recognises need to spend more on defence, minister says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer to urge EU nations to 'shoulder more of the burden' on defence spending\n                 \n                  UK to 'war-game' how frontline British troops could be equipped with weapons amid supply chain disruption\n                 Sir Keir Starmer will be attending, describing it as \"a once in a generation moment for our national security… we cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face\". Donald Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, General Kellogg, has laid down the gauntlet to Europe's leaders to come up with their own contributions to the Ukrainian peace process, calling on them to \"participate in the debate, not by complaining about being at the table or not, but by presenting concrete proposals, ideas, by increasing spending.\" And that is exactly what will be on the table at Monday's meeting. While it seems unlikely the leaders will be either willing or practically able to develop a new European army of the kind requested by President Zelenskyy, their discussions will surely focus on the options for a future peacekeeping force in Ukraine, how best to bolster Ukraine's existing fighting capabilities, and underlying everything - the level of future defence spending. The figures tell a clear story. As the top three military powers in NATO, the US spends $967.71bn on defence, Germany $97.69bn and the UK $82.11bn  President Trump has called for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defence spending - and for Europe to take over responsibility for its own defence. The UK has been effusively nodding along with that argument in principle, with the PM arguing \"it's clear Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\" while continuing to work with the US. The government has pledged to increase defence spending from around 2.3% to 2.5%, but we're still waiting to find out when and how that target will be met, let alone surpassed. Just meeting the original 2.5% target is set to cost £5bn - a figure which is difficult for the chancellor to justify while keeping within her self-imposed fiscal rules and under pressure to make cuts to government spending elsewhere. Sunday's papers are full of speculation about cabinet division over the issue. Could the chancellor break her rule on not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, and borrow to pay for rearmament? The foreign secretary made the point at Munich on Saturday that the UK spent 7% on defence at the height of the Cold War - and that the costs of Ukraine falling to Russia would ultimately be far higher. Whatever the European leaders agree to on Monday, Sir Keir Starmer is likely to act as a kind of envoy to the Americans when he flies out to meet Donald Trump at the White House next week. We understand the Europeans will then reconvene following his return, alongside President Zelenskyy. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told Sky's Trevor Phillips this morning \"there is a role the United Kingdom can play, which is in that bridge between European allies and our US allies\". That bridge is in danger of becoming something of a tightrope given the growing transatlantic distance between the US and Europe. Divisions are growing not just on how to handle the conflict in Ukraine and the future of NATO, but on broader issues of society and democracy too, following the US vice president's broadside against European countries including the UK and Germany over supposed issues of free speech and religious freedom. The special relationship will be doing a lot of heavy lifting."

Ahead of an \"emergency meeting\" of European leaders on Monday, the prime minister said he was \"ready and willing\" to put British troops into a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, the prime minister also said the UK was \"ready to play a leading role\" in Ukraine's defence and security, by committing £3bn a year until 2030. It comes as Emmanuel Macron rallies the likes of Sir Keir and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at a hastily-arranged Paris summit to discuss Ukraine's next steps. The French president will look to recapture Ukraine's future at the informal meeting, which has been swiftly put together following announcements from the United States. It will take place as the US sends senior officials to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Russia - which representatives from Europe have not been invited to. It is unclear if Ukraine will take part.  A delegation from Ukraine is in Saudi Arabia to pave the way for a possible visit from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one Ukrainian official said on Sunday. However, less than 24 hours prior, a top Zelenskyy adviser had denied Ukraine would take part in the discussions. \"There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,\" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a TV interview. Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Donald Trump said of Mr Putin: \"I think he wants to stop fighting. \"They [Russia] have a big powerful machine, you understand that. They defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. They've been fighting a long time.\" Mr Macron's meeting is expected to be attended by British Prime Minister Sir Keir, Germany's Mr Scholz, Danish PM Mette Frederiksen and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, alongside other European leaders. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and NATO chief Mark Rutte are also expected at the Paris summit. The goal of the discussions is to \"bring together all partners interested in peace and security in Europe\", a French statement said.

The discussions are expected to begin in Riyadh on Tuesday, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant. Mr Trump's push for a quick way out of Russia's war on Ukraine has stirred concern and uncertainty from European leaders. After a recent phone call with Mr Putin, Mr Trump has - on multiple occasions - said he and the Russian president will meet soon to discuss a peace deal over Ukraine. He has assured Mr Zelenskyy he will have a seat at the table, but it is unclear if European officials will be invited. The Ukrainian president has previously said he will not accept any negotiations that do not include his country."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Not invited to American talks with Russia on the future of Ukraine, European leaders are holding a hastily convened meeting of their own on Monday. After years of exasperation from the US over Europe's more relaxed attitude to defence spending - nothing quite makes the point about military irrelevance than being left out of the room where the future of Ukraine is likely to be decided. President Macron's scrambled plan to get European leaders to drop everything and come to Paris for talks demonstrates the high level of alarm at the new world order. As well as the UK, Paris has confirmed those on the invite list for the \"informal\" meeting include Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark - as well as the president of the European Council, the president of the European Commission and the secretary general of NATO.  Politics Live: UK 'disagrees' with JD Vance on free speech comments  \n                  'Whole cabinet' recognises need to spend more on defence, minister says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer to urge EU nations to 'shoulder more of the burden' on defence spending\n                 \n                  UK to 'war-game' how frontline British troops could be equipped with weapons amid supply chain disruption\n                 Sir Keir Starmer will be attending, describing it as \"a once in a generation moment for our national security… we cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face\". Donald Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, General Kellogg, has laid down the gauntlet to Europe's leaders to come up with their own contributions to the Ukrainian peace process, calling on them to \"participate in the debate, not by complaining about being at the table or not, but by presenting concrete proposals, ideas, by increasing spending.\" And that is exactly what will be on the table at Monday's meeting. While it seems unlikely the leaders will be either willing or practically able to develop a new European army of the kind requested by President Zelenskyy, their discussions will surely focus on the options for a future peacekeeping force in Ukraine, how best to bolster Ukraine's existing fighting capabilities, and underlying everything - the level of future defence spending. The figures tell a clear story. As the top three military powers in NATO, the US spends $967.71bn on defence, Germany $97.69bn and the UK $82.11bn  President Trump has called for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defence spending - and for Europe to take over responsibility for its own defence. The UK has been effusively nodding along with that argument in principle, with the PM arguing \"it's clear Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\" while continuing to work with the US. The government has pledged to increase defence spending from around 2.3% to 2.5%, but we're still waiting to find out when and how that target will be met, let alone surpassed. Just meeting the original 2.5% target is set to cost £5bn - a figure which is difficult for the chancellor to justify while keeping within her self-imposed fiscal rules and under pressure to make cuts to government spending elsewhere. Sunday's papers are full of speculation about cabinet division over the issue. Could the chancellor break her rule on not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, and borrow to pay for rearmament? The foreign secretary made the point at Munich on Saturday that the UK spent 7% on defence at the height of the Cold War - and that the costs of Ukraine falling to Russia would ultimately be far higher. Whatever the European leaders agree to on Monday, Sir Keir Starmer is likely to act as a kind of envoy to the Americans when he flies out to meet Donald Trump at the White House next week. We understand the Europeans will then reconvene following his return, alongside President Zelenskyy. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told Sky's Trevor Phillips this morning \"there is a role the United Kingdom can play, which is in that bridge between European allies and our US allies\". That bridge is in danger of becoming something of a tightrope given the growing transatlantic distance between the US and Europe. Divisions are growing not just on how to handle the conflict in Ukraine and the future of NATO, but on broader issues of society and democracy too, following the US vice president's broadside against European countries including the UK and Germany over supposed issues of free speech and religious freedom. The special relationship will be doing a lot of heavy lifting."

        "Content": " US secretary of state Marco Rubio has fully endorsed Israel's war aims in the Gaza Strip – throwing the region's fragile ceasefire into further doubt. Mr Rubio met with top Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday as he started a tour of the Middle East which will likely see him face pushback from Arab leaders over Donald Trump's plan to \"take over\" and redevelop Gaza. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire began on 19 January and the first phase comes to an end in two weeks' time. The second phase is yet to be negotiated. Mr Rubio said Hamas cannot continue as either a military or government force - using language which could complicate the talks. \"As long as it stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,\" he said. \"It must be eradicated.\"  Hamas reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire began and has been releasing hostages taken during its attack on 7 October 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. \n                  Gazans are resilient but they have been left with a hellscape\n                 \n                  Hamas names three Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners\n                 \n                  Hamas says it will release Israeli hostages as planned amid fears over collapse of ceasefire\n                 Mr Rubio's comments came as the Israel military said it carried out an airstrike on Sunday on people who had approached its forces in southern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run Interior Ministry had said three of its police officers were killed while they secured the entry of aid trucks on the Egyptian border. Hamas said the attack was a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire agreement.  Mr Netanyahu - who has welcomed Mr Trump's plan for Gaza - has signalled a readiness to war after the current phase of the ceasefire. He has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile - which has been rejected by the group. While each of the phase one hostage releases have so far taken place as planned, they haven't been without their issues. Read more from Sky News:Trump administration trying to un-fire nuclear safety workersTupac trial: Alternative cause of deathJockey Michael O'Sullivan dies aged 24 Earlier this week, Hamas threatened to delay a release because Mr Netanyahu was yet to approve the entry of mobile homes and heavy machinery into Gaza, as required by the ceasefire agreement. In response, Israel - with the backing of Mr Trump - threatened to renew its offensive if the hostages were not freed. Mr Rubio's tour will see him visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, but he is skipping Egypt and Jordan - two long-time US allies which have refused to accept any influx of Palestinian refugees."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Unlike Theresa May, Sir Keir Starmer will not be the first world leader to set foot in the Trump White House, but he has at least now secured an invitation to Washington. It wasn't issued on the most gracious of terms - with the president telling reporters \"it was his request not mine\" - but the PM will now have the chance to speak with him face to face in the room where it happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. Donald Trump was exceptionally casual about the forthcoming meeting, claiming not to know what the two of them would have to talk about. But Number 10 will be pleased that so far their charm offensive appears to be holding, with the president describing Mr Starmer as \"a nice guy\". Politics latest: UK 'disagrees' with JD Vance's free speech comments That warm personal relationship is going to come under increasing pressure given the growing divergence of UK and US positions on the topics Mr Starmer will certainly want to discuss - Ukraine, the Middle East, trade tariffs and the Chagos deal for starters.  The diplomatic contortions required to keep faith with Ukraine - while continuing to stay on the right side of Mr Trump - are only getting more extreme. The president's 90-minute unilateral phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by the announcement of peace talks, shocked the world. The White House does now seem to have accepted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will need to be at the table, with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy telling reporters that US vice president JD Vance had agreed the Ukrainians will have to be part of any future deal. It's a message the UK has been doing its best to reinforce, with Mr Starmer expressing his \"concrete\" backing for Ukraine in a phone call on Friday and insisting \"there can be no talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine\". In a joint article in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Mr Lammy and John Healey underlined that support, calling \"for us all to continue to unite and show strength\" and arguing that the West has previously done \"too little\" to counter Russian aggression.  Read more:Trump administration trying to un-fire nuclear safety workersTrump says he and Starmer will meet 'very soon' The foreign and defence secretaries also wanted to demonstrate they have been listening to the US's arguments about defence spending, insisting \"we have been clear that Europe and the UK must do more together to share the burden of our continent's security\". Despite this claim, we're still waiting for the government to set out when they will meet their commitment to increase defence spending from 2.3 to 2.5% of GDP. Going further than that - given the chancellor's existing difficulties in balancing the budget while sticking to her fiscal rules - looks incredibly remote, despite Mr Trump's calls for a 5% target.  It also seems unlikely that that promise of shouldering the burden to defend Europe will go as far as establishing an \"army of Europe\" as proposed by Mr Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. We've heard plenty of discussion about that idea for many years, and the UK has always been opposed. But it's also true that Mr Starmer has pledged the UK would \"play its full part\" in any peacekeeping operation in Ukraine in the future. How extensively the PM would be prepared to commit to this will surely be another sticking point with the Americans. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Another open disagreement is over the accession of Ukraine to NATO. On Friday, Mr Starmer reiterated the UK's commitment to Ukraine being on an \"irreversible path to NATO as agreed by allies at the Washington Summit last year\". The Americans have described this as \"unrealistic\" but in his speech on Saturday Mr Zelenskyy continued to insist it must remain on the table as \"the core of any security guarantees for Ukraine\". Mr Starmer will be hoping the special relationship will help give weight to his arguments when he heads to the White House later this month. But it's not the only area of negotiation which requires delicate handling, given the threat of trade tariffs which could cost the UK economy £24bn. Can the PM's staunch position on Ukraine survive - let alone prevail - when he needs to go in to bat for the UK on so many other fronts?"

A 23-year-old Syrian was arrested after the rampage, which is being treated as an \"Islamic terror incident\". Austria's interior minister Gerhard Karner said the suspect had alleged ties to the Islamic State group and radicalised himself online within a very short period.

Austria's president Alexander Van der Bellen called the attack \"horrific\", saying on X that \"no words can undo the suffering, the horror, the fear\". Also, far-right leader Herbert Kickl, whose Freedom Party of Austria won a national election four months ago, called for \"a rigorous crackdown on asylum\" in the wake of the attack. Mr Karner said it will ultimately be necessary to \"carry out a mass screening without cause because this assassin was not conspicuous\".

        "Content": " US secretary of state Marco Rubio has fully endorsed Israel's war aims in the Gaza Strip – throwing the region's fragile ceasefire into further doubt. Mr Rubio met with top Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday as he started a tour of the Middle East which will likely see him face pushback from Arab leaders over Donald Trump's plan to \"take over\" and redevelop Gaza. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire began on 19 January and the first phase comes to an end in two weeks' time. The second phase is yet to be negotiated. Mr Rubio said Hamas cannot continue as either a military or government force - using language which could complicate the talks. \"As long as it stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,\" he said. \"It must be eradicated.\"  Hamas reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire began and has been releasing hostages taken during its attack on 7 October 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. \n                  Gazans are resilient but they have been left with a hellscape\n                 \n                  Hamas names three Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners\n                 \n                  Hamas says it will release Israeli hostages as planned amid fears over collapse of ceasefire\n                 Mr Rubio's comments came as the Israel military said it carried out an airstrike on Sunday on people who had approached its forces in southern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run Interior Ministry had said three of its police officers were killed while they secured the entry of aid trucks on the Egyptian border. Hamas said the attack was a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire agreement.  Mr Netanyahu - who has welcomed Mr Trump's plan for Gaza - has signalled a readiness to war after the current phase of the ceasefire. He has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile - which has been rejected by the group. While each of the phase one hostage releases have so far taken place as planned, they haven't been without their issues. Read more from Sky News:Trump administration trying to un-fire nuclear safety workersTupac trial: Alternative cause of deathJockey Michael O'Sullivan dies aged 24 Earlier this week, Hamas threatened to delay a release because Mr Netanyahu was yet to approve the entry of mobile homes and heavy machinery into Gaza, as required by the ceasefire agreement. In response, Israel - with the backing of Mr Trump - threatened to renew its offensive if the hostages were not freed. Mr Rubio's tour will see him visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, but he is skipping Egypt and Jordan - two long-time US allies which have refused to accept any influx of Palestinian refugees."

        "Content": "The US nuclear safety watchdog, which sacked hundreds of workers under orders from Donald Trump's administration, is now trying to contact employees to rehire them. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has been attempting to notify some employees who had been let go that they are now due to be reinstated. But according to Sky News' US partner NBC News, officials are struggling to find them because they do not have their new contact information. In an email sent to employees at the NNSA on Friday, officials wrote: \"The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel.\" The individuals had been fired on Thursday and lost access to their federal government email accounts. Some 325 essential nuclear security workers at the NNSA, which manages the US nuclear weapons stockpile, were let go, according to the Reuters news agency. The NNSA is part of the Department of Energy (DOE) which has laid off between 1,200 to 2,000 people among a staff of around 14,000. The termination notices included the subject line: \"Notification of Termination During Probationary/Trial Period.\" The letter said: \"DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with DOE and the federal civil service effective today.\" The department laid off workers' access to government-issued laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Time (5am UK time) on Friday. That left some unable to receive the notifications and they did not know they had been fired.

She said some were safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site. \"These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make workers less safe - trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts,\" she added. The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have been at risk in Russia's war on Ukraine."

        "Content": "Lawyers for the man suspected of killing rap icon Tupak Shakur are investigating evidence that could show an alternative cause of death. Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 7 September 1996. Shakur died from his injuries six days later. And Davis's lawyers say they have witness information that Shakur was in stable condition after the shooting. They are consulting medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death. Defence lawyers also want to delay next month's trial, saying more time is needed for investigative work to ensure Davis gets a fair trial. The motion filed on Friday in a Nevada court provides insight into Davis' defence, noting that a private investigator has identified witnesses who can testify that he was not at the scene of the 1996 shooting, nor was he in Las Vegas at the time. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of raping woman over Tupac claims\n                 \n                  Drake ordered to delete diss track featuring AI-generated voice of Tupac Shakur \n                 \n                  Tupac Shakur: Trial delayed for Duane 'Keffe D' Davis, ex-gang leader charged with murder of hip-hop star in 1996\n                 The motion also suggests that someone else may have orchestrated the shooting and that witnesses who could testify on the matter are being interviewed. The defence team said in a statement that the new developments and the need to interview key witnesses necessitate a delay. A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the timing of the trial. \"This case involves decades-old allegations, and with every new piece of evidence, it becomes increasingly clear that critical facts have yet to be fully examined,\" said attorney Carl Arnold. On the night of the shooting, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur's killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest."

        "Content": "\n          Sky News commentator\n              @adamboultonTABB\n Germans will be voting in a general election next weekend. The country has the largest population - 84 million - and the biggest economy in Europe with a GDP of $4.5trn, but its elections are usually dull affairs. Since the Second World War, there has been agreement between the two ruling centre-right and centre-left political groupings, who have even ended up sometimes forming a grand coalition. The proportional representation voting system usually means that there is not much change in Germany's political settlement, often after weeks of negotiations with smaller parties until a government with control in the Bundestag can be formed. This time it's different. As in France and the UK, the mainstream orthodoxy is being thrown into turmoil by the emergence of a challenger party on the far right which is commanding significant levels of support. In France, Marine Le Pen's National Rally was the largest party in last year's Assembly elections. Nigel Farage's Reform UK has MPs at Westminster and is on equal terms with Labour and Conservatives in current opinion polls. \n                  Mother and two-year-old daughter die after car ramming attack in Germany\n                 \n                  JD Vance takes centre stage at Munich Security Conference - but fears of wider European war persist\n                 \n                  Who is Friedrich Merz - the trained pilot and Angela Merkel's long-time rival on course to become German chancellor?\n                 The rise of AfD  Ahead of the German election, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is in second place in opinion polls, at around 22%, behind the CDU/CSU conservatives, on 30%. The partners who make up the current red-green-yellow \"traffic light\" government are all lagging behind - the SPD Social Democrats are on 17%, and the Greens are on 13%. The smaller Liberal FDP joins the far-left Linke and BSW Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance in struggling to reach the 5% threshold to qualify for parliament. As elsewhere in Europe, economic contraction and immigration are central issues in the German campaign along with the Ukraine war and relations with the disruptive Trump administration. Elon Musk has interfered in German politics, as much as he has in Britain. Musk hosted the AfD co-leader Alice Weidel on X. Times have changed. None of these issues were top priorities for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who retired less than four years ago after 16 years in power. Merkel is remembered for her decision in 2015 to take in over a million migrants mainly from Syria with the slogan \"wir schaffen das\" - \"we can do it\". Since then the mood has soured and tensions have been rising. There have recently been several deadly attacks, with migrants identified as the suspects - including earlier this week in Munich, at the Magdeburg Christmas market, and a stabbing in Aschafftenburg. AfD's rise is acutely sensitive because of Germany's Nazi past. Its popularity is rising but in opinion polls, two-thirds of Germans regard it as a threat to democracy, and 40% would like the party to be shut down. The leadership disassociates itself but some of its supporters have brandished swastikas. One of the party's campaign adverts includes two blonde parents raising their arms to form a symbolic roof over their two blonde children. Like Musk's gesture at Donald Trump's victory rally in January, their pose reminds many of the Heil Hitler salute. Farage keeping his distance Two of Europe's far-right parties, France's National Rally and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Mussolini-linked Fratelli d'Italia, insisted on a \"clean break\" and kicked AfD out of their European Parliament caucus. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has also so far kept his distance from the AfD. The AfD has some influential international admirers. Ten days ahead of the elections, Hungary's Viktor Orban hosted Alice Weidel and described her party as Germany's future. Read more:All you need to know about Germany's electionsDoes Germany need to be ready for war?Musk urges far-right supporters to move beyond 'past guilt' Billionaire Musk, who has emerged as President Trump's right-hand man, appeared on screen recently at a major AfD rally to endorse the party and tell its supporters that there was \"too much focus on past guilt\" and that \"only the AfD can save Germany\". Germany's main political parties have long supported a \"firewall\", working together to exclude far-right parties from determining national policy. This is why the two main TV debates during the campaign have been confined to head-to-heads between the CDU and SPD chancellor candidates. The second debate between Friedrich Merz and Olaf Scholz, the current chancellor, is on 19 February. There was nothing in their first encounter to rule out another grand coalition between their two parties. CDU leader Merz, and most likely the next chancellor, recently oversaw a breach in the firewall. He relied on AfD votes to pass an anti-immigrant measure in parliament. Angela Merkel, who has had a career-long feud with Merz, denounced his move as \"wrong\" and the CDU's poll lead dipped a couple of points. AfD probably won't win this time The AfD is not expecting to win this year's elections. Like Reform UK, it is predicting that its breakthrough into government will come in four years' time at the next general election. It only entered parliament in 2017 and is currently polling more than double its vote share at the election in 2021. The assumptions underpinning German politics would be in ruins if it is the largest party next Sunday. There will be headaches enough for the other parties if as expected the AfD comes a strong second. Merz has ruled out a coalition with the AfD. But as with the Conservatives in the UK, the temptation will be there to try to build an alliance on the right, bringing in the extremists. More likely, there will be a weak coalition between mainstream parties that do not agree with each other, while AfD and others continue to make hay on the fringes.  Ultra-nationalism may gain further momentum Merz has pledged to bolster Germany's international standing and support for Ukraine by meeting with his French and Polish opposite numbers in the so-called Weimar Alliance on day one in office. The UK government committed itself to a \"Weimar +\" declaration last week opposing Trump's warm approach to Putin of Russia. Unless European governments, including those in Germany and the UK, can find ways to restore their economies to health and are really prepared to step up their national defences, for themselves and their neighbours, the ultra-nationalism embodied by Trump and the AfD, and the yearning for strong leaders, may yet gather further momentum."

The 18-year-old was jailed for a minimum of 52 years in January after murdering three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in July last year.

Rudakubana pleaded guilty to murdering Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven. He also admitted trying to murder eight other children, instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes, as well as charges of producing ricin and possession of information useful for the purposes of terrorism. Rudakubana will be 70 before a parole board can consider releasing him, but the judge, Mr Justice Goose, said it was \"highly likely\" he will never be freed. The attack sparked the UK riots last summer after false claims online that Rudakubana - born in Cardiff to Christian parents from Rwanda - was a newly arrived asylum seeker. The government has announced an inquiry into how the state failed to recognise the risk posed by the killer and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he will consider changing the definition of terrorism if necessary."

Mr Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, has also said European leaders will not have a place at the negotiating table in a discussion to end the war.  Rachel Ellehuus, the head of defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News that with Washington shifting its focus away from Europe, all NATO members should increase defence spending and the alliance's 2% target is not enough. She said the issue should be treated with \"urgency\" and called on the UK government to \"find the headroom to invest in conventional capabilities as well as innovation - to continue to invest in people, recruitment, personnel\". It comes ahead of an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss Ukraine, organised by French President Emmanuel Macron which Sir Keir is expected to attend in Paris on Monday. In a statement issued on Saturday night, the prime minister spoke of a \"once in a generation moment\" for the UK, US and Europe to work together and warned against \"divisions\" within the alliance. He also said it was clear \"Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\". Sir Keir will take messages from the meeting to Washington DC when he meets Mr Trump the following week, according to Downing Street sources."

After years of exasperation from the US over Europe's more relaxed attitude to defence spending - nothing quite makes the point about military irrelevance than being left out of the room where the future of Ukraine is likely to be decided. President Macron's scrambled plan to get European leaders to drop everything and come to Paris for talks demonstrates the high level of alarm at the new world order. As well as the UK, Paris has confirmed those on the invite list for the \"informal\" meeting include Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark - as well as the president of the European Council, the president of the European Commission and the secretary general of NATO.

Donald Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, General Kellogg, has laid down the gauntlet to Europe's leaders to come up with their own contributions to the Ukrainian peace process, calling on them to \"participate in the debate, not by complaining about being at the table or not, but by presenting concrete proposals, ideas, by increasing spending.\" And that is exactly what will be on the table at Monday's meeting. While it seems unlikely the leaders will be either willing or practically able to develop a new European army of the kind requested by President Zelenskyy, their discussions will surely focus on the options for a future peacekeeping force in Ukraine, how best to bolster Ukraine's existing fighting capabilities, and underlying everything - the level of future defence spending. The figures tell a clear story. As the top three military powers in NATO, the US spends $967.71bn on defence, Germany $97.69bn and the UK $82.11bn  President Trump has called for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defence spending - and for Europe to take over responsibility for its own defence. The UK has been effusively nodding along with that argument in principle, with the PM arguing \"it's clear Europe must take on a greater role in NATO\" while continuing to work with the US. The government has pledged to increase defence spending from around 2.3% to 2.5%, but we're still waiting to find out when and how that target will be met, let alone surpassed. Just meeting the original 2.5% target is set to cost £5bn - a figure which is difficult for the chancellor to justify while keeping within her self-imposed fiscal rules and under pressure to make cuts to government spending elsewhere. Sunday's papers are full of speculation about cabinet division over the issue. Could the chancellor break her rule on not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, and borrow to pay for rearmament? The foreign secretary made the point at Munich on Saturday that the UK spent 7% on defence at the height of the Cold War - and that the costs of Ukraine falling to Russia would ultimately be far higher. Whatever the European leaders agree to on Monday, Sir Keir Starmer is likely to act as a kind of envoy to the Americans when he flies out to meet Donald Trump at the White House next week. We understand the Europeans will then reconvene following his return, alongside President Zelenskyy. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told Sky's Trevor Phillips this morning \"there is a role the United Kingdom can play, which is in that bridge between European allies and our US allies\". That bridge is in danger of becoming something of a tightrope given the growing transatlantic distance between the US and Europe. Divisions are growing not just on how to handle the conflict in Ukraine and the future of NATO, but on broader issues of society and democracy too, following the US vice president's broadside against European countries including the UK and Germany over supposed issues of free speech and religious freedom. The special relationship will be doing a lot of heavy lifting."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a \"milestone\" in his plan to fix the NHS as figures show an extra two million appointments were delivered during Labour's first five months in office. New figures published by NHS England reveal that between July and November 2024, the health service delivered almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared with the same period the previous year. This includes for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endoscopy, and diagnostic tests, which were possible in part because of staff working extra weekend and evening shifts, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also pointed to the end of NHS strikes, extra flu vaccinations and £1.8bn of funding into elective appointments since Labour took office. The extra appointments come on top of figures last week showing total NHS waiting lists fell in December for the fourth month in a row - though challenges remain in other areas. The prime minister said: \"Two million extra NHS appointments and a waiting list on its way down - we're delivering on our promise to fix the NHS and make sure people get the care they need, when they need it. \"We said we'd turn this around and that's exactly what we're doing - this milestone is a shot in the arm for our plan to get the NHS back on its feet and cut waiting times.\" \n                  Ozempic helps to reduce alcohol consumption and smoking, new study finds\n                 \n                  'People will die': Chaos and mounting fear in Uganda as USAID cuts lead to 'total panic' and HIV clinic closures\n                 \n                  NHS warns hospitals are 'close to full' as norovirus cases surge\n                 During the general election campaign, polls suggested the NHS was the second most important issue to voters after the economy. The extra appointments mean Labour's manifesto commitment for two million a year was met seven months early.  Labour have also pledged to end hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment. The figures last week showed the number of people waiting 18 weeks or more for elective care has started to fall. The number who have been on the list for more than a year is also down. Overall, an estimated 7.46 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of December in England, down from 7.48 million treatments at the end of November. However, pressure remains in other areas. Sky News found the number of patients waiting for 12 hours in A&E after a decision has been made to admit them - known as a \"trolley-wait\" - rose above 60,000 for the first time in January. Waits of this length, usually indicative of a lack of available beds in the hospital, were almost non-existent before the pandemic. The January total - equivalent to more than 15% of all patients admitted via A&E - is more than the total recorded in over 11 years from August 2010 to October 2021. As Sky News' health correspondent Ashish Joshi reports that health anxiety - not emergencies - is clogging up A&E. There are also problems facing social care, with a lack of availability often preventing medically fit people from being discharged. Sir Keir acknowledged there was more to do, saying \"we're not complacent and we know the job isn't done\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the next steps on the Plan for Change include \"opening new surgical hubs, community diagnostics centres at evenings and weekends, and using private sector capacity to cut waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks\". He added: \"We have wasted no time in getting to work to cut NHS waiting times and end the agony of millions of patients suffering uncertainty and pain.\"Because we ended the strikes, invested in the NHS, and rolled out reformed ways of working, we are finally putting the NHS on the road to recovery.\" The government has also announced a £40m funding pot for trusts that make the most improvements, which will be available for hospitals from next year to spend on capital projects such repairs to their estates or new tech such as AI scanners. Sir Keir has previously promised more funding for trusts who make the fastest improvements in cutting waiting times but it was not clear how much. More detail on how the funds will be allocated will be set out \"in due course\", the government said."

        "Content": " A Christian cabinet minister has said he doesn't agree with JD Vance's claim that  \"basic liberties of religious Britons\" are under threat. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that the UK and America \"don't have to agree on everything\" after the US vice president gave a speech criticising the UK and Europe. Politics live: Steel tariffs 'negative' for both sides of Atlantic Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday, Mr Vance claimed that \"the backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular, in the crosshairs\". He also claimed that \"in Britain, and across Europe, free speech I fear is in retreat\". Asked for his reaction, Mr Reynolds said: \"We don't have to agree on everything and I think that's one area where we would disagree. \"I speak as a Christian myself. No one is subject to any kind of enforcement from the state for praying in this country.\" In his speech, Mr Vance referred to the conviction of 51-year-old Adam Smith-Connor, who was given a conditional discharge for breaching a safe zone around an abortion clinic in Bournemouth. Safe zones outside abortion clinics are designed to stop anti-abortion campaigners from leafleting, holding vigils, or showing graphic images to people near the sites. Proponents of the zones say women using a clinic can feel intimidated and distressed by the presence of someone standing in the area praying, even if they are not speaking - but critics argue the rule undermines the right to freedom of religion and free speech. Mr Reynolds said that having an abortion \"free of intimidation or harassment\" is \"an important British value\". His comments struck a different tone to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who told the Sunday Telegraph free speech is \"under threat\" because the law has \"overreached\" while policing people's opinions. She did not directly address the safe zone remarks but more generally said that she \"hates cancel culture\".  Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel gave a similar response when asked about Mr Vance's speech, saying that when she was home secretary she had to \"effectively battle many of these free speech issues\", citing campuses on universities \"silencing various groups and individuals and organisations\". Asked if she agreed with what Mr Vance said, she told Trevor Phillips: \"I agree with the fact that many [countries] have a challenge. There's always more that we must do to defend free speech.\" 'Too early to talk about NATO divisions' Mr Vance's speech reflects a divergence between the UK and US on certain areas - particularly Europe and defence. However ministers are also trying to stay on the good side of President Donald Trump as he threatens a global tariff war.  Speaking to Trevor Phillips, Mr Reynolds sought to play down divisions with the US over the future of Ukraine. Read More:Trump says he and Starmer will meet 'very soon'Ukraine still on 'irreversible path to joining NATO' Starmer says Mr Trump has said he doesn't see any way \"that a country in Russia's position\" could allow Ukraine to join NATO, something the UK supports and Ukraine itself wants. US officials have headed to Saudi Arabia for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine which Europe is not part of - prompting French President Emmanual Macron to hold crisis talks with European leaders which Sir Keir is expected to attend.  Mr Reynolds denied that the UK has parted company with America, saying: \"We all want the war to end.\" \"I think it's too early to start talking about divisions between allies. I really would push back very strongly on that,\" he said. He also claimed the UK could act as the \"bridge between European allies and our US allies\" to help \"strengthen that relationship\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Unlike Theresa May, Sir Keir Starmer will not be the first world leader to set foot in the Trump White House, but he has at least now secured an invitation to Washington. It wasn't issued on the most gracious of terms - with the president telling reporters \"it was his request not mine\" - but the PM will now have the chance to speak with him face to face in the room where it happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. Donald Trump was exceptionally casual about the forthcoming meeting, claiming not to know what the two of them would have to talk about. But Number 10 will be pleased that so far their charm offensive appears to be holding, with the president describing Mr Starmer as \"a nice guy\". Politics latest: UK 'disagrees' with JD Vance's free speech comments That warm personal relationship is going to come under increasing pressure given the growing divergence of UK and US positions on the topics Mr Starmer will certainly want to discuss - Ukraine, the Middle East, trade tariffs and the Chagos deal for starters.  The diplomatic contortions required to keep faith with Ukraine - while continuing to stay on the right side of Mr Trump - are only getting more extreme. The president's 90-minute unilateral phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by the announcement of peace talks, shocked the world. The White House does now seem to have accepted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will need to be at the table, with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy telling reporters that US vice president JD Vance had agreed the Ukrainians will have to be part of any future deal. It's a message the UK has been doing its best to reinforce, with Mr Starmer expressing his \"concrete\" backing for Ukraine in a phone call on Friday and insisting \"there can be no talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine\". In a joint article in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Mr Lammy and John Healey underlined that support, calling \"for us all to continue to unite and show strength\" and arguing that the West has previously done \"too little\" to counter Russian aggression.  Read more:Trump administration trying to un-fire nuclear safety workersTrump says he and Starmer will meet 'very soon' The foreign and defence secretaries also wanted to demonstrate they have been listening to the US's arguments about defence spending, insisting \"we have been clear that Europe and the UK must do more together to share the burden of our continent's security\". Despite this claim, we're still waiting for the government to set out when they will meet their commitment to increase defence spending from 2.3 to 2.5% of GDP. Going further than that - given the chancellor's existing difficulties in balancing the budget while sticking to her fiscal rules - looks incredibly remote, despite Mr Trump's calls for a 5% target.  It also seems unlikely that that promise of shouldering the burden to defend Europe will go as far as establishing an \"army of Europe\" as proposed by Mr Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. We've heard plenty of discussion about that idea for many years, and the UK has always been opposed. But it's also true that Mr Starmer has pledged the UK would \"play its full part\" in any peacekeeping operation in Ukraine in the future. How extensively the PM would be prepared to commit to this will surely be another sticking point with the Americans. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Another open disagreement is over the accession of Ukraine to NATO. On Friday, Mr Starmer reiterated the UK's commitment to Ukraine being on an \"irreversible path to NATO as agreed by allies at the Washington Summit last year\". The Americans have described this as \"unrealistic\" but in his speech on Saturday Mr Zelenskyy continued to insist it must remain on the table as \"the core of any security guarantees for Ukraine\". Mr Starmer will be hoping the special relationship will help give weight to his arguments when he heads to the White House later this month. But it's not the only area of negotiation which requires delicate handling, given the threat of trade tariffs which could cost the UK economy £24bn. Can the PM's staunch position on Ukraine survive - let alone prevail - when he needs to go in to bat for the UK on so many other fronts?"

Based on Robert Harris's 2016 novel of the same name, and centred around the selection of a new pope, the movie also won best adapted screenplay and best editing. Thanking his ensemble cast as he accepted the award, director Edward Berger said: \"What you did to me on set when I watched you was pure magic, it was beyond my grasp or understanding.\" It's not the first BAFTA success for the German filmmaker, who swept the board two years ago with his remake of All Quiet On The Western Front, taking seven prizes. Conclave is his first English-language film. BAFTA Awards 2025: The full list of winners Despite being the most nominated movie of the night, Conclave did not take any acting prizes, with its star Ralph Fiennes losing out to The Brutalist lead Adrien Brody in the hotly contested best actor category. Brody's portrayal of Hungarian architect Lazlo Toth saw the 51-year-old actor bag his first BAFTA statuette. \n                  BAFTA Awards 2025: The full list of winners\n                 \n                  Demi Moore 'took many risks' - director Coralie Fargeat on making The Substance\n                 \n                  BAFTA red carpet 2025: All the best looks from the nominees and guests\n                 New York-born Brody said the gong was \"incredibly meaningful\", adding: \"England has felt quite a bit like home lately.\" The three-and-a-half-hour-long epic, which is largely set in America following World War II, also took best director, best original score and best cinematography. Accepting his director award, Brady Corbet, told the audience that despite being \"humbled\" and \"grateful\" for his win, there really was \"no such thing\" as best director. Conclave and The Brutalist were joint winners across the night, taking four gongs each. Anora, about a Brooklyn sex worker who marries into money, saw its break-out lead star, Mikey Madison take the top prize, after many had forecast a win for Demi Moore. Accepting her award, the 25-year-old actress took her moment on the stage to honour the sex worker community, who she said had helped her immeasurably in her preparation for the role, telling them: \"I see you. You deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally.\" Anora also took the casting prize.  Emilia Perez, which has come under fire in recent weeks following resurfaced tweets from its lead star Karla Sofia Gascon, took best film not in the English language. Gascon was not at the event. An emotional Zoe Saldaña, took best supporting actress for her outstanding performance in the musical - in which she acts, sings and dances - telling the audience her win was \"so validating\" and \"a true honour\". As she accepted her prize the 46-year-old star said: \"I was told not to cry by my children, so I'm going to try. This is so validating because the very few times I tried to go for roles with a British accent I was told this isn't going to happen.\" She ended her emotional speech by saying: \"Films are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds and I hope Emilia Perez did something like this, because voices need to be heard, just not my English accent.\" Saldana, who won in the same category at the Golden Globes last month will be hoping to follow up her success with an Oscar in March. An early front-runner in awards season, mostly Spanish language movie Emilia Perez had already been under fire from parts of the trans community for what some considered to be a retrograde step in representation, as well as those who objected to stereotypical depictions of Mexicans, as well as its handling of the sensitive topic of narcotics crime, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Going into the night with 11 nominations, it took two overall. Kieran Culkin, 42, won best supporting actor for his role in comedy A Real Pain, with his co-star and the film's writer Jesse Eisenberg accepting the gong on his behalf due to a member of Culkin's family being unwell, meaning he stayed in New York to be by their side. The movie, about two cousins revisiting their family history in Poland, also took best original screenplay. Body horror The Substance took a well-deserved win for best makeup and hair, despite Moore missing out on the best actress win. Back to host for a second year running, Scottish actor David Tennant opened the show singing The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), before encouraging members of the starry audience to get involved.  With 42 gongs to hand out, from a host of well-known presenters, the first award of the night went to Dune: Part Two which took special visual effects. It also won best sound. Elsewhere, Wallace And Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl bagged best children's and family film as well a best animated feature. Accepting his second prize, Aardman director Nick Park joked: \"I didn't actually write a second speech.\" Republican Irish-language band Kneecap lived up to their promise, giving it plenty of attitude on the red carpet, and with the film's director Rich Peppiatt taking outstanding debut. The music biopic about Mo Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai (who wore his trademark balaclava in the colours of the Irish flag) had been up for six BAFTAs, despite failing to make it onto the Oscars shortlist last month. While it was up for seven awards, BAFTA voters didn't seem to be feeling too much of the Wicked magic, with the Wizard Of Oz prequel taking just two prizes - best production design and best costume design. Despite being up for six awards, A Complete Unknown, went home empty-handed. Lack of gongs aside, the movie's star Timothée Chalamet still managed to cause plenty of buzz on the night, thanks to the fact he was accompanied to the ceremony with his girlfriend Kylie Jenner - part of the ubiquitous Kardashian clan.  In a pre-announced win, British star Warwick Davis, best known for fantasy film Willow and the Harry Potter movies, was awarded the prestigious BAFTA film fellowship for both his performing and advocacy work. The In Memoriam section of the night was led by Wicked star Jeff Goldblum playing As Time Goes By on the piano as late stars including Dame Maggie Smith, David Lynch and Dame Joan Plowright were honoured. MediCinema was awarded the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema award, and Alien Romulus actor David Jonsson won the only publicly voted award of the night, the rising star, which celebrates up-and-coming talent. And in a balloon-filled performance, Take That's current line up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen performed their 2008 hit Greatest Day, a track which has been given a new lease of life thanks to its prominence in Anora."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Tears, laughter and some Take That fangirling from a best actress nominee - this year's BAFTA Film Awards had it all. Conclave and The Brutalist were the night's big winners, taking home four awards each - including best picture and outstanding British film for Conclave, and best actor for The Brutalist star Adrien Brody and directing award for its filmmaker, Brady Corbet. But as always with these big entertainment awards ceremonies, there were plenty of moments to remember outside the big prizes. Here are our BAFTA 2025 key talking points. The return of Tennant Hosts can make or break an awards ceremony, so when you get a good 'un you want to keep them. After a successful stint in 2024, Doctor Who and Rivals star David Tennant was back to take the helm once again. This time round, the Scottish actor, sporting a kilt and sporran at first, kicked things off by calling on the \"BAFTA gods\" - acting legends Dame Helen Mirren, Jim Broadbent and Brian Cox, naturally - before a sketch performance of The Proclaimers' hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles). Of course, this needed some audience participation - including from US stars Camila Cabello, Colman Domingo and Anna Kendrick, who probably didn't have a clue what was going on but joined in with gusto. Tennant joked about actors \"freshening up\" while they age, after referencing that Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa took on his role in the BBC series, as well as the length of films such as The Brutalist (three-and-a-half hours). \"Who doesn't like a chance to have a wee halfway through?\" he asked, while talking about the film's much-needed intermission. Emilia Perez awards despite controversy - and Saldana's speech It went into awards season as one of the favourites, but Emilia Perez has been surrounded by controversy in recent weeks. As stars Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez enjoyed the show, leading actress Karla Sofia Gascon was notably absent from the ceremony following the resurgence of offensive tweets, and the film has also come under fire for its portrayal of Mexico and of trans people. Despite this, it picked up the BAFTAs for best film not in the English language and best supporting actress for Saldana. Earlier this month, director Jacques Audiard said Gascon's tweets were \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"very sad\" to see the issue \"taking up all the space\" around the film. However, collecting the BAFTA for best film not in the English language, the French filmmaker namechecked all his stars, including Gascon - and blew her a kiss through his translator. \"I'm deeply proud of what we have all achieved together - long live Emilia Perez,\" he said. Read more:The full list of winnersThe BAFTA red carpet in pictures In her speech, an emotional Saldana said the film defied categorisation and also paid tribute to her co-stars, before realising she was taking too long and being given a countdown. \"F***, f***, f***\", she panicked, before continuing with her speech anyway. Thanking her mother for \"being such a selfless person\", she broke down in tears, and added: \"Films are supposed to change hearts and challenge minds and I hope Emilia Perez did something like this, because voices need to be heard.\" Kylie Jenner sneaks in  We didn't see her on the red carpet, but sneaky old Kylie Jenner, girlfriend of Timothee Chalamet, was most definitely in attendance to show her support. The Kardashians star was in the audience next to Chalamet, who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. During a break from awards announcements, Tennant spent time joking with some of the A-listers in the crowd, and the couple didn't escape from his mic (or the cameras), despite their efforts to keep their appearance lowkey. Referencing the Chalamet lookalike competition that made headlines in New York last year, Tennant joked about what a good likeness the \"second place\" doppelganger before him was - and how nice it was to have a Jenner lookalike, too. Take That perform - and Saoirse Ronan fangirls If you've seen Anora, you'll know the filmmakers behind it are fans of Take That, specifically the 2008 hit Greatest Day. The band, now a trio of Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, performed the hit remix used in the film on stage at the ceremony. As host Tennant made his way through the crowd afterwards, he came across best actress nominee Saoirse Ronan and her husband Jack Lowden. Is Ronan a Take That fan? \"I've seen you twice,\" she shouted at the boys as they made their way off stage. That's a yes, then. Kieran Culkin couldn't attend - so Jesse Eisenberg stepped up Following best supporting actor wins at earlier ceremonies including the Golden Globes, Kieran Culkin has been a favourite when it comes to speeches this awards season. It was no surprise to see him honoured at the BAFTAs, but as he sadly couldn't attend the ceremony in person, his co-star and director Jesse Eisenberg stepped up - not only collecting the award on his behalf but also delivering the laughs, too. In A Real Pain, the pair play two very different cousins on a trip exploring their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland. The BAFTA was \"like the fifth\" award Eisenberg has picked up for Culkin, he told the audience. \"We have a similar life, but his is 20% better than mine,\" he added. Accepting the award for best original screenplay, Eisenberg also joked that his wife had not attended the ceremony as she did not think he would win. Breakthrough star pays tribute to sex workers After gaining a lot of support throughout the awards ceremony, Demi Moore was a favourite for a prize for her performance in The Substance. However, Mikey Madison had also gained momentum in recent weeks thanks to her breakout role as a young sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch in Anora. This one is a particularly exciting win as Madison, 25, was also up for the rising star award for up-and-coming talent. Being nominated in a major category in the same year is quite a feat in itself - winning it even more so. On stage, Madison thanked her mother for driving her \"to so many auditions\", as well as her fellow castmates. She also paid tribute to the sex worker community, after working with many women in the industry to perfect her performance. \"I want to take a second to recognise the sex worker community,\" Madison said. \"You deserve respect and decency, and I... (urge) others to do the same... I will always be a friend and an ally.\" Kneecap: 'It's a movement' Irish-language film Kneecap, a semi-autobiographical story starring a trio of rappers of the same name from Belfast, picked up the award for outstanding debut for a British filmmaker. Band member JJ O Dochartaigh always wears a balaclava featuring the Irish flag - but for the BAFTAs he went all out, matching his suit. The award went to director and writer Rich Peppiatt, who collected the prize on stage. \"Within two weeks of moving to Belfast I met Kneecap and now I'm standing here,\" he told the audience, saying his movie was \"more than a film, it's a movement - about how everyone should have their language respected, their culture respected, their homeland respected. \"This award is dedicated to everyone out there fighting that fight.\" British success and a new collab? Here's a look backstage at US singer-songwriter Camila Cabello and the Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl filmmakers Nick Park, left, and Merlin Crossingham. The pair picked up the prize for best children's and family film, becoming the first ever recipients of the award, which was presented by Cabello. We're hoping this could be the start of a new partnership. Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl also took home the animated film trophy, with Park joking on stage: \"I didn't actually write a second speech.\" And there was more recognition for British technical creatives in other categories, too. Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales picked up the award for best production design, for their incredible visual work on the blockbuster smash Wicked. Paul Lambert was on the team awarded the BAFTA for best visual effects, for his work on the science fiction blockbuster Dune: Part Two - which also won best sound, with a winning team including British mixer and engineer Gareth John. Warwick Davis's emotional speech Honoured with the prestigious BAFTA fellowship award, Warwick Davis dedicated the prize to his late wife Samantha, who died in March last year. Davis, who is known for fantasy film Willow and the Harry Potter movies, received the organisation's highest honour for his performing and advocacy work. \"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me - and I've been in Star Wars,\" he joked at the start of his speech, before getting emotional as he talked about his wife and referenced his children, Annabelle and Harrison, who were in the audience. \"Thank you to the support of our wonderful children, I've been able to keep engaging in life,\" he said. Davis was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare bone disorder that results in dwarfism. Previous recipients of the fellowship include Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Stanley Kubrick, Billy Wilder, Ken Loach, Sir Michael Caine, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Lord Laurence Olivier and Dame Judi Dench. Look out for David Jonsson British actor David Jonsson was named this year's BAFTA rising star - the only award voted for by the public. The 31-year-old recently starred in the film Alien: Romulus and his credits also include TV series Industry as well as the 2023 romantic comedy Rye Lane. \"I've got to be honest, this isn't why I do it,\" he told the BAFTA audience in his speech. \"Do you know what I mean? I'm just an east London boy. \"I didn't really see a space for me in this industry. But this award is about people and as long as we can keep telling stories about people I think there's got to be a space for me.\" Jonsson saw off competition from his fellow Industry and Back To Black star Marisa Abela, American actor Jharrel Jerome, Anora's Madison and Informer star Nabhaan Rizwan. Previous winners include Kristen Stewart, Daniel Kaluuya, John Boyega and Tom Hardy, all before they became big names in the industry. Sing Sing stars visas denied, filmmakers say This wasn't a moment from the ceremony, but on the red carpet ahead of the awards the filmmakers behind Sing Sing, which tells the true story of a group of men who take part in an arts rehabilitation project at a maximum security prison, spoke to Sky News on the red carpet. While Colman Domingo, an established Hollywood star who was nominated for best actor, was able to attend the ceremony, the real-life person he portrayed in the film, Divine G Whitfield, was not - and neither was his co-star Clarence Maclin. Maclin is a former inmate who played himself in the film, after being rehabilitated through the programme, and was nominated for best supporting actor. Both were denied denied entry to the UK earlier this week due to their previous convictions, filmmakers Greg Kwedar and Clint Bentley said. \"Their visas were denied to enter the country because they have served prison time, which goes against the grain of everything this movie stands for,\" Kwedar told us. \"It shows that people have the capacity to grow and to come back into their communities when they leave prison. \"These two particular men have such courage, vulnerability, integrity - and they're not here tonight and they should be. The story is about them, it was built with them.\""

The singer's next show in Lima is booked for Monday after starting her tour in Brazil last week. Her tour is in support of her Grammy-winning album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, centred around her highly-publicised split from Spanish footballer Gerard Piqué.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        It's the bloody body horror that has made audiences squirm in their seats - and is now making waves throughout awards season. Demi Moore has already won a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice award for her performance as fading star Elisabeth Sparkle in The Substance - and we'll find out later on if she gets to add a BAFTA to that list. The film sees the '90s icon playing an Oscar winner turned fitness guru struggling to accept she has been unceremoniously dropped from her TV show because she's too old. She signs up for a secret new medical procedure to create a younger version of herself - without fully understanding what the consequences might be. Moore stars alongside Margaret Qualley, who plays her younger version. The impact of creating this other \"self\" - called Sue - on her own body is pretty gruesome. Director Coralie Fargeat insists her visceral story is more allegory than gory, reflecting the daily violence and sexism women experience throughout life. \"The story was really for me expressing what a life of a woman in our society is in a very genuine way, which is the violence that I think it's at every level and stage... since we were little girls,\" she tells Sky News. \"There are so many pressures that make you feel that if you are not the perfect fantasy or ideal then you don't deserve to exist. That you have to cut this, hide that, keep it inside, and it is a huge jail that we've been raised with and it generates so much violence.\" A few years ago, The Substance might not have been considered traditional awards season fare. But horrors are having a moment, with Heretic and Nosferatu in the running at several ceremonies this year. And the theme of The Substance, a reflection of the harsh realities of ageing for women, especially in Hollywood, is resonating. The 'popcorn' speech On stage at the Globes, Moore, 62, gave an emotional speech about winning her first major award after 45 years in the business, despite starring in dozens of hit films including Ghost, A Few Good Men and Indecent Proposal. The irony was not lost. \"Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a 'popcorn' actress and at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have, that I could do movies that were successful, that made a lot of money, but that I couldn't be acknowledged,\" she says. \"I bought in, and I believed that, and that corroded me over time, to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it, maybe I was complete. I've done what I was supposed to do. \"And as I was at kind of a low point, I had this magical, bold, courageous, out-of-the-box, absolutely bonkers script come across my desk called The Substance, and the universe told me that you're not done.\" Moore thanked French filmmaker Fargeat along with her team, and said the film was a reminder \"that I do belong\". Now, The Substance is nominated for five BAFTAs and five Oscars. Fargeat says she let out \"a huge scream of joy\" when she found out - saying the nods are particularly satisfying after she initially struggled to secure funding for the film. \"The space that [women] have is still to be pretty, to smile, to be gentle, polite, and I really wanted to be the opposite.\" 'She took risks' Fargeat is also BAFTA and Oscar-nominated for best director - but once again, is the only female filmmaker in the running. \"Being the only woman director, I still think it tells a lot of things about all the imbalance, you know, the inequality that there is in society,\" she says. \"There are as many women in film school as there are men... when you look at the difference between film school and where we are now, like [the absence of women making] second and third feature films. The difference is drastic.\" She was told to tone the film down \"a lot\".

Critics have called Moore's performance the best of her career, with many tipping her to win her first-ever BAFTA and Oscar. On awards prediction site Gold Derby, Moore is the favourite to win best actress at the Oscars, with more than half of the experts backing her. For the BAFTAs, they have her tied with Anora's Mikey Madison. \"The truth is that she took many risks,\" Fargeat says of Moore. \"The script arrived to her at a time where she was in the process of getting the control of who she was back, not letting the outside world define her worth, being empowered for herself to decide who she wanted to be - and the next chapter of her life.\""

        "Content": "Lawyers for the man suspected of killing rap icon Tupak Shakur are investigating evidence that could show an alternative cause of death. Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 7 September 1996. Shakur died from his injuries six days later. And Davis's lawyers say they have witness information that Shakur was in stable condition after the shooting. They are consulting medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death. Defence lawyers also want to delay next month's trial, saying more time is needed for investigative work to ensure Davis gets a fair trial. The motion filed on Friday in a Nevada court provides insight into Davis' defence, noting that a private investigator has identified witnesses who can testify that he was not at the scene of the 1996 shooting, nor was he in Las Vegas at the time. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of raping woman over Tupac claims\n                 \n                  Drake ordered to delete diss track featuring AI-generated voice of Tupac Shakur \n                 \n                  Tupac Shakur: Trial delayed for Duane 'Keffe D' Davis, ex-gang leader charged with murder of hip-hop star in 1996\n                 The motion also suggests that someone else may have orchestrated the shooting and that witnesses who could testify on the matter are being interviewed. The defence team said in a statement that the new developments and the need to interview key witnesses necessitate a delay. A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the timing of the trial. \"This case involves decades-old allegations, and with every new piece of evidence, it becomes increasingly clear that critical facts have yet to be fully examined,\" said attorney Carl Arnold. On the night of the shooting, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur's killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest."

Even before the 4 Nations Face-Off match started in Montreal, there were tensions among the crowd of more than 21,000 fans at Bell Centre. Canadian fans showed their displeasure with Team USA, booing during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and as the American players were introduced. Recent remarks from Donald Trump, that Canada should become a US state along with threats of tariffs, have angered many Canadians. Fans across Canada have booed the US anthem at NHL and NBA games since the president's comments. In the end, it was the Americans who came out on top, securing a 3-1 victory over Canada and a spot in the tournament final.

Then Brady Tkachuk, brother of Matthew, and Canada's Sam Bennett, a forward who plays for the Florida Panthers, took aim at each other.
