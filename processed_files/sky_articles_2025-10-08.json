        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Britain is at the lowest risk of a winter power blackout than at any point in the last six years, the national electricity grid operator has said. Not since the pre-pandemic winter of 2019-2020 has the risk been so low, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) said. It's thanks to increased battery capacity to store and deploy excess power from the likes of windfarms, and a new subsea electricity cable to Ireland that came on stream in April. The margins between expected demand and supply are now roughly three gas power stations greater than last year, the NESO said.   It also comes as Britain and the world reached new records for green power. For the first time, renewable energy produced more of the world's electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, while in Britain, a record 54.5% of power came from renewables like solar and wind energy in the three months to June. More renewable power can mean lower bills, as there's less reliance on volatile oil and gas markets, which have remained elevated after the invasion of Ukraine and the Western attempt to wean off Russian fossil fuels. \"Renewables are lowering wholesale electricity prices by up to a quarter\", said Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank.

Those plants have since been decommissioned. But it may not be all plain sailing… There will, however, be some \"tight\" days, the NESO said. On such occasions, the NESO will tell electricity suppliers to up their output. The times Britain is most likely to experience supply constraints are in early December or mid-January, the grid operator said.  The NESO had been owned by National Grid, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but was acquired by the government for £630m in 2023."

        "Content": " A woman accused of stalking Madeleine McCann's parents shouted: \"Why are you doing this to me?\" and was led away in tears by officers, during her trial. Giving evidence against 24-year-old Julia Wandelt, Mrs McCann said her first contact with the Polish woman happened \"about three years ago\". Wandelt insisted that she was Madeleine, who went missing in Portugal in 2007, while stalking the missing girl's parents by sending emails, calling them and turning up at their address, prosecutors allege. Follow the latest updates from the trial Wandelt is accused of one count of stalking causing serious alarm and distress to Mrs McCann and Gerry McCann between June 2022 and February this year. She denies stalking. She is on trial with 61-year-old Karen Spragg, from Cardiff, who is accused of the same offence and also denies the offence. Speaking from behind a blue curtain screening her from the dock at Leicester Crown Court, Mrs McCann spoke about the defendants visiting her home address in Leicestershire on 7 December last year. \n                  Trial latest: 'You're not Madeleine,' Gerry McCann told 'stalker' - as court hears recording of confrontation\n                 \n                  Woman who claimed to be Madeleine McCann pretended to be two other missing girls, court hears\n                 \n                  Christian B: Freed Madeleine McCann suspect pleads 'give me back my life' as he tries to confront prosecutor\n                 Mrs McCann told the court that Wandelt had been \"pleading\" with her, asking why she wouldn't agree to do a DNA test. Spragg, who accompanied Wandelt, was \"slightly more aggressive\", asking her whether she didn't want to find her daughter, Mrs McCann added. \"I told them to leave. I told them I was distressed,\" she told the court. Asked how the incident had made her feel, Mrs McCann added: \"I felt quite distressed to be honest. I think I had been on edge anyway because of the recent communications from her.\" After Mrs McCann had given her first round of evidence, Wandelt was led away from the dock after sobbing loudly and shouting: \"Why are you doing this to me?\". Mrs McCann told the jury that Wandelt had been \"incessant\" with her messages, which left her with a \"little niggle\" about doing a DNA test. She said part of her brain was \"saying 'what if'\" because of Wandelt's frequent messages, but added: \"Having seen a photo of her, she's Polish … it doesn't make sense.\" \"I can't say what Madeleine looks like now, but if I saw a photo of her, I would recognise her,\" she said. But she added that the \"persistance\" of Wandelt's behaviour started to \"get to\" her, making her \"almost [want] a DNA test to put it to bed\".

Gerry McCann told the court he answered the phone to Julia Wandelt on one of the many occasions that she tried to call Kate. He said he told Wandelt: \"You're not Madeleine.\" He said: \"I made it very clear these were unwanted calls. To be honest, it was a bit of a blur.\" The trial continues."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There's no question that Kemi Badenoch's on the ropes after a low-energy first year as leader that has seen the Conservative Party slide backwards by pretty much every metric. But on Wednesday, the embattled leader came out swinging with a show-stopping pledge to scrap stamp duty, which left the hall delirious. \"I thought you'd like that one,\" she said with a laugh as party members cheered her on. A genuine surprise announcement - many in the shadow cabinet weren't even told - it gave the Conservatives and their leader a much-needed lift after what many have dubbed the lost year. Politics latest: Stamp duty to be axed under Tories Ms Badenoch tried to answer that criticism this week with a policy blitz, headlined by her promise on stamp duty. This is a leader giving her party some red meat to try to help her party at least get a hearing from the public, with pledges on welfare, immigration, tax cuts and policing. In all of it, a tacit admission from Ms Badenoch and her team that as politics speeds up, they have not kept pace, letting Reform UK and Nigel Farage run ahead of them and grab the microphone by getting ahead of the Conservatives on scrapping net zero targets or leaving the ECHR in order to deport illegal migrants more easily. Ms Badenoch is now trying to answer those criticisms and act. At the heart of her offer is £47bn of spending cuts in order to pay down the nation's debt pile and fund tax cuts such as stamp duty. All of it is designed to try to restore the party's reputation for economic competence, against a Labour Party of tax rises and a growing debt burden and a Reform party peddling \"fantasy economics\". She needs to do something, and fast. A YouGov poll released on the eve of her speech put the Conservatives joint third in the polls with the Lib Dems on 17%. That's 10 percentage points lower than when Ms Badenoch took power just under a year ago. The crisis, mutter her colleagues, is existential. One shadow cabinet minister lamented to me this week that they thought it was \"50-50\" as to whether the party can survive. Read more from Sky News:Starmer blames Tories for China spy trial being droppedUK won't give more visas to Indian workers, says PM Ms Badenoch had to do two things in her speech on Wednesday: the first was to try to reassert her authority over her party. The second was to get a bit of attention from the public with a set of policies that might encourage disaffected Tories to look at her party again. On the first point, even her critics would have to agree that she had a successful conference and has given herself a bit of space from the constant chatter about her leadership with a headline-grabbing policy that could give her party some much-needed momentum. On the second, the promise of spending control coupled with a retail offer of tax cuts does carve out a space against the Labour government and Reform. But the memory of Liz Truss's disastrous mini-Budget, the chaos of Boris Johnson's premiership, and the failure of Sunak to cut NHS waiting lists or tackle immigration still weigh on the Conservative brand. Ms Badenoch might have revived the room with her speech, but whether that translates into a wider revival around the country is very hard to read. Ms Badenoch leaves Manchester knowing she pulled off her first conference speech as party leader: what she will be less sure about is whether it will be her last. I thought she tacitly admitted that to me when she pointedly avoided answering the question of whether she would resign if the party goes backwards further in the English council, Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd elections next year. \"Let's see what the election result is about,\" was her reply. That is what many in her party are saying too, because if Ms Badenoch cannot show progress after 18 months in office, she might see her party turn to someone else."

        "Content": " The Manchester synagogue terrorist made a call to police during the attack where he pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State, police say. Jihad al Shamie, 35, carried out the attack last Thursday as he tried to get inside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. In a statement, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said that minutes after the first call was made during the attack, al Shamie called 999 himself.  The force said that during the call, he claimed responsibility for the attack and \"pledged allegiance to Islamic State\". Two people were killed during the car and knife attack, while al Shamie was shot dead by police at the scene. Three other people remain in hospital.  Adrian Daulby, 53, is believed to have been shot dead by police while attempting to prevent al Shamie entering the synagogue. He was killed together with Melvin Cravitz, 66, from Crumpsall, a worshipper who helped prevent the attacker from getting into the premises. No misconduct was found to be apparent in the police response, which Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson welcomed. He said: \"I welcome this continued support and acknowledge the fact that the IOPC have today confirmed their finding that no misconduct is apparent in the actions required of our officers in bringing this dreadful attack to an end.\"  Four arrested will be 'released without charge' Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said that since the attack, counter-terror police have arrested and interviewed six people. He said two were released without charge over the weekend, and the remaining four were released without charge on Wednesday, before adding \"this does not mean our investigation has concluded\". ACC Potts then said that eyewitnesses reported that al Shamie was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security. Around 15 minutes later, he returned in a vehicle and deliberately drove at members of the public.  Al Shamie never referred to Prevent, police say The police officer added that al Shamie had a second knife on him during the attack, and was wearing a hoax explosive device. ACC Potts also said al Shamie had never been referred to the anti-terrorism Prevent programme, and was not otherwise known to counter-terror police. \"At this stage of our investigation,\" he added, \"we are more confident that he was influenced by extreme Islamist ideology,\" before noting that the 999 call \"forms part of this assessment\".

The investigation is continuing at pace.\" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said it has informed the three Greater Manchester Police officers who fired their weapons while responding to the attack that they are being treated as witnesses to the investigation. It added that it received a further referral from the force in relation to prior contact with Al Shamie since December 2024, when an allegation of rape was made against him."

        "Content": "A man has been arrested in connection with a deadly wildfire that destroyed much of the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood in Los Angeles, California. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, was detained for allegedly starting a fire on New Year's Day that burned down much of the wealthy coastal area a week later, acting US attorney Bill Essayli said. The blaze, which erupted on 7 January amid high winds, killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,000 homes and buildings in the Pacific Palisades. It burned down mansions with views of the ocean and central Los Angeles.  Rinderknecht allegedly started the fire after finishing his shift as an Uber driver on 31 December 2024. He fled the scene of the original fire, but returned to the same trail where he had been earlier to watch it burn, according to Mr Essayli. \"He left as soon as he saw the fire trucks were headed to the location. He turned around and went back up there. And he took some video and, and watched them fight the fire,\" Mr Essayli said Rinderknecht made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. During an interview with investigators on 24 January, Rinderknecht spoke of where the fire began - information that was not yet public and he would not have known if he hadn't witnessed it, the complaint said. The suspect was visibly nervous during the interview, according to the complaint. His efforts to call 911 and a question to ChatGPT about a cigarette lighting a fire indicated he \"wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire\", the complaint added. Investigators determined the fire was intentionally lit, likely by a lighter used on vegetation or paper, according to the criminal complaint. Authorities found a \"barbecue-style\" lighter inside the glove compartment of his car. Read more:'It's an apocalypse' - families return to homes reduced to ruinsScale of 'most destructive' blazes in modern US history revealed  Rinderknecht also lied about his location when the fire began, claiming he was near the bottom of the hiking trail, Mr Essayli said. The fire was put out initially, but it continued to smoulder underground before reigniting during high winds a week later, Mr Essayli added. Rinderknecht was arrested in Florida on Tuesday and will appear in court in the state on Wednesday. He faces between five and 20 years in prison if convicted, according to the US Attorney's Office. \"While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" Mr Essayli said. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said: \"More than nine months ago, our city faced one of the most devastating periods our region had ever seen. Lives were tragically lost. Thousands of homes were destroyed. \"Our heroic firefighters fought the blaze valiantly with no rest. Each day that families are displaced is a day too long and as we are working tirelessly to bring Angelenos home, we are also working towards closure and towards justice - and today is a step forward in that process.\" Investigators are still to determine the cause of the Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day in the community of Altadena and killed 18 people."

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n Stephen Lawrence's mother has branded one of his killers a \"coward\" and a \"liar\" after he admitted his role in her son's murder - but refused to reveal who else was involved.  David Norris, 49, spoke publicly at a parole board hearing for the first time on Tuesday about the racist attack on the 18-year-old, who was stabbed to death by a group of up to six youths in Eltham, southeast London, on 22 April 1993. He said he was \"deeply sorry\" after he punched Stephen on the back of his head while he was crouched on the ground on his knees. Norris, who was 16 at the time, said he could name the rest of the gang, including the member he saw holding a 22cm-long knife after the murder, but feared for his family's safety. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years and three months in January 2012, more than 18 years later, after he was found guilty of murder alongside Gary Dobson at the Old Bailey. The other suspects in the case - brothers Jamie and Neil Acourt, who were later jailed for unrelated drug offences, Luke Knight, and Matthew White, who died in 2021, have never been convicted. The Acourt brothers and Knight have denied being involved in the attack on Stephen Lawrence, while White was named as a suspect after his death. \n                  David Norris, one of Stephen Lawrence's killers, begs for family's forgiveness as he tells of role in murder\n                 \n                  Stephen Lawrence killer David Norris 'admits role in attack', says Parole Board\n                 \n                  Stephen Lawrence murder suspect Jamie Acourt jailed over serious crime order breach\n                 Norris is making his first bid for freedom at a parole board hearing live-streamed from his prison to the Royal Courts of Justice, where he can only be seen on camera from behind. Speaking outside court after watching two days of evidence, Stephen's mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence, 72, said the \"police now have no excuse not to act\". \"He says he's sorry for the pain he caused me and my family. I don't believe him,\" she said. \"The only person he is sorry for is himself. As far as I'm concerned, he is a coward. \"He refused to show his face. He needs to look me in the eye and tell me exactly what he did and why he did it.\" Norris, a Category B prisoner, said he was no longer the \"16-year-old horrible violent racist\" and told Stephen's family \"I'm so sorry and please forgive me\". But the hearing was told Norris has used racist language, including calling a female prison officer the N-word in October 2022, and was involved in \"grooming\" a vulnerable young prisoner to join the English Defence League the following year. Baroness Lawrence said it had been \"painful\" to listen to Norris's application for release and it is \"crystal clear he is not safe to be released\". \"He is a danger to the public and a danger to people like me. He was a violent racist and is still a violent racist. He has not changed,\" she said. She said it was \"numbing and incredibly frustrating\" to hear Norris describe her son's murder \"but he is not telling the truth\" and \"trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes\". \"He was and remains a liar. Only if he tells the truth can anyone, including me, start to think he is truly sorry,\" she said. \"The parole board should not fall for his lies and deception\". Baroness Lawrence said it was \"deeply shocking\" the police and authorities have known for years Norris admitted his involvement in her son's murder after he said he first confessed to a Catholic priest in 2018. The Metropolitan Police closed its investigation in 2020 but the College of Policing has since launched a review. \"The police stopped investigating Stephen's murder five years ago and have done nothing since, despite everything that has been revealed in that time,\" she said. \"The police must now urgently investigate. This person can name the other killers and says he would love to do so. The police must do everything in their power to obtain that evidence and bring all of Stephen's murderers to justice. \"The man owes me the truth and the Met owe me justice.\" Norris's parole board hearing will continue on Friday in private, with a decision on whether he should be kept in prison, released, or moved to an open prison expected 14 days later. Deputy assistant commissioner Matt Ward said: \"Officers have been closely monitoring David Norris' parole hearing and we remain committed to achieving the arrest, prosecution and conviction of all of those responsible for Stephen's murder. We have commissioned the College of Policing to conduct a review of the investigations since October 2013 into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\"The review is being conducted independently of the Metropolitan Police and we give it our full backing and support. The review is being led by an experienced investigator working for the College and will focus on identifying any outstanding lines of enquiry which could reasonably lead to a suspect being brought to justice.\""

        "Content": " A trekker has told Sky News of how he escaped the worst of a snowstorm near Everest that left hundreds of people stranded. Speaking on The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee, Rob Mason described seeing a body brought down from the world's highest mountain after he and his friends completed a charity trek to the base camp. Mr Mason, from Jersey, said he and his six friends were caught in the blizzard that left at least one person dead and many others trapped near the eastern face of the peak in Tibet. Hundreds of hikers were stuck by unseasonal deep snow over the weekend after an unusually powerful blizzard dumped heavy snowfall in the Himalayas. Mr Mason said they were heading down the mountain on the Nepal side when rain and thunderstorms hit, and \"went on for about 18 hours\". He told Sarah-Jane Mee that a \"substantial amount of rain fell as heavy snow higher up, de-stabilising the area and trapping those who were higher up the mountain\". A path that his group was following down on the lower slopes was taken away by a landslide just 12 hours after they used it, he said. \n                  Stranded Mount Everest hikers being evacuated\n                 \n                  Race to rescue hundreds stranded on Mount Everest\n                 \n                  Mount Everest suffers traffic jams as climbers battle harsh weather - with beginners not helping\n                 His party was one of the last groups to get past before it was washed away, after which, \"it became impassable, so alternative, higher, routes had to be taken\". His trek ended in the town of Lukla, in the province of Koshi in northeastern Nepal, he said. Whilst \"grounded\" there, \"we were hearing stories coming down the mountain of about other groups being airlifted where they could be or others being locked down in their tea houses to wait it out until conditions improved. \"While we were at Lukla helipad, we saw the recovery of a body of somebody who'd been taken ill on the mountain and, sadly, the emergency services weren't able to get to them in time.\" The trek to Everest was organised to raise money for Kezia's Fund, a charity established in memory of Mr Mason's daughter, \"our beautiful Kezia\", as he described her, who took her own life three years ago. When they reached the base camp, they left a green heart, a symbol of remembrance for Kezia, on one of the prayer flags at the site in her memory. Mr Mason admitted he found the hike \"a huge personal challenge\" as, he said, he's \"not really built for endurance things\" and said they enjoyed enormous luck, especially with timing. \"We had amazingly good weather for our trek up, but it changed so quickly. Our base camp day, we had about three inches of snow. We were fairly comfortable getting down until the last couple of days but then it really hit hard and it really hit fast. \"And we were passing many people on the trail who were just on their way up, so they were heading into this storm as we'd just come out of it. \"The vast majority of people who were trapped were on the Tibetan side. We were on the Nepalese side. \"But one of the first things we heard - we were trying to get out at that point - the Nepalese government had instructed all helicopters were for search and rescue missions only. That was when stories started to filter down the mountain about how severe it was where we'd been just 48 hours earlier.\" A total of 580 trekkers along with more than 300 guides, yak herders and other support staff were taken off the mountain, the official Chinese Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday, in one of the largest search-and-rescue operations in the region.

        "Content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first billionaire footballer, according to a report. The Al Nassr and Portugal striker's net worth has been estimated at $1.4bn (£1.04bn) by the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The valuation puts Ronaldo among a small group of billionaire athletes including basketball greats Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, as well as golfer Tiger Woods and tennis player Roger Federer. Bloomberg said that between 2002, when he started his career at the Portuguese team Sporting CP, to 2023, Ronaldo earned more than $550m (£410.4m) in salary. That was supplemented with a decade-long sponsorship by Nike, worth close to $18m (£13.4m) per year, and endorsements from brands like Armani and Castrol, adding more than $175m (£130.6m) to his fortune. After leaving Manchester United by mutual consent, Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr in 2023, and became the highest-paid player in history with a salary of around $237.2m (£177m) - plus bonuses and a reported 15% share in the club Still playing at 40 years old, Ronaldo has just signed a new contract with the Saudi side, reportedly worth more than $400m (£298.5m). \n                  Cristiano Ronaldo hints time at Al Nassr is 'over'\n                 \n                  Pitch invaders keen for Cristiano Ronaldo selfies disrupt Turkey v Portugal Euro 2024 match\n                 \n                  Cristiano Ronaldo tops Forbes list of highest-paid athletes\n                 Read more from Sky News:Trump says Democrat politicians should be jailedDaughter suspected in attack on German mayor - police With the World Cup next year, Ronaldo shows no sign of hanging up his boots, telling the Portugal Football Globes gala on Tuesday: \"I still have a passion for this. \"My family says it's time to quit and they ask me why I want to score 1,000 goals if I've already scored 900-something.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Britain is at the lowest risk of a winter power blackout than at any point in the last six years, the national electricity grid operator has said. Not since the pre-pandemic winter of 2019-2020 has the risk been so low, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) said. It's thanks to increased battery capacity to store and deploy excess power from the likes of windfarms, and a new subsea electricity cable to Ireland that came on stream in April. The margins between expected demand and supply are now roughly three gas power stations greater than last year, the NESO said.   It also comes as Britain and the world reached new records for green power. For the first time, renewable energy produced more of the world's electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, while in Britain, a record 54.5% of power came from renewables like solar and wind energy in the three months to June. More renewable power can mean lower bills, as there's less reliance on volatile oil and gas markets, which have remained elevated after the invasion of Ukraine and the Western attempt to wean off Russian fossil fuels. \"Renewables are lowering wholesale electricity prices by up to a quarter\", said Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank. Read more:Bank issues warning over AI bubbleGold smashes past $4,000 per ounce In a recent winter, British coal plants were fired up to meet capacity constraints when cold weather increased demand, but still weather conditions meant lower supply, as the wind didn't blow. Those plants have since been decommissioned. But it may not be all plain sailing… There will, however, be some \"tight\" days, the NESO said. On such occasions, the NESO will tell electricity suppliers to up their output. The times Britain is most likely to experience supply constraints are in early December or mid-January, the grid operator said.  The NESO had been owned by National Grid, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but was acquired by the government for £630m in 2023."

Giving evidence against 24-year-old Julia Wandelt, Mrs McCann said her first contact with the Polish woman happened \"about three years ago\". Wandelt insisted that she was Madeleine, who went missing in Portugal in 2007, while stalking the missing girl's parents by sending emails, calling them and turning up at their address, prosecutors allege. Follow the latest updates from the trial Wandelt is accused of one count of stalking causing serious alarm and distress to Mrs McCann and Gerry McCann between June 2022 and February this year. She denies stalking. She is on trial with 61-year-old Karen Spragg, from Cardiff, who is accused of the same offence and also denies the offence.

Spragg, who accompanied Wandelt, was \"slightly more aggressive\", asking her whether she didn't want to find her daughter, Mrs McCann added. \"I told them to leave. I told them I was distressed,\" she told the court. Asked how the incident had made her feel, Mrs McCann added: \"I felt quite distressed to be honest. I think I had been on edge anyway because of the recent communications from her.\" After Mrs McCann had given her first round of evidence, Wandelt was led away from the dock after sobbing loudly and shouting: \"Why are you doing this to me?\". Mrs McCann told the jury that Wandelt had been \"incessant\" with her messages, which left her with a \"little niggle\" about doing a DNA test. She said part of her brain was \"saying 'what if'\" because of Wandelt's frequent messages, but added: \"Having seen a photo of her, she's Polish … it doesn't make sense.\" \"I can't say what Madeleine looks like now, but if I saw a photo of her, I would recognise her,\" she said.

Gerry McCann told the court he answered the phone to Julia Wandelt on one of the many occasions that she tried to call Kate. He said he told Wandelt: \"You're not Madeleine.\" He said: \"I made it very clear these were unwanted calls. To be honest, it was a bit of a blur.\" The trial continues."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There's no question that Kemi Badenoch's on the ropes after a low-energy first year as leader that has seen the Conservative Party slide backwards by pretty much every metric. But on Wednesday, the embattled leader came out swinging with a show-stopping pledge to scrap stamp duty, which left the hall delirious. \"I thought you'd like that one,\" she said with a laugh as party members cheered her on. A genuine surprise announcement - many in the shadow cabinet weren't even told - it gave the Conservatives and their leader a much-needed lift after what many have dubbed the lost year. Politics latest: Stamp duty to be axed under Tories Ms Badenoch tried to answer that criticism this week with a policy blitz, headlined by her promise on stamp duty. This is a leader giving her party some red meat to try to help her party at least get a hearing from the public, with pledges on welfare, immigration, tax cuts and policing. In all of it, a tacit admission from Ms Badenoch and her team that as politics speeds up, they have not kept pace, letting Reform UK and Nigel Farage run ahead of them and grab the microphone by getting ahead of the Conservatives on scrapping net zero targets or leaving the ECHR in order to deport illegal migrants more easily. Ms Badenoch is now trying to answer those criticisms and act. At the heart of her offer is £47bn of spending cuts in order to pay down the nation's debt pile and fund tax cuts such as stamp duty. All of it is designed to try to restore the party's reputation for economic competence, against a Labour Party of tax rises and a growing debt burden and a Reform party peddling \"fantasy economics\". She needs to do something, and fast. A YouGov poll released on the eve of her speech put the Conservatives joint third in the polls with the Lib Dems on 17%. That's 10 percentage points lower than when Ms Badenoch took power just under a year ago. The crisis, mutter her colleagues, is existential. One shadow cabinet minister lamented to me this week that they thought it was \"50-50\" as to whether the party can survive. Read more from Sky News:Starmer blames Tories for China spy trial being droppedUK won't give more visas to Indian workers, says PM Ms Badenoch had to do two things in her speech on Wednesday: the first was to try to reassert her authority over her party. The second was to get a bit of attention from the public with a set of policies that might encourage disaffected Tories to look at her party again. On the first point, even her critics would have to agree that she had a successful conference and has given herself a bit of space from the constant chatter about her leadership with a headline-grabbing policy that could give her party some much-needed momentum. On the second, the promise of spending control coupled with a retail offer of tax cuts does carve out a space against the Labour government and Reform. But the memory of Liz Truss's disastrous mini-Budget, the chaos of Boris Johnson's premiership, and the failure of Sunak to cut NHS waiting lists or tackle immigration still weigh on the Conservative brand. Ms Badenoch might have revived the room with her speech, but whether that translates into a wider revival around the country is very hard to read. Ms Badenoch leaves Manchester knowing she pulled off her first conference speech as party leader: what she will be less sure about is whether it will be her last. I thought she tacitly admitted that to me when she pointedly avoided answering the question of whether she would resign if the party goes backwards further in the English council, Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd elections next year. \"Let's see what the election result is about,\" was her reply. That is what many in her party are saying too, because if Ms Badenoch cannot show progress after 18 months in office, she might see her party turn to someone else."

        "Content": " The Manchester synagogue terrorist made a call to police during the attack where he pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State, police say. Jihad al Shamie, 35, carried out the attack last Thursday as he tried to get inside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall. In a statement, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said that minutes after the first call was made during the attack, al Shamie called 999 himself.  The force said that during the call, he claimed responsibility for the attack and \"pledged allegiance to Islamic State\". Two people were killed during the car and knife attack, while al Shamie was shot dead by police at the scene. Three other people remain in hospital.  Adrian Daulby, 53, is believed to have been shot dead by police while attempting to prevent al Shamie entering the synagogue. He was killed together with Melvin Cravitz, 66, from Crumpsall, a worshipper who helped prevent the attacker from getting into the premises. No misconduct was found to be apparent in the police response, which Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson welcomed. He said: \"I welcome this continued support and acknowledge the fact that the IOPC have today confirmed their finding that no misconduct is apparent in the actions required of our officers in bringing this dreadful attack to an end.\"  Four arrested will be 'released without charge' Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said that since the attack, counter-terror police have arrested and interviewed six people. He said two were released without charge over the weekend, and the remaining four were released without charge on Wednesday, before adding \"this does not mean our investigation has concluded\". ACC Potts then said that eyewitnesses reported that al Shamie was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security. Around 15 minutes later, he returned in a vehicle and deliberately drove at members of the public.  Al Shamie never referred to Prevent, police say The police officer added that al Shamie had a second knife on him during the attack, and was wearing a hoax explosive device. ACC Potts also said al Shamie had never been referred to the anti-terrorism Prevent programme, and was not otherwise known to counter-terror police. \"At this stage of our investigation,\" he added, \"we are more confident that he was influenced by extreme Islamist ideology,\" before noting that the 999 call \"forms part of this assessment\".

The investigation is continuing at pace.\" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said it has informed the three Greater Manchester Police officers who fired their weapons while responding to the attack that they are being treated as witnesses to the investigation. It added that it received a further referral from the force in relation to prior contact with Al Shamie since December 2024, when an allegation of rape was made against him."

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n Stephen Lawrence's mother has branded one of his killers a \"coward\" and a \"liar\" after he admitted his role in her son's murder - but refused to reveal who else was involved.  David Norris, 49, spoke publicly at a parole board hearing for the first time on Tuesday about the racist attack on the 18-year-old, who was stabbed to death by a group of up to six youths in Eltham, southeast London, on 22 April 1993. He said he was \"deeply sorry\" after he punched Stephen on the back of his head while he was crouched on the ground on his knees. Norris, who was 16 at the time, said he could name the rest of the gang, including the member he saw holding a 22cm-long knife after the murder, but feared for his family's safety. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years and three months in January 2012, more than 18 years later, after he was found guilty of murder alongside Gary Dobson at the Old Bailey. The other suspects in the case - brothers Jamie and Neil Acourt, who were later jailed for unrelated drug offences, Luke Knight, and Matthew White, who died in 2021, have never been convicted. The Acourt brothers and Knight have denied being involved in the attack on Stephen Lawrence, while White was named as a suspect after his death. \n                  David Norris, one of Stephen Lawrence's killers, begs for family's forgiveness as he tells of role in murder\n                 \n                  Stephen Lawrence killer David Norris 'admits role in attack', says Parole Board\n                 \n                  Stephen Lawrence murder suspect Jamie Acourt jailed over serious crime order breach\n                 Norris is making his first bid for freedom at a parole board hearing live-streamed from his prison to the Royal Courts of Justice, where he can only be seen on camera from behind. Speaking outside court after watching two days of evidence, Stephen's mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence, 72, said the \"police now have no excuse not to act\". \"He says he's sorry for the pain he caused me and my family. I don't believe him,\" she said. \"The only person he is sorry for is himself. As far as I'm concerned, he is a coward. \"He refused to show his face. He needs to look me in the eye and tell me exactly what he did and why he did it.\" Norris, a Category B prisoner, said he was no longer the \"16-year-old horrible violent racist\" and told Stephen's family \"I'm so sorry and please forgive me\". But the hearing was told Norris has used racist language, including calling a female prison officer the N-word in October 2022, and was involved in \"grooming\" a vulnerable young prisoner to join the English Defence League the following year. Baroness Lawrence said it had been \"painful\" to listen to Norris's application for release and it is \"crystal clear he is not safe to be released\". \"He is a danger to the public and a danger to people like me. He was a violent racist and is still a violent racist. He has not changed,\" she said. She said it was \"numbing and incredibly frustrating\" to hear Norris describe her son's murder \"but he is not telling the truth\" and \"trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes\". \"He was and remains a liar. Only if he tells the truth can anyone, including me, start to think he is truly sorry,\" she said. \"The parole board should not fall for his lies and deception\". Baroness Lawrence said it was \"deeply shocking\" the police and authorities have known for years Norris admitted his involvement in her son's murder after he said he first confessed to a Catholic priest in 2018. The Metropolitan Police closed its investigation in 2020 but the College of Policing has since launched a review. \"The police stopped investigating Stephen's murder five years ago and have done nothing since, despite everything that has been revealed in that time,\" she said. \"The police must now urgently investigate. This person can name the other killers and says he would love to do so. The police must do everything in their power to obtain that evidence and bring all of Stephen's murderers to justice. \"The man owes me the truth and the Met owe me justice.\" Norris's parole board hearing will continue on Friday in private, with a decision on whether he should be kept in prison, released, or moved to an open prison expected 14 days later. Deputy assistant commissioner Matt Ward said: \"Officers have been closely monitoring David Norris' parole hearing and we remain committed to achieving the arrest, prosecution and conviction of all of those responsible for Stephen's murder. We have commissioned the College of Policing to conduct a review of the investigations since October 2013 into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\"The review is being conducted independently of the Metropolitan Police and we give it our full backing and support. The review is being led by an experienced investigator working for the College and will focus on identifying any outstanding lines of enquiry which could reasonably lead to a suspect being brought to justice.\""

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  It is not hard to see why Sir Keir Starmer ends up doing quite so many foreign trips. On the road to Mumbai, India, from the airport there were giant pictures of the British prime minister looming over the sealed-off roads cleared for his special VIP convoy. There was nothing short of a carnival along the roadside to greet the cars. Politics latest: Stamp duty on primary homes to be axed under Tories People who knew nothing about Sir Keir - and were happy to admit so to me - dressed up for the occasion in plumes of feathers and chicken costumes and danced to music. The Labour conference does not come close to that. This trip has a big first - 125 blue chip business leaders, more than any business delegation in history - are here. The enthusiasm to take advantage of the signed, though not completed, free trade deal is clear. \"I think the importance of this trip is reflected by the huge British delegation we've got here today,\" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \n                  Renewable energy produces more electricity than coal for the first time, experts say\n                 \n                  Indian police investigate Vijay's 'overcrowded' political rally as 40 people die\n                 \n                  Vijay rally stampede: At least 36 people killed and dozens injured at campaign event for Indian actor-politician\n                 \"A hundred and twenty five businesses, biggest UK names Beattie, BP, British Airways, Diageo, Virgin, huge businesses all the way through to incredible AI and energy start-ups from around the UK.\" But business leaders have been clear to me that they haven't simply joined the delegation to further their activities in India. They want to raise their profile with the prime minister, in order to ensure their voice is heard when it needs to be by the government. And the picture some paint of life back in the UK is more challenging. CEO of leading architecture firm Benoy, Tom Cartledge, said how 10 to 15 years ago their business was 90% UK activity, and now it is 90% overseas. He said markets like India are important in part because the UK environment is challenging. \"We're having to go and find new markets because what we do is design big projects, infrastructure, real estate towers, residential, retail,\" he told me. He went on: \"There really is a perception of overseas markets that we are sluggish, low productivity, high tax rates. And that does nothing for the confidence. And in fact, I spoke to an Indian client this morning who said that they are relocating from the head offices to Dubai, because the perception is it's going to get harder, it's going to get tougher in the UK and we just do not need that.\" It is rare for business figures on a PM delegation to speak so openly. Ms Haviland told me that business figures are using this trip to pass a message to the prime minister. \"We want to see no more tax for business,\" she told me, saying that's the message being conveyed right now in India. I asked what they say back? \"They hear us,\" she replied. \"I think we'll have to wait and see.\" Read more:Badenoch has done enough to hold off her critics - for nowPM blames Tories for China spy trial being dropped  Another important voice is Rohan Malik, managing partner of EY. He says there's an optimistic case for the UK over the medium term but suggested short-term challenges for the government. \"No one likes taxes, but at the same time, they are a necessary way for the government to balance the books. \"If I take a five or seven-year view, I feel more optimistic about the future, because I do think some short-term pain will lead to some long-term gains.\" Does he think the business community could bear paying a bit more? \"I think it's going to be tricky for the chancellor,\" he said. \"I don't envy her position at all to be looking at different, but she's got other of disposal businesses, but not like more taxation. At the same time, we have to be prepared to understand how do we try and contribute more towards economic growth?\" The candour is not something I can remember from business delegations in the past. That's a response to the nervousness about a £20bn-£30bn black hole Chancellor Rachel Reeves will have to fill in the November budget. Overall the delegates remain on side - for now."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n MSPs are being urged to put party politics aside and back a bill that would give people diagnosed with a drug or alcohol addiction a legal right to treatment. The Right to Addiction Recovery (Scotland) Bill will go before MSPs on Thursday, but it is understood the legislation is not expected to pass at stage one. The bill, introduced by former Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, seeks to give those diagnosed with drug or alcohol addiction a statutory right to receive treatment from a relevant professional. However, it has not been backed by Holyrood's Health, Social Care and Sport Committee amid concerns it is not the correct \"vehicle\" to effectively support those suffering harm from addiction. Ahead of the debate, Mr Ross urged those with reservations to help the bill pass its first parliamentary hurdle with an aim to address any concerns further down the legislative process. He said: \"I am calling on all MSPs to put party politics aside, do what is right, and allow the right to recovery bill to move forward at its first stage. \"For seven straight years, Scotland has been the drugs death capital of Europe. Every grieving family knows that the current system is failing vulnerable Scots. \n                  Addiction recovery bill not backed by majority of Scottish parliament committee\n                 \n                  Nearly two-thirds of UK workers turning to drink because of job pressures, survey says\n                 \n                  Low-level drinkers have increased cancer and cardiovascular risk, study finds\n                 \"This bill could be game-changing. It would enshrine in law the right of everyone to receive the treatment they need - a principle that I'm convinced every MSP backs.\" National Records of Scotland (NRS) data recently showed there were a total of 1,017 deaths due to drug misuse in 2024 - a decrease of 155 (13%) on the previous year. Despite the drop, Scotland remains the drugs death capital of Europe. And while the UK's first safer drug consumption room opened in Glasgow in January, a Westminster committee last month said it should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\" to tackle the crisis. Recent NRS data also showed there were 1,185 alcohol specific deaths in 2024 - a decrease of 92 (7%) on the previous year. The figure is the lowest level recorded since before the pandemic. However, Scotland continues to have the highest rate of alcohol specific deaths of any country in the UK.  Read more:Living beside the UK's first drug consumption roomDigger mobilised to clean up drugs den near The Thistle The Health, Social Care and Sport Committee's report said the bill would require \"significant amendments\" if it were to reach stage two. A proposed three-week statutory deadline in the bill raised concerns that it could compromise treatment quality, limit choice, increase relapse risk, and could lead to a rise in litigation in cases where health services are unable to meet the legal rights on time. The costs of implementation set out in the financial memorandum were also said to be a \"significant underestimate\". Mr Ross, MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said his bill had been \"drafted by people with lived experience of addiction and experts in the field\". He said consigning it \"to the dustbin at stage one would be the height of complacency\", arguing it would \"send the signal that MSPs think they have done enough\" to tackle the issue. Mr Ross added: \"This is about saving lives. If we really want to end Scotland's heartbreaking drugs and alcohol crises, we must not close off this opportunity for meaningful change. \"The optics of MSPs voting to close down any further debate on an issue as important as this would be awful. \"To those with reservations about the practicalities of the bill, I say: These can be considered and addressed further down the legislative process.\""

        "Content": "\n          Money live reporter\n              @JournoJess97\n Less than 20% of all active UK companies are led by women, and the pace of new business registrations is slowing down.  That's according to analysis of Companies House data by Prowess, which also found women-led companies receive just 5.8% of all investment.  In our Women in Business series, we speak to women who are bossing it in their respective fields as they tell us how they've overcome challenges and how others could do the same.  Today Money live reporter Jess Sharp speaks to Lemon Fuller, a former dancer, choreographer, singer and the founder of Lemonade Dolls.  Lemon's business grew from an Instagram page she created while heading back to London after living in LA for three years. Having spent a decade in the entertainment industry being criticised, her aim was to build a community that uplifted women. \"I was being told whether I was good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, fat enough - you name it. I think that was really the heartbeat of building a brand that was so inclusive,\" she says. Read the latest consumer news here She had spent a lot of her life working on shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Comic Relief, and with global music stars. She toured around the UK as a support act for Little Mix before being signed by a record company in LA. \"I have no regrets at all, it was absolutely amazing and I worked very, very hard to get where I got. I worked my bum off every single hour of every single day, but after 10 years I needed to change.\" 'The Nike of lingerie' After her Instagram page gained thousands of followers, she decided to shift the account into the lingerie business that we now know as Lemonade Dolls. Starting off with no money and no team, she has gone on to raise more than £3m in investment and create a business she tells Money is worth £17m. Her aim now is to become the \"Nike of lingerie\". \"I want it to be mass market done better where everything is recycled, and it's sustainable. I want it to be as accessible to as many women as possible, and that's why our price point and where we stock is so important,\" she says. \"We want to at least be a leading disruptor in the lingerie space, where every woman feels like we have catered to them.\" And Lemonade Dolls is already on the right track. More from Money:Should you put money in savings or pension?£200,000 salary and whay happens if you don't use airplane mode: Secrets of a pilot'I'm a nanny - this is what society has wrong about raising children' Its products are sold in several countries including the US, New Zealand, the UK and across Europe. While its sales come predominately from online, it has entered several stores, including John Lewis and Nordstrom. \"W're here because our customers are so epic. We are still learning... but once you shop Lemonade Dolls, you just keep coming back. Our returning customer rate is so high,\" she says. \"We don't really use celebrity endorsement - our customers are our ambassadors and we just use word of mouth.\" 'You're only as good as the last pair of knickers you sold' Despite her determination and passion, Lemon says she made \"mistake after mistake after mistake\" and nothing in the business happened quickly for a long time. For the first few years, she just held the position of founder, but three years ago she took over as chief executive and pushed the business to new heights. \"I didn't have any products, I didn't know factories, I didn't know where to get it done, I didn't know anything but I didn't have any money, so I just tried to find people who had influence that could help me,\" she says. \"When I became CEO, I was able to really run the business the way I believed it should, taking lots of risks. \"But we're not getting too ahead of ourselves, you are only as good as the last pair of knickers you sold.\" How to face a room full of male investors One of the keys to her success was learning how to face a room full of male investors and convincing them the underwear market is big enough for Lemonade Dolls. \"The biggest thing that I learned to succeed in that environment is to match their understanding of numbers and to be ready to ask them questions,\" she says. \"Some people have said I shouldn't have to do that but I'm not angry about it - at the end of the day it's made me grow and nobody knows the numbers more than me. That's how I have been able to get respect and investment. \"No one knows your business better than you, so make sure you know how to articulate that.\""

        "Content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed \"a critical turning point\" in the Gaza war after Israel and Hamas signed off the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan. The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday night's breakthrough meant all remaining 48 hostages held by the militant group, 20 of whom are thought to still be alive, would be returned. Follow live updates as peace deal reached \"Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we've reached this critical turning point,\" he added. The White House said it was down to the Israeli security cabinet to sign off the deal today, which will bring a ceasefire into force and allow for an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Hamas urged Mr Trump not to let Israel \"evade or delay\" the deal, as it said it hoped it would lead to the \"complete withdrawal\" of the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Defence Forces said it was \"ready for any scenario\" and any movement \"will be carried out in accordance with the directives\" of its government. In a statement, it added it is prepared to \"lead the operation\" for the hostages' return. It comes after the US president announced the two sides had agreed to the first phase of his plan. 'A great day for the world' In a Truth Social post just before midnight UK time, he said: \"I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan.\" It means all the hostages will be released, he said, and Israel will withdraw its troops \"to an agreed upon line\". He thanked mediators for their part in negotiations in Egypt this week, including those from Qatar and Turkey. The delegates were pictured hugging and celebrating as the deal was announced. He later told Reuters it was a \"great day for the world\", and told Fox News the hostages could be released on Monday. Mr Trump had teased an imminent announcement earlier on Wednesday evening - and revealed he may travel to the Middle East, and perhaps even Gaza, as soon as this weekend.  During an event at the White House, the US secretary of state Marco Rubio handed Mr Trump a note, which the US president read and then said: \"I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly.\" The note had the two words \"very close\" underlined and asked the US president to approve a post on his Truth Social website \"soon so you can announce deal first\". Sources familiar with the talks had told Sky News lead world news presenter Yalda Hakim a deal could be signed within 24 to 36 hours. Mr Trump's plan called for an immediate ceasefire and the release of the 48 hostages still held in Gaza from the 7 October 2023 attack that sparked the beginning of the war. Hamas was seeking guarantees from mediators Israel will not resume its military campaign in Gaza after the militant group releases all the remaining Israeli hostages. Other elements of the deal include a requirement that Hamas disarm, and the creation of an international body to run the enclave once Hamas steps down - led by Mr Trump, with a role for Sir Tony Blair. Ahead of Mr Trump's announcement, Israel had reduced its military campaign in Gaza at his request, but had not stopped conducting strikes altogether. Medical authorities in Gaza reported eight people had been killed by Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours - the lowest number for weeks. Over 67,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says around half were women and children."

More than 67,000 Palestinians are dead, virtually all of Gaza has been flattened by Israel's bombing campaign, and disease and famine stalk the Strip.  Yet Hamas - the group still holding the 20 or so living hostages in captivity - is still not entirely defeated. Yes, they are weakened immensely, but has Benjamin Netanyahu achieved the \"total victory\" over the group he set out to do two years ago? No. So why has he suddenly agreed to a partial victory? Speaking to those in the Israeli security establishment, one could develop a somewhat cynical view about his decision. Recent leaks in the media around talks between Donald Trump and Israel's prime minister, reports that the US president told Mr Netanyahu to \"stop being so f***ing negative,\" could be more coordinated than it seems at first glance, according to these conversations that I am having here in Israel. It now suits Mr Netanyahu politically to stop the war. For the past two years, he has needed to keep his coalition with the far-right together to prevent his government from collapsing.  That meant continuing to pound Gaza, restricting the flow of aid, and allowing the likes of Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir to continue, unchecked, to fan the flames of ethnonationalism and call for the ethnic cleansing of the area. Now, next year's elections are honing into view. Mr Netanyahu needs a win so he can go to his country as the statesman who got the hostages back and ended the war. He needs external pressure from the US president to get this war done. Don't forget that, for Mr Trump, the timing is also key; the Nobel Peace Prize is announced on Friday and there is not much more that the president wants than to put the gong on his mantelpiece. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 Some pessimists said that Mr Netanyahu's government wouldn't last for days after the 7 October 2023 attacks because of the massive security failings. After all, this is a country that punishes political leaders more harshly than most. But two years later, Mr Netanyahu is still fighting.  Never mind that this deal looks a lot like the deal Joe Biden presented more than a year ago. The timing wasn't right then, but it might be now. The Palestinians living through sheer hell in Gaza desperately needed this deal to be finalised. As did those Israelis with family still held captive by Hamas. A dual hell for both sides, separated by mere miles, and dependent on a man who seems to have finally decided that the time for peace has come because it suits him."

        "Content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first billionaire footballer, according to a report. The Al Nassr and Portugal striker's net worth has been estimated at $1.4bn (£1.04bn) by the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The valuation puts Ronaldo among a small group of billionaire athletes including basketball greats Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, as well as golfer Tiger Woods and tennis player Roger Federer. Bloomberg said that between 2002, when he started his career at the Portuguese team Sporting CP, to 2023, Ronaldo earned more than $550m (£410.4m) in salary. That was supplemented with a decade-long sponsorship by Nike, worth close to $18m (£13.4m) per year, and endorsements from brands like Armani and Castrol, adding more than $175m (£130.6m) to his fortune. After leaving Manchester United by mutual consent, Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr in 2023, and became the highest-paid player in history with a salary of around $237.2m (£177m) - plus bonuses and a reported 15% share in the club Still playing at 40 years old, Ronaldo has just signed a new contract with the Saudi side, reportedly worth more than $400m (£298.5m). \n                  Cristiano Ronaldo hints time at Al Nassr is 'over'\n                 \n                  Pitch invaders keen for Cristiano Ronaldo selfies disrupt Turkey v Portugal Euro 2024 match\n                 \n                  Cristiano Ronaldo tops Forbes list of highest-paid athletes\n                 Read more from Sky News:Trump says Democrat politicians should be jailedDaughter suspected in attack on German mayor - police With the World Cup next year, Ronaldo shows no sign of hanging up his boots, telling the Portugal Football Globes gala on Tuesday: \"I still have a passion for this. \"My family says it's time to quit and they ask me why I want to score 1,000 goals if I've already scored 900-something.

        "Content": " A trekker has told Sky News of how he escaped the worst of a snowstorm near Everest that left hundreds of people stranded. Speaking on The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee, Rob Mason described seeing a body brought down from the world's highest mountain after he and his friends completed a charity trek to the base camp. Mr Mason, from Jersey, said he and his six friends were caught in the blizzard that left at least one person dead and many others trapped near the eastern face of the peak in Tibet. Hundreds of hikers were stuck by unseasonal deep snow over the weekend after an unusually powerful blizzard dumped heavy snowfall in the Himalayas. Mr Mason said they were heading down the mountain on the Nepal side when rain and thunderstorms hit, and \"went on for about 18 hours\". He told Sarah-Jane Mee that a \"substantial amount of rain fell as heavy snow higher up, de-stabilising the area and trapping those who were higher up the mountain\". A path that his group was following down on the lower slopes was taken away by a landslide just 12 hours after they used it, he said. \n                  Stranded Mount Everest hikers being evacuated\n                 \n                  Race to rescue hundreds stranded on Mount Everest\n                 \n                  Mount Everest suffers traffic jams as climbers battle harsh weather - with beginners not helping\n                 His party was one of the last groups to get past before it was washed away, after which, \"it became impassable, so alternative, higher, routes had to be taken\". His trek ended in the town of Lukla, in the province of Koshi in northeastern Nepal, he said. Whilst \"grounded\" there, \"we were hearing stories coming down the mountain of about other groups being airlifted where they could be or others being locked down in their tea houses to wait it out until conditions improved. \"While we were at Lukla helipad, we saw the recovery of a body of somebody who'd been taken ill on the mountain and, sadly, the emergency services weren't able to get to them in time.\" The trek to Everest was organised to raise money for Kezia's Fund, a charity established in memory of Mr Mason's daughter, \"our beautiful Kezia\", as he described her, who took her own life three years ago. When they reached the base camp, they left a green heart, a symbol of remembrance for Kezia, on one of the prayer flags at the site in her memory. Mr Mason admitted he found the hike \"a huge personal challenge\" as, he said, he's \"not really built for endurance things\" and said they enjoyed enormous luck, especially with timing. \"We had amazingly good weather for our trek up, but it changed so quickly. Our base camp day, we had about three inches of snow. We were fairly comfortable getting down until the last couple of days but then it really hit hard and it really hit fast. \"And we were passing many people on the trail who were just on their way up, so they were heading into this storm as we'd just come out of it. \"The vast majority of people who were trapped were on the Tibetan side. We were on the Nepalese side. \"But one of the first things we heard - we were trying to get out at that point - the Nepalese government had instructed all helicopters were for search and rescue missions only. That was when stories started to filter down the mountain about how severe it was where we'd been just 48 hours earlier.\" A total of 580 trekkers along with more than 300 guides, yak herders and other support staff were taken off the mountain, the official Chinese Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday, in one of the largest search-and-rescue operations in the region.

More than 540,000 tourists visited the Everest region last year, a new record, although the area is temporarily closed to the public, the agency said."

German police said Ms Stalzer is now in a stable condition, and was found sitting in a chair with multiple stab wounds before being taken to hospital in a helicopter. Emergency services were alerted shortly after midday by her 17-year-old daughter, who reported that Ms Stalzer had been seriously wounded outside her house in an attempted robbery. Both the mayor-elect's daughter and 15-year-old son were taken into custody.

        "Content": "A charity partially run by Prince Harry has had its mandate for managing wildlife reserves in Chad removed by the country's government. The non-profit organisation African Parks, of which the Duke of Sussex is a board member and former president, has been accused of a lack of investment in the reserves, and not doing enough to stop poaching. Chad's environment minister Hassan Bakhit Djamous said in a statement that it had also shown a \"recurring indelicate and disrespectful attitude toward the government\". African Parks managed 22 national parks and protected areas across 12 countries, including two wildlife reserves in Chad - the Ennedi Natural and Cultural Reserve and the Greater Zakouma Ecosystem, which includes the Zakouma and Siniaka Minia national parks. Chad's decision to withdraw African Parks' mandates ends a 15-year partnership to lead anti-poaching efforts and restore elephant populations at several wildlife reservations. African Parks said it was in talks to \"better understand the government's position\" and \"explore the best way forward to support the continued protection of these landscapes that are critical to conservation\". The elephant population at Zakouma National Park increased from 450 in 2010, when it started managing the site, to more than 550 by 2019, according to the conservation charity. African Parks, which was founded in 2000, aims to protect Africa's national parks and advance conservation on the continent and around the world, particularly in countries where poverty and conflict impede the care of their wildlife. The group takes over the day-to-day management of wildlife areas, to make each park in the 20 million hectares of protected area it manages, \"ecologically, socially and financially sustainable for the long term\".

Chad's decision to withdraw African Parks' mandates to manage its wildlife reserves is a new blow to Prince Harry's charitable endeavours after he stepped down from Sentebale, an organisation he founded to help children orphaned by AIDS in Botswana and Lesotho, earlier this year."

Firefighters recovered their bodies early on Wednesday, nearly 15 hours after the collapse of \"several floors\" inside the property, the city's mayor, Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida, wrote on X. The former office building, located in an area of downtown Madrid popular with tourists near the city's opera house and royal palace, was being converted into a four-star hotel when it collapsed on Tuesday. The four victims have been identified as three male construction workers aged between 30 and 50 from Ecuador, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, and the renovation project's architect, a 30-year-old woman. Three other construction workers suffered minor injuries, with local media reporting one of them had been taken to hospital with a broken leg. One worker, a man named Mikhail, told Reuters news agency he was pumping concrete into the building's lower floors from the outside when he saw a large cloud of dust, causing him to sprint away. \"I was the first to run; I didn't care about anything else. I'll save my life first and, if I can, save others later,\" he said. The search-and-rescue operation following the collapse of the building's interior structure, which left its facade intact, involved more than 50 firefighters, drones and sniffer dogs. Francisco Martin Aguirre, a delegate for the Spanish government in Madrid, told Spanish media organisation El Diario that the collapse caused \"a sheer drop to the basement\", describing it as \"an industrial incident\".

The renovation works, which were approved by local authorities in December 2024, were expected to last two years."

        "Content": "A man has been arrested in connection with a deadly wildfire that destroyed much of the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood in Los Angeles, California. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, was detained for allegedly starting a fire on New Year's Day that burned down much of the wealthy coastal area a week later, acting US attorney Bill Essayli said. The blaze, which erupted on 7 January amid high winds, killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,000 homes and buildings in the Pacific Palisades. It burned down mansions with views of the ocean and central Los Angeles.  Rinderknecht allegedly started the fire after finishing his shift as an Uber driver on 31 December 2024. He fled the scene of the original fire, but returned to the same trail where he had been earlier to watch it burn, according to Mr Essayli. \"He left as soon as he saw the fire trucks were headed to the location. He turned around and went back up there. And he took some video and, and watched them fight the fire,\" Mr Essayli said Rinderknecht made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. During an interview with investigators on 24 January, Rinderknecht spoke of where the fire began - information that was not yet public and he would not have known if he hadn't witnessed it, the complaint said. The suspect was visibly nervous during the interview, according to the complaint. His efforts to call 911 and a question to ChatGPT about a cigarette lighting a fire indicated he \"wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire\", the complaint added. Investigators determined the fire was intentionally lit, likely by a lighter used on vegetation or paper, according to the criminal complaint. Authorities found a \"barbecue-style\" lighter inside the glove compartment of his car.

The fire was put out initially, but it continued to smoulder underground before reigniting during high winds a week later, Mr Essayli added. Rinderknecht was arrested in Florida on Tuesday and will appear in court in the state on Wednesday. He faces between five and 20 years in prison if convicted, according to the US Attorney's Office. \"While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" Mr Essayli said. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said: \"More than nine months ago, our city faced one of the most devastating periods our region had ever seen. Lives were tragically lost. Thousands of homes were destroyed. \"Our heroic firefighters fought the blaze valiantly with no rest. Each day that families are displaced is a day too long and as we are working tirelessly to bring Angelenos home, we are also working towards closure and towards justice - and today is a step forward in that process.\" Investigators are still to determine the cause of the Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day in the community of Altadena and killed 18 people."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, giving him sweeping presidential powers over the deployment of the military in the US. \"Well, it's been invoked before,\" he said, when speaking to reporters this week. He repeatedly suggested he might invoke it during his first term - but never did.  What is the Insurrection Act? It gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalise National Guard troops inside the US to tackle domestic uprisings. It can be invoked when there are \"unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion\" against the authority of the US government, the statute states. The law gives the president the power to use the armed forces to enforce the laws of the United States in any state and to take action \"to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion\". President Thomas Jefferson signed it into law in 1807. There is a long American tradition of keeping the military out of domestic affairs and such a move would normally need approval by Congress.  What has Trump said about the act? The president told reporters on Monday so far it has not been necessary to invoke the Insurrection Act - but he would consider doing so. \"We have an Insurrection Act for a reason,\" Mr Trump said. \"If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that.\" On Tuesday, hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers gathered at a training centre outside Chicago, Illinois. A federal judge has temporarily barred troops from heading to Portland, Oregon - but another has allowed a deployment to proceed in Chicago, where federal agents have embarked on a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration. Mr Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and to Washington DC, as part of his law enforcement takeover there. How does Trump define insurrection? Mr Trump became the first president to be impeached twice when in 2021 he was accused of inciting an insurrection following the deadly riots at the US Capitol. He has indicated he has a low bar for what he considers an insurrection. The president mentioned the word several times on Monday, including when referencing Portland. \"Portland is on fire. Portland's been on fire for years. And not so much saving it - we have to save something else, because I think that's all insurrection, really criminal insurrection,\" he said in the Oval Office. He later told Newsmax the situation in Portland was \"pure insurrection\".  Has the act been used before? Yes, it has been invoked on dozens of occasions throughout American history. But since the civil rights movement of the 1960s, its use has become \"exceedingly rare\", according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. The Insurrection Act was last used in 1992, when the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King led to deadly race riots. California's governor had requested military aid from President George HW Bush to deal with the violence. Historically, in instances where the Insurrection Act has been invoked, presidents and governors have usually agreed on the need for troops. But the act provides scenarios where such approval is not necessary. In 2005, President George W Bush decided not to invoke the Insurrection Act to send active-duty troops to Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. This was partly because the state's then-governor opposed the move. Why is the Insurrection Act so controversial? Researchers have said the nation's founders, having witnessed abuses by the British military during colonial times, feared that giving the president unlimited control over troops would erode civil liberties and the democratic process. Under the US Constitution, it is the state governors who generally have the authority to maintain order within their borders. Civil rights groups have long warned the Insurrection Act gives the president broad authority to use the military as a domestic police force in ways the founding fathers did not intend."

Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home, closer to Vanderbilt, where I'm kind of having a few treatments here and there.\" And in true Parton fashion, she ended with a joke: \"I wanted you to know that I'm not dying\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n An extraordinary milestone was achieved overnight for the price of gold. The spot gold price topped $4,000 an ounce for the first time on record - and futures data suggests no let up in its upwards momentum for the rest of 2025. It was trading at $4,035 early on Wednesday morning. Money latest: 'I want to create the Nike of lingerie' It has risen steadily since Trump 2.0 began in January, when it stood at a level around $2,600. Sky News was quick to report on the early reasons for a spike in the price when heavy outflows were witnessed at the Bank of England. Gold has traditionally been seen as a safe haven for investors' money in tough times. \n                  Britain's winter blackout risk the lowest in six years - but 'tight' days expected\n                 \n                  Bank of England warns of 'sharp correction' for markets if AI bubble bursts - and IMF agrees\n                 \n                  Money blog: Ryanair cuts another 1.2 million seats to and from Spain\n                 There has been plenty to worry about this year - not all of it down to Donald Trump. Analysts say the surge during 2025 can be partly explained as a hedge against the US trade war and the resulting slowdown in the global economy, which has hit demand for many traditional growth-linked stocks and the dollar. Wider economic and geopolitical uncertainty, such as the tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the sustainability of US government debt levels, have also been at play. Over this week, the political crisis in France and the implications of the continuing US government shutdown have been driving forces. But there is one other, crucial, factor that has entered the equation, particularly since the end of the summer. Many analysts say that gold has become a collective hedge against the possible implosion of the AI-driven boom for technology stocks in the US.  Despite a few wobbles, there have been almost endless headlines around record values for such shares, with most investment seen as a big bet on the future rather than current earnings. Around 35% of the market capitalisation of the S&P 500 Index trades at more than 10 times sales, according to investment firm GQG. AI leaders such as Nvidia and companies investing big in their capabilities see huge rewards ahead in terms of both productivity and profits. But a recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of businesses that had integrated AI into their operations had yet to see any return on their investment. A potential bursting of the AI bubble was seen enough of a risk for the Bank of England to call it out in its latest financial stability report. That AI sentiment was also supported by the head of the International Monetary Fund in a speech on Wednesday. Kristalina Georgieva said of the stock market threat: \"Today's valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. \"If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth, expose vulnerabilities, and make life especially tough for developing countries.\" The Bank of England also sees the threat of a market correction from the Trump administration's challenge to the independence of the US central bank. Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at the spread betting provider Pepperstone, said gold's $4,000 level would test appetite but the outlook remained positive for now, given all the global risks at play. \"Selling gold at this stage has become a high-risk endeavour for one simple reason, conviction. \"Institutions, central banks and retail investors alike now treat dips as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of exhaustion. One only needs to recall the $3,000 level just six months ago, reached amid the tariff headlines, to understand how sentiment has shifted. \"This collective behaviour has created a self-reinforcing cycle where every pause in momentum is met with renewed buying. \"Gold has evolved from a traditional hedge during uncertainty into what could be described as a conviction trade, an asset whose value transcends price, reflecting deeper doubts about policy credibility and the erratic course of fiscal decision-making.\" It all suggests there is good reason for momentum behind this gold rush and that more market participants could soon be 'running for them there hills'."

        "Content": "The Nobel Peace Prize winner is set to be named on Friday, with Donald Trump and his administration having made clear more than once that they think the US president deserves the award. The two-time president has been on a not-so-subtle Nobel Prize campaign for years, starting in his first term in office, when he said \"many people\" thought he deserved it. In February this year, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, he said: \"They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\" But why does he think he should win, who has nominated him and how likely is it? Why does Trump think he should get a Nobel Prize?  Mr Trump has suggested on several occasions that he has been instrumental in stopping multiple wars. \"I've done six wars, I've ended six wars,\" he said on 18 August, during his summit with Ukrainian and European leaders. \"If you look at the six deals I settled this year, they were all at war. I didn't do any ceasefires.\" \n                  Man arrested over deadly Pacific Palisades fire in California\n                 \n                  Trump says Illinois governor and Chicago mayor should be jailed, as National Guard deployed\n                 \n                  What is the Insurrection Act which Trump keeps threatening to use?\n                 The following day, in an interview with Fox News, he revised the number to seven wars. It's a claim he went on to repeat last month, claiming that no one had \"ever done anything close to that\".  Read more: The seven wars Trump claims to have ended Dr Samir Puri, director of the Centre for Global Governance and Security at Chatham House, previously told Sky News: \"There's an absurdity to Trump's claims, but like many of his claims, within the absurdity there are sometimes grains of truth.\" He suggested there was a \"huge difference between getting fighting to stop in the short-term and resolving the root causes of the conflict,\" and that Mr Trump's interventions often amount to \"conflict management\" rather than conflict resolution. Has Trump been nominated? He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize more than 10 times - by Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet, a Ukrainian politician, as well as legislators from the US, Sweden, and Norway. Mr Netanyahu nominated him in July, saying Mr Trump was \"forging peace as we speak\" in \"one country and one region after the other\". It came after Mr Trump took credit for stopping Iran and Israel's \"12-day war\" the month prior.  Could Trump actually win? Experts such as Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, have suggested successfully pressuring Russia to end the war in Ukraine or Israel to stop its war in Gaza would make Mr Trump a viable candidate.  But while Mr Trump says indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over his 20-point peace plan are \"very serious,\" it looks unlikely anything will be agreed before the prize is handed out on Friday. Experts suggest Mr Trump is an unlikely winner for other reasons. Alfred Nobel's will, the award's foundation, says the award should go to the person \"who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations\". That is something Trump is not doing, according to Ms Graeger. \"He has withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization and from the Paris Accord on climate, he has initiated a trade war on old friends and allies,\" she said. \"That is not exactly what we think about when we think about a peaceful president or someone who really is interested in promoting peace.\" Anyone can be nominated for the prize, but its website cautions that with \"no vetting of nominations\", \"to simply be nominated is therefore not an official endorsement or honour and may not be used to imply affiliation with the Nobel Peace Prize or its related institutions.\" Only people who meet certain criteria can nominate someone, including heads of state, members of government, former Nobel winners, and university professors. The Nobel committee, a panel of five experts appointed by the Norwegian Storting (supreme legislative body), shortlists candidates, which are then further scrutinised by external consultants. These include permanent advisers to the committee, Norwegian and international experts in the field. Once this information is shared with the committee, the final decision is made and the winner announced each October.  In 2025, there were 338 candidates, including 244 individuals and 94 organisations. During his second term, Mr Trump has also proposed measures that critics argue will hamper education and scientific research - two areas that are considered pillars of the Nobel Prize. They include slashing the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the world's largest funder of biomedical research, and plans to dismantle the Department of Education to shrink the federal government's role in education in favour of more control by the states. Ylva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards three of the six Nobel prizes - for chemistry, physics and economics - says she believes Mr Trump's changes are reckless and could have \"devastating effects\". \"Academic freedom... is one of the pillars of the democratic system,\" she says. The Trump administration denies stifling academic freedom, arguing its measures will cut waste and promote scientific innovation. Asle Toje, the deputy leader of the present Norwegian Nobel Committee, has suggested Mr Trump's lobbying campaign for the prize may have had an opposing effect on his chances of winning. \"These types of influence campaigns have a rather more negative effect than a positive one, he says. \"Because we talk about it on the committee. Some candidates push for it really hard and we do not like it. \"We are used to working in a locked room without being attempted to be influenced. It is hard enough as it is to reach an agreement among ourselves, without having more people trying to influence us.\"  Who could win the prize? The prize committee does not publish a list of candidates before announcing a winner, but they have said there are 338 candidates nominated this year, of which 244 are individuals and 94 are organisations. That's up from last year, when there were 286 candidates. Bookmakers have Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as one of the potential frontrunners, along with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died after allegedly being poisoned in a Russian jail. Humanitarian organisations like Sudan's Emergency Response Rooms and Doctors Without Borders also have high odds. The committee could give the award to UN institutions such as the International Court of Justice, or the UN as a whole, which is marking its 80th anniversary this year. It could also reward the Committee to Protect Journalists or Reporters Without Borders, to mark a year in which more media workers than ever before were killed, predominantly in Gaza.

Have US presidents won the prize before? Four US presidents have won it in the past: Theodore Roosevelt (1906), Woodrow Wilson (1919), Jimmy Carter (2002) and Barack Obama (2009). All of the presidents won the award while in office, except for Mr Carter - though the Nobel committee said he should have won it in 1978, while president, when he successfully mediated a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. Mr Obama won the prize just nine months into his presidency for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\". In his acceptance speech, he acknowledged the surrounding controversy, saying: \"Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize - Schweitzer and King; Marshall and Mandela - my accomplishments are slight.\" It's a fact Mr Trump has taken issue with. In 2019, he said: \"They gave it to Obama. He didn't even know what he got it for. He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize. \"With me, I probably will never get it.\" At a rally ahead of his second election win in 2024, he told supporters in Detroit: \"If I were named Obama I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds.\""

        "Content": "Major airports across the US are seeing delays for a second day due to staffing issues, as the federal government's shutdown continues. More than 3,000 flights have been delayed, according to flight tracking data, as staffing shortages have affected a growing number of airports, including Houston, Nashville, Dallas, Chicago O'Hare and Newark, New York. Air traffic controllers are expected to show up for work even though they won't be paid during a government shutdown. They are, however, due to receive partial pay next week for work carried out before the shutdown, which started on 1 October. Sean Duffy, US secretary of transportation, said on Monday the Federal Aviation Administration had seen a slight increase in controllers taking sick leave, and air traffic staffing had been cut by 50% in some areas since the shutdown began. \"If we don't have controllers, we're going to make sure the airspace is safe. So what we do is we'll slow traffic,\" Mr Duffy said on Tuesday on Fox News' Fox and Friends. But the risk of wider impacts to the US aviation system \"is growing by the day\" as federal workers whose jobs are deemed critical continue working without pay, travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said. The longer the shutdown drags on, the more likely it is to affect holiday travel plans in November, he said.\"I'm gravely concerned that if the government remains shut down, then it could disrupt, and possibly ruin, millions of Americans' Thanksgiving holidays,\" he added. FlightAware, a flight tracking website, said more than 3,000 US flights had been delayed on Tuesday, including 225 at Nashville - or 20% of its flights - and more than 570 flights at Chicago O'Hare, more than 20% of its flights. Southwest Airlines has delayed more than 500 flights and American Airlines 400 flights, FlightAware data showed.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Britain is at the lowest risk of a winter power blackout than at any point in the last six years, the national electricity grid operator has said. Not since the pre-pandemic winter of 2019-2020 has the risk been so low, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) said. It's thanks to increased battery capacity to store and deploy excess power from the likes of windfarms, and a new subsea electricity cable to Ireland that came on stream in April. The margins between expected demand and supply are now roughly three gas power stations greater than last year, the NESO said.   It also comes as Britain and the world reached new records for green power. For the first time, renewable energy produced more of the world's electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, while in Britain, a record 54.5% of power came from renewables like solar and wind energy in the three months to June. More renewable power can mean lower bills, as there's less reliance on volatile oil and gas markets, which have remained elevated after the invasion of Ukraine and the Western attempt to wean off Russian fossil fuels. \"Renewables are lowering wholesale electricity prices by up to a quarter\", said Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank.

Those plants have since been decommissioned. But it may not be all plain sailing… There will, however, be some \"tight\" days, the NESO said. On such occasions, the NESO will tell electricity suppliers to up their output. The times Britain is most likely to experience supply constraints are in early December or mid-January, the grid operator said.  The NESO had been owned by National Grid, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but was acquired by the government for £630m in 2023."

The Bank's Financial Policy Committee said in its latest update on the state of the financial system that there was also a risk of a market correction through intensifying worries about US central bank independence. \"The risk of a sharp market correction has increased,\" it warned, while adding that the risk of \"spillovers\" to these shores from such a shock was \"material\".

This was seen early on Wednesday when the spot gold price surpassed the $4,000 per ounce level for the first time. Analysts point to upward pressure from a global economic slowdown driven by the US trade war, the continuing US government shutdown and worries about the sustainability of US government debt.  The political crisis in France has also been cited as a reason for recent gold shifts. Money has also left the US dollar since Donald Trump moved to place his supporters at the heart of the US central bank, repeatedly threatening to fire its chair for failing to cut interest rates to support the economy. Jay Powell's term at the Federal Reserve ends next spring but the White House, while moving to nominate his replacement, has already shifted the voting power and is looking to fire one rate-setter, Lisa Cook, for alleged mortgage fraud. She is fighting that move in the courts. Financial markets fear that monetary policy will no longer be independent of the federal government. \"A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp repricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia and global spillovers,\" the Bank of England said. British government borrowing costs are closely correlated with US Treasury yields and both are currently elevated, near multi-year highs in some cases. It's presenting Chancellor Rachel Reeves with a headache as she prepares the ground for November's budget, with the higher yields reflecting investor concerns over high borrowing and debt levels.  On AI, the Bank said that 30% of the US S&P 500's valuation was made up by the five largest companies, the greatest concentration in 50 years. Share valuations based on past earnings were the most stretched since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago, though looked less so based on investors' expectations for future profits. A recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of businesses that had integrated AI into their operations had yet to see any return on their investment. \"This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,\" the statement said."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n An extraordinary milestone was achieved overnight for the price of gold. The spot gold price topped $4,000 an ounce for the first time on record - and futures data suggests no let up in its upwards momentum for the rest of 2025. It was trading at $4,035 early on Wednesday morning. Money latest: 'I want to create the Nike of lingerie' It has risen steadily since Trump 2.0 began in January, when it stood at a level around $2,600. Sky News was quick to report on the early reasons for a spike in the price when heavy outflows were witnessed at the Bank of England. Gold has traditionally been seen as a safe haven for investors' money in tough times. \n                  Britain's winter blackout risk the lowest in six years - but 'tight' days expected\n                 \n                  Bank of England warns of 'sharp correction' for markets if AI bubble bursts - and IMF agrees\n                 \n                  Money blog: Ryanair cuts another 1.2 million seats to and from Spain\n                 There has been plenty to worry about this year - not all of it down to Donald Trump. Analysts say the surge during 2025 can be partly explained as a hedge against the US trade war and the resulting slowdown in the global economy, which has hit demand for many traditional growth-linked stocks and the dollar. Wider economic and geopolitical uncertainty, such as the tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the sustainability of US government debt levels, have also been at play. Over this week, the political crisis in France and the implications of the continuing US government shutdown have been driving forces. But there is one other, crucial, factor that has entered the equation, particularly since the end of the summer. Many analysts say that gold has become a collective hedge against the possible implosion of the AI-driven boom for technology stocks in the US.  Despite a few wobbles, there have been almost endless headlines around record values for such shares, with most investment seen as a big bet on the future rather than current earnings. Around 35% of the market capitalisation of the S&P 500 Index trades at more than 10 times sales, according to investment firm GQG. AI leaders such as Nvidia and companies investing big in their capabilities see huge rewards ahead in terms of both productivity and profits. But a recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of businesses that had integrated AI into their operations had yet to see any return on their investment. A potential bursting of the AI bubble was seen enough of a risk for the Bank of England to call it out in its latest financial stability report. That AI sentiment was also supported by the head of the International Monetary Fund in a speech on Wednesday. Kristalina Georgieva said of the stock market threat: \"Today's valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. \"If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth, expose vulnerabilities, and make life especially tough for developing countries.\" The Bank of England also sees the threat of a market correction from the Trump administration's challenge to the independence of the US central bank. Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at the spread betting provider Pepperstone, said gold's $4,000 level would test appetite but the outlook remained positive for now, given all the global risks at play. \"Selling gold at this stage has become a high-risk endeavour for one simple reason, conviction. \"Institutions, central banks and retail investors alike now treat dips as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of exhaustion. One only needs to recall the $3,000 level just six months ago, reached amid the tariff headlines, to understand how sentiment has shifted. \"This collective behaviour has created a self-reinforcing cycle where every pause in momentum is met with renewed buying. \"Gold has evolved from a traditional hedge during uncertainty into what could be described as a conviction trade, an asset whose value transcends price, reflecting deeper doubts about policy credibility and the erratic course of fiscal decision-making.\" It all suggests there is good reason for momentum behind this gold rush and that more market participants could soon be 'running for them there hills'."

The Al Nassr and Portugal striker's net worth has been estimated at $1.4bn (£1.04bn) by the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

        "Content": "Britain's wealth gap is growing and it's now practically impossible for a typical worker to save enough to become rich, according to a report. Analysis by The Resolution Foundation, a left-leaning thinktank, found it would take average earners 52 years to accrue savings that would take them from the middle to the top of wealth distribution. The total needed would be about £1.3m, and assumes they save almost all of their income. Wealth gaps are \"entrenched\", it said, meaning that who your parents are - and what assets they may have - is becoming more important to your living standards than how hard you work. While the UK's wealth has \"expanded dramatically over recent decades\", it's been mainly fuelled by periods of low interest rates and increases in asset worth - not wage growth or buying new property. Citing figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Wealth And Assets Survey, the thinktank found household wealth reached £17trn in 2020-22, with £5.5trn (32%) held in property and £8.2trn (48%) in pensions. The report said: \"As a result, Britain's wealth reached a new peak of nearly 7.5 times GDP by 2020-22, up from around three times GDP in the mid-1980s. \"Yet, despite this remarkable increase in the overall stock of wealth, relative wealth inequality - measured by the share of wealth held by the richest households - has remained broadly stable since the 1980s, with the richest tenth of households consistently owning around half of all wealth.\" According to the thinktank, this trend has worsened intergenerational inequality. It said the wealth gap between people in their early 30s and people in their early 60s has more than doubled between 2006-08 and 2020-22 - from £135,000 to £310,000, in real cash terms. Regional inequality remains an issue, with median average wealth per adult higher in London and the South East. Could wealth tax be the answer? The report comes seven weeks before Rachel Reeves delivers her budget on 26 November, having batted away calls earlier this year for a wealth tax. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock is among those to have called for one, in an interview with Sky News. Read more from Sky News:What is a wealth tax?What wealth tax options could Britain have?  But speaking to Bloomberg last month, Ms Reeves said: \"We already have taxes on wealthy people - I don't think we need a standalone wealth tax.\" Previous government policies targeting Britain's richest, notably a move to grab billions from non-doms, has led to concerns about an exodus of wealth. The prime minister has denied that too many are leaving the capital. Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said any wealth taxes would not just be paid by the country's richest citizens. She said: \"With property and pensions now representing 80% of the growing bulk of household wealth, we need to be honest that higher wealth taxes are likely to fall on pensioners, southern homeowners or their families, rather than just being paid by the super-rich.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  The Conservatives will abolish stamp duty if they win the next election, Kemi Badenoch has announced. Speaking to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, the Tory leader described stamp duty - the tax paid when a new home is purchased - as a \"bad tax\" and an \"unconservative tax\". She said she had looked at lowering the thresholds at which stamp duty is paid but decided such a move would not be \"enough\". Politics latest: 'The Conservatives are back', says shadow minister Unveiling the surprise announcement, she told the conference: \"The last Conservative government cut stamp duty for thousands of home buyers. \"But now we must go further. We must free up our housing market - because a society where no one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead. \"The next Conservative government will abolish stamp duty on your home.\" \n                  Badenoch pulls off first conference speech as leader, but it is less clear if this will be her last\n                 \n                  Badenoch has done enough to hold off her critics - for now\n                 \n                  Jenrick 'merely pointing out fact' about not seeing 'another white face', Tory party chair says\n                 Ms Badenoch said the move - which was warmly welcomed by the conference audience - would be paid for by delivering £47bn in spending cuts. It includes £7bn in the overseas aid budget, £8bn from the civil service and £23bn from welfare.  According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, abolishing stamp duty on people's primary residence would currently cost around £4.5bn. The Conservatives claim scrapping the tax will cost £9bn \"due to the dramatic tax increase\" they believe the chancellor is planning in the November budget. The policy will apply irrespective of purchase price for primary residences, but it will not apply to additional properties, the party later confirmed. It will also not apply to properties purchased by companies or by non-UK residents. Scotland or Wales are also not included in the policy as separate taxation exists in the two nations. Ms Badenoch made the announcement in a speech in which she sought to portray the Tories as the party of \"fiscal responsibility\" and outlined her \"golden rule\" for spending: that half the cash from any cuts will go towards bringing down the deficit. Political correspondent This speech was a clear statement of Conservative intent, delivered with a newfound confidence from a woman who's faced months of speculation about her leadership.\n Unlike many of her previous speeches, this one didn't dwell on the previous government's mistakes.  Indeed, she said she wanted to celebrate the \"great things\" her party had done in 14 years in power – delivering Brexit, supporting Ukraine, and halving the deficit from 2010 to 2020.\n\n The economic record of the past four years of Conservative government was unsurprisingly left unsaid.  But the subtext has been clear throughout conference - a drive to rebuild the party's reputation for economic competence following the economic disaster of Liz Truss's mini budget three years ago. Ms Badenoch does not enjoy the level of devotion we have seen for her defeated leadership rival Robert Jenrick, who earned rapturous applause for his speech attacking activist judges on Tuesday - and polling shows he's much more popular with the party membership.  But CCHQ will undoubtedly be relieved to have avoided the kind of outright rebellion we saw from Andy Burnham at Labour's conference last week.  And given the delighted response from her headline announcement in the hall on Wednesday - it looks like Kemi has done enough to hold off her critics - at least for the time being.  The rest would go towards tax cuts and stimulating growth in the economy, she said. But Anna Turley, chair of the Labour Party, accused Ms Badenoch of being in \"complete denial\". \"The public saw the Tories' disastrous blueprint for Britain across their 14 years of failure in government - and the Conservatives still won't apologise for the mess they left,\" she said. \"Kemi Badenoch set herself a new 'golden economic rule' today and broke it immediately. It's the same old Tories, with the same old policies without a plan. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" The stamp duty announcement was one of several policy offerings announced by the Tories as Ms Badenoch attempts to steal the agenda away from Nigel Farage and Reform UK, who are significantly ahead in the polls. Read more:Top Tory refuses to apologise for 'disgraceful' remarkStarmer blames Tories for China spy trial being dropped Much of the criticism that has been directed at Ms Badenoch has been centred on her lack of visibility and policy agenda, which some Conservative MPs believe has created a vacuum for Mr Farage to fill with his own announcements to tackle immigration - including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and carrying out mass deportations. The Conservatives unveiled their own immigration plans which emulate Reform's, and have also committed to leaving the ECHR - a treaty critics believe is being used to frustrate deportations - and to carrying out ICE-style raids. Other announcements include abolishing business rates for about 250,000 high street shops and pubs if they win the next election. Despite the policy blitz, Ms Badenoch has still been subject to a number of briefings about her leadership, given the party's poor standing in the polls, at just 17% of the vote. On Monday, a YouGov poll of Tory members for Sky News showed half did not want Ms Badenoch to lead the party into the next election, and showed a preference Mr Jenrick, her former leadership rival, to take over."

That's according to analysis of Companies House data by Prowess, which also found women-led companies receive just 5.8% of all investment.  In our Women in Business series, we speak to women who are bossing it in their respective fields as they tell us how they've overcome challenges and how others could do the same.  Today Money live reporter Jess Sharp speaks to Lemon Fuller, a former dancer, choreographer, singer and the founder of Lemonade Dolls.  Lemon's business grew from an Instagram page she created while heading back to London after living in LA for three years. Having spent a decade in the entertainment industry being criticised, her aim was to build a community that uplifted women. \"I was being told whether I was good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, fat enough - you name it. I think that was really the heartbeat of building a brand that was so inclusive,\" she says. Read the latest consumer news here She had spent a lot of her life working on shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Comic Relief, and with global music stars. She toured around the UK as a support act for Little Mix before being signed by a record company in LA. \"I have no regrets at all, it was absolutely amazing and I worked very, very hard to get where I got. I worked my bum off every single hour of every single day, but after 10 years I needed to change.\" 'The Nike of lingerie' After her Instagram page gained thousands of followers, she decided to shift the account into the lingerie business that we now know as Lemonade Dolls. Starting off with no money and no team, she has gone on to raise more than £3m in investment and create a business she tells Money is worth £17m.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The cut-price sale of WH Ireland’s wealth management division is on the brink of collapse after a group of investors including Hugh Osmond, one of Britain’s most successful entrepreneurs, moved to block the deal. Sky News has learnt that shareholders accounting for more than half of WH Ireland's stock will vote against the £1m sale to Oberon Investments at a general meeting on Thursday. The deal's collapse will leave WH Ireland's wealth arm, which has £830m of assets under management, facing an uncertain future. WH Ireland declined to say how many clients the business has, but is expected to face searching questions about its handling of the process. Money latest: 'I want to create the Nike of lingerie' City sources said on Wednesday that other buyers had expressed interest in acquiring the division, but said WH Ireland's directors had made it clear that they would be unable to share material information about it with rival suitors - even after the Oberon deal had been rejected. WH Ireland's biggest shareholders, according to its website, include TFG Asset Management, which owns 29.9%, and Melvin Lawson, owner of a 9.7% stake. \n                  Britain's winter blackout risk the lowest in six years - but 'tight' days expected\n                 \n                  Bank of England warns of 'sharp correction' for markets if AI bubble bursts - and IMF agrees\n                 \n                  Money blog: Ryanair cuts another 1.2 million seats to and from Spain\n                 Mr Osmond, who owns a 9.9% stake in WH Ireland and is best-known for his role in building PizzaExpress into one of the UK's biggest restaurant businesses, expressed fury at its board's conduct. \"The directors have paid themselves huge bonuses while rinsing shareholders for every penny,\" he said. \"After running the business utterly incompetently for years, they crowned their achievements by agreeing to sell the only remaining valuable part of the business for nothing. \"Shareholders deserve better.\" According to an announcement on 22 September, WH Ireland - which previously ranked among the City's best-known small-cap investment banks - planned to sell the business and assets of its wealth management division for £1m. It then intended to delist its shares from the junior AIM market and wind the rest of the company - which does not consist of any trading operations - down. WH Ireland said in the same statement that it had considered a capital-raising to support the wealth management arm's return to profitability but had judged this to be too difficult to execute. \"The transaction follows the disposal of the company's Capital Markets division in July 2024 and reflects the board's assessment of the future of the Wealth Management business and the continuing consolidation in the wealth management market,\" the company said when it unveiled the deal to shareholders. \"In that context, the company has had strategic conversations with a number of potential counterparties. \"In some cases, these discussions have been prolonged and extensive and have led to advanced negotiations that have not come to fruition.\" One insider said other parties remained willing and able to hold swift negotiations about a deal, but had been prevented from doing so.

Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a WH Ireland spokesman said: \"At this stage the proxy votes filed with the company's registrars indicate that the resolutions will fail, but the actual outcome of the general meeting will not be known until the meeting has been held tomorrow.\" Sources said the company could be forced to release a stock exchange announcement about the Oberon deal on Wednesday."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  There's no question that Kemi Badenoch's on the ropes after a low-energy first year as leader that has seen the Conservative Party slide backwards by pretty much every metric. But on Wednesday, the embattled leader came out swinging with a show-stopping pledge to scrap stamp duty, which left the hall delirious. \"I thought you'd like that one,\" she said with a laugh as party members cheered her on. A genuine surprise announcement - many in the shadow cabinet weren't even told - it gave the Conservatives and their leader a much-needed lift after what many have dubbed the lost year. Politics latest: Stamp duty to be axed under Tories Ms Badenoch tried to answer that criticism this week with a policy blitz, headlined by her promise on stamp duty. This is a leader giving her party some red meat to try to help her party at least get a hearing from the public, with pledges on welfare, immigration, tax cuts and policing. In all of it, a tacit admission from Ms Badenoch and her team that as politics speeds up, they have not kept pace, letting Reform UK and Nigel Farage run ahead of them and grab the microphone by getting ahead of the Conservatives on scrapping net zero targets or leaving the ECHR in order to deport illegal migrants more easily. Ms Badenoch is now trying to answer those criticisms and act. At the heart of her offer is £47bn of spending cuts in order to pay down the nation's debt pile and fund tax cuts such as stamp duty. All of it is designed to try to restore the party's reputation for economic competence, against a Labour Party of tax rises and a growing debt burden and a Reform party peddling \"fantasy economics\". She needs to do something, and fast. A YouGov poll released on the eve of her speech put the Conservatives joint third in the polls with the Lib Dems on 17%. That's 10 percentage points lower than when Ms Badenoch took power just under a year ago. The crisis, mutter her colleagues, is existential. One shadow cabinet minister lamented to me this week that they thought it was \"50-50\" as to whether the party can survive. Read more from Sky News:Starmer blames Tories for China spy trial being droppedUK won't give more visas to Indian workers, says PM Ms Badenoch had to do two things in her speech on Wednesday: the first was to try to reassert her authority over her party. The second was to get a bit of attention from the public with a set of policies that might encourage disaffected Tories to look at her party again. On the first point, even her critics would have to agree that she had a successful conference and has given herself a bit of space from the constant chatter about her leadership with a headline-grabbing policy that could give her party some much-needed momentum. On the second, the promise of spending control coupled with a retail offer of tax cuts does carve out a space against the Labour government and Reform. But the memory of Liz Truss's disastrous mini-Budget, the chaos of Boris Johnson's premiership, and the failure of Sunak to cut NHS waiting lists or tackle immigration still weigh on the Conservative brand. Ms Badenoch might have revived the room with her speech, but whether that translates into a wider revival around the country is very hard to read. Ms Badenoch leaves Manchester knowing she pulled off her first conference speech as party leader: what she will be less sure about is whether it will be her last. I thought she tacitly admitted that to me when she pointedly avoided answering the question of whether she would resign if the party goes backwards further in the English council, Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd elections next year. \"Let's see what the election result is about,\" was her reply. That is what many in her party are saying too, because if Ms Badenoch cannot show progress after 18 months in office, she might see her party turn to someone else."

On the road to Mumbai, India, from the airport there were giant pictures of the British prime minister looming over the sealed-off roads cleared for his special VIP convoy. There was nothing short of a carnival along the roadside to greet the cars. Politics latest: Stamp duty on primary homes to be axed under Tories People who knew nothing about Sir Keir - and were happy to admit so to me - dressed up for the occasion in plumes of feathers and chicken costumes and danced to music. The Labour conference does not come close to that. This trip has a big first - 125 blue chip business leaders, more than any business delegation in history - are here. The enthusiasm to take advantage of the signed, though not completed, free trade deal is clear. \"I think the importance of this trip is reflected by the huge British delegation we've got here today,\" said Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \n                  Renewable energy produces more electricity than coal for the first time, experts say\n                 \n                  Indian police investigate Vijay's 'overcrowded' political rally as 40 people die\n                 \n                  Vijay rally stampede: At least 36 people killed and dozens injured at campaign event for Indian actor-politician\n                 \"A hundred and twenty five businesses, biggest UK names Beattie, BP, British Airways, Diageo, Virgin, huge businesses all the way through to incredible AI and energy start-ups from around the UK.\" But business leaders have been clear to me that they haven't simply joined the delegation to further their activities in India. They want to raise their profile with the prime minister, in order to ensure their voice is heard when it needs to be by the government. And the picture some paint of life back in the UK is more challenging. CEO of leading architecture firm Benoy, Tom Cartledge, said how 10 to 15 years ago their business was 90% UK activity, and now it is 90% overseas. He said markets like India are important in part because the UK environment is challenging. \"We're having to go and find new markets because what we do is design big projects, infrastructure, real estate towers, residential, retail,\" he told me. He went on: \"There really is a perception of overseas markets that we are sluggish, low productivity, high tax rates. And that does nothing for the confidence. And in fact, I spoke to an Indian client this morning who said that they are relocating from the head offices to Dubai, because the perception is it's going to get harder, it's going to get tougher in the UK and we just do not need that.\" It is rare for business figures on a PM delegation to speak so openly. Ms Haviland told me that business figures are using this trip to pass a message to the prime minister. \"We want to see no more tax for business,\" she told me, saying that's the message being conveyed right now in India. I asked what they say back? \"They hear us,\" she replied. \"I think we'll have to wait and see.\" Read more:Badenoch has done enough to hold off her critics - for nowPM blames Tories for China spy trial being dropped  Another important voice is Rohan Malik, managing partner of EY. He says there's an optimistic case for the UK over the medium term but suggested short-term challenges for the government. \"No one likes taxes, but at the same time, they are a necessary way for the government to balance the books. \"If I take a five or seven-year view, I feel more optimistic about the future, because I do think some short-term pain will lead to some long-term gains.\" Does he think the business community could bear paying a bit more? \"I think it's going to be tricky for the chancellor,\" he said. \"I don't envy her position at all to be looking at different, but she's got other of disposal businesses, but not like more taxation. At the same time, we have to be prepared to understand how do we try and contribute more towards economic growth?\" The candour is not something I can remember from business delegations in the past. That's a response to the nervousness about a £20bn-£30bn black hole Chancellor Rachel Reeves will have to fill in the November budget. Overall the delegates remain on side - for now."

On Tuesday, Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), told MPs in a letter that the CPS had tried \"over many months\" to get the evidence it needed to carry out the prosecution, but it had not been forthcoming from the Labour government. He said the government refused to brand China a threat, despite being repeatedly asked.

And so all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then.\" He added his government was \"disappointed\" the trial did not proceed. Case law changed after Russian spy ring Former Conservative chair of the powerful foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns, who Mr Cash worked for when he was arrested, accused Labour of crippling prosecutors to appease Beijing for a trade deal. However, minister Emma Hardy told Sky News the case was dropped due to a change in case law following a High Court case earlier this year, which meant the evidence threshold \"wasn't met\". She said the China spy case had to be based on the evidence from 2023, when they were charged.

She accused the government of having \"stonewalled\" her and the public by failing to explain why it is blaming the Conservative government while also saying the CPS is independent. Luke de Pulford, chief executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, told Sky News the letter from the DPP is an \"extraordinary intervention\" and Mr Parker was forced into sending it because the government was blaming him for the case collapsing. He added: \"What was alleged here was the worst breach of parliamentary security I think anybody can remember. \"To allow people to walk away scot-free because we didn't want to provide evidence, because we didn't want to upset China, really is unacceptable at any level and that's why I think nobody wants to admit it.\" No involvement from national security adviser It is understood the decision to end the case came after a meeting of senior officials, which, according to The Sunday Times, included Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, and Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office's top diplomat. Ms Hardy denied Mr Powell was involved in the decision to drop the case. \"Absolutely not, nothing to do with him, nothing to do with ministers whatsover,\" she said. \"That is completely false.\" The minister said she would not call China an \"enemy\" but added: \"China is a challenge and China is a country which we have a large trading relationship with. \"And sometimes we'll be competing with China, sometimes we'll be collaborating with China. And sometimes we need to challenge China when it makes decisions that we don't think are in our interest.\" The Chinese Embassy in the UK said: \"We have emphasised from the outset that the allegation about China instructing the relevant British individuals to 'steal British intelligence' is entirely fabricated and malicious slander, which we firmly reject. \"We urge certain individuals in the UK to stop this kind of self-staged anti-China political farce.\""

Sir Keir Starmer, a former head of the CPS, said the government was \"disappointed\" the case did not reach trial and blamed the Tories. He said the trial would have had to take place based on the government's position during the period Berry and Cash were accused - which was when the Conservatives were in government. \"Now, that's not a political to and fro, that's a matter of law,\" he said on 8 October. \"You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence. And so all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then.\"  Minister Emma Hardy said the case was dropped due to a change in case law after a Court of Appeal ruling following a group of Bulgarians being found guilty of spying for Russia last year, which meant the evidence in the China case did not meet the threshold. She also denied the government had applied pressure on the CPS to drop the case over fears of calling China an enemy. What does the CPS say? Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP) - the current head of the CPS - took the unusual step of sending a letter to MPs on 7 October to explain why they dropped the case after he felt he was being publicly briefed against. He said the government had refused to label Beijing an enemy and the Official Secrets Act, under which the charges were brought, specifies it is a crime to communicate any documents which might be useful to \"an enemy\". Mr Parkinson said prosecutors had \"over many months\" tried to get the government to provide them with evidence after the Russian spy case to prove the government sees China as a threat to national security. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Read more:Bulgarians who ran Russian spy ring from England jailedFormer assistant to German politician guilty of spying for China What do the Conservatives say? Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having \"deliberately collapsed\" the trial because the PM \"wants to suck up to Beijing\". Former Conservative chair of the powerful foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns, who Mr Cash worked for, told Sky News the government's explanation did not make sense as they were blaming the Tory government at the same time as saying the CPS is independent of government. She accused the government of having \"stonewalled\" her and the public by failing to explain why the case was dropped. What is the law? Mark Elliott, professor of public law at the University of Cambridge and a former legal adviser to the House of Lords constitution committee, said the government is both wrong to say the previous government did not consider China to be an enemy, and that the current government is bound by that. \"There's nothing in the Official Secrets Act or the case law that recognises this concept of a declared enemy,\" he said. \"There's no official status where countries are an enemy or not. \"The prosecution has to prove to the jury they were trying to pass information to an enemy, the court can form its own view. \"There is also nothing to stop the current government from saying a state was an enemy two years ago.\" He said the Court of Appeal case last year actually makes it easier to prosecute for espionage as it determined that an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act includes states that represent a \"current threat to the national security of the UK\". Government 'cherry picking' Professor Elliott pointed out the 2023 Integrated Defence Review, under the Tories, clearly says China was a threat to national security, but the current government only picked out a specific sentence saying China is an \"epoch-defining challenge\". \"The idea that because it doesn't say China is an enemy it doesn't count is hard to understand, given they refer to Russia, but not as an 'enemy',\" he added. \"They're cherry picking something to say the previous government didn't regard China as a threat to national security. \"As a former DPP, I'm surprised by Sir Keir Starmer's analysis of the law.\" Professor Elliott also questioned why the CPS spent months trying to get the government to provide evidence, in the form of ministers and officials saying whether China is a national security threat. Former DPP Lord Macdonald also queried the DPP's explanation, telling BBC Radio 4 it is \"very hard to follow\" why the DPP claimed the Court of Appeal case made the situation more difficult. He agreed it actually \"set the bar lower\" for Cash and Berry's prosecution. The Chinese embassy said: \"We have emphasised from the outset that the allegation about China instructing the relevant British individuals to 'steal British intelligence' is entirely fabricated and malicious slander, which we firmly reject.\" \"We urge certain individuals in the UK to stop this kind of self-staged anti-China political farce.\""

        "Content": "A former sex worker has told a Holyrood committee that Scotland needs to \"put the not for sale sign out\" and pass new laws on prostitution. Diane Martin was giving evidence to the Criminal Justice Committee on Wednesday to support proposals put forward by Alba MSP Ash Regan which, if passed, could see those convicted of buying sex fined up to £10,000 or face jail. The Prostitution (Offences and Support) (Scotland) Bill aims to criminalise those buying sex, while decriminalising those selling it. Ms Martin told the committee, which is scrutinising the bill, she had previously worked in London at \"the supposed highest end of prostitution\". However, she said: \"It is no different if you are in a five-star hotel or in an alley.\" She urged the MSPs to back the proposal, telling them: \"We think of ourselves as a progressive country, and we need to put the not for sale sign out.\" Another ex-sex worker, Amanda Jane Quick, said criminalising those buying sex would act as a \"deterrent\" and could therefore \"reduce demand and reduce violence\". \n                  Douglas Ross urges MSPs to put party politics aside and back addiction recovery bill\n                 \n                  Martin Ready: Sentencing of 'evil Jesus' who plotted to kill prosecutor postponed\n                 \n                  Bird of prey suffered 'harrowing death' after being poisoned in Aberdeenshire\n                 She recounted her experiences working both on the streets and in a brothel. Ms Quick said she was raped at the age of 18 by a client in a brothel, and also told how when she became pregnant and tried to leave, she was encouraged to stay as \"men liked young pregnant women\" and therefore would be able to make more money. Ms Quick, who now campaigns for the introduction of the so-called Nordic model, where selling sex is decriminalised but its purchase is made a criminal act, said selling sex \"can never be made safe\". She told the committee such work \"will always be underground, because the men and women who sell don't want anybody really to find out\". Ms Quick said prostitution \"thrives on silence and thrives on violence\", adding: \"When I sold sex I was also selling silence and secrets, not just my body.\" She said the proposals outlined in the bill would help \"change the thoughts and attitudes and beliefs of society\". Read more from Sky News:'Ordering a woman to be sexually exploited as easy as ordering takeaway' Bronagh Andrew, operations manager for Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), said: \"There needs to be a very strong message sent out to civic society that paying for sex causes harm to a significant number of women. \"It is overwhelmingly men that are the ones paying for sex, and it is overwhelmingly women who are selling sex. \"That needs to be understood better and a clear message going out saying 'this is not a harmless activity, this does cause harm to women and society in general'.\" Other campaigners warned the legislation could leave sex workers at an increased risk of violence. Laura Baillie of Scotland for Decrim - which wants sex work to be fully decriminalised - told the committee the group \"strongly oppose\" the bill, saying: \"It does increase the likelihood of violence against sex workers. \"It puts them in more danger because it limits their ability to conduct safety checks such as asking for ID or providing a deposit so there is a record of a financial transaction.\" She went on to say an app which is a \"vital lifeline for many sex workers\", allowing them to warn each other of clients who are violent or abusive, may not be able to continue if the law is changed because it could be \"seen as facilitating a crime\". Niki Adams of the English Collective of Prostitutes also said criminalising those who buy sex would \"endanger sex workers and push us underground\". She said: \"There is no evidence it reduces prostitution. \"We really feel that the biggest flaw of this bill is it does not address the poverty, homelessness, lack of pay equity, expensive childcare and many of the other reasons that push women in particular and mothers in particular into sex work. \"We agree with the aim, ultimately, of trying to reduce prostitution, because we think women should have the option to leave if they want to. \"But we do not understand why the focus is not on ending women's poverty.\""

The Right to Addiction Recovery (Scotland) Bill will go before MSPs on Thursday, but it is understood the legislation is not expected to pass at stage one. The bill, introduced by former Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, seeks to give those diagnosed with drug or alcohol addiction a statutory right to receive treatment from a relevant professional. However, it has not been backed by Holyrood's Health, Social Care and Sport Committee amid concerns it is not the correct \"vehicle\" to effectively support those suffering harm from addiction. Ahead of the debate, Mr Ross urged those with reservations to help the bill pass its first parliamentary hurdle with an aim to address any concerns further down the legislative process. He said: \"I am calling on all MSPs to put party politics aside, do what is right, and allow the right to recovery bill to move forward at its first stage. \"For seven straight years, Scotland has been the drugs death capital of Europe.

It would enshrine in law the right of everyone to receive the treatment they need - a principle that I'm convinced every MSP backs.\" National Records of Scotland (NRS) data recently showed there were a total of 1,017 deaths due to drug misuse in 2024 - a decrease of 155 (13%) on the previous year. Despite the drop, Scotland remains the drugs death capital of Europe. And while the UK's first safer drug consumption room opened in Glasgow in January, a Westminster committee last month said it should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\" to tackle the crisis. Recent NRS data also showed there were 1,185 alcohol specific deaths in 2024 - a decrease of 92 (7%) on the previous year. The figure is the lowest level recorded since before the pandemic. However, Scotland continues to have the highest rate of alcohol specific deaths of any country in the UK.

A proposed three-week statutory deadline in the bill raised concerns that it could compromise treatment quality, limit choice, increase relapse risk, and could lead to a rise in litigation in cases where health services are unable to meet the legal rights on time. The costs of implementation set out in the financial memorandum were also said to be a \"significant underestimate\". Mr Ross, MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said his bill had been \"drafted by people with lived experience of addiction and experts in the field\". He said consigning it \"to the dustbin at stage one would be the height of complacency\", arguing it would \"send the signal that MSPs think they have done enough\" to tackle the issue. Mr Ross added: \"This is about saving lives. If we really want to end Scotland's heartbreaking drugs and alcohol crises, we must not close off this opportunity for meaningful change. \"The optics of MSPs voting to close down any further debate on an issue as important as this would be awful. \"To those with reservations about the practicalities of the bill, I say: These can be considered and addressed further down the legislative process.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n  The Conservatives will abolish stamp duty if they win the next election, Kemi Badenoch has announced. Speaking to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, the Tory leader described stamp duty - the tax paid when a new home is purchased - as a \"bad tax\" and an \"unconservative tax\". She said she had looked at lowering the thresholds at which stamp duty is paid but decided such a move would not be \"enough\". Politics latest: 'The Conservatives are back', says shadow minister Unveiling the surprise announcement, she told the conference: \"The last Conservative government cut stamp duty for thousands of home buyers. \"But now we must go further. We must free up our housing market - because a society where no one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead. \"The next Conservative government will abolish stamp duty on your home.\" \n                  Badenoch pulls off first conference speech as leader, but it is less clear if this will be her last\n                 \n                  Badenoch has done enough to hold off her critics - for now\n                 \n                  Jenrick 'merely pointing out fact' about not seeing 'another white face', Tory party chair says\n                 Ms Badenoch said the move - which was warmly welcomed by the conference audience - would be paid for by delivering £47bn in spending cuts. It includes £7bn in the overseas aid budget, £8bn from the civil service and £23bn from welfare.  According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, abolishing stamp duty on people's primary residence would currently cost around £4.5bn. The Conservatives claim scrapping the tax will cost £9bn \"due to the dramatic tax increase\" they believe the chancellor is planning in the November budget. The policy will apply irrespective of purchase price for primary residences, but it will not apply to additional properties, the party later confirmed. It will also not apply to properties purchased by companies or by non-UK residents. Scotland or Wales are also not included in the policy as separate taxation exists in the two nations. Ms Badenoch made the announcement in a speech in which she sought to portray the Tories as the party of \"fiscal responsibility\" and outlined her \"golden rule\" for spending: that half the cash from any cuts will go towards bringing down the deficit. Political correspondent This speech was a clear statement of Conservative intent, delivered with a newfound confidence from a woman who's faced months of speculation about her leadership.\n Unlike many of her previous speeches, this one didn't dwell on the previous government's mistakes.  Indeed, she said she wanted to celebrate the \"great things\" her party had done in 14 years in power – delivering Brexit, supporting Ukraine, and halving the deficit from 2010 to 2020.\n\n The economic record of the past four years of Conservative government was unsurprisingly left unsaid.  But the subtext has been clear throughout conference - a drive to rebuild the party's reputation for economic competence following the economic disaster of Liz Truss's mini budget three years ago. Ms Badenoch does not enjoy the level of devotion we have seen for her defeated leadership rival Robert Jenrick, who earned rapturous applause for his speech attacking activist judges on Tuesday - and polling shows he's much more popular with the party membership.  But CCHQ will undoubtedly be relieved to have avoided the kind of outright rebellion we saw from Andy Burnham at Labour's conference last week.  And given the delighted response from her headline announcement in the hall on Wednesday - it looks like Kemi has done enough to hold off her critics - at least for the time being.  The rest would go towards tax cuts and stimulating growth in the economy, she said. But Anna Turley, chair of the Labour Party, accused Ms Badenoch of being in \"complete denial\". \"The public saw the Tories' disastrous blueprint for Britain across their 14 years of failure in government - and the Conservatives still won't apologise for the mess they left,\" she said. \"Kemi Badenoch set herself a new 'golden economic rule' today and broke it immediately. It's the same old Tories, with the same old policies without a plan. They didn't work then and you can't trust them now.\" The stamp duty announcement was one of several policy offerings announced by the Tories as Ms Badenoch attempts to steal the agenda away from Nigel Farage and Reform UK, who are significantly ahead in the polls. Read more:Top Tory refuses to apologise for 'disgraceful' remarkStarmer blames Tories for China spy trial being dropped Much of the criticism that has been directed at Ms Badenoch has been centred on her lack of visibility and policy agenda, which some Conservative MPs believe has created a vacuum for Mr Farage to fill with his own announcements to tackle immigration - including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and carrying out mass deportations. The Conservatives unveiled their own immigration plans which emulate Reform's, and have also committed to leaving the ECHR - a treaty critics believe is being used to frustrate deportations - and to carrying out ICE-style raids. Other announcements include abolishing business rates for about 250,000 high street shops and pubs if they win the next election. Despite the policy blitz, Ms Badenoch has still been subject to a number of briefings about her leadership, given the party's poor standing in the polls, at just 17% of the vote. On Monday, a YouGov poll of Tory members for Sky News showed half did not want Ms Badenoch to lead the party into the next election, and showed a preference Mr Jenrick, her former leadership rival, to take over."

Not since the pre-pandemic winter of 2019-2020 has the risk been so low, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) said. It's thanks to increased battery capacity to store and deploy excess power from the likes of windfarms, and a new subsea electricity cable to Ireland that came on stream in April. The margins between expected demand and supply are now roughly three gas power stations greater than last year, the NESO said.   It also comes as Britain and the world reached new records for green power. For the first time, renewable energy produced more of the world's electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, while in Britain, a record 54.5% of power came from renewables like solar and wind energy in the three months to June. More renewable power can mean lower bills, as there's less reliance on volatile oil and gas markets, which have remained elevated after the invasion of Ukraine and the Western attempt to wean off Russian fossil fuels. \"Renewables are lowering wholesale electricity prices by up to a quarter\", said Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank.

Those plants have since been decommissioned. But it may not be all plain sailing… There will, however, be some \"tight\" days, the NESO said. On such occasions, the NESO will tell electricity suppliers to up their output. The times Britain is most likely to experience supply constraints are in early December or mid-January, the grid operator said.  The NESO had been owned by National Grid, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but was acquired by the government for £630m in 2023."

Kristalina Georgieva said of the stock market threat: \"Today's valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. \"If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth, expose vulnerabilities, and make life especially tough for developing countries.\" \n                  Robin Williams's daughter begs people to stop sending her AI videos of her father\n                 \n                  Trump to sign US-UK tech partnership in drive for AI\n                 \n                  OpenAI reveals how most people are using ChatGPT\n                 Fears have been growing that the AI-driven stock market rally in the United States is unsustainable, and there are signs that a growing number of investors are rushing to hedge against any correction. This was seen early on Wednesday when the spot gold price surpassed the $4,000 per ounce level for the first time. Analysts point to upward pressure from a global economic slowdown driven by the US trade war, the continuing US government shutdown and worries about the sustainability of US government debt.  The political crisis in France has also been cited as a reason for recent gold shifts. Money has also left the US dollar since Donald Trump moved to place his supporters at the heart of the US central bank, repeatedly threatening to fire its chair for failing to cut interest rates to support the economy. Jay Powell's term at the Federal Reserve ends next spring but the White House, while moving to nominate his replacement, has already shifted the voting power and is looking to fire one rate-setter, Lisa Cook, for alleged mortgage fraud. She is fighting that move in the courts. Financial markets fear that monetary policy will no longer be independent of the federal government. \"A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp repricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia and global spillovers,\" the Bank of England said. British government borrowing costs are closely correlated with US Treasury yields and both are currently elevated, near multi-year highs in some cases. It's presenting Chancellor Rachel Reeves with a headache as she prepares the ground for November's budget, with the higher yields reflecting investor concerns over high borrowing and debt levels.  On AI, the Bank said that 30% of the US S&P 500's valuation was made up by the five largest companies, the greatest concentration in 50 years. Share valuations based on past earnings were the most stretched since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago, though looked less so based on investors' expectations for future profits. A recent report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of businesses that had integrated AI into their operations had yet to see any return on their investment. \"This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,\" the statement said."

        "Content": " Dolly Parton has declared she \"ain't dead yet\" after her sister raised concerns about the singer's health by asking people to pray for her. \"There are just a lot of rumours flying around. But I figured if you heard it from me, you'd know that I was okay,\" the 79-year-old singer said in a new two-minute video posted on social media. \"I'm not ready to die yet. I don't think God is through with me. And I ain't done working,\" she added. In the footage, captioned \"I ain't dead yet!\", the 9 to 5 singer is seen on a set speaking directly to the camera. On Tuesday, a Facebook post shared by her sister Freida Parton escalated concerns around Parton's health when she wrote that she had been \"up all night praying for my sister, Dolly\". Hours later, Freida Parton followed up with a clarification. \"I want to clear something up. I didn't mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly,\" she wrote. \"She's been a little under the weather, and I simply asked for prayers because I believe so strongly in the power of prayer.\" \n                  Dolly Parton is 'going to be just fine', country singer's sister says\n                 \n                  Dolly Parton's husband of nearly 60 years dies\n                 \n                  Taylor Swift donates $5m to help feed those affected by Hurricane Milton\n                 Last month, Parton postponed her first Las Vegas residency in 32 years, citing \"health challenges\". She was scheduled to perform six shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in December. The dates have been moved to next September Parton offered her own clarification about her health condition in Wednesday's video.

Anyway, I wanted to put everybody's mind at ease, those of you who seem to be real concerned, which I appreciate,\" she continued. \"And I appreciate your prayers because I'm a person of faith. I can always use the prayers for anything and everything.\" She also referenced her late husband of nearly 60 years Carl Dean who died earlier this year at the age of 82. \"I want you to know that I'm OK. I've got some problems as I've mentioned. Back when my husband Carl was very sick, that was for a long time, and then when he passed, I didn't take care of myself. So I let a lot of things go that I should've been taking care of,\" she said. \"So anyway, when I got around to it, the doctor said: 'We need to take care of this. We need to take care of that.' Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home, closer to Vanderbilt, where I'm kind of having a few treatments here and there.\" And in true Parton fashion, she ended with a joke: \"I wanted you to know that I'm not dying\"."
