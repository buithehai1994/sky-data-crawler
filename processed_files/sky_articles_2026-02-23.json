        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Russia's invasion of Ukraine and wider threats to the UK and its allies share \"a lot of similarities\" with the three-year run-up to the Second World War, the armed forces minister has said. Al Carns, a former special forces colonel in the Royal Marines, said Ukraine is on the frontline of Europe's defences as Vladimir Putin's full-scale onslaught enters its fifth year. But he warned Britain is not immune, with Russia attacking the UK and its interests across four different kinds of frontline. The minister spoke about daily threats in the North Atlantic, the Arctic and cyber attacks, as well as the danger posed by fake news and other forms of disinformation spread online - designed to sow or amplify divisions within UK society or between Britain and its friends. 'History rhymes' Asked whether he agreed with comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Mr Putin had already started World War Three with his invasion of Ukraine, Mr Carns signalled that he saw similarities between the challenges faced today and the global landscape in the three years running up to the Second World War. \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme,\" he said. \"And if you were to go back to, you know, 1936, '37, '38… there's definitely a lot of similarities. \"What I would say is that Ukraine is absolutely the front line of European defence, and they're doing an absolutely sterling job.\" The UK's frontline While Ukraine is on the frontline of Russia's conventional military machine, the armed forces minister said the UK is also in Moscow's sights - though the conflict is raging in a grey zone that sits under the threshold of all-out war. \"A lot of people say that the UK doesn't have a frontline,\" Mr Carns said. \"Well, the reality is we do. It sits in the North Atlantic. It sits in the High North. It sits in cyberspace. And it sits in influence - and I think that is being battled out every day.\" He described how Russia has various means to inflict harm away from bombs and bullets. \"It's not through sharp power. It's through influence, through cyberspace, through industrial espionage,\" the minister said. \"It's through sowing division and discord into this country, into Europe. Drive us apart from the US, apart from our European allies, to fragment and then isolate and defeat.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief correspondent\n       The Mexican authorities would've expected a violent backlash after the killing of El Mencho, one of the country's most powerful cartel bosses. But it's likely they'll have been surprised at the scale of violence across so much of the country. That violence appears to have calmed down for now, but there's nothing to indicate it will simply peter out. 'El Mencho' killing - as it happened When incidents like this happen, the cartels usually respond in three ways. The first is a show of strength, aimed at deterring the authorities from carrying out more raids - that's what has just happened. The second is often fighting between factions within the same cartel or turf wars with other cartels trying to muscle their way into the territory - something gang members are already talking about. The third is to launch a war against the Mexican government and its security forces. It wouldn't be what we have seen over the past 24 hours; it would be something far more organised. This will no doubt be on the government's mind. El Mencho was head of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the only ones I haven't managed to access in my time covering Mexico's drug wars. Jalisco New Generation are notoriously violent and untrustworthy, and our go-betweens in Mexico have always warned us not to even try approach them, although we have tried, but with little success. This cartel, along with the Sinaloa drug cartel, is the top producer of a range of illegal drugs, including the opioid fentanyl, a drug predominantly made in Mexico and exported to the United States, where it kills thousands of users every year. Just because its leader has been killed, it doesn't mean that Jalisco New Generation as a cartel is anywhere near finished. US President Donald Trump's war on drugs has mainly focused on Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Mexico - and ever since Venezuela's Nicholas Maduro was captured in January, Mexico's government has come under even more pressure to take the war to the cartels inside Mexico and show some results. Read more on Sky News:El Mencho's death followed partner's visitWho is 'El Mencho' and why does his death matter? El Mencho's scalp will be much appreciated by the Trump administration and will likely take off some of the pressure on Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's president. But with the football World Cup not too far away, and Mexico, like the United States and Canada, a host nation, President Sheinbaum's government needs to contain the fallout from this very quickly, or people may not risk going to Mexico."

        "Content": "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have thrown their weight behind plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession. The intervention from the Commonwealth countries comes amid calls for the former duke to be prevented from ever becoming king. Backing the calls, a spokesperson for New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the country would support the UK government if it proposes to take action. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had already written to Sir Keir Starmer on Monday backing the measure. Andrew was arrested and interviewed under caution on Thursday 19 February, over allegations of misconduct in public office - something he strongly denies. Politics latest - follow live Following his arrest, calls for MPs to consider passing a law to remove the 66-year-old from the line of succession have grown. In his letter, Mr Albanese wrote: \"In light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession. \"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation. \"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\" Changing the line of succession would require the agreement of all 15 realms of the Commonwealth where the British monarch is also the head of state. Only New Zealand and Australia have so far backed the move. Sky's royal commentator Alastair Bruce said Albanese's letter \"must help the prime minister\", but warned that it may not be so simple to get all to agree. He said: \"It takes a lot of time, and I think parliaments across the world who have the King as head of state will not be looking forward to having to find time to do this.\" Asked about support for the move, Bruce said that \"particularly since Elizabeth II died\", we are living in \"a post-deferential age\", when \"the attitude of people to institutions generally, not just the Royal Family, has altered\". He added that the monarchy was \"suffering at the moment from the fact that its reputation is hugely damaged, and it will want to see to it that a solution is found that those who need justice receive it\". The UK government is understood to be considering introducing legislation to remove the former duke from the line of succession. But any such move would only happen once the ongoing police investigation into him has concluded. Andrew is currently eighth in line to the throne, behind Prince William and his three children, as well as Prince Harry and his two children. Australia has had a republican movement for well over a century, and it became the official policy of the country's governing Labor Party more than three decades ago, in 1991. In 1999, a referendum on becoming a republic was held. Some 55% of voters supported remaining a constitutional monarchy, while 45% wanted to become a republic. The latest polls show similar results, although republicanism is stronger among younger people. Mr Albanese said on Friday that his government was not intending to hold another referendum, despite his personal support for having an Australian head of state."

        "Content": "A Tourette's campaigner who yelled out a racial slur at the BAFTAs has spoken out about the incident, saying he is \"deeply mortified\". John Davidson MBE was attending the awards ceremony after inspiring the film, I Swear, which dramatises his life with severe Tourette syndrome. The condition is characterised by sudden, involuntary, repetitive sounds or movements, known as tics, which cause Davidson to call out inappropriate words. That's what happened at the BAFTAs, when he called out a racial slur while two black actors, Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo, were on stage presenting the first award of the night. Now Davidson has spoken out about the incident, saying that he is \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning\". He also praised the BAFTA organisers for notifying the audience about his tics beforehand and clarifying that they do not reflect his personal beliefs. \"I was heartened by the round of applause that followed this announcement and felt welcomed and understood in an environment that would normally be impossible for me,\" he said. \n                  Robert Aramayo: The Hull actor who's taken the BAFTAs by storm\n                 \n                  BBC removes BAFTAs from iPlayer and apologises after racial slur yelled during show\n                 \n                  British rising star Robert Aramayo beats Timothee Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio to acting BAFTA - as One Battle After Another named best film\n                 In the aftermath of Davidson's shout, the two actors on stage appeared to pause momentarily before continuing with the presentation. Davidson said he then chose to leave the ceremony early because \"I was aware of the distress my tics were causing\". The host, Alan Cumming, subsequently acknowledged the interruption and explained again about Tourette's. In a statement, BAFTA said the slur was a source of \"incomparable trauma and pain for so many\" and apologised for putting its guests in a \"very difficult situation\". The academy's statement said: \"Early in the ceremony a loud tic in the form of a profoundly offensive term was heard by many people in the room. \"Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at the time, and we apologise unreservedly to them, and to all those impacted. We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their incredible dignity and professionalism. \"During the ceremony, John chose to leave the auditorium and watch the rest of the ceremony from a screen, and we would like to thank him for his dignity and consideration of others, on what should have been a night of celebration for him. \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologise to all. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\" The ceremony, with the offending moment intact, remained available to watch on BBC iPlayer for over 12 hours.

The Palace said in a statement on Monday that the pair met at Clarence House, the official home of the King and Queen, while repairs are made to Buckingham Palace.

        "Content": "By Sarah Taaffe-Maguire and James Sillars, business and economics reporters  UK businesses are facing uncertainty and higher costs as Donald Trump's new global tariff hike is set to take effect from Tuesday. Governments worldwide have been scrambling for information since Friday when the US Supreme Court struck down his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs policy, and the president announced a temporary tax of 15% on imports into the US from all countries. Money blog: 'Sporadic shortages' of four items on supermarket shelves as supply hit Many British businesses are in the same position, now fearing higher costs to bring their products into America. \"Clarity is now urgently required on how UK exports will be treated on arrival into the United States\", said manufacturing industry trade body Make UK. From Tuesday morning, UK exporters will be subject to a 15% tariff, higher than the 10% agreed under a UK-US deal back in May. \"Unless we hear otherwise from the US, we are looking at a further 5% hike for many goods from 5am GMT, tomorrow. However, the nature of the legislation the US is using means it is difficult to give the UK a carve-out,\" said the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday. \n                  Trump bumps up global tariffs - creating more mess and uncertainty for the world\n                 \n                  About half of Trump's tariffs are now null and void - but his trade war is not over\n                 \n                  Quick take: Major tariff U-turn for Trump\n                 UK exporters and manufacturers \"are now staring down the barrel at higher costs\", the organisation said. What's happening?  Mr Trump said over the weekend, after hitting out against the court ruling on Friday, that he would impose a 15% tariff rate on all countries instead. That was up from the 10% he had announced a day earlier. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. The policy, under a US law known as section 122, limits such action to 150 days' duration. If the statute is to be extended, Congressional approval must be obtained. It had been unclear whether this 15% rate would apply to countries such as the UK, which had completed deals with the US to avoid the worst of the punitive tariffs announced last April. What's the UK government doing? Despite the uncertainty businesses face, the prime minister's official spokesman said he remains hopeful Washington will \"honour\" its previously agreed \"preferential deal\" and that talks had been under way. \"Discussions are happening at all levels\", he added. Asked if the UK could impose retaliatory tariffs on the US, the spokesman told journalists: \"Nothing is off the table.\" Read more: Trump creates more tariff mess for the worldAbout half of Trump's tariffs are now null and void Business Secretary Peter Kyle spoke to his US counterpart Jamieson Greer over the weekend and \"underlined his concerns about further uncertainty for business and reinforced the need to honour the UK-US deal\", the spokesman also said. He was unable to say when the government might get clarity on how the tariffs would apply to British goods and services, or whether agreements on trade in steel and cars would be honoured. Global chaos Companies and governments across the world are grappling with the latest trade reality. The world's biggest trading bloc, the European Union (EU), announced on Monday afternoon it would put ratification of its deal with the US on hold in response to the evolving situation. \"Nobody knows what will happen\", the European Parliament's international trade committee chief Bernd Lange said. \"Clarity and legal certainty are needed before any further steps can be taken,\" he added. On Monday, Mr Trump issued a warning on his Truth Social platform. \"Any Country that wants to 'play games' with the ridiculous Supreme Court decision, especially those that have 'ripped off' the USA for years, and even decades, will be met with a much higher tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to,\" he wrote. Meanwhile, Democrats planned to unveil a bill requiring US Customs and Border Protection to issue companies refunds with interest for sums paid to bring items into the US. A stock market sell-off continued from Friday into Monday. Most major stock indexes in Europe closed down as their US equivalents also fell."

The UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) said it had received four separate reports of incidents against Premier League players in the last three days. Sky News is aware of six incidents of racial abuse against footballers across the UK's football leagues - including the Scottish Premiership - from Friday to Sunday. Chelsea's Wesley Fofana and Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri were racially abused on Instagram after the clubs played out a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Meta has removed the accounts and messages behind the abuse of both players, while Lancashire Constabulary said it was working with the club and the UKFPU to investigate further. In a statement, Chelsea said they were \"appalled and disgusted\" by the abuse, and that it stands \"unequivocally with Wes\".

The club took the step of publishing the uncensored racist posts to name the accounts on their website, and reported the incident to Meta and the West Midlands Police. Sunderland's Romaine Mundle deactivated his Instagram account after also being sent racist abuse, following the club's 1-3 defeat to Fulham on Sunday. The Wearside club said it has reported the abuse to Meta and the relevant authorities, and said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\" Meanwhile, two Rangers players - centre-back Emmanuel Fernandez and winger Djeidi Gassama - were racially abused on Instagram following a 2-2 draw at Livingston. Both players appeared to have been abused by the same social media account user. Cheshire Chief Constable Mark Roberts, head of the UKFPU, said: \"There is absolutely no place for racial abuse, either online or in person, and anyone who believes they can hide behind their keyboards should think again. \"The UKFPU condemns this abhorrent behaviour and we will ensure that, through our dedicated team of officers, we do everything possible to identify those responsible and bring them to justice.\" The Premier League also condemned the abuse of the players, and said: \"There are serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations. \"Football is for everyone - there is no room for racism.\" UK charity Kick It Out repeated calls for social media platforms to do more to address the problem, adding that \"the sad fact is, we know it [racial abuse] happens regularly\". \"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow,\" it added. \"Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\" Read more from Sky News:Who is 'El Mencho', and why does his death matter?Parents charged with murder of three-month-old son The abuse comes after Gianluca Prestianni was provisionally suspended by UEFA for Benfica's Champions League game against Real Madrid on Wednesday following allegations he racially abused Vinicius Junior.

Now 93 years old, he was found unfit to stand trial, so instead a trial-of-facts was held at Bradford Crown Court to determine whether or not he had committed the acts alleged. Such trials cannot pass a guilty verdict, but his assistant, Linda Brunning, has been found guilty of indecent assault, and aiding and abetting Phillips in his crimes. The court heard that Phillips controlled Skircoat Lodge and, with Brunning's help, ran the place \"more like a prison\", according to a former member of staff. Prosecutor Michelle Colborne KC said the pair carefully picked their victims, using the children's files to identify who could be manipulated. \n                  Politics latest: Mandelson pictured leaving police station after arrest\n                 \n                  Peter Mandelson arrested and led away from home by police\n                 \n                  'Simply a miracle': Baby boy born from dead donor womb transplant in UK first\n                 \"They told them no-one cared about them, they told them no-one would believe them,\" Ms Colborne said. \"If they ran away from Skircoat Lodge, they were taken straight back by police, accused of being troublemakers.\" In this way, the court heard, abuse at the home went on \"unreported against a backdrop of legitimacy\" for almost 20 years. The jury was told that Phillips lived in a flat leading to the girls' bedrooms, giving him \"unfettered access\" to his victims. \"During the course of almost two decades, Malcolm Phillips used his power to isolate specific children to use for his sexual gratification, and he wasn't the only one,\" Ms Colborne said. The prosecutor described Brunning as \"a large and domineering woman who took pleasure in physically hurting and humiliating children\". She continued: \"At times she would perform sexual assaults on them, at her worst she facilitated the abuse by Malcolm Phillips upon a small defenceless child.\" Brunning was found guilty of restraining one boy while Phillips sexually assaulted him and indecently assaulting another herself while drying him after a shower. Phillips' \"regime of fear\" only came to an end when he was suspended in 1994 after an investigation, the court heard. Skircoat Lodge closed two years later. He was subsequently jailed in 2001 for sexual offences against eight female residents. In a 2019 police statement, he branded his victims liars and said he had been the victim of a high-profile media campaign to discredit him. But the jury found Phillips, of Tyseley, Birmingham, had committed three counts of indecent assault, two of indecency with a child, three of indecent assault on a male person, two of buggery, and two of rape. He was not in court.

She put her head into her hands and sobbed as the verdicts were read out. She has been remanded into custody until 27 April , when Judge Kirstie Watson said she would \"inevitably\" receive a jail sentence The court heard that a medical report would be prepared for Phillips, but police said there were \"only a limited number of orders available to a judge\" in a trial-of-facts.

        "Content": "Rob Reiner's son Nick has pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of the actor-director and his wife Michele Singer Reiner. Reiner's lawyer, deputy public defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he appeared behind glass in court in Los Angeles. The 32-year-old, the third of Rob Reiner's four children, has been held without bail since his arrest hours after the 78-year-old director and his wife were found dead at their home in the Brentwood area of LA on 14 December. Reiner, who was in court with his head shaved and wearing brown jail clothes, talked briefly to his lawyer before the hearing and spoke only to answer yes to a question from the judge. The judge told Reiner to return to court on 29 April for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors will present evidence and a judge will decide if it is enough for Reiner to go to trial. Speaking outside court, district attorney Nathan Hochman said his office still has not decided whether it will seek the death penalty for the defendant. Reiner's previous lawyer quit the case at a hearing in January because of what he called circumstances beyond his and his client's control. The high-profile private lawyer said legal ethics would not allow him to say why, but speaking outside the courthouse he declared that \"pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder\". He was replaced by a public defender. Read more: Rob Reiner spoke to Eric Idle about future before murder Meanwhile, deputy district attorney Habib Balian said his office is still awaiting a full post-mortem report, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defence. Rob Reiner and his 70-year-old wife died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\", the LA County Medical Examiner said in its initial findings. Authorities said they were killed hours before their bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the release of further details. Rob Reiner's work included some of the most memorable films of the 1980s and 1990s, including This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride."

Al Carns, a former special forces colonel in the Royal Marines, said Ukraine is on the frontline of Europe's defences as Vladimir Putin's full-scale onslaught enters its fifth year. But he warned Britain is not immune, with Russia attacking the UK and its interests across four different kinds of frontline. The minister spoke about daily threats in the North Atlantic, the Arctic and cyber attacks, as well as the danger posed by fake news and other forms of disinformation spread online - designed to sow or amplify divisions within UK society or between Britain and its friends. 'History rhymes' Asked whether he agreed with comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Mr Putin had already started World War Three with his invasion of Ukraine, Mr Carns signalled that he saw similarities between the challenges faced today and the global landscape in the three years running up to the Second World War. \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme,\" he said. \"And if you were to go back to, you know, 1936, '37, '38… there's definitely a lot of similarities. \"What I would say is that Ukraine is absolutely the front line of European defence, and they're doing an absolutely sterling job.\" The UK's frontline While Ukraine is on the frontline of Russia's conventional military machine, the armed forces minister said the UK is also in Moscow's sights - though the conflict is raging in a grey zone that sits under the threshold of all-out war. \"A lot of people say that the UK doesn't have a frontline,\" Mr Carns said. \"Well, the reality is we do. It sits in the North Atlantic. It sits in the High North. It sits in cyberspace. And it sits in influence - and I think that is being battled out every day.\" He described how Russia has various means to inflict harm away from bombs and bullets. \"It's not through sharp power. It's through influence, through cyberspace, through industrial espionage,\" the minister said. \"It's through sowing division and discord into this country, into Europe. Drive us apart from the US, apart from our European allies, to fragment and then isolate and defeat.\""

        "Content": "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have thrown their weight behind plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession. The intervention from the Commonwealth countries comes amid calls for the former duke to be prevented from ever becoming king. Backing the calls, a spokesperson for New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the country would support the UK government if it proposes to take action. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had already written to Sir Keir Starmer on Monday backing the measure. Andrew was arrested and interviewed under caution on Thursday 19 February, over allegations of misconduct in public office - something he strongly denies. Politics latest - follow live Following his arrest, calls for MPs to consider passing a law to remove the 66-year-old from the line of succession have grown. In his letter, Mr Albanese wrote: \"In light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession. \"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation. \"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\" Changing the line of succession would require the agreement of all 15 realms of the Commonwealth where the British monarch is also the head of state. Only New Zealand and Australia have so far backed the move. Sky's royal commentator Alastair Bruce said Albanese's letter \"must help the prime minister\", but warned that it may not be so simple to get all to agree. He said: \"It takes a lot of time, and I think parliaments across the world who have the King as head of state will not be looking forward to having to find time to do this.\" Asked about support for the move, Bruce said that \"particularly since Elizabeth II died\", we are living in \"a post-deferential age\", when \"the attitude of people to institutions generally, not just the Royal Family, has altered\". He added that the monarchy was \"suffering at the moment from the fact that its reputation is hugely damaged, and it will want to see to it that a solution is found that those who need justice receive it\". The UK government is understood to be considering introducing legislation to remove the former duke from the line of succession. But any such move would only happen once the ongoing police investigation into him has concluded. Andrew is currently eighth in line to the throne, behind Prince William and his three children, as well as Prince Harry and his two children. Australia has had a republican movement for well over a century, and it became the official policy of the country's governing Labor Party more than three decades ago, in 1991. In 1999, a referendum on becoming a republic was held. Some 55% of voters supported remaining a constitutional monarchy, while 45% wanted to become a republic. The latest polls show similar results, although republicanism is stronger among younger people. Mr Albanese said on Friday that his government was not intending to hold another referendum, despite his personal support for having an Australian head of state."

The Palace said in a statement on Monday that the pair met at Clarence House, the official home of the King and Queen, while repairs are made to Buckingham Palace. The Frenchwoman's book, titled Hymn To Life: Shame Has To Change Sides, was launched at London's Royal Festival Hall on Friday, with readings given by Hollywood actresses Kate Winslet, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliet Stevenson.

Camilla began speaking in French, joking that she had studied the language \"60 years ago\" but had \"forgotten\" it all. During the informal chat, Ms Pelicot talked about receiving \"incredible strength\" from people, and in response, the Queen told her she had \"so much support\". Camilla mentioned the standing ovations the survivor received from audiences.

John Davidson MBE was attending the awards ceremony after inspiring the film, I Swear, which dramatises his life with severe Tourette syndrome. The condition is characterised by sudden, involuntary, repetitive sounds or movements, known as tics, which cause Davidson to call out inappropriate words. That's what happened at the BAFTAs, when he called out a racial slur while two black actors, Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo, were on stage presenting the first award of the night. Now Davidson has spoken out about the incident, saying that he is \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning\". He also praised the BAFTA organisers for notifying the audience about his tics beforehand and clarifying that they do not reflect his personal beliefs. \"I was heartened by the round of applause that followed this announcement and felt welcomed and understood in an environment that would normally be impossible for me,\" he said. \n                  Robert Aramayo: The Hull actor who's taken the BAFTAs by storm\n                 \n                  BBC removes BAFTAs from iPlayer and apologises after racial slur yelled during show\n                 \n                  British rising star Robert Aramayo beats Timothee Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio to acting BAFTA - as One Battle After Another named best film\n                 In the aftermath of Davidson's shout, the two actors on stage appeared to pause momentarily before continuing with the presentation. Davidson said he then chose to leave the ceremony early because \"I was aware of the distress my tics were causing\". The host, Alan Cumming, subsequently acknowledged the interruption and explained again about Tourette's. In a statement, BAFTA said the slur was a source of \"incomparable trauma and pain for so many\" and apologised for putting its guests in a \"very difficult situation\". The academy's statement said: \"Early in the ceremony a loud tic in the form of a profoundly offensive term was heard by many people in the room. \"Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at the time, and we apologise unreservedly to them, and to all those impacted. We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their incredible dignity and professionalism. \"During the ceremony, John chose to leave the auditorium and watch the rest of the ceremony from a screen, and we would like to thank him for his dignity and consideration of others, on what should have been a night of celebration for him. \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologise to all. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\" The ceremony, with the offending moment intact, remained available to watch on BBC iPlayer for over 12 hours.

From Tuesday morning, UK exporters will be subject to a 15% tariff, higher than the 10% agreed under a UK-US deal back in May. \"Unless we hear otherwise from the US, we are looking at a further 5% hike for many goods from 5am GMT, tomorrow.

The policy, under a US law known as section 122, limits such action to 150 days' duration. If the statute is to be extended, Congressional approval must be obtained. It had been unclear whether this 15% rate would apply to countries such as the UK, which had completed deals with the US to avoid the worst of the punitive tariffs announced last April. What's the UK government doing? Despite the uncertainty businesses face, the prime minister's official spokesman said he remains hopeful Washington will \"honour\" its previously agreed \"preferential deal\" and that talks had been under way. \"Discussions are happening at all levels\", he added. Asked if the UK could impose retaliatory tariffs on the US, the spokesman told journalists: \"Nothing is off the table.\" Read more: Trump creates more tariff mess for the worldAbout half of Trump's tariffs are now null and void Business Secretary Peter Kyle spoke to his US counterpart Jamieson Greer over the weekend and \"underlined his concerns about further uncertainty for business and reinforced the need to honour the UK-US deal\", the spokesman also said. He was unable to say when the government might get clarity on how the tariffs would apply to British goods and services, or whether agreements on trade in steel and cars would be honoured. Global chaos Companies and governments across the world are grappling with the latest trade reality. The world's biggest trading bloc, the European Union (EU), announced on Monday afternoon it would put ratification of its deal with the US on hold in response to the evolving situation. \"Nobody knows what will happen\", the European Parliament's international trade committee chief Bernd Lange said. \"Clarity and legal certainty are needed before any further steps can be taken,\" he added. On Monday, Mr Trump issued a warning on his Truth Social platform. \"Any Country that wants to 'play games' with the ridiculous Supreme Court decision, especially those that have 'ripped off' the USA for years, and even decades, will be met with a much higher tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to,\" he wrote. Meanwhile, Democrats planned to unveil a bill requiring US Customs and Border Protection to issue companies refunds with interest for sums paid to bring items into the US. A stock market sell-off continued from Friday into Monday. Most major stock indexes in Europe closed down as their US equivalents also fell."

        "Content": "An investigation has been launched after several football clubs reported online racial abuse of their players over the weekend. The UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) said it had received four separate reports of incidents against Premier League players in the last three days. Sky News is aware of six incidents of racial abuse against footballers across the UK's football leagues - including the Scottish Premiership - from Friday to Sunday. Chelsea's Wesley Fofana and Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri were racially abused on Instagram after the clubs played out a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Meta has removed the accounts and messages behind the abuse of both players, while Lancashire Constabulary said it was working with the club and the UKFPU to investigate further. In a statement, Chelsea said they were \"appalled and disgusted\" by the abuse, and that it stands \"unequivocally with Wes\". Burnley said it was \"disgusted by the online racist abuse directed at Hannibal following today's Premier League fixture\", adding: \"There is no place for this in our society, and we condemn it unreservedly.\" \n                  Nottingham Forest sack Sean Dyche - their third managerial departure this season\n                 \n                  Football watchdog pitches up to Premier League clubs summit\n                 \n                  Former Premier League referee David Coote avoids jail sentence over sexual video of schoolboy\n                 Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare was also racially abused on Instagram after a 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Sunday. The club took the step of publishing the uncensored racist posts to name the accounts on their website, and reported the incident to Meta and the West Midlands Police. Sunderland's Romaine Mundle deactivated his Instagram account after also being sent racist abuse, following the club's 1-3 defeat to Fulham on Sunday. The Wearside club said it has reported the abuse to Meta and the relevant authorities, and said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\" Meanwhile, two Rangers players - centre-back Emmanuel Fernandez and winger Djeidi Gassama - were racially abused on Instagram following a 2-2 draw at Livingston. Both players appeared to have been abused by the same social media account user. Cheshire Chief Constable Mark Roberts, head of the UKFPU, said: \"There is absolutely no place for racial abuse, either online or in person, and anyone who believes they can hide behind their keyboards should think again. \"The UKFPU condemns this abhorrent behaviour and we will ensure that, through our dedicated team of officers, we do everything possible to identify those responsible and bring them to justice.\" The Premier League also condemned the abuse of the players, and said: \"There are serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations. \"Football is for everyone - there is no room for racism.\" UK charity Kick It Out repeated calls for social media platforms to do more to address the problem, adding that \"the sad fact is, we know it [racial abuse] happens regularly\". \"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow,\" it added. \"Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\" Read more from Sky News:Who is 'El Mencho', and why does his death matter?Parents charged with murder of three-month-old son The abuse comes after Gianluca Prestianni was provisionally suspended by UEFA for Benfica's Champions League game against Real Madrid on Wednesday following allegations he racially abused Vinicius Junior.

        "Content": "Team GB's athletes have returned home to a rapturous welcome after their most successful Winter Olympics ever. The competitors landed at London's Gatwick Airport on Monday morning after securing a record-equalling tally of medals. They were led out of arrivals to cheers from the waiting public by Matt Weston, the double gold medal-winning skeleton competitor. Team GB's total haul of five medals was also achieved in 2014 and 2018, but their three golds in 2026 were more than at any other winter Games. They took home two golds in the middle weekend of the Olympics: the first for Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale in the mixed team snowboarding, and the second for Matt Weston and Tabby Stoecker in the mixed team skeleton. Weston won his second gold medal of the Games alongside Stoecker, after picking up his first in the men's singles skeleton on 13 February. Stoecker said: \"This welcome has been completely overwhelming. I don't think it's quite hit me yet how much the nation had got behind us. And that's just incredible, especially for our sport, which is quite niche, so we don't always get that much attention.\" Read more:Who is Matt Weston?Curling 'cheating' controversy explained Nightingale was wearing his gold medal as he walked into the arrivals hall.

He added that he would \"not think about curling for a few months at least, and [would] try to get on the golf course.\" Halfpipe skiing bronze medallist, Zoe Atkin, described the experience as \"surreal,\" saying her medal was \"really heavy, but it feels really good\". Atkin, whose sister also won bronze in the 2018 Winter Olympics, joked that \"when I get home, we're going to weigh them\". She said seeing her sister win in 2018 was a \"huge inspiration\" and \"to be able to back her up eight years later with my own bronze is just so special\"."

        "Headline": "The boy, who cannot be named, was accused of preparing acts of terrorism but a jury was unable to reach a verdict.",
        "Content": "By Duncan Gardham, security journalist  A schoolboy has been found guilty of terror offences after joining a banned far-right group and researching a synagogue, encouraged by Russian extremists. The boy, who was 15-years-old at the time, was unanimously found guilty of possession of terrorist documents, dissemination of terrorist documents and membership of a proscribed terrorist organisation. The jury was unable on Monday to reach a verdict on whether he prepared acts of terrorism after the teenager, who is now 16 and cannot be named because of his age, said he was playing an online \"character\" and never intended to go through with his plans. The CPS said in court that it would not be seeking a retrial on the more serious charge. After he was arrested at his father's home in a village in Northumberland - where he lived after his parents split up - police found a series of entries from a journal in which the teenager wrote ​​​​​​about pupils at his school. \"I swear to God I just hate my f***ing school,\" the court heard he wrote. \"I want to do horrible things to the people in my school. Some of them should be shot.\" On the same page, the boy ranked mass murderers with the neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Breivik topping his list, Leeds Crown Court was told. \n                  Ten British 'far-right activists' banned from France over 'reconnaissance and destruction' against small boats\n                 \n                  The rise of Christian nationalism in Britain and its relationship with the far right\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney reveals summit plan to combat far-right threat as he accuses Nigel Farage of being 'accomplice to Russian agenda'\n                 Officers also found a \"to-do list\" of weapons and explosives after the arrest, and that the boy's bedroom was adorned with white supremacist flags. Michelle Heeley KC, prosecuting, told the jury that the youth had \"an arsenal worthy of any young right-wing terrorist\" and his diary and social media messages were the words of a teenage boy \"filled with hate and racism\". She added that he was \"building up to real life action\" and had a GoPro camera in order to livestream the attack like other mass killers. Speaking during the trial, the boy said: \"I felt like I was getting addicted a bit. It didn't feel like real life, it was a completely different world. I didn't really know how to stop. It felt exciting.\" He previously also told the jury that he joined in with racist conversations on Snapchat and shared \"gore\" videos showing beheadings because they were \"going around\" and he wanted to \"fit in\". Jurors were told the boy had joined far-right groups on Telegram as early as 2023, and had researched a Newcastle synagogue, electrical substations and mobile phone towers.

The drug Trump is waging war onHow four years of war in Ukraine changed two main figuresAustralia backs removing Andrew from line of succession Russian told boy 'we're willing to help' The court also heard that the boy's activity escalated after he messaged a group called The Base - a proscribed terror group which encourages followers to carry out acts of violence in order to ignite a race war - on Telegram in August 2024. In February last year, a Russian user, who was claiming to be the leader of The Base, was urging the youth to take action, saying \"we're willing to help you\". The Russian user also told him in a separate message: \"Brother, do not have doubts. You are doing a benefit, a good deed for your community... \"You are a warrior, brother, and we are very proud of you. We will help you with everything you need because you are a part of us, of the brotherhood.\" Frida Hussain KC, defending, told the court that the boy was \"desperately lonely\", had been \"plagued\" with thoughts of killing himself, and created an online persona as a distraction. During the trial, Ms Hussain asked him: \"Writing in these terms about harming other people, was this anything you wanted to do in reality?\" The boy replied: \"Just thoughts in my head. I never intended to harm anyone.\" Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, warned parents: \"This case provides a stark reminder around the dangers of extreme content online and how individuals can be drawn into serious offending.\" He recommended a website for called Internet Matters which provides practical advice on how to help children. Judge Mr Justice Wall said the teenager will now be sentenced in Leeds on 27 March."

Al Carns, a former special forces colonel in the Royal Marines, said Ukraine is on the frontline of Europe's defences as Vladimir Putin's full-scale onslaught enters its fifth year. But he warned Britain is not immune, with Russia attacking the UK and its interests across four different kinds of frontline. The minister spoke about daily threats in the North Atlantic, the Arctic and cyber attacks, as well as the danger posed by fake news and other forms of disinformation spread online - designed to sow or amplify divisions within UK society or between Britain and its friends. 'History rhymes' Asked whether he agreed with comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Mr Putin had already started World War Three with his invasion of Ukraine, Mr Carns signalled that he saw similarities between the challenges faced today and the global landscape in the three years running up to the Second World War. \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme,\" he said. \"And if you were to go back to, you know, 1936, '37, '38… there's definitely a lot of similarities. \"What I would say is that Ukraine is absolutely the front line of European defence, and they're doing an absolutely sterling job.\" The UK's frontline While Ukraine is on the frontline of Russia's conventional military machine, the armed forces minister said the UK is also in Moscow's sights - though the conflict is raging in a grey zone that sits under the threshold of all-out war. \"A lot of people say that the UK doesn't have a frontline,\" Mr Carns said. \"Well, the reality is we do. It sits in the North Atlantic. It sits in the High North. It sits in cyberspace. And it sits in influence - and I think that is being battled out every day.\" He described how Russia has various means to inflict harm away from bombs and bullets. \"It's not through sharp power. It's through influence, through cyberspace, through industrial espionage,\" the minister said. \"It's through sowing division and discord into this country, into Europe. Drive us apart from the US, apart from our European allies, to fragment and then isolate and defeat.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief correspondent\n       The Mexican authorities would've expected a violent backlash after the killing of El Mencho, one of the country's most powerful cartel bosses. But it's likely they'll have been surprised at the scale of violence across so much of the country. That violence appears to have calmed down for now, but there's nothing to indicate it will simply peter out. 'El Mencho' killing - as it happened When incidents like this happen, the cartels usually respond in three ways. The first is a show of strength, aimed at deterring the authorities from carrying out more raids - that's what has just happened. The second is often fighting between factions within the same cartel or turf wars with other cartels trying to muscle their way into the territory - something gang members are already talking about. The third is to launch a war against the Mexican government and its security forces. It wouldn't be what we have seen over the past 24 hours; it would be something far more organised. This will no doubt be on the government's mind. El Mencho was head of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the only ones I haven't managed to access in my time covering Mexico's drug wars. Jalisco New Generation are notoriously violent and untrustworthy, and our go-betweens in Mexico have always warned us not to even try approach them, although we have tried, but with little success. This cartel, along with the Sinaloa drug cartel, is the top producer of a range of illegal drugs, including the opioid fentanyl, a drug predominantly made in Mexico and exported to the United States, where it kills thousands of users every year. Just because its leader has been killed, it doesn't mean that Jalisco New Generation as a cartel is anywhere near finished. US President Donald Trump's war on drugs has mainly focused on Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Mexico - and ever since Venezuela's Nicholas Maduro was captured in January, Mexico's government has come under even more pressure to take the war to the cartels inside Mexico and show some results. Read more on Sky News:El Mencho's death followed partner's visitWho is 'El Mencho' and why does his death matter? El Mencho's scalp will be much appreciated by the Trump administration and will likely take off some of the pressure on Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's president. But with the football World Cup not too far away, and Mexico, like the United States and Canada, a host nation, President Sheinbaum's government needs to contain the fallout from this very quickly, or people may not risk going to Mexico."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @alexrossiSKY\n The war in Ukraine has become a grinding test of attrition, where movement on the map is measured in metres, not miles. In the frozen wastelands where this fight is being waged, it feels never-ending. At stake are huge consequences not just for Ukrainians, but for Europe and the wider international order - whether borders can be changed by force. On the ground, the conflict feels less like grand strategy and more like a daily slog to survive. We joined a unit from the 117th Brigade, tasked with defending one of the most heavily contested areas of the Donbas, known as the \"fortress belt\". Ukraine latest: Putin has started WWIII, says Zelenskyy, on war's anniversary eve Just getting to their positions is a test of nerve, as moving forward often means walking across open ground. It is terrifying. All around, the landscape bears the scars of war. It used to be only the scream of a shell you had to fear, but now it is also the menacing buzz of a drone - and the sky here is full of them. A drone spots us The soldiers scan the skies for any unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and use handheld drone detectors. One drone heads over our position, hunting for a target, and the radio soon alerts us that it is tracking back. The drone detector doesn't stop bleeping, indicating that our movement has been spotted. We hear it before we see it, and the increasingly louder whizzing sound means the drone is getting closer and closer. The deputy commander we are with opens fire with his assault rifle, and another soldier joins the fight. While hitting a small, fast-moving target is not easy, it's the only way to combat the threat and has become routine for the soldiers. We are relieved when we see the drone fall from the sky, but there is no time to linger, as more drones could follow and artillery might be called in on our position. The next leg of the journey to the village where the unit is stationed is by quad bike, racing over icy roads. As we speed forward, smashed Ukrainian vehicles lie abandoned along the route; they are stark reminders of the danger ahead. Ukrainian drones are our eyes in the sky, tracking our movement overhead, thereby offering some protection. Cheap, mass-produced and deadly The small \"drone hunter\" unit operates largely in the shadows, helping protect the logistical hub of Sloviansk, a key city anchoring the defensive line in eastern Ukraine. Inside their bunker, where they live and plan missions, they show us a drone they shot down that morning. It is cheap, mass-produced and deadly. Bohdan, the commander of the anti-aircraft battery unit of the 117th Brigade, explains: \"There are men working with pump-action shotguns because the drones fly at their lowest altitude there. \"That is within the effective range for a shotgun. But here, they fly higher and faster so the Kalashnikov is the most effective tool.\" Desperate fight for survival The drones are relentless, and the landscape has been battered by years of war. The soldiers show us something extraordinary: two civilians are still living in this shattered place. For four years, Alexander and his wife have survived under constant bombardment. He tells me they are frightened, but have no money and nowhere to go. As we speak, we move for cover, as another drone has been spotted overhead. For the men defending this territory, the danger is constant. One soldier describes the rhythm of their days: \"It happens two, three times a day: icy roads, sleeper drones, flying drones, and the Russians. It couldn't be more dangerous. Threats from everywhere - within seconds.\" Life in eastern Ukraine is a desperate fight for survival. Secret underground bunker We are taken to a secret location deep in a forest. Access to the brigade's headquarters is tightly restricted. Inside, we descend into a bunker - a labyrinth of screens and monitors that reflects what this war has become. This is now a conflict of microchips and mud, with drones sketching digital kill chains and men doing whatever they must to survive. Colonel Dmytro Yaroshenko, the commander of the 117th Brigade, says the transformation has been profound: \"The war has changed fundamentally. \"We used to fight 'on horseback', so to speak; now we fight in the sky. We're even taking down helicopters with drones. Not my brigade specifically, but there are units doing it.\" On one screen, he shows us what remains of a group of Russian soldiers who tried to use the mist to launch a probing attack. Surveillance drones - and the algorithms guiding them - see everything and everyone. \"Logistics are currently a nightmare because technology has evolved so much; drones are flying almost everywhere. If the enemy spots a vehicle, it's highly likely to be quickly destroyed,\" the colonel adds. Another image appears: a bunker where Russian troops were spotted entering. Attack drones are called in, striking the hideout. No one comes out. The 21st century has fused with the muddied trench battlefields of the First World War, and the result is grim and brutal. The fighting here may feel remote to those thousands of miles away, but the implications are not.

So far, only nine bodies of the victims have been identified. But one of them was a 24-year-old from the UK, according to the Dhading district police office. A Chinese national and a 27-year-old woman from New Zealand were among the injured. Police are investigating the cause of the crash. Government official Mohan Prasad Neupane said that rescuers reached the site soon after it happened.

        "Content": "Gianluca Prestianni has been provisionally suspended by UEFA for Benfica's Champions League game against Real Madrid on Wednesday following allegations he racially abused Vinicius Junior. The 20-year-old was banned for one match, while an investigation into alleged racism directed at the Real Madrid forward continues, which could lead to further punishment, UEFA said. Prestianni denied making a racist slur, claiming Vinicius \"misinterpreted what he thought he heard\" at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal. Benfica, who last week said they stood by their player, said in a statement on Monday they \"regret being deprived ‌of the player while the case is still under investigation and will appeal UEFA's decision\". Last week's Champions League knockout round play-off first leg was stopped for 11 minutes early in the second half, after the Brazilian forward told the referee he suffered racial abuse. TV footage showed Prestianni covering his mouth with his shirt repeatedly before making comments that ⁠Vinicius and nearby teammates interpreted as a racial slur. Cameras picked up the 25-year-old telling French referee Francois Letexier he had been targeted in a comment made to him by the Argentine winger. \n                  Russian invasion of Ukraine shares 'similarities' with run-up to Second World War, armed forces minister says\n                 \n                  Violence triggered by killing of notorious Mexican drug lord could hit the World Cup \n                 \n                  Ukraine war has 'changed fundamentally', commander says, as trench fighting fuses with 21st century\n                 Anti-racism protocol used UEFA's anti-racism protocol was activated but no further action was taken during the match as there was no evidence against Prestianni. The match was halted shortly after the away side went ahead thanks to a Vinicius goal, which he celebrated by the Benfica corner flag, upsetting local fans and players. The forward was shown a yellow card after his celebration. Both coaches, Benfica's Jose Mourinho and Madrid's Alvaro Arbeloa, talked to Vinicius at one point. Real's players threatened ⁠to leave the pitch ​as tensions rose, but the referee ​eventually allowed the match to resume. It finished 1-0 to Real. Mourinho accused of 'gaslighting' Mourinho, who was roundly criticised for his comments about the incident after the game, will not be at Tuesday's pre-match press conference ahead of the second leg in Madrid on Wednesday. The Portuguese coach appeared to suggest Vinicius had brought any abuse upon himself with his celebration, and said that \"a stadium where Vinicius plays, something happens, always\".

        "Content": "A court in Hong Kong has upheld the convictions and sentences of pro-democracy activists in the biggest case brought under a Beijing-imposed national security law. The appeals were part of the so-called \"Hong Kong 47\" case, in which many leading pro-democracy activists and politicians were arrested in early 2021 and charged with conspiracy to commit subversion. Hong Kong's government said the court's decision showed that anyone endangering national security would be punished in accordance with the law. The case centred on an unofficial primary election organised by pro-democracy campaigners in mid-2020 to select the strongest candidates for a council election. The prosecution alleged they were conspiring to win a majority in order to paralyse the government by blocking the city's annual budget, in a bid to force Hong Kong's leader to resign. The mass prosecution of 47 activists crushed much of the city's once-thriving pro-democracy movement, which saw massive anti-government protests in 2019. Forty-five of the defendants were sentenced to between four and 10 years in 2024, drawing criticism from foreign governments and rights groups. Eleven activists who appealed their convictions lost their bids. They included former politicians Leung Kwok-hung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Raymond Chan and Helena Wong. All appeals over their sentences, brought by 10 of them and another activist, were also dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Lawrence Lau, a pro-democracy former district councillor, was one of two activists acquitted in the case. Judges upheld his acquittal following an appeal from the prosecution. After hearing the result, the defendants appeared calm and waved to their families and supporters. Some people had waited outside since Saturday to secure a seat in the courtroom. After the ruling, Chan Po-ying, the wife of activist Leung Kwok-hung, said: \"What crimes have they committed?\" So far, 18 of the 45 convicted democrats have been released after serving their jail terms, including former district councillors Jimmy Sham and Lester Shum. Officials in Hong Kong and Beijing insist that they received a fair trial, and say the national security law in 2020 helped restore order following the mass pro-democracy protests.

        "Content": "A visit from a \"romantic partner\" led to the capture and death of one of Mexico's most notorious drug lords, \"El Mencho\", Mexico's defence minister has said. General Ricardo Trevilla Trejo said information from a confidante of one of the crime boss's lovers helped officials quickly plan the raid at his hideout in Tapalpa, in the state of Jalisco. \"El Mencho\", the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), whose real name was Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, was wounded in the operation to capture him on Sunday and later died in a helicopter while being flown to Mexico City. The US had offered a reward of up to $15m (£11m) for information leading to his arrest. 'El Mencho' killing live updates The CJNG is known for trafficking large quantities of fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine into the US. It was designated a foreign terrorist organisation by Donald Trump's administration in February 2025. During the raid, cartel gunmen reportedly opened fire on security forces, before the fighting moved to a cabin complex in a wooded area, where the drug boss was wounded alongside two of his bodyguards. The trio were transported by helicopter to Mexico City but \"died on the way\", general Trevilla said. He said several rocket launchers were found with them, but the men were not able to use them. Eight cartel members were killed in the raid, he said, while grenades, ammo and armoured vehicles were seized. Read more: Who is 'El Mencho' and why does his death matter? The operation sparked waves of violence across Mexico, as cartel members blocked roads, burned cars and carried out retaliatory attacks. At least 73 people died in the attempt to capture the CJNG boss and the violent aftermath of his death, officials said. The figure, taken by security officials, included security forces, suspected cartel members and others. Officials did not offer further details and the circumstances of most of the deaths were unclear. Mexico's security minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said 25 members of the National Guard had been killed in six separate cartel attacks, as well as an agent from the state prosecutor's office, a security guard and a woman he did not identify. The crime boss's death triggered \"27 cowardly attacks against authorities in Jalisco\", Mr Garcia Harfuch said, ⁠adding that 30 cartel operatives were killed ​as well as one bystander in Jalisco, while four other cartel members were killed in the neighbouring state of Michoacan. At least ​70 people have been arrested in seven states. \"We ​are closely monitoring for any kind of reaction ⁠or restructuring within the cartel that could lead to violence,\" he added. On Monday, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum praised the armed forces and said the country was now \"at peace\" and \"calm\", adding that none of the 250-plus roadblocks across 20 states remained. She said the most important thing now was to guarantee peace and security for the entire population of Mexico. The White House has confirmed that the US provided intelligence to support the operation and applauded Mexico's army for taking down a man who was one of the most wanted criminals in both countries. The UK Foreign Office urged Britons in Mexico to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. A spokesperson said: \"You should exercise extreme caution, follow local authorities' advice, including orders to stay indoors and avoid non-essential travel in affected areas.\""

Now the letter from Australia's prime minister just emphasises the global reach of the Andrew issue. On Friday, we heard that No 10 was looking at legislation to remove him from the line of succession, but to actually make it happen, the 14 other realms, countries that share our monarch, also need to agree. Follow along live Anthony Albanese has fired the starting gun, and we wait to see if others will join. The fact that he's first may not come as a surprise; in the past, he's had a complex relationship with the monarchy, raising the idea of a referendum in Australia about them becoming a republic. Although the success of the King and Queen's visit in 2024 appears to have muted that for now. When you look at the line of succession, the likelihood of Andrew ever becoming king could not seem more remote, but, as is so often the case with the royal family, it's all about the optics. It looks terrible. That's ultimately why the King took what was seen as the ultimate action last year, stripping him of his titles, his birthright to be a prince and moving him from his Windsor home.

The King's statement from last week emphasised their current position that, for now, he must remain silent while not turning a blind eye to the enormity of what is playing out. Andrew has always strenuously denied any wrongdoing."

        "Content": "\n          Live news reporter\n              @markgwyatt\n Throughout 1,460 days of the Ukraine war, two figures have remained central. The decisions made by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin, their leadership styles, and their standing on the international stage have shaped a conflict soon entering its fifth year. But how have the war's two central figures changed in the past four years? Sky News has explored each leader's domestic and global image, as well as how the conflict has shaped them personally, in this piece. Follow live updates of the Ukraine war Volodymyr Zelenskyy Mr Zelenskyy has undergone one of the most dramatic image transformations of any contemporary leader in the past four years, going from a relatively inexperienced president to a central symbol of resistance and democratic defiance. While his background in acting made his rise to Ukraine’s highest office an unlikely one, Mr Zelenskyy fitted the presidential mould in his early years, at least in appearance. Often seen clean-shaven and suited, images of Ukraine's leader from before the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 now make him appear boyish compared to the hardened wartime leader of 2026. Mr Zelenskyy is now rarely spotted in anything other than military fatigues, something that famously irked Donald Trump when he hosted the Ukrainian president for a disastrous meeting at the White House last year. Zelenskyy at home Domestically, the 2022 invasion saw Mr Zelenskyy experience an initial surge in approval and trust as Ukrainians rallied behind their leader. His decision to stay in Kyiv and lead from the capital, even after offers to evacuate for his own safety, became symbolic of Ukrainian resistance, enhancing his credibility and sense of purpose. \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,\" he reportedly told US officials as Russia's 35-mile armoured convoy closed in on the capital. From that moment on, Mr Zelenskyy has remained a central unifying figure in Ukraine, providing nightly video updates to inform and rally his people and making visits to frontline towns to inspire his troops. Inevitably, as the conflict has progressed, economic strain, war fatigue, and high-profile political controversies (including protests over anti-corruption institutions and an investigation into large-scale bribery in the energy sector) have seen his domestic approval ratings decline slightly, though he still maintains broad support overall. Zelenskyy abroad Mr Zelenskyy's global standing skyrocketed after 2022. He became not just Ukraine's leader but the face of its diplomatic effort, repeatedly addressing parliaments, world leaders and public audiences to sustain foreign support. By framing the war with Russia as a broader struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, Ukraine's president positioned his country on the world stage as defending both European and Western values. He's been successful in his repeated attempts to bring financial and military support to Ukraine and maintained working relationships with key allies throughout the war. He even wrestled Donald Trump back from the brink after their disastrous White House meeting last February. Outside questions remain - largely from Europe - over Mr Zelenskyy's ability to tackle corruption at home, while his reputation in Russia has remained negative, but his image on the world stage overall remains positive. Zelenskyy the man So, what about how the last four years have changed Mr Zelenskyy personally? There is no doubt about the toll the war has taken on the president and his family, as it has for millions of Ukrainians. In the early months of the war, his family were evacuated and taken to secret locations to keep them safe. That separation had a clear impact on Mr Zelenskyy. According to First Lady Olena Zelenska, her husband now appreciates the simple things more, such as communication with his family. \"Send him a photo of his son or tell him what his daughter said. And it touches him very emotionally now,\" she said in 2023. \"He wasn't so sensitive to it before.\" Vladimir Putin Despite hoping to see Ukraine capitulate within days, Russia's invasion has now dragged into its fifth year. In that time, Mr Putin's global standing has largely deteriorated to pariah status. The Ukraine war has recast his image, both domestically as the wartime leader Russia \"needs\" (in state narratives) and internationally as a more marginalised, conflict-driven figure. Personally, the Russian president has become more isolated since the invasion, both in terms of his public appearances and his demeanour - claiming he \"jokes less\" since the war began. Putin at home Inside Russia, Mr Putin's popularity has been sustained by a mix of state-controlled messaging, repression of dissent and wartime patriotic mobilisation, even amid economic strain and military setbacks. His approval ratings initially rose sharply after the invasion began, reaching some of the highest figures in years, with a surge in patriotic sentiment and support for \"defending Russia\". And while sanctions, mobilisation and economic pressures dented some support, independent and state pollsters still often report significant backing for Mr Putin among many Russians. Even so, it can be difficult to gauge public opinion of the president inside Russia thanks to censorship and media control. The Kremlin has demanded active participation in and support for the war from society since 2022, not just quiet compliance. Opposition politics are outlawed, independent media has been almost entirely dismantled or subjected to strict \"foreign agent\" laws, and even mentioning the war in ways that contradict official narratives can lead to prison sentences. But that hasn't stopped some direct criticism. One woman wrote to Mr Putin demanding an explanation as to why her late son, an 18-year-old conscript, had been involved in combat. The spiralling cost of living has also damaged Mr Putin at home. For many households, everyday essentials - from basic groceries to fuel and housing - have become markedly more expensive, squeezing incomes despite official assurances of economic resilience. During his 2025 annual address, Russians sent messages for the president to answer, many of which raised concerns over the state of the economy. Putin abroad Outside Russia's borders, Mr Putin's reputation has worsened markedly. While relations with many Western governments were already strained before 2022, the invasion of Ukraine transformed long-standing suspicion into broad diplomatic isolation. Mr Putin no longer sits comfortably at global tables and forums frequented by world powers, while several Western governments have severed ties entirely. In response, Russia's president has kept relationships with his few remaining allies close, narrowing his diplomatic circle. Read more: How Moscow and its allies are trying to display their immunity to Western pressure He signed a comprehensive strategic partnership with North Korea in 2024 and signed a similar deal, promising future investment, with China in 2025. The outlier is the US. Mr Putin had no contact with the White House during the early stages of the war under Joe Biden. But the return of Donald Trump brought a shift in approach: several phone calls and a face-to-face meeting in Alaska have suggested a desire to redefine the two powers' relationship. Putin the man As with Mr Zelenskyy, there is little doubt that four years of war have also taken a significant toll on Russia's leader. During his 2024 year-end press conference, he stated that the ongoing war in Ukraine had changed him, causing him to \"joke less\" and \"almost stop laughing\". He also said that his focus has shifted, stating his happiness would not be complete until all Russian forces return from the frontline. Mr Putin also appears to have become more physically and socially isolated during the war, with fewer spontaneous public interactions and reduced foreign travel compared with pre-war years."

Reiner's lawyer, deputy public defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he appeared behind glass in court in Los Angeles. The 32-year-old, the third of Rob Reiner's four children, has been held without bail since his arrest hours after the 78-year-old director and his wife were found dead at their home in the Brentwood area of LA on 14 December. Reiner, who was in court with his head shaved and wearing brown jail clothes, talked briefly to his lawyer before the hearing and spoke only to answer yes to a question from the judge. The judge told Reiner to return to court on 29 April for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors will present evidence and a judge will decide if it is enough for Reiner to go to trial. Speaking outside court, district attorney Nathan Hochman said his office still has not decided whether it will seek the death penalty for the defendant. Reiner's previous lawyer quit the case at a hearing in January because of what he called circumstances beyond his and his client's control.

Governments worldwide have been scrambling for information since Friday when the US Supreme Court struck down his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs policy, and the president announced a temporary tax of 15% on imports into the US from all countries. Money blog: 'Sporadic shortages' of four items on supermarket shelves as supply hit Many British businesses are in the same position, now fearing higher costs to bring their products into America. \"Clarity is now urgently required on how UK exports will be treated on arrival into the United States\", said manufacturing industry trade body Make UK. From Tuesday morning, UK exporters will be subject to a 15% tariff, higher than the 10% agreed under a UK-US deal back in May. \"Unless we hear otherwise from the US, we are looking at a further 5% hike for many goods from 5am GMT, tomorrow. However, the nature of the legislation the US is using means it is difficult to give the UK a carve-out,\" said the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday. \n                  Trump bumps up global tariffs - creating more mess and uncertainty for the world\n                 \n                  About half of Trump's tariffs are now null and void - but his trade war is not over\n                 \n                  Quick take: Major tariff U-turn for Trump\n                 UK exporters and manufacturers \"are now staring down the barrel at higher costs\", the organisation said. What's happening?  Mr Trump said over the weekend, after hitting out against the court ruling on Friday, that he would impose a 15% tariff rate on all countries instead. That was up from the 10% he had announced a day earlier. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. The policy, under a US law known as section 122, limits such action to 150 days' duration. If the statute is to be extended, Congressional approval must be obtained. It had been unclear whether this 15% rate would apply to countries such as the UK, which had completed deals with the US to avoid the worst of the punitive tariffs announced last April.

Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. Today we speak to Alistair McFarlane, chief operating officer of game design company Facepunch Studios and the executive producer of survival game Rust... We let staff work whatever hours and days suit them... as long as the work gets done. If you want to mow your grass at 2pm, go for it. Facepunch definitely isn't typical for the industry. For the most part, it's a normal job, around 35 hours a week. I get relatives thinking I just play games all day a lot... but I don't. A lot of my job is strategy, people management, planning, product decisions and making sure teams have what they need to actually build great things. There are meetings, roadmaps, hiring, problem-solving and a lot of unglamorous stuff behind the scenes. Playing the game is usually a small part of it. The long-running argument that video games encourage violence is... one I have never bought into. Decades of peer-reviewed research have failed to find any causal link between video games and real-world violence. It's an easy headline, but it doesn't hold up. In reality, games are a massive outlet for social connection and stress relief. We see them used in therapy, education and even pain management. And it's honestly a shame the press so often blame such a creative industry when there's no correlation. Like any form of media, context matters, but blaming games for violence oversimplifies a much bigger, more complex set of issues. Find tips and personal finance news in the Money blog The biggest advice I can give is... make stuff. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity, just start building things, mods, prototypes, little games, tools, whatever. You learn far more by doing than by watching. Now with AI, learning and experimenting is easier than ever. I genuinely believe AI is for the better, not the worse... It's powerful, it's efficient and at the end of the day, it's just another tool, one that helps people move faster and focus on the creative stuff. Sure, it's disruptive, no question about that. Every major shift in tech is. But used properly, AI doesn't replace creativity, it amplifies it. It removes busywork, speeds up iteration and gives teams more space to experiment. The art of making a good game is... it has to be something you genuinely want to make, not just something you think will perform well on a spreadsheet. Don't play it safe. The best games come from teams who care deeply and aren't afraid to take risks. When that passion comes through, players feel it. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. Games can be expensive, especially at the high end... but they also don't have to be. You can make a game solo, for free, with nothing more than time and curiosity. A lot of breakout indie hits came from passionate people building things in their spare time. That's how I first got started. If you care enough and put the hours in, the barriers to entry have never been lower. A great place to start is modding existing games... It teaches you how systems fit together without needing to build everything from scratch... A game is millions of lines of code all holding hands. If one person lets go, the whole thing can collapse... It's honestly a small miracle that any game runs at all, let alone evolves and ships new content as regularly as we do. Mario is a masterclass in design... Simple controls, instant readability, pure fun. You can hand it to almost anyone and they'll get it in seconds. That kind of accessibility mixed with depth is rare, and honestly timeless. But then there's World of Warcraft... I've yet to find another game that quite matched that first WoW feeling. Logging in, seeing Ironforge packed, discovering zones for the first time, it was magic. The scale of WoW in 2004 was just unreal. Epic, huge and for its time completely unheard of. It mashed together so many parts of games I already loved into one living world, exploration, progression, social play, raids, all of it. More from this series:Criminal barrister on salariesI'm a self-taught celebrity photographerI'm a child psychiatrist We're not really competing with Sony or Activision in the traditional sense... we're playing a different game. Indie studios tend to be more ambitious in risk-taking, we can move faster, try weird ideas and ship things that wouldn't survive an AAA [a term used to classify high-budget, high-profile games] greenlight process. It's an incredibly competitive industry... A lot of studios are one bad release away from shutting their doors, and it's expensive to make games. You see a lot of burn and churn as a result. We genuinely read community comments, from everywhere... We never ignore them. Sometimes they hurt, sometimes they inspire us, but they always matter. There's a huge amount of engineering, iteration and care happening behind the scenes, even when it doesn't look like it from the outside. One of the biggest things I've learned is... that the people who can be the loudest or harshest are often your most passionate and dedicated community members, they just don't always channel it in the right way. Over the years, you start to realise that most anger comes from investment. The biggest lesson for me was... take the time to step back and look at the bigger picture. Are we building the right thing, for the right audience, at the right scale, with the time and money we actually have? If the answer isn't a confident yes, you need to change course early because the later you leave it, the more painful it gets. If I could go back, I... wouldn't change anything. Every day is a learning experience, and without the mistakes along the way, I wouldn't be where I am now. Good decisions, bad decisions, they all teach you something. It's all part of the journey. Just make sure you put people first along the way because that matters more than anything else."

        "Content": "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have thrown their weight behind plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession. The intervention from the Commonwealth countries comes amid calls for the former duke to be prevented from ever becoming king. Backing the calls, a spokesperson for New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the country would support the UK government if it proposes to take action. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had already written to Sir Keir Starmer on Monday backing the measure. Andrew was arrested and interviewed under caution on Thursday 19 February, over allegations of misconduct in public office - something he strongly denies. Politics latest - follow live Following his arrest, calls for MPs to consider passing a law to remove the 66-year-old from the line of succession have grown. In his letter, Mr Albanese wrote: \"In light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession. \"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation. \"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\" Changing the line of succession would require the agreement of all 15 realms of the Commonwealth where the British monarch is also the head of state. Only New Zealand and Australia have so far backed the move. Sky's royal commentator Alastair Bruce said Albanese's letter \"must help the prime minister\", but warned that it may not be so simple to get all to agree. He said: \"It takes a lot of time, and I think parliaments across the world who have the King as head of state will not be looking forward to having to find time to do this.\" Asked about support for the move, Bruce said that \"particularly since Elizabeth II died\", we are living in \"a post-deferential age\", when \"the attitude of people to institutions generally, not just the Royal Family, has altered\". He added that the monarchy was \"suffering at the moment from the fact that its reputation is hugely damaged, and it will want to see to it that a solution is found that those who need justice receive it\". The UK government is understood to be considering introducing legislation to remove the former duke from the line of succession. But any such move would only happen once the ongoing police investigation into him has concluded. Andrew is currently eighth in line to the throne, behind Prince William and his three children, as well as Prince Harry and his two children. Australia has had a republican movement for well over a century, and it became the official policy of the country's governing Labor Party more than three decades ago, in 1991. In 1999, a referendum on becoming a republic was held. Some 55% of voters supported remaining a constitutional monarchy, while 45% wanted to become a republic. The latest polls show similar results, although republicanism is stronger among younger people. Mr Albanese said on Friday that his government was not intending to hold another referendum, despite his personal support for having an Australian head of state."

Al Carns, a former special forces colonel in the Royal Marines, said Ukraine is on the frontline of Europe's defences as Vladimir Putin's full-scale onslaught enters its fifth year. But he warned Britain is not immune, with Russia attacking the UK and its interests across four different kinds of frontline. The minister spoke about daily threats in the North Atlantic, the Arctic and cyber attacks, as well as the danger posed by fake news and other forms of disinformation spread online - designed to sow or amplify divisions within UK society or between Britain and its friends. 'History rhymes' Asked whether he agreed with comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Mr Putin had already started World War Three with his invasion of Ukraine, Mr Carns signalled that he saw similarities between the challenges faced today and the global landscape in the three years running up to the Second World War. \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme,\" he said. \"And if you were to go back to, you know, 1936, '37, '38… there's definitely a lot of similarities. \"What I would say is that Ukraine is absolutely the front line of European defence, and they're doing an absolutely sterling job.\" The UK's frontline While Ukraine is on the frontline of Russia's conventional military machine, the armed forces minister said the UK is also in Moscow's sights - though the conflict is raging in a grey zone that sits under the threshold of all-out war. \"A lot of people say that the UK doesn't have a frontline,\" Mr Carns said. \"Well, the reality is we do. It sits in the North Atlantic. It sits in the High North. It sits in cyberspace. And it sits in influence - and I think that is being battled out every day.\" He described how Russia has various means to inflict harm away from bombs and bullets. \"It's not through sharp power. It's through influence, through cyberspace, through industrial espionage,\" the minister said. \"It's through sowing division and discord into this country, into Europe. Drive us apart from the US, apart from our European allies, to fragment and then isolate and defeat.\""

Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator that issued the fines, said if the firm does not immediately implement highly effective age assurance, it will also face a daily penalty of £1,000. It will also be fined £250 a day until it responds to the regulator's requests for information, including a full list of all of its sites. After 60 days, if it still has not responded, the fines will be capped. From July, all pornography providers with UK audiences had to start properly checking the ages of their users. A tick-box asking users if they were over 18 was no longer considered a proper age check, and major providers introduced technology to properly verify their users' ages.

        "Content": "Rob Reiner's son Nick has pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of the actor-director and his wife Michele Singer Reiner. Reiner's lawyer, deputy public defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he appeared behind glass in court in Los Angeles. The 32-year-old, the third of Rob Reiner's four children, has been held without bail since his arrest hours after the 78-year-old director and his wife were found dead at their home in the Brentwood area of LA on 14 December. Reiner, who was in court with his head shaved and wearing brown jail clothes, talked briefly to his lawyer before the hearing and spoke only to answer yes to a question from the judge. The judge told Reiner to return to court on 29 April for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors will present evidence and a judge will decide if it is enough for Reiner to go to trial. Speaking outside court, district attorney Nathan Hochman said his office still has not decided whether it will seek the death penalty for the defendant. Reiner's previous lawyer quit the case at a hearing in January because of what he called circumstances beyond his and his client's control. The high-profile private lawyer said legal ethics would not allow him to say why, but speaking outside the courthouse he declared that \"pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder\". He was replaced by a public defender.

Rob Reiner and his 70-year-old wife died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\", the LA County Medical Examiner said in its initial findings. Authorities said they were killed hours before their bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the release of further details. Rob Reiner's work included some of the most memorable films of the 1980s and 1990s, including This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n It's not often an actor from Hull pips Hollywood actors to a top award, but Robert Aramayo has done just that. Against the odds, he beat the likes of Hollywood stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothee Chalamet and Michael B Jordan when he was named best actor at the 79th annual BAFTA film awards. He was also named EE rising star. Here's everything we know about the 33-year-old British actor. Aramayo was born in Kingston Upon Hull and began acting at an early age. His first role was Bugsy Malone in a primary school production of the musical. Joining the Hull Truck Youth Theatre aged 10, he performed around three plays a year with the group, including playing the treacherous pig, Squealer, in Animal Farm - his first time playing a villain. Aged 18, Aramayo won a place at the prestigious New York drama school, Juilliard. \n                  Tourette's campaigner 'deeply mortified' after racial slur at BAFTAs\n                 \n                  BBC removes BAFTAs from iPlayer and apologises after racial slur yelled during show\n                 \n                  British rising star Robert Aramayo beats Timothee Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio to acting BAFTA - as One Battle After Another named best film\n                 The school, which inspired the musical Fame, is considered one of the best acting schools in the world, and boasts alumni including Robin Williams, Viola Davis, Adam Driver and Jessica Chastain. Aramayo was the only British student to be accepted in his year. After playing the lead in a Juilliard production of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, Aramayo landed his first film role in the 2016 thriller Nocturnal Animals. Other movies followed, including Lost in Florence, Antebellum and The Empty Man, and playing brutal Captain Wingate in Palestine 36, before being cast in multi BAFTA-winning movie I Swear. Aramayo's best-known TV work includes Game Of Thrones - playing young Ned Stark, Elrond in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and psychological thriller Behind Her Eyes. Away from acting, Aramayo's a fan of football club Leeds United and has previously spoken about bonding with his dad through going to matches together. I Swear - the film that surprised the BAFTAs Aramayo's real film break came when he was cast in the lead role of Kirk Jones' 2025 film I Swear, although he probably didn't know it at the time. An independent British film with a tough sell, it's now earned him his double BAFTA win. The movie also won a BAFTA for casting. Speaking on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony, the film's director, Kirk Jones told Sky News that Aramayo didn't actually audition for the role, as he wanted to avoid \"just doing an impression\" of Tourette Syndrome advocate John Davidson who he plays. The first time the director saw him in the role, for which Aramayo adopted a Scottish Borders accent, was when they began filming. Aramayo's performance has been widely acclaimed and has also earned him the British Independent Film Award for Best Lead Performance. Speaking in the summer, when promoting the film, Aramayo told Sky News: \"[The film] was really eye-opening for me because a lot of tics that people just don't see, a lot of tics that, you know, might be perceptible, but they're almost imperceptible, you know?\" He went on: \"There's been a lot of people, it's been a surprising response, who have contacted me speaking about their own neurodiversity, and they actually expand this into a larger conversation about neurodiversity. And the way that we talk about and the shifting, changing ways in which we talk about neurodiversity. \"If it could have if it could aid something in that conversation, as it seems to be doing, which is an amazing thing, then that would be that would be awesome.\" Not one, but two BAFTA wins Aramayo's BAFTA success started with him winning the EE rising star award - the only BAFTA film award to be voted for by the public. Accepting his award, Aramayo said, \"I can't believe this, it really blows my mind.\" Referring to Davidson, on whom I Swear is based, he said: \"John Davidson is the most remarkable person I've ever met and he believes there is so much more we need to learn about Tourette's. \"In the words of the film, they need support and understanding.\" Aramayo's words had particular resonance, following several outbursts during the ceremony, when Davidson shouted offensive words, including as Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the first award of the night, for special visual effects. The BBC later apologised and removed the BAFTA ceremony from the iPlayer. Tourette syndrome is a condition that causes you to make sudden, repetitive sounds or movements - called tics. Davidson suffers from coprolalia - a condition which affects only a minority of the Tourette's population, and causes involuntary utterance of socially inappropriate words or phrases. Tics can be triggered by stress, excitement or tiredness. While there is no cure for Tourette's, it can be managed through treatment.

He gave Hawke a special mention as he accepted his trophy. Aramayo said: \"When I was in school, Ethan Hawke came in to speak to us at Juilliard and he gave an amazing talk on longevity as an actor, about protecting your instrument and avoiding self-destructive behaviours, and it had a great impact on everyone in the room. \"So, to be in this category with you tonight is incredible. Thank you, Ethan.\" A close-up shot of Hawke in the audience showed the 55-year-old star reacting, rubbing his face and smiling, and at the end of Aramayo's speech, Hawke appeared to say, \"That's better than a win\". Aramayo's father, Michael, was in the audience clapping and saying, \"We love you, Robert.\" Aramayo's mother, Lisa, and older sister, Laura, were also there to support him, as well as his \"amazing partner\". I Swear will be released in the US this year, and it will be eligible for consideration for next year's Oscars."

        "Content": "A Tourette's campaigner who yelled out a racial slur at the BAFTAs has spoken out about the incident, saying he is \"deeply mortified\". John Davidson MBE was attending the awards ceremony after inspiring the film, I Swear, which dramatises his life with severe Tourette syndrome. The condition is characterised by sudden, involuntary, repetitive sounds or movements, known as tics, which cause Davidson to call out inappropriate words. That's what happened at the BAFTAs, when he called out a racial slur while two black actors, Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo, were on stage presenting the first award of the night. Now Davidson has spoken out about the incident, saying that he is \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning\". He also praised the BAFTA organisers for notifying the audience about his tics beforehand and clarifying that they do not reflect his personal beliefs. \"I was heartened by the round of applause that followed this announcement and felt welcomed and understood in an environment that would normally be impossible for me,\" he said. \n                  Robert Aramayo: The Hull actor who's taken the BAFTAs by storm\n                 \n                  BBC removes BAFTAs from iPlayer and apologises after racial slur yelled during show\n                 \n                  British rising star Robert Aramayo beats Timothee Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio to acting BAFTA - as One Battle After Another named best film\n                 In the aftermath of Davidson's shout, the two actors on stage appeared to pause momentarily before continuing with the presentation. Davidson said he then chose to leave the ceremony early because \"I was aware of the distress my tics were causing\". The host, Alan Cumming, subsequently acknowledged the interruption and explained again about Tourette's. In a statement, BAFTA said the slur was a source of \"incomparable trauma and pain for so many\" and apologised for putting its guests in a \"very difficult situation\". The academy's statement said: \"Early in the ceremony a loud tic in the form of a profoundly offensive term was heard by many people in the room. \"Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at the time, and we apologise unreservedly to them, and to all those impacted. We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their incredible dignity and professionalism. \"During the ceremony, John chose to leave the auditorium and watch the rest of the ceremony from a screen, and we would like to thank him for his dignity and consideration of others, on what should have been a night of celebration for him. \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologise to all. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\" The ceremony, with the offending moment intact, remained available to watch on BBC iPlayer for over 12 hours.
