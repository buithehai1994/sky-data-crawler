        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n Israelis are good at tactics, poor at strategic vision, it has been observed.  Their campaign against Iran may be a case in point. Short termism is understandable in a region that is so unpredictable. Why make elaborate plans if they are generally undone by unexpected events? It is a mindset that is familiar to anyone who has lived or worked there. And it informs policy-making. The Israeli offensive in Gaza is no exception. The Israeli government has never been clear how it will end or what happens the day after that in what remains of the coastal strip. Pressed privately, even senior advisers will admit they simply do not know. It may seem unfair to call a military operation against Iran that literally took decades of planning short-termist or purely tactical. There was clearly a strategy of astonishing sophistication behind a devastating campaign that has dismantled so much of the enemy's capability.  But is there a strategic vision beyond that? That is what worries Israel's allies. It's not as if we've not been here before, time and time again. From Libya to Afghanistan and all points in between we have seen the chaos and carnage that follows governments being changed. \n                  Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow: What we know about the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities\n                 \n                  'Fordow is gone': US warplanes strike three nuclear sites in Iran\n                 \n                  US warplanes transit through UK: Here's what the flight tracking data shows\n                 Hundreds of thousands have died. Vast swathes of territory remain mired in turmoil or instability. Which is where a famous warning sign to American shoppers in the 80s and 90s comes in. Ahead of the disastrous invasion that would tear Iraq apart, America's defence secretary, Colin Powell, is said to have warned US president George W Bush of the \"Pottery Barn rule\". The Pottery Barn was an American furnishings store. Signs among its wares told clumsy customers: \"You break it, you own it.\"  Bush did not listen to Powell hard enough. His administration would end up breaking Iraq and owning the aftermath in a bloody debacle lasting years. Israel is not invading Iran, but it is bombing it back to the 80s, or even the 70s, because it is calling for the fall of the government that came to power at the end of that decade. Iran's leadership is proving resilient so far but we are just a week in. It is a country of 90 million, already riven with social and political discontent. Its system of government is based on factional competition, in which paranoia, suspicion and intense rivalries are the order of the day. Read more:Putin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strikeAir India warned by watchdog over pilot scheduling breaches After half a century of authoritarian theocratic rule there are no opposition groups ready to replace the ayatollahs. There may be a powerful sense of social cohesion and a patriotic resentment of outside interference, for plenty of good historic reasons. But if that is not enough to keep the country together then chaos could ensue. One of the biggest and most consequential nations in the region could descend into violent instability. That will have been on Israel's watch. If it breaks Iran it will own it even more than America owned the disaster in Iraq. Iran and Israel are, after all, in the same neighbourhood. Has Israel thought through the consequences? What is the strategic vision beyond victory? At the very least, is his administration asking its allies whether they have a plan for what could come next?"

        "Content": "A jailed opposition leader in Belarus has been freed and is now in Lithuania. Siarhei Tsikhanouski was released along with 13 other political prisoners following talks between Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Keith Kellogg, who is President Trump's envoy for Ukraine. Mr Kellogg became the highest-ranking US official in years to visit Belarus, which is a close ally of Russia. Israel-Iran live: Trump arrives back at White House as Security Council mulls Iran action Mr Tsikhanouski, a blogger and activist, was arrested after announcing he would run for the presidency against Mr Lukashenko in the 2020 election. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison the following year after a court found him guilty of organising mass unrest and of inciting social hatred. After he was detained, his wife Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya ran in his place and she became an opposition leader who is now in exile in Lithuania. \n                  Polls close in Belarus - with Alexander Lukashenko set to extend 30-year presidential rule\n                 \n                  Vladimir Putin won't 'whack' Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin - but he's in Russia, says Belarus leader\n                 \n                  Vladimir Putin thanks Russian army for stopping 'civil war' after Wagner mutiny\n                 Although Mr Lukashenko was officially declared the winner of the election, the result was denounced by the opposition and the West as a sham. On Saturday, a video on Ms Tsikhanouskaya's social media showed Mr Tsikhanouski getting out of a minibus and smiling despite his emaciated appearance. He and his wife hugged as their supporters clapped. She said: \"My husband is free. It's difficult to describe the joy in my heart.\" She thanked Mr Trump, Mr Kellogg and \"all European allies\" for their efforts in getting him released.

The 14 who were freed on Saturday included five Belarus nationals as well as three Poles, two Latvians, two Japanese citizens, one Estonian and one Swede. Among those released was Ihar Karnei, a former journalist at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 'Free world needs you' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X the release was \"fantastic news and a powerful symbol of hope for all the political prisoners suffering under the brutal Lukashenka (sic) regime\". \"The free world needs you, Siarhei!\", Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on X. At the meeting between Mr Lukashenko and Mr Kellogg in the Belarusian capital Minsk, the pair hugged. Mr Lukashenko said: \"I really hope that our conversation will be very sincere and open. Otherwise, what is the point of meeting? \"If we are clever and cunning in front of each other, we will not achieve results. You have made a lot of noise in the world with your arrival.\" Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, secured a seventh term in office following an election in January this year that the opposition called a farce. Could Belarus sanctions be lifted? It was not immediately clear whether Mr Kellogg's visit might pave the way for the lifting of some US sanctions against Belarus. They were imposed over the crackdown on the 2020 protests and Mr Lukashenko's support of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Belarus has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory to send troops and weapons into Ukraine, and also to put its forces and nuclear weapons there."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n Since the local elections Reform UK has had no shortage of good polls. But a new one suggests Nigel Farage's party has a chance not only of winning the next election, but of claiming a decent Commons majority, too. In February, Reform topped a Sky News/YouGov poll for the first time, with Nigel Farage's party edging in front on 25%, Labour pushed into second on 24%, with the Tories on 21%. But a fresh one from Ipsos puts Reform on 34%, nine points ahead of Labour on 25%, with the Conservatives a distant third on 15%.  While the other parties are flatlining, Reform appears to be pushing boundaries. Were these figures to be replicated across the country at a general election, with every constituency behaving the same way, then Reform could win as many as 340 seats, giving it a majority of 30, Sky News analysis suggests. Labour could be reduced to 176 seats, down 236 on last year's election, while the Tories would hit a record low of 12 seats. But polling should always be taken with a pinch of salt and with the firm acknowledgement that there is not an election coming any time soon. Conservative backbenchers might also tell you publicly that opinion polls are notoriously difficult to translate into seat numbers because voting percentages in individual constituencies can vary hugely from the overall average. But the truth is that the symbolism of Reform UK topping another poll is likely to be noticed by MPs from all parties, especially backbench Conservatives who have actively been hoping their leader, Kemi Badenoch, can help them climb the polls and bring the party back into public favour. Politics is a brutal game and when it comes to toppling underwhelming party leaders, the Tories are more ruthless than most. One wonders how many of these polls Mrs Badenoch's party will allow her to endure.

And the figure of 25% of voters intending to vote Labour is a level not seen since October 2019. While abstract to much of the public, polling can often shape not only the chatter inside Westminster but how and when plots by MPs begin. For Reform UK, this is a much-needed morale boost after a surprise resignation by their former Chairman Zia Yusuf, and then an almost immediate U-turn back into the party. And Kemi Badenoch - who said during her leadership campaign that the Conservatives needed to go back to first principles and that this would take time - will be wondering, seven-and-a-half months after winning the leadership, how much time she really has left.

Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said \"hot and humid air is being dragged up\" from parts of continental Europe. \"But we also have low pressure out in the Atlantic, and that is driving weather fronts across the UK, providing instability in the air and the perfect conditions to start sparking off some thunderstorms as that hot and humid air rises rapidly,\" he added. The east of England, including London and the South East, could experience a \"tropical night\", although most of the country will see \"a lot cooler\" and \"a lot fresher\" conditions, Met Office forecaster Dan Stroud said. \"In one or two spots, that could potentially be a tropical night, which is where the overnight minimums actually fail to drop below 20 degrees (centigrade),\" he added.

An amber heat-health alert for all regions in England remains in place over the weekend. The alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has warned that significant impacts are likely during the alert period across health and social care services, including a rise in demand."

The photo was taken in Windsor earlier this month and was released as he celebrated his 43rd birthday. It shows Prince William gazing adoringly into the eyes of one of the puppies as another clambers over his legs. The family's black cocker spaniel, Orla, gave birth to four puppies last month, three of which can be seen in the photograph. In the Instagram post, signed from Catherine, George, Charlotte, and Louis, the family said: \"Happy birthday! Love C, G, C, L, Orla and the puppies!\" The message was signed off with an emoji showing a pair of paws. Orla was first seen in a picture of Princess Charlotte marking her seventh birthday in May 2022. She was gifted to the family in 2020 by Kate's brother, James Middleton, who breeds dogs, after their first dog together, cocker spaniel Lupo, died unexpectedly. The King and Queen's Instagram account also posted a new picture of Prince William to mark his birthday, showing him dressed in a shirt and sitting in a field.

        "Content": "\n          National correspondent\n              @TomSkyNews\n  The impending ban on protest group Palestine Action has divided opinion - described as both \"outrageous\" and \"long overdue\". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to take the step after the group broke into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on e-scooters and sprayed two Voyager planes with red paint. The prime minister described the attack as \"outrageous\" and a rapid review of security at MoD bases is under way. It was the latest protest in a five-year campaign from Palestine Action (PA) that has targeted arms manufacturers, financial institutions, political figures and government buildings. Red spray paint has become its signature. On its website, PA says it is a \"direct action movement\" committed to ending \"global participation\" in what it calls Israel's \"genocidal and apartheid regime\". It adds that it uses \"disruptive tactics\" to target \"corporate enablers of the Israeli military-industrial complex\". Banning the group would make membership of it illegal. It would be treated as a terrorist organisation. Saeed Taji Farouky, a spokesman for PA, told Sky News that potential proscription was \"unfair\", adding that it was \"ludicrous\" that a \"civil society direct action group\" could end up on the same list as ISIS. He added: \"It's not logical, it's not even consistent with the British legal definition of terrorism, it's a reaction that's been taken overnight, with almost no discussion or debate. \"The whole thing is incredibly worrying, mostly for what it means about British law in general, about undermining the very basis of British democracy and the rule of law.\" There are \"no circumstances\" under which the two people who breached Brize Norton would be handed over to the police, he said. Singer-songwriter Paloma Faith, who spoke at a pro-Palestine rally in Whitehall in central London on Saturday, told Sky News she was \"devastated\" by the move. \"I have met some of the people who have friends in that group. They are young students and they are basically trying to do something because they feel that our government is failing them.\" She added that \"everyone\" wants to end what she described as a \"massacre\" in Gaza. Israel says its military campaign in Gaza is a way of defending itself against Hamas, which killed more than a thousand people in its 7 October attacks and took about 240 people hostage. Hamas-run health authorities claim Israeli attacks have since killed almost 56,000 people in Gaza.  Faith continued: \"When you scribble on something, or paint on it, it's a non-violent protest and it shouldn't be made at the same level as a violent protest - it is unjust.\" Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, backed Palestine Action's use of non-violent protest. He told Sky News: \"There has been a place for that in all political movements in history. \"In the struggle for the rights of black people in the US, in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, in the struggle for women to have the vote, people took forms of non-violent direct action. \"Imagine if we had the current [situation] back in those days - we would have been proscribing the suffragettes, treating them as terrorists.\" Read more:Analysis: If Israel breaks Iran it will own the chaosPutin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike Others have welcomed the move. Lord Walney, who served as the government's independent adviser on political violence, told Sky News the decision was \"long overdue\". \"Palestine Action have acted as the enemy within which is why it's right, now, to crack down on them,\" he said. \"They have terrorised working people for a number of years and there's a number of serious violent charges that are going through the court system at the moment.\" The UK government is expected to announce its decision early next week."

An amber heat-health alert is in place for all regions in England over the weekend. Solstice events at Stonehenge are some of the rare occasions when visitors are allowed to get close to the stones at the World Heritage site, which was built to align with the sun on the solstices. Solstices are believed to have been celebrated at Stonehenge for thousands of years. The summer solstice sees the sun rise behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, with rays of sunlight being channelled into the centre of the monument. It takes place as one of the Earth's poles reaches its maximum tilt towards the sun as it reaches its highest position in the sky, giving the longest period of daylight for the year and signifying the end of spring.

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n Israelis are good at tactics, poor at strategic vision, it has been observed.  Their campaign against Iran may be a case in point. Short termism is understandable in a region that is so unpredictable. Why make elaborate plans if they are generally undone by unexpected events? It is a mindset that is familiar to anyone who has lived or worked there. And it informs policy-making. The Israeli offensive in Gaza is no exception. The Israeli government has never been clear how it will end or what happens the day after that in what remains of the coastal strip. Pressed privately, even senior advisers will admit they simply do not know. It may seem unfair to call a military operation against Iran that literally took decades of planning short-termist or purely tactical. There was clearly a strategy of astonishing sophistication behind a devastating campaign that has dismantled so much of the enemy's capability.  But is there a strategic vision beyond that? That is what worries Israel's allies. It's not as if we've not been here before, time and time again. From Libya to Afghanistan and all points in between we have seen the chaos and carnage that follows governments being changed. \n                  Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow: What we know about the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities\n                 \n                  'Fordow is gone': US warplanes strike three nuclear sites in Iran\n                 \n                  US warplanes transit through UK: Here's what the flight tracking data shows\n                 Hundreds of thousands have died. Vast swathes of territory remain mired in turmoil or instability. Which is where a famous warning sign to American shoppers in the 80s and 90s comes in. Ahead of the disastrous invasion that would tear Iraq apart, America's defence secretary, Colin Powell, is said to have warned US president George W Bush of the \"Pottery Barn rule\". The Pottery Barn was an American furnishings store. Signs among its wares told clumsy customers: \"You break it, you own it.\"  Bush did not listen to Powell hard enough. His administration would end up breaking Iraq and owning the aftermath in a bloody debacle lasting years. Israel is not invading Iran, but it is bombing it back to the 80s, or even the 70s, because it is calling for the fall of the government that came to power at the end of that decade. Iran's leadership is proving resilient so far but we are just a week in. It is a country of 90 million, already riven with social and political discontent. Its system of government is based on factional competition, in which paranoia, suspicion and intense rivalries are the order of the day. Read more:Putin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strikeAir India warned by watchdog over pilot scheduling breaches After half a century of authoritarian theocratic rule there are no opposition groups ready to replace the ayatollahs. There may be a powerful sense of social cohesion and a patriotic resentment of outside interference, for plenty of good historic reasons. But if that is not enough to keep the country together then chaos could ensue. One of the biggest and most consequential nations in the region could descend into violent instability. That will have been on Israel's watch. If it breaks Iran it will own it even more than America owned the disaster in Iraq. Iran and Israel are, after all, in the same neighbourhood. Has Israel thought through the consequences? What is the strategic vision beyond victory? At the very least, is his administration asking its allies whether they have a plan for what could come next?"

At the meeting between Mr Lukashenko and Mr Kellogg in the Belarusian capital Minsk, the pair hugged. Mr Lukashenko said: \"I really hope that our conversation will be very sincere and open. Otherwise, what is the point of meeting? \"If we are clever and cunning in front of each other, we will not achieve results. You have made a lot of noise in the world with your arrival.\" Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, secured a seventh term in office following an election in January this year that the opposition called a farce. Could Belarus sanctions be lifted? It was not immediately clear whether Mr Kellogg's visit might pave the way for the lifting of some US sanctions against Belarus. They were imposed over the crackdown on the 2020 protests and Mr Lukashenko's support of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Belarus has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory to send troops and weapons into Ukraine, and also to put its forces and nuclear weapons there."

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) instructed Air India to remove three company executives from crew scheduling roles over the breaches, according to government reports, seen by the Reuters news agency. A divisional vice president, a chief manager of crew scheduling, and a planning executive have been removed at the aviation agency's instruction. The flights on 16 May and 17 May exceeded the allowed pilot flight time limit of 10 hours, according to the report. It cited \"systemic failures in scheduling protocol and oversights\" and criticised the lack of strict disciplinary measures against responsible officials. The report is unrelated to this month's crash of an Air India Boeing 787-8 that killed 241 people.  The Gatwick-bound flight, which was carrying 53 Britons, came down just after take-off from Ahmedabad airport in western India on Thursday, 12 June. An investigation into the crash is ongoing.

The DGCA stated in its order that Air India had voluntarily disclosed the violations. Last year, around half of the fines handed out by India's aviation agency were given to Air India or Air India Express. The biggest fine was $127,000 (£94,370) on Air India for \"insufficient oxygen on board\" during some international flights."

Civil rights groups, such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), which is suing the administration, argue this conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel in order to silence dissent. Judge Farbiarz ruled the government can't deport Mr Khalil on the basis that his presence could undermine foreign policy, but it can continue deportation over allegations that he lied on his green card application. Mr Khalil disputes these allegations. He had to surrender his passport but will get his green card back and be given official documents permitting limited travel within the country, including New York and Michigan to visit family, New Jersey and Louisiana for court appearances and Washington to lobby Congress.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Sam Laidlaw, the former boss of Centrica, is among the candidates being considered as the next chairman of BP, Britain’s besieged oil and gas exploration giant. Sky News has learnt that Mr Laidlaw is being considered by BP board members as a potential successor to Helge Lund, who announced in April that he would step down. BP's chair search comes with the £62bn oil major in a state of crisis, as industry predators circle and the pace of its strategic transformation being interrogated by shareholders. Elliott Management, the activist investor, snapped up a multibillion pound stake in BP earlier this year and is pushing its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, to accelerate spending cuts and ditch a string of renewable energy commitments. Mr Lund's departure will come after nearly a quarter of BP's shareholders opposed his re-election at its annual meeting in April - an unusually large protest given that his intention to step down had already been announced. BP's senior independent director - the Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc - is said to be moving \"at pace\" to complete the recruitment process. A number of prominent candidates are understood to be in discussions with headhunters advising BP on the search. \n                  Hundreds of jobs at risk as River Island takes axe to store base\n                 \n                  Money blog: 'We charge diners £225 for our tasting menu - here's why it's worth every penny'\n                 \n                  Post Office Capture scandal: Sir Alan Bates calls for those responsible for wrongful convictions to be 'brought to account'\n                 Mr Laidlaw would be a logical choice to take the role, having transformed Centrica, the owner of British Gas, during his tenure, which ended in 2014. Since then, he has had a long stint - which recently concluded - on the board of miner Rio Tinto, which has been fending off activist calls to abandon its London listing. He also established, and then sold, Neptune Energy, an oil company which was acquired by Italy's Eni for nearly £4bn in 2023. Last December, Mr Laidlaw was appointed chairman of AWE, the government-owned body which oversees Britain's nuclear weapons capability. He also has strong family connections to BP, with his father, Christopher Laidlaw, having served as its deputy chairman during a long business career. One person close to BP said the younger Mr Laidlaw had been approached about chairing the company during its previous recruitment process but had ruled himself out because of his Neptune Energy role. The status of his engagement with BP's search was unclear on Saturday. Another person said to have been approached is Ken MacKenzie, who recently retired as chairman of the mining giant BHP. Mr MacKenzie headed BHP during a period when Elliott held a stake in the company, and is said to have a good working relationship with the investor. Shares in BP have continued their downward trajectory over the last year, having fallen by nearly a fifth during that period. The company's valuation slump is reported to have drawn renewed interest in a possible takeover bid, with rivals Shell and ExxonMobil among those said to have \"run the numbers\" in recent months. Reports of such interest have not elicited any formal response, suggesting that any deal is conceptual at this stage. BP is racing to sell assets including Castrol, its lubricants division, which could command a price of about $8bn. This weekend, BP declined to comment, while Mr Laidlaw could not be reached for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n Since the local elections Reform UK has had no shortage of good polls. But a new one suggests Nigel Farage's party has a chance not only of winning the next election, but of claiming a decent Commons majority, too. In February, Reform topped a Sky News/YouGov poll for the first time, with Nigel Farage's party edging in front on 25%, Labour pushed into second on 24%, with the Tories on 21%. But a fresh one from Ipsos puts Reform on 34%, nine points ahead of Labour on 25%, with the Conservatives a distant third on 15%.  While the other parties are flatlining, Reform appears to be pushing boundaries. Were these figures to be replicated across the country at a general election, with every constituency behaving the same way, then Reform could win as many as 340 seats, giving it a majority of 30, Sky News analysis suggests. Labour could be reduced to 176 seats, down 236 on last year's election, while the Tories would hit a record low of 12 seats. But polling should always be taken with a pinch of salt and with the firm acknowledgement that there is not an election coming any time soon. Conservative backbenchers might also tell you publicly that opinion polls are notoriously difficult to translate into seat numbers because voting percentages in individual constituencies can vary hugely from the overall average. But the truth is that the symbolism of Reform UK topping another poll is likely to be noticed by MPs from all parties, especially backbench Conservatives who have actively been hoping their leader, Kemi Badenoch, can help them climb the polls and bring the party back into public favour. Politics is a brutal game and when it comes to toppling underwhelming party leaders, the Tories are more ruthless than most. One wonders how many of these polls Mrs Badenoch's party will allow her to endure.  Read more:How did your MP vote on the assisted dying bill?Starmer tries to contain rebellion over welfare reforms This poll is also a warning to Labour. As the party approaches a year since its major victory, it will not have much to celebrate if these numbers are anything to go by. According to this survey, only 19% are satisfied with the job Sir Keir Starmer is doing as prime minister, with 73% dissatisfied. And the figure of 25% of voters intending to vote Labour is a level not seen since October 2019. While abstract to much of the public, polling can often shape not only the chatter inside Westminster but how and when plots by MPs begin. For Reform UK, this is a much-needed morale boost after a surprise resignation by their former Chairman Zia Yusuf, and then an almost immediate U-turn back into the party. And Kemi Badenoch - who said during her leadership campaign that the Conservatives needed to go back to first principles and that this would take time - will be wondering, seven-and-a-half months after winning the leadership, how much time she really has left. Ipsos interviewed a representative probability sample of 1,180 British adults aged 18+, via the Ipsos UK KnowledgePanel. Data was collected between 30 May-4 June 2025."

        "Content": "\n          National correspondent\n              @TomSkyNews\n  The impending ban on protest group Palestine Action has divided opinion - described as both \"outrageous\" and \"long overdue\". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to take the step after the group broke into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on e-scooters and sprayed two Voyager planes with red paint. The prime minister described the attack as \"outrageous\" and a rapid review of security at MoD bases is under way. It was the latest protest in a five-year campaign from Palestine Action (PA) that has targeted arms manufacturers, financial institutions, political figures and government buildings. Red spray paint has become its signature. On its website, PA says it is a \"direct action movement\" committed to ending \"global participation\" in what it calls Israel's \"genocidal and apartheid regime\". It adds that it uses \"disruptive tactics\" to target \"corporate enablers of the Israeli military-industrial complex\". Banning the group would make membership of it illegal. It would be treated as a terrorist organisation. Saeed Taji Farouky, a spokesman for PA, told Sky News that potential proscription was \"unfair\", adding that it was \"ludicrous\" that a \"civil society direct action group\" could end up on the same list as ISIS. He added: \"It's not logical, it's not even consistent with the British legal definition of terrorism, it's a reaction that's been taken overnight, with almost no discussion or debate. \"The whole thing is incredibly worrying, mostly for what it means about British law in general, about undermining the very basis of British democracy and the rule of law.\" There are \"no circumstances\" under which the two people who breached Brize Norton would be handed over to the police, he said. Singer-songwriter Paloma Faith, who spoke at a pro-Palestine rally in Whitehall in central London on Saturday, told Sky News she was \"devastated\" by the move. \"I have met some of the people who have friends in that group. They are young students and they are basically trying to do something because they feel that our government is failing them.\" She added that \"everyone\" wants to end what she described as a \"massacre\" in Gaza. Israel says its military campaign in Gaza is a way of defending itself against Hamas, which killed more than a thousand people in its 7 October attacks and took about 240 people hostage. Hamas-run health authorities claim Israeli attacks have since killed almost 56,000 people in Gaza.  Faith continued: \"When you scribble on something, or paint on it, it's a non-violent protest and it shouldn't be made at the same level as a violent protest - it is unjust.\" Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, backed Palestine Action's use of non-violent protest. He told Sky News: \"There has been a place for that in all political movements in history. \"In the struggle for the rights of black people in the US, in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, in the struggle for women to have the vote, people took forms of non-violent direct action. \"Imagine if we had the current [situation] back in those days - we would have been proscribing the suffragettes, treating them as terrorists.\" Read more:Analysis: If Israel breaks Iran it will own the chaosPutin says 'Ukraine is ours' and threatens nuclear strike Others have welcomed the move. Lord Walney, who served as the government's independent adviser on political violence, told Sky News the decision was \"long overdue\". \"Palestine Action have acted as the enemy within which is why it's right, now, to crack down on them,\" he said. \"They have terrorised working people for a number of years and there's a number of serious violent charges that are going through the court system at the moment.\" The UK government is expected to announce its decision early next week."

In those blood spot tests, the baby's heel is pricked to collect a few drops of blood on a card, but with whole genome sequencing, blood samples are typically taken from the umbilical cord shortly after birth.

Technologies like artificial intelligence will be used by the health service to predict illness and allow treatment or medication to be offered much earlier. \"With the power of this new technology, patients will be able to receive personalised healthcare to prevent ill health before symptoms begin, reducing the pressure on NHS services and helping people live longer, healthier lives,\" said Mr Streeting. Along with a greater focus on prevention, the Government's 10-year plan is expected to include Mr Streeting's two other \"shifts\" in the NHS: moving care away from hospitals to communities, and from analogue to digital services. It follows Chancellor Rachel Reeves' announcement that the Government would increase NHS funding by £29 billion per year in real terms over the next three years as it tries to cut waiting lists in line with its election promises."

        "Content": "K-pop star Suga, a rapper and songwriter from global sensation BTS, has been discharged from South Korea's mandatory military service. He is the last member of the band to finish their enlistment duties with Jin, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook already leaving the military. The other six members of the K-pop band served in the army while Suga worked as a social service agent, which is an alternative form of military service. His return is a big moment for BTS fans, known as the ARMY, as the band plans to reunite now they've all finished their service. While details of a reunion have not been released, the group is expected to hold its largest-ever world tour in 2026, according to NH Securities, one of South Korea's largest investment firms. \"It's gone past excitement and into almost being numb,\" said Ayla O'Ryan, 45, from Scotland, about the potential reunion. RM and V were discharged last week, with Jimin and Jung Kook discharged a day later. \"I hope they can explore whatever music...anything they want to do because I will always support them, whatever they feel like doing,\" said Alice Bonamy, an interpreter from France.

It's a system designed to deter aggression from rival North Korea. Athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers are exempt if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers, however, are not exempt. In 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea allowed K-pop stars to delay their enlistment. But there was a heated public debate in 2022 over whether BTS should be completely exempt. The group's management agency then announced that all seven members would fulfil their duties."
