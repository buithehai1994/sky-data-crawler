        "Content": "Lord Mandelson has resigned his membership of the Labour Party to avoid causing it \"further embarrassment\" after documents in newly released files appeared to show he received $75,000 from Jeffrey Epstein. The latest batch of files released by the US Department of Justice includes three apparent bank statements detailing three money transfers of $25,000 each from the paedophile financier to the former British ambassador to Washington in 2003 and 2004. It is unclear whether the payments ever made it into any named accounts. Lord Mandelson, who was the Labour MP for Hartlepool when the files suggest the payments were alleged to have been made, resigned his membership of the party on Sunday night. The peer, who has denied any record or recollection of the payments and questioned their authenticity, said in a statement he wanted \"to repeat my apology to the women and girls whose voices should have been heard long before now\". The New Labour grandee, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the United States over his links to Epstein, appeared in a picture found in the files wearing only his underwear. He said he felt \"regretful and sorry\" about weekend revelations linking him to \"the understandable furore surrounding\" Epstein, who took his own life in prison in 2019. \n                  Mandelson 'has no recollection' of Epstein giving him $75,000\n                 \n                  Trump responds to new Epstein files - as Starmer calls on Andrew to testify before US Congress\n                 \n                  Mandelson told Epstein he was 'trying hard' to change bonus policy after payment to husband, files show\n                 Sky News has found video of Epstein being questioned about his crimes and whether his money was \"dirty\". Epstein, wearing glasses and a black shirt, appears to be answering questions in a sit-down interview. At one point, the interviewer asks Epstein if his money is \"dirty money\", to which the paedophile financier replies: \"No, it's not.\" Asked why not, Epstein says: \"Because I earned it.\" Put to him that his wealth was earned by \"advising the worst people in the world that do enormous bad things\", Epstein says that \"ethics is always a complicated subject\". Epstein then claims he donated money to help try to eradicate polio in Pakistan and India. \"What are you, [a] class 3 sexual predator?\" the interviewer asks. \"Tier 1. I'm the lowest,\" Epstein responds. The interviewer asks if those receiving Epstein's donations knew where the money came from, leading to the following exchange: Epstein: I think if you told them the devil himself said 'I'm going to exchange some dollars for your child's life'... Interviewer: Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: No, but I do have a good mirror. Interviewer: It's a serious question. Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: I don't know. Why would you say that? Interviewer: Because you have all the attributes - Epstein: No, the devil scares me. The person interviewing Epstein doesn't appear on screen, but he is believed to be Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon served in the White House role for the first seven months of Trump's first presidential term. It is unclear when or where the interview was filmed, who filmed the footage or why Bannon in particular was speaking to Epstein. The footage was among more than 2,000 videos released on Friday by the US Department of Justice, along with more than three million pages and 180,000 images.

Pressure is growing on both Lord Mandelson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to appear before the US Congress over their links to Epstein. The latest tranche of Epstein files include three images appearing to show Andrew on all fours over a woman lying on the floor, with the date and circumstances unspecified. Andrew has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing relating to his relationship with Epstein. The former Duke of York has lost all his titles and associated royal roles due to his links to Epstein."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said the US will \"hopefully\" make a deal with Iran after the country's leader warned of a regional conflict if Washington attacked. Asked by reporters for his response to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's remarks, the US president seemed unfazed, asking: \"Why wouldn't he say that? Of course, he could say that. \"We have the biggest, most powerful ships in the world over there, very close, a couple of days \"Hopefully, we'll make a deal. If we don't make a deal, we'll find out whether or not he was right.\" Mr Trump spoke about US ships closing in on Iran on Saturday night and has previously warned he could take military action against Tehran over its killing of peaceful protesters. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded by warning that if the US starts a war, the whole region will be drawn in. In comments reported by Iranian state media, he said: \"America should know that if it starts a war, this time it will be a regional war. \"These threats are nothing new. In the past as well, American officials repeatedly talked about war and said that all options were on the table including war. \"Now this man [Mr Trump] too, keeps claiming that they have brought aircraft carriers and warplanes. The Iranian people should not and will not be frightened by such things. \"We are not the ones who start a war and we do not want to attack any country, but if America attacks or harms Iran the Iranian nation will deliver a strong blow and any war started by America will spread across the region.\" When the US president was asked during a flight to Florida on Saturday night what his \"final decision\" would be on Iran, declined to answer. He said: \"I certainly can't tell you that, but we do have very big, powerful ships heading in that direction, as you know. I can't tell you, you know. But I hope they negotiate something that's acceptable.\" Mr Trump was also asked whether Tehran would be emboldened by the US backing off. He replied: \"Well, some people think that and some people don't. And if you could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons they should do that. But I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\" General Amir Hatami, Iran's regular army commander-in-chief, struck a defiant tone in response. He said: \"Thanks Allah today we are at a high level of military and defensive readiness. We are closely watching enemies' movement in the region. \"They are under complete surveillance by us. And since we are aware of their evil intentions, our fingers are on the trigger. \"If they make a mistake, without doubt they will endanger their security, the security of their forces, the security of the region, and the security of the criminal Zionist regime.\" In Tehran's parliament the mood was similarly combative, with the speaker telling the assembly that European Union military forces were now terrorist groups in the eyes of the Islamic republic. It comes after the EU designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist faction over its bloody crackdown on protesters. Others were more conciliatory. Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing\" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. However, Khamenei, 86, has repeatedly ruled out direct talks with the US. With tensions mounting, Iran faced two explosions on Saturday, though its government denies a ‌military leader was targeted. ‌One blast happened at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas. A four-year-old girl was killed and a further 14 people were injured. A second blast, more than 1,000 kilometres away in Ahvaz, saw five people killed, state media reported."

        "Content": "Five-year prison sentences for those advertising illegal migration routes on social media are coming into force under new powers. Changes as part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act will be enforced from Monday. Law enforcement will no longer have to prove online ads had led to crossings, as under the previous regulations, and will instead be able to prosecute proactively when they find postings. Border security minister Alex Norris told the PA news agency his message to smugglers was: \"We are coming for you.\" Reducing the number of illegal Channel crossings is one of the key goals of the government, with Sir Keir Starmer claiming he had made progress on stopping Chinese-made boat engines reaching Europe while on a visit to Beijing last week. The agreement will make it easier for law enforcement groups to share information with their Chinese counterparts, the government claimed. Some 60% of the boats which crossed the Channel last year had motors made in China. The National Crime Agency will deploy its Online Communications Centre to investigate thousands of social media accounts as part of the latest crackdown. More than 10,000 accounts, pages and posts were shut down last year. The Home Office shared examples of adverts for crossings, which appeared in English, French and Pashto. \"Social media ads promoting the corrupt promise of a life and work in the UK are truly sickening,\" Mr Norris told PA. \"To the people smugglers peddling this content, whether you are selling your vile trade online through 'golden package deals', supplying boat equipment or researching routes, we are coming after you. \"I will not stop until we've restored order and control to our borders.\" Read more:2025 second highest for small boatsMan jailed for supplying small boats and enginesStarmer makes deal with China on engines So far this year, 933 people have crossed the Channel by small boat, with no one having made the trip since 20 January.

Lord Mandelson, who was the Labour MP for Hartlepool when the files suggest the payments were alleged to have been made, resigned his membership of the party on Sunday night. The peer, who has denied any record or recollection of the payments and questioned their authenticity, said in a statement he wanted \"to repeat my apology to the women and girls whose voices should have been heard long before now\". The New Labour grandee, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the United States over his links to Epstein, appeared in a picture found in the files wearing only his underwear. He said he felt \"regretful and sorry\" about weekend revelations linking him to \"the understandable furore surrounding\" Epstein, who took his own life in prison in 2019. \n                  Mandelson 'has no recollection' of Epstein giving him $75,000\n                 \n                  Trump responds to new Epstein files - as Starmer calls on Andrew to testify before US Congress\n                 \n                  Mandelson told Epstein he was 'trying hard' to change bonus policy after payment to husband, files show\n                 Sky News has found video of Epstein being questioned about his crimes and whether his money was \"dirty\". Epstein, wearing glasses and a black shirt, appears to be answering questions in a sit-down interview. At one point, the interviewer asks Epstein if his money is \"dirty money\", to which the paedophile financier replies: \"No, it's not.\" Asked why not, Epstein says: \"Because I earned it.\" Put to him that his wealth was earned by \"advising the worst people in the world that do enormous bad things\", Epstein says that \"ethics is always a complicated subject\". Epstein then claims he donated money to help try to eradicate polio in Pakistan and India. \"What are you, [a] class 3 sexual predator?\" the interviewer asks. \"Tier 1. I'm the lowest,\" Epstein responds. The interviewer asks if those receiving Epstein's donations knew where the money came from, leading to the following exchange: Epstein: I think if you told them the devil himself said 'I'm going to exchange some dollars for your child's life'... Interviewer: Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: No, but I do have a good mirror. Interviewer: It's a serious question. Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: I don't know. Why would you say that? Interviewer: Because you have all the attributes - Epstein: No, the devil scares me. The person interviewing Epstein doesn't appear on screen, but he is believed to be Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon served in the White House role for the first seven months of Trump's first presidential term. It is unclear when or where the interview was filmed, who filmed the footage or why Bannon in particular was speaking to Epstein. The footage was among more than 2,000 videos released on Friday by the US Department of Justice, along with more than three million pages and 180,000 images.

Pressure is growing on both Lord Mandelson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to appear before the US Congress over their links to Epstein. The latest tranche of Epstein files include three images appearing to show Andrew on all fours over a woman lying on the floor, with the date and circumstances unspecified. Andrew has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing relating to his relationship with Epstein. The former Duke of York has lost all his titles and associated royal roles due to his links to Epstein."

        "Content": "A group of families are taking legal action against the company which ran a London nursery where paedophile Vincent Chan abused children. The nursery worker, 45, pleaded guilty last year to assaulting girls aged three and four while working at a Bright Horizons nursery branch in north London, which has since closed. He admitted to 26 sexual offences, including five counts of sexual assault of a child by penetration, four counts of sexual assault of a child by touching, 11 counts of taking indecent photographs of a child and six counts of making indecent photographs of a child. He filmed himself carrying out abuse during the children's naptime. The law firm Leigh Day says it is representing families \"affected by the serious allegations of abuse\" while Chan worked at the nursery between 2017 and 2024, bringing a claim against Bright Horizons Family Solutions Ltd. Leigh Day says 46 families have joined the claim against the company, which runs more than 300 nurseries. In December, Bright Horizons said in a statement that it was \"shocked and appalled\" at the crimes and had commissioned an expert review of its safeguarding practices. At a hearing on Thursday, Chan admitted a further 30 offences which did not take place at the nursery. He worked at a school in north London between 2007 and before he joined the nursery in 2017, according to police. Read more:'Unbearable pain' of family of girl, 7, missing in MoroccoWoman stabbed to death in 'busy' area of London At the hearing last week, Chan pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a female, 12 counts of taking and making indecent photographs of children, six charges of outraging public decency and 11 counts of voyeurism. Police said they recovered images showing him exposing himself in a classroom in 2017, and videos, believed to be of Chan, depicting a solo sex act, also in a classroom. He also admitted to a campaign of voyeurism between 2011 and 2023. Chan was initially unmasked as a paedophile after a Bright Horizons staff member reported that he had filmed a child falling asleep in their food with a nursery-issued device and set it to music for \"comedic purposes\" before sharing the video with his colleagues, the force said in a statement. He was subsequently arrested in June 2024 on suspicion of neglect and officers seized 25 digital devices from his home and three from the nursery. Chan was released on bail, but lost his job at the nursery. Three months later, his devices were submitted for analysis by police, which was completed in July 2025. Forensic teams found substantial amounts of indecent images and videos of children, including evidence of contact sexual offences against children, according to a police statement. Chan will be sentenced on 12 February for all 56 offences to which he has pleaded guilty. A spokesperson for Bright Horizon said: \"First and foremost, our thoughts remain with the children and families affected. \"What happened at our former Finchley Road nursery was an appalling breach of trust by one individual and not representative of the thousands of experienced and dedicated staff who work tirelessly each day to look after the children in our care. \"The safety and wellbeing of children entrusted to our care is our highest priority. We are committed to learning any lessons that can be taken from this terrible case. \"We fully support the Child Safeguarding Practice Review (CSPR) and hope that it will be beneficial for families, for us as a provider and for the Early Years industry as a whole. \"It would be premature to comment on any matters relating to our former nursery whilst the CSPR's process is ongoing. \"Parents are invited to contribute to this review and we would encourage them to participate so that information can be obtained and considered.\""

The warnings say icy patches may form on untreated surfaces, and cautions there may be some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces.

Check the forecast for your area The forecaster said there will probably be some icy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths. It comes after the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain covering the South West from midday on Monday to 9am on Tuesday, following weeks of heavy rain and stormy conditions. A major incident was declared in Somerset earlier this week when around 50 properties were hit by flooding caused by Storm Chandra, according to the county council. As of 12pm on Sunday, there were 58 flood warnings, saying flooding is expected, and 116 alerts - meaning flooding is possible - across England. The Met Office said Sunday would see outbreaks of rain for most of the UK, which will move eastwards throughout the day. It said there would be outbreaks of light rain and showers on Monday, with more persistent rain moving in later.

The forecaster said there will be below-average temperatures in the north and snow on northern hills. It said on Monday, accumulations of 10-20mm of rainfall will be \"possible fairly widely\" in the South West, the Met Office said, \"with perhaps as much as 30-50mm over Dartmoor\", in Devon. The weather warning said there was a small chance of homes and businesses flooding, and fast-flowing or deep floodwater could cause danger to life. \"Outbreaks of rain may become persistent on Monday, especially later in the day and overnight, before gradually easing and clearing into Tuesday,\" it added. \"Given saturated ground following recent rain, there is a chance this may lead to some flooding and disruption in places.\" Official statistics for rainfall in January are set to be released on Monday, but it has been a very wet month for large parts of the UK."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said the US will \"hopefully\" make a deal with Iran after the country's leader warned of a regional conflict if Washington attacked. Asked by reporters for his response to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's remarks, the US president seemed unfazed, asking: \"Why wouldn't he say that? Of course, he could say that. \"We have the biggest, most powerful ships in the world over there, very close, a couple of days \"Hopefully, we'll make a deal. If we don't make a deal, we'll find out whether or not he was right.\" Mr Trump spoke about US ships closing in on Iran on Saturday night and has previously warned he could take military action against Tehran over its killing of peaceful protesters. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded by warning that if the US starts a war, the whole region will be drawn in. In comments reported by Iranian state media, he said: \"America should know that if it starts a war, this time it will be a regional war. \"These threats are nothing new. In the past as well, American officials repeatedly talked about war and said that all options were on the table including war. \"Now this man [Mr Trump] too, keeps claiming that they have brought aircraft carriers and warplanes. The Iranian people should not and will not be frightened by such things. \"We are not the ones who start a war and we do not want to attack any country, but if America attacks or harms Iran the Iranian nation will deliver a strong blow and any war started by America will spread across the region.\" When the US president was asked during a flight to Florida on Saturday night what his \"final decision\" would be on Iran, declined to answer. He said: \"I certainly can't tell you that, but we do have very big, powerful ships heading in that direction, as you know. I can't tell you, you know. But I hope they negotiate something that's acceptable.\" Mr Trump was also asked whether Tehran would be emboldened by the US backing off. He replied: \"Well, some people think that and some people don't. And if you could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons they should do that. But I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\" General Amir Hatami, Iran's regular army commander-in-chief, struck a defiant tone in response. He said: \"Thanks Allah today we are at a high level of military and defensive readiness. We are closely watching enemies' movement in the region. \"They are under complete surveillance by us. And since we are aware of their evil intentions, our fingers are on the trigger. \"If they make a mistake, without doubt they will endanger their security, the security of their forces, the security of the region, and the security of the criminal Zionist regime.\" In Tehran's parliament the mood was similarly combative, with the speaker telling the assembly that European Union military forces were now terrorist groups in the eyes of the Islamic republic. It comes after the EU designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist faction over its bloody crackdown on protesters. Others were more conciliatory. Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing\" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. However, Khamenei, 86, has repeatedly ruled out direct talks with the US. With tensions mounting, Iran faced two explosions on Saturday, though its government denies a ‌military leader was targeted. ‌One blast happened at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas. A four-year-old girl was killed and a further 14 people were injured. A second blast, more than 1,000 kilometres away in Ahvaz, saw five people killed, state media reported."

        "Content": "Carlos Alcaraz has become the youngest ever man to complete a career Grand Slam after defeating Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final. The Spanish tennis star beat Djokovic in four sets to keep the veteran from an unprecedented 25th Grand Slam singles title. But the world number one made history of his own by winning the only Grand Slam that had eluded him, becoming the youngest to win all four tournaments at the age of 22 years and 272 days. His maiden title in Melbourne means he has eclipsed Don Budge - who wrapped up his at the 1938 French Open two days before his 23rd birthday. The previous record in the Open era was held by fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal, who was 24 years and 88 days old when he won the US Open in 2010 to complete the four slams. Alcaraz becomes one of just six men to achieve the feat since 1968, in an esteemed list which also includes Djokovic himself and fellow modern great Roger Federer. Djokovic, a 10-time Australian Open winner, started the match strongly by winning the opening set 2-6, but struggled with Alcaraz's intensity in the following two sets, with the Spaniard taking them 6-2 and 6-3. \nLatest scores with Raducanu at the Transylvania Open, Davis Cup and Montpellier\n \n                  Men's and Women's Australian Open draw and results with Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff playing\n                 \n                  Australian Open: Carlos Alcaraz makes history with victory over Novak Djokovic in men's singles final\n                 It was a hotly contested final set, seeing both players hold their serve until 5-6, when Alcaraz broke Djokovic to earn his victory. It sealed Alcaraz's seventh Grand Slam title in only 20 attempts, adding to his two trophies at each of the other major tournaments. Djokovic paid tribute to the winner after the match, saying: \"Congratulations Carlos, an amazing tournament and an amazing couple of weeks. What you've been doing, the best word to describe it is: historic. \"It's legendary, and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your career. \"You are young like me and I'm sure we'll be seeing each other many times over the next 10 years… not!\" He was non-committal when it came to his future in the sport, signing off at Melbourne Park by saying: \"I must be honest and say I did not think I would be standing at the closing ceremony of a Grand Slam again. \"God knows what happens tomorrow, but it's been a great ride. I love you all.\" Alcaraz was equally complimentary of his opponent, telling Djokovic: \"You're talking about how I'm doing amazing things, but what you're doing is inspiring. Not only for tennis players, but athletes around the world. Putting the right hard work in every day. \"I enjoy watching you play so much. It's been an honour to share the locker room with you and share the court with you. Thank you.\" On his historic win, he added: \"Nobody knows how hard I've worked to get this trophy. \"I chased this moment so much. I appreciate it was a rollercoaster emotionally, and my team and I went through stuff but did the right work.\" The final came off the back of gruelling semi-finals for both players on Friday night. Alcaraz overcame third seed Alexander Zverev in a five-set thriller on Friday night, while Djokovic played at a sensational level for four hours against Sinner, who had won the last two Australian Opens back-to-back."

        "Content": "A group of eight Islamic countries have joined to condemn Israel, accusing the  country \"repeated violations\" of the Gaza ceasefire. Their statement comes a day after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 30 people in Gaza. On Sunday Israel began a move likely to attract more criticism when the country's Diaspora Ministry said it would ban medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), from working in Gaza. Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia claim Israel's actions \"risk escalating tensions and undermining efforts aimed at consolidating calm\" in the region. A joint statement released by the countries' foreign ministries went on to warn that \"repeated violations constitute a direct threat to the political process and hinder ongoing efforts to create appropriate conditions for transitioning to a more stable phase in the Gaza Strip\". The statement suggests this could hinder security, humanitarian conditions and US President Donald Trump's peace plan. Casualties of Saturday's strikes included two women and six children from two different families, officials at the Gaza hospitals which received the bodies said. \n                  Israeli strikes kill at least 30 Palestinians in Gaza, hospital officials say\n                 \n                  Focus turns to future of Gaza after final hostage remains returned to Israel\n                 \n                  Remains of last Israeli hostage found in Gaza\n                 The renewed controversy comes as Israel prepares for to reopen the Rafah border crossing, one of the key steps of the US brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire. On Sunday Israel announced that the crossing between Gaza and Egypt had been opened as part of a test to assess its operation. It said that on Monday it will be opened for the movement of residents in both directions, but numbers will be limited. Some 20,000 people in need of medical care are hoping to leave devastated Gaza via the crossing. On the other side of the fence there are thousands of Palestinians in Egypt hoping to return home. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will allow 50 patients a day to leave. An anonymous official involved in the plans added that they will be allowed to travel with two relatives. They claimed a further 50 people who left Gaza during the war will be allowed to return each day. But Israel say they will be vetted before crossing and stay under the supervision of European Union border agents. Middle East correspondent The opening of the Rafah Crossing will be symbolically important. But its immediate impact will be limited. It seems that Israel will allow only very small numbers to go in either direction - a total of up to 150 leaving Gaza each day, comprising 50 people requiring medical treatment, each accompanied by a maximum of two companions, and 50 people going in the other direction.\n So this is where the maths comes into play. The only people allowed to enter Gaza are those who left during the course of the war, a number that Israel estimates at 42,000.  At a rate of 50 per day, it would take them more than two years for all those people to get back.  Going in the other direction, Palestinian authorities say there are around 6,000 people requiring urgent medical treatment. At that same rate - 50 people crossing per day - that would mean waiting for about four months for them all to cross.  Palestinian medical sources suggest that some will die of their conditions before they can cross. And it's worth remembering that these are not all people injured by war.  Gaza's health system has been largely destroyed, so people suffering from serious illnesses are all desperate for the treatment they cannot get without leaving. A few hundred civilians per day is not the busy crisis-cross of people envisaged by some when the peace deal was announced, nor the flow of aid that many hoped for. It may be that, in the coming days and weeks, the rate of flow is increased, but that will be dependent on Israel’s risk assessment.  It is screening everyone who applies to go in either direction, and that process is not fast. The Rafah Crossing may be open, but not in the way the world might have imagined.  Medical aid for those who have to remain in Gaza could be further limited if the ban on MSF goes ahead. Israel had suspended the charity's operations in Gaza in December because it refused to comply with new registration requirements for organisations to submit lists of local employees. The charity said the regulations could endanger Palestinian staff. Now Israel's diaspora ministry says it is \"moving to terminate\" MSF operations by the end of February. It has said the regulations are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating aid groups. MSF said they were \"a pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance\" and Israeli authorities were \"forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need\". Israel's diaspora ministry director general Avi Cohen-Scali said MSF had chosen to \"violate a public commitment and evade the basic transparency required of any humanitarian organisation\". \"If the organisation had nothing to hide, the employee lists would have been transferred to the inter-ministerial team,\" he said.

The crossing was briefly reopened early last year to allow the evacuation of medical patients. Earlier this month Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie visited Rafah as part of a humanitarian trip. The move to finally reopen it indefinitely comes after the remains of the final Israeli hostage were evacuated from Gaza. It marks a key step in a ceasefire agreement, brokered by Donald Trump's US administration, as it moves into its second phase. Gaza has four other border crossings. But, unlike Rafah, they are shared with Israel."

Erfan Soltani, 26, had been detained during protests on 8 January. His family were later told Mr Soltani, from Fardis, Karaj, would be sentenced to death on Wednesday 14 January, according to Kurdish and Iranian human rights organisation Hengaw. But according to Hengaw and Iranian state media, ISNA, Mr Soltani has been released on bail. A relative of Mr Soltani also confirmed to Sky News that he has been released on bail. ISNA said in a post on Telegram: \"Erfan Soltani, who was arrested during the recent events and whom some foreign media had previously claimed was sentenced to death was released from prison on bail of two billion tomans [roughly £9,000 in Iranian currency].\" Hengaw had previously said Mr Soltani was yet to be executed, despite reports saying he had been on social media. US President Donald Trump has previously warned of \"very strong action\" if Iran executes any protesters. But Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned any action by Mr Trump against his nation would result in war. 'The Iranian people should not be frightened'  In comments reported by Iranian state media, Mr Khamenei said: \"America should know that if it starts a war, this time it will be a regional war. \"These threats are nothing new.

Thousands of people have been killed with Sky News being told of conflicting reports on the actual number."

        "Content": "Nearly 150 militants have been killed in a 40-hour battle after separatist fighters launched a series of deadly attacks, the Pakistani government said. Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province was rocked by a series of coordinated gun and bomb assaults on Saturday that left almost 50 people dead. Attackers dressed as civilians targeted hospitals, schools, banks and markets, junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said. The army, police and counterterrorism units launched large-scale counter-operations after the militants unleashed almost simultaneous assaults across several districts. Officials said armed men across Quetta, Gwadar, Mastung, and Noshki districts had opened fire on security installations, attempted suicide bombings, and briefly blocked roads in urban areas. But 92 militants were killed on Saturday, and 41 more on Friday, according to the chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, while the attackers had killed 17 police and 31 civilians. \"We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation was being planned, and as a result of those, we started pre-operations a day before,\" the minister said. He said the latest tally, 145, represents the highest number of militants killed in such a short span since the insurgency intensified. \"The bodies of these 145 killed terrorists are in our custody, and some of them are Afghan nationals,\" he said.

A banned separatist group, Baloch Liberation Army, claimed responsibility for the recent attacks, dubbing the flare-up Operation Herof, or \"black storm\". The group, which is designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US, claims to have killed 84 members of the security forces and captured 18 others. But the figure remains unverified and the Pakistani military has not commented. Resource-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province, but also its poorest, and has faced decades of separatist insurgency. The separatists demand greater autonomy and a larger share of the province's natural resources. Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif, accused the insurgents of increasingly targeting civilians, labourers, and low-income communities. Mr Chaudhry, the junior interior minister, accused them of using civilians as human shields, adding: \"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops.\" The Pakistani government has accused the insurgents of being \"Indian-sponsored\", though India, Pakistan's arch-rival, claims these are \"baseless allegations\"."

The latest batch of files released by the US Department of Justice includes three apparent bank statements detailing three money transfers of $25,000 each from the paedophile financier to the former British ambassador to Washington in 2003 and 2004. It is unclear whether the payments ever made it into any named accounts. Lord Mandelson, who was the Labour MP for Hartlepool when the files suggest the payments were alleged to have been made, resigned his membership of the party on Sunday night. The peer, who has denied any record or recollection of the payments and questioned their authenticity, said in a statement he wanted \"to repeat my apology to the women and girls whose voices should have been heard long before now\".

Epstein, wearing glasses and a black shirt, appears to be answering questions in a sit-down interview. At one point, the interviewer asks Epstein if his money is \"dirty money\", to which the paedophile financier replies: \"No, it's not.\" Asked why not, Epstein says: \"Because I earned it.\" Put to him that his wealth was earned by \"advising the worst people in the world that do enormous bad things\", Epstein says that \"ethics is always a complicated subject\". Epstein then claims he donated money to help try to eradicate polio in Pakistan and India. \"What are you, [a] class 3 sexual predator?\" the interviewer asks. \"Tier 1. I'm the lowest,\" Epstein responds. The interviewer asks if those receiving Epstein's donations knew where the money came from, leading to the following exchange: Epstein: I think if you told them the devil himself said 'I'm going to exchange some dollars for your child's life'... Interviewer: Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: No, but I do have a good mirror. Interviewer: It's a serious question. Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: I don't know. Why would you say that? Interviewer: Because you have all the attributes - Epstein: No, the devil scares me. The person interviewing Epstein doesn't appear on screen, but he is believed to be Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon served in the White House role for the first seven months of Trump's first presidential term. It is unclear when or where the interview was filmed, who filmed the footage or why Bannon in particular was speaking to Epstein.

        "Content": "A five-year-old boy and his father have returned to Minnesota after they were detained by ICE officers during a raid. Liam Conejo Ramos and his father Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias were taken into custody by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents in their Minneapolis driveway on 20 January, just after the child returned home from preschool that day. A photo of Liam wearing a bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack as he was surrounded by ICE officers went viral and caused outrage among protesters and the wider public. Liam and his father were then flown more than 1,000 miles from their home in Minneapolis to a facility in Texas. But the boy and his father have been released following a judge's order and returned to Minnesota, a spokeswoman for US Congressman Joaquin Castro confirmed on Sunday. She said Mr Castro picked them up from the Dilley immigration detention facility on Saturday night and escorted them home. Following the release, Columbia Heights Public Schools said in a statement: \"Columbia Heights Public Schools is so happy that Liam and his father have returned home to be reunified with his mother, brother and our community. We are very grateful for the overwhelming number of well-wishes and offers of support from people around the globe.\"Liam's release is an important development, and we hope it will lead to positive developments for other families as well, including our other four students who are being held at the Dilley facility in Texas.

He was critical of US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown tactics in his ruling, saying that \"the case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children\". ICE accused of using boy 'as bait' Local school officials and neighbours claimed ICE officers had used Liam as \"bait\" to get his parents by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer. It has generally been understood that ICE agents cannot enter a home unless they have a warrant signed by a judge, so immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments urge people who fear being arrested not to open their doors to agents unless they are shown a warrant. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said suggestions ICE officers used the boy as bait were an \"abject lie\" and claimed the father fled on foot and left the boy in a vehicle in their driveway. Read more:What is ICE and what powers do its agents have?Former CNN presenter charged after covering anti-ICE protest DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: \"For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.\" She said parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing. A protest for Conejo Arias and Liam was held outside the family detention centre they were being held at earlier this week. Texas Representatives, Mr Castro and Jasmine Crockett, visited the father and son, and reported that Conejo Arias said Liam was tired and not eating well. Liam was one of four students stopped in his district on 20 January, according to Zena Stenvik, superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, who said masked and armed officers also detained two 17-year-olds and a 10-year-old. Their detainment has only added to the unrest in Minneapolis, where ICE's crackdown has sparked mass protests. Tensions have deepened since the government deployed 2,000 ICE agents to the city at the start of the year, and even more since the deadly shootings by federal officers of poet Renee Good and Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said the US will \"hopefully\" make a deal with Iran after the country's leader warned of a regional conflict if Washington attacked. Asked by reporters for his response to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's remarks, the US president seemed unfazed, asking: \"Why wouldn't he say that? Of course, he could say that. \"We have the biggest, most powerful ships in the world over there, very close, a couple of days \"Hopefully, we'll make a deal. If we don't make a deal, we'll find out whether or not he was right.\" Mr Trump spoke about US ships closing in on Iran on Saturday night and has previously warned he could take military action against Tehran over its killing of peaceful protesters. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded by warning that if the US starts a war, the whole region will be drawn in. In comments reported by Iranian state media, he said: \"America should know that if it starts a war, this time it will be a regional war. \"These threats are nothing new. In the past as well, American officials repeatedly talked about war and said that all options were on the table including war. \"Now this man [Mr Trump] too, keeps claiming that they have brought aircraft carriers and warplanes. The Iranian people should not and will not be frightened by such things. \"We are not the ones who start a war and we do not want to attack any country, but if America attacks or harms Iran the Iranian nation will deliver a strong blow and any war started by America will spread across the region.\" When the US president was asked during a flight to Florida on Saturday night what his \"final decision\" would be on Iran, declined to answer. He said: \"I certainly can't tell you that, but we do have very big, powerful ships heading in that direction, as you know. I can't tell you, you know. But I hope they negotiate something that's acceptable.\" Mr Trump was also asked whether Tehran would be emboldened by the US backing off. He replied: \"Well, some people think that and some people don't. And if you could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons they should do that. But I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\" General Amir Hatami, Iran's regular army commander-in-chief, struck a defiant tone in response. He said: \"Thanks Allah today we are at a high level of military and defensive readiness. We are closely watching enemies' movement in the region. \"They are under complete surveillance by us. And since we are aware of their evil intentions, our fingers are on the trigger. \"If they make a mistake, without doubt they will endanger their security, the security of their forces, the security of the region, and the security of the criminal Zionist regime.\" In Tehran's parliament the mood was similarly combative, with the speaker telling the assembly that European Union military forces were now terrorist groups in the eyes of the Islamic republic. It comes after the EU designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist faction over its bloody crackdown on protesters. Others were more conciliatory. Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing\" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. However, Khamenei, 86, has repeatedly ruled out direct talks with the US. With tensions mounting, Iran faced two explosions on Saturday, though its government denies a ‌military leader was targeted. ‌One blast happened at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas. A four-year-old girl was killed and a further 14 people were injured. A second blast, more than 1,000 kilometres away in Ahvaz, saw five people killed, state media reported."

The billionaire brothers behind gambling giant Betfred topped the rankings of The Sunday Times Tax List 2026 for the first time, surpassing musicians, entrepreneurs and sports stars. Fred and Peter Done, who founded the Warrington-based business in 1967, paid out an estimated £400.1m in tax over the past year, according to the annual list. It came after their tax bill climbed by almost half from £273.4m a year earlier. Financial trading entrepreneur Alex Gerko ranked second on the list with £331.4m in tax, followed by hedge fund boss Chris Rokos, who paid £330m. Elsewhere, Harry Styles was among the new entries to the list, in 54th place, paying £24.7m in tax. The former One Direction member-turned-solo artist is set to release his fourth studio album in March.

Two footballers also joined the list for the first time, with Manchester City's Erling Haaland appearing in 72nd place with an estimated tax payment of £16.9m and Liverpool's Salah believed to have a bill of £14.5m, in 81st place. Haaland, 25, is the youngest person to appear in the tax list. Harry Potter author Rowling ranked 36th on the list with a bill of £47.5m, and musician Ed Sheeran 64th, with a £19.9m tax payment. Boxer Anthony Joshua ranked 100th, paying £11m. Wetherspoons founder Sir Tim Martin, 70, ranked eighth in the list with a personal contribution of £199.7m. The list showed that the top 100 taxpayers handed over a total of £5.758bn worth of tax, up from £4.985bn a year earlier. Many on the list, including the Done brothers, paid more tax after changes to corporation tax rates and other taxes by the government in a bid to support higher welfare spending. Robert Watts, who compiled the list, said: \"This is an increasingly diverse list, with Premier League footballers and world famous pop stars lining up alongside aristocrats and business owners selling pies, pillows and baby milk. \"This year there's been a big jump in the amount of tax we've identified - largely because of higher corporation tax rates.\" Six taxpayers feature on the list despite leaving the UK over the past year, amid reports of wealthy individuals moving to avoid higher taxes under Labour, or due to non-dom status being removed. These included Wren Kitchens founder Malcolm Healey and sports promoter Eddie Hearn."

The latest batch of files released by the US Department of Justice includes three apparent bank statements detailing three money transfers of $25,000 each from the paedophile financier to the former British ambassador to Washington in 2003 and 2004. It is unclear whether the payments ever made it into any named accounts. Lord Mandelson, who was the Labour MP for Hartlepool when the files suggest the payments were alleged to have been made, resigned his membership of the party on Sunday night. The peer, who has denied any record or recollection of the payments and questioned their authenticity, said in a statement he wanted \"to repeat my apology to the women and girls whose voices should have been heard long before now\". The New Labour grandee, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the United States over his links to Epstein, appeared in a picture found in the files wearing only his underwear.

Epstein, wearing glasses and a black shirt, appears to be answering questions in a sit-down interview. At one point, the interviewer asks Epstein if his money is \"dirty money\", to which the paedophile financier replies: \"No, it's not.\" Asked why not, Epstein says: \"Because I earned it.\" Put to him that his wealth was earned by \"advising the worst people in the world that do enormous bad things\", Epstein says that \"ethics is always a complicated subject\". Epstein then claims he donated money to help try to eradicate polio in Pakistan and India. \"What are you, [a] class 3 sexual predator?\" the interviewer asks. \"Tier 1. I'm the lowest,\" Epstein responds. The interviewer asks if those receiving Epstein's donations knew where the money came from, leading to the following exchange: Epstein: I think if you told them the devil himself said 'I'm going to exchange some dollars for your child's life'... Interviewer: Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: No, but I do have a good mirror. Interviewer: It's a serious question. Do you think you're the devil himself? Epstein: I don't know. Why would you say that? Interviewer: Because you have all the attributes - Epstein: No, the devil scares me. The person interviewing Epstein doesn't appear on screen, but he is believed to be Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Bannon served in the White House role for the first seven months of Trump's first presidential term. It is unclear when or where the interview was filmed, who filmed the footage or why Bannon in particular was speaking to Epstein. The footage was among more than 2,000 videos released on Friday by the US Department of Justice, along with more than three million pages and 180,000 images.

Changes as part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act will be enforced from Monday. Law enforcement will no longer have to prove online ads had led to crossings, as under the previous regulations, and will instead be able to prosecute proactively when they find postings. Border security minister Alex Norris told the PA news agency his message to smugglers was: \"We are coming for you.\" Reducing the number of illegal Channel crossings is one of the key goals of the government, with Sir Keir Starmer claiming he had made progress on stopping Chinese-made boat engines reaching Europe while on a visit to Beijing last week. The agreement will make it easier for law enforcement groups to share information with their Chinese counterparts, the government claimed. Some 60% of the boats which crossed the Channel last year had motors made in China. The National Crime Agency will deploy its Online Communications Centre to investigate thousands of social media accounts as part of the latest crackdown. More than 10,000 accounts, pages and posts were shut down last year. The Home Office shared examples of adverts for crossings, which appeared in English, French and Pashto. \"Social media ads promoting the corrupt promise of a life and work in the UK are truly sickening,\" Mr Norris told PA. \"To the people smugglers peddling this content, whether you are selling your vile trade online through 'golden package deals', supplying boat equipment or researching routes, we are coming after you. \"I will not stop until we've restored order and control to our borders.\" Read more:2025 second highest for small boatsMan jailed for supplying small boats and enginesStarmer makes deal with China on engines So far this year, 933 people have crossed the Channel by small boat, with no one having made the trip since 20 January.

It comes after even more information linking the pair to the paedophile financier was released over the weekend. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has lost all his titles and associated royal roles due to his links to Epstein, while Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the United States. There have also been calls for the New Labour grandee to be stripped of his peerage. And on Sunday, Trevor Phillips delivered a blunt message to his friend of nearly 50 years, warning Lord Mandelson that his political career was over. Speaking to Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Housing Secretary Steve Reed said: \"If anybody has information or evidence that they can share that might help to understand what's gone on and bring justice for these victims then they should share it. \"Whether that is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, whether it's Lord Mandelson, or whether it's anybody else.\" The minister added that people have a \"moral obligation to share what they know\". In the latest tranche of Epstein files, it was revealed Lord Mandelson was \"trying hard\" to change government policy on bankers' bonuses at Epstein's behest in December 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. By that point, he had returned to the UK government and was business secretary. The documents also showed correspondence in September 2009 between Epstein and Lord Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, who asked the financier to pay him thousands to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses. Epstein was released from prison in July 2009, having pleaded guilty to trafficking a minor. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said that Andrew should give evidence to the US Congress, which is investigating Epstein, if asked. Now pressure is building on Lord Mandelson to do the same. Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp told Sky News that both Andrew and Lord Mandelson should \"give all the assistance they possibly can\" to authorities investigating Epstein. Trevor Phillips said at the start of his own show that he had known Lord Mandelson for almost half a century. He went on: \"I have not spoken personally to Lord Mandelson about the release this weekend of documents, messages, photographs and videos related to the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"He was invited to join us this morning but declined. \"However, he has told this programme that neither he nor his husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, has any record or recollection of receiving payments in 2003 or 2004, or knows whether the documentation is authentic. \"He does accept that Reinaldo received a loan of $10,000 from Epstein whilst he, Mandelson, was a senior cabinet minister, and he acknowledges that in the same period, Epstein was amongst those who lobbied him on important policy matters. \"There's no suggestion that Lord Mandelson has done anything unlawful. \"But I would claim the friend's privilege to tell Peter that he has been, at best naive and foolish, at worst greedy and duplicitous. \"Whatever is true as far as politics and public office are concerned, for Peter Mandelson, this is the end.\" Read more:Key findings from the latest Epstein filesClear Epstein welcomed into Andrew's family foldEpstein sent thousands to Mandelson's husband Phillips finished: \"The question now is whether the price of his misjudgement is to be paid only by the man himself, or whether those who trusted him and elevated him to the peerage, and to one of the highest diplomatic posts available, should also share in his ignominy.\" Asked to comment on Lord Mandelson and Epstein, Sir Keir said: \"Obviously he was removed as ambassador in relation to the further information that came to light in September of last year and I've nothing more to say in relation to Peter Mandelson.\" 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Lord Mandelson has previously offered an unequivocal apology to Epstein's victims. Being pictured or mentioned in the Epstein files is not an indicator of any wrongdoing. Andrew paid millions to Virginia Giuffre, a woman he has claimed never to have met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022. In a statement issued on 17 October 2025, the former prince reiterated that he \"vigorously\" denies the accusations against him."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n John Bishop was going through a divorce from his wife Melanie. It was October 2000 and he had moved out of his family home and would see his children on the weekend. After saying goodbye to his family for another week, the then 34-year-old salesman wandered into the Frog and Bucket comedy club in Manchester and, to avoid paying the £4 entry fee, signed up for the open mic night that was taking place. Only a handful of people were in the room, his name was called to go on stage and from there, John Bishop began his career in comedy. \"I found this thing that I just loved, but I was never sure it would be a job ever,\" he tells Sky News. \"It took a number of years for me to build up to it and I was 40 when I left my job, so it was a completely different stage than what you see in the film. \"What you see in the film is someone who all of a sudden finds something that they never knew would be the right thing for them.\" The Scouse stand-up comic adds: \"I wasn't nervous when I handed in my notice because I knew I could do it. You know, the big thing with stand-up comedy is it's a meritocracy. \n                  All the best Grammys 2026 fashion as celebrities hit the red carpet\n                 \n                  Riz Ahmed hopes his modern-day 'visceral' Hamlet will be shown in schools\n                 \n                  Catherine O'Hara, who starred in Home Alone and Schitt's Creek, has died \n                 \"You know if you're good because you make more people laugh in the room than the other acts on the bill. \"And because it's the support of the community, which again is something you see in the film, they'll push you on if you are good, people will let you know. \"By the time I was ready to leave my job, it was either stay as someone who's a decent comedian or try and make the leap and see what happens.\" It was that story he recounted to actor Will Arnett when they met by chance on a barge in Amsterdam. Joined by Mark Chappell, the three began creating what would become the new film Is This Thing On?, directed by Bradley Cooper. Bishop was involved in the early stages of the script but took a step back to allow Arnett and Chappell make it their own. The story, now set in America, follows Alex Novak, a finance professional who stumbles into the New York comedy scene. 'It wasn't even crickets, it was silence' Reflecting the early stages of a comedian's journey means Arnett had to purposely create jokes that wouldn't land - and perform them to real crowds. \"It was important to us that he doesn't come out and be the Michael Jordan of comedy the first time,\" Arnett explains. \"There was a night that I bombed particularly badly, and what was so glaring was the contrast because I'd done the same material five minutes before and it had gone really well.\" Arnett adds: \"It wasn't even crickets, it was silence. At first that was really daunting and very scary, and at the same time, there's something kind of magical about bombing that much because it's so quiet and you have to stay up there and do it. \"And it's also perversely funny to you as well. You're like, wow, this is really not working.\" The film isn't just about finding your correct path in life, but also taking the active decision to choose what is right for you. Its main characters, Alex and Tess, played by Arnett and co-star Laura Dern, are shown going through the ordeal of a divorce. Read more from Sky News:Prince Harry's court case: What's happened so far?Oscar nominations 2026: The full list There's no pinpoint reason behind their separation, but instead the film explores their journey in finding their own passions in life. The separation sparks Tess's own identity search as a woman who had dedicated her life to a sport she no longer plays. Dern says the film served as a reminder to make a conscious decision to choose happiness. \"Every day we have to reignite our passion,\" she says. \"The luxury of having lives where - whether it's being in partnership or parenting... If we're lucky enough to have a job we actually love, even still life happens to us and you have to work to reignite your joy.\" Is This Thing On? is in cinemas now."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       \"He's powerless, he's being gaslit… a lot of people feel that way\" - Riz Ahmed on why his \"fresh\" adaptation of Hamlet speaks to our \"unfair\" times. For Ahmed, \"a musical chairs of... studio execs leaving\" meant it's taken 13 years to bring his modern interpretation of Shakespeare's Hamlet to the screen. While the wait has clearly been frustrating for the Oscar-winning actor, he says he's come to realise \"this is the time for this story\". \"Hamlet is feeling the way a lot of us are, you know, he's feeling the world's an unfair place,\" he tells Sky News. \"He's powerless about it. He's being gaslit about it. He's complicit in it... and a lot of people feel that way.\" Ahmed says he became \"obsessed\" with the story as a teenager. \"I had an amazing English teacher who gave me the play to look at because he saw that I was feeling out of place.\" Filmed as an action thriller reimagined in modern London, the actor says he'd love the movie to be shown to students instead of the \"very-old filmed plays\" which have traditionally been shown in schools. \n                  All the best Grammys 2026 fashion as celebrities hit the red carpet\n                 \n                  'I bombed particularly badly': Star of John Bishop-inspired film Is This Thing On? recalls 'scary' stand-up show\n                 \n                  Catherine O'Hara, who starred in Home Alone and Schitt's Creek, has died \n                 Deploying a shaky first-person camera technique, stylistically the adaptation certainly feels edgy and original with Hamlet's iconic \"To be or not to be\" speech delivered at high speed in a car. \"Really, my biggest hope is that they show this to students, that this very visceral version is the one that people have in their minds when they think of a filmed version.\" It sees Ahmed reunited with his creative collaborator, director Aneil Karia. In 2022 the pair won an Oscar for their short film, The Long Goodbye. Ahmed jokes: \"I thought, 'if it wins, I'll take [Hamlet] to him, if it doesn't, I'll delete his number' - and so it turned out alright!\" 'Destroyed' from lack of sleep In the past, the actor has admitted being an \"obsessive perfectionist\" when it comes to the projects he works on. When asked if becoming a dad might have seen a shift in Ahmed's focus and made him a little less intense to work with, the pair crack up laughing. As Karia diplomatically explains: \"The creative process is like a long, winding one, right? In the shoot, Riz operates almost entirely on bodily emotional instinct… there is something raw and kind of beautiful about how it goes into that.\" \"It's the edit!\" Ahmed chips in, laughing. Ahmed says becoming a new dad while, at the same time, Karia was a father to young kids going through sleep regressions certainly made the shoot feel \"a bit more raw\".

You know, parents get to that kind of breaking point, they hit that wall.

You know, sometimes when you're that exhausted, you bypass the brain. You have to go from instinct, so I think weirdly having families forced us to not be as precious.\" Hamlet opens in cinemas in the UK on 6 February."

The billionaire brothers behind gambling giant Betfred topped the rankings of The Sunday Times Tax List 2026 for the first time, surpassing musicians, entrepreneurs and sports stars. Fred and Peter Done, who founded the Warrington-based business in 1967, paid out an estimated £400.1m in tax over the past year, according to the annual list. It came after their tax bill climbed by almost half from £273.4m a year earlier. Financial trading entrepreneur Alex Gerko ranked second on the list with £331.4m in tax, followed by hedge fund boss Chris Rokos, who paid £330m. Elsewhere, Harry Styles was among the new entries to the list, in 54th place, paying £24.7m in tax. The former One Direction member-turned-solo artist is set to release his fourth studio album in March.

Two footballers also joined the list for the first time, with Manchester City's Erling Haaland appearing in 72nd place with an estimated tax payment of £16.9m and Liverpool's Salah believed to have a bill of £14.5m, in 81st place. Haaland, 25, is the youngest person to appear in the tax list. Harry Potter author Rowling ranked 36th on the list with a bill of £47.5m, and musician Ed Sheeran 64th, with a £19.9m tax payment. Boxer Anthony Joshua ranked 100th, paying £11m. Wetherspoons founder Sir Tim Martin, 70, ranked eighth in the list with a personal contribution of £199.7m. The list showed that the top 100 taxpayers handed over a total of £5.758bn worth of tax, up from £4.985bn a year earlier. Many on the list, including the Done brothers, paid more tax after changes to corporation tax rates and other taxes by the government in a bid to support higher welfare spending. Robert Watts, who compiled the list, said: \"This is an increasingly diverse list, with Premier League footballers and world famous pop stars lining up alongside aristocrats and business owners selling pies, pillows and baby milk. \"This year there's been a big jump in the amount of tax we've identified - largely because of higher corporation tax rates.\" Six taxpayers feature on the list despite leaving the UK over the past year, amid reports of wealthy individuals moving to avoid higher taxes under Labour, or due to non-dom status being removed. These included Wren Kitchens founder Malcolm Healey and sports promoter Eddie Hearn."
