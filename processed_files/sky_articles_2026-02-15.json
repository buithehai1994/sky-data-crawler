        "Content": "The government has announced a sweeping \"crackdown\" on tech firms to protect children from illegal content. It will include measures to eliminate \"vile illegal content created by AI,\" and could even open the door to an Australia-style age limit on social media, a Number 10 spokesperson said. It also promises to shut down the loophole that has allowed chatbots to produce illegal content. On Sunday Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"no platform gets a free pass\" from the new restrictions. Under the plans, ministers will \"shut a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by illegal content duties in the Online Safety Act\", according to a government announcement. Introduced in 2023, the Online Safety Act imposes strict duties on social media platforms - particularly in protecting children from harmful content. The government has also promised a consultation with tech firms to discuss how to best safeguard children. \n                  How Trump's White House is helping Big Tech fight back against child safety campaigners\n                 \n                  Instagram use can be 'problematic' but not addictive, says app's chief\n                 \n                  Beth Rigby: The constant challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild West\n                 A spokesperson said that means \"being able to act quickly on measures like setting a minimum age limit for social media and restricting features like infinite scrolling that are harmful\". In December last year Australia became the first country in the world to introduce a mandatory minimum age of 16 for accessing social media platforms. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"As a dad of two teenagers, I know the challenges and the worries that parents face making sure their kids are safe online. \"Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up. With my government, Britain will be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to online safety. \"Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action. \"We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media.\" Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. \"That's why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values. \"We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media. \"We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at a time of rapid technological change.\" Read more from Sky News:Foreign secretary denies PM is 'rattled'Inside the UK's van dwelling hotspots Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott dismissed the proposals as \"more smoke and mirrors from a government that has chosen inaction when it comes to stopping under-16s accessing social media\". Ms Trott said the evidence that social media content harms under-16s is \"clear\" and said they \"should be prevented from accessing\" it. Britain, she said, \"is lagging behind while other countries have recognised the risks and begun to act\". Her view was echoed by Dr Becky Foljambe, founder of Health Professionals for Safer Screens, who said ministers should \"stop talking and act, as every day they dither, more children are harmed\"."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The old, rules-based order that evolved from the ashes of the Second World War no longer exists - at least that is the verdict of Germany's chancellor, and the evidence is clear to see. The United States signalled at a major security conference in Munich over the weekend that it is ready to go it alone, without its European allies - unless they get serious about rearming. Russia is showing no real desire to end its war in Ukraine. And China is gaining a level of strength and influence that can only be rivalled by America. It all means so-called big power competition - potentially leading to larger-scale conflict - is back, and small and medium-sized countries like the UK and its European allies need each other more than ever. That was a key message coming from this year's Munich Security Conference. It was delivered via speeches by prime ministers, presidents and foreign secretaries on a large stage inside a hotel surrounded by police, barricades and security cordons. \n                  Epstein survivor says women who recruited her 'laughed' as she was sexually assaulted on jet\n                 \n                  Epstein survivor says her recruiters 'laughed' as she was sexually assaulted on private jet\n                 \n                  Only Russia could poison Navalny - Yvette Cooper\n                 Friedrich Merz, the German leader, set the tone with his address on Friday, the first day of the event which stretched until Sunday morning. \"In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat,\" he said. \"The international order based on rights and rules... no longer exists in the way it once did.\" President Vladimir Putin and President Xi Jinping of China have already been working to undermine this global system that was created by design to favour liberal democracies and restrict authoritarian regimes by enshrining fundamental values such as human rights and the rule of law. But the end of the Cold War meant that many European governments chose to shift funding away from their respective armed forces that had given them the hard military strength to be able to defend and fight for these values were they ever to be challenged again in the future. Instead, and especially across western Europe, they relied on the United States to defend them in crisis as part of the NATO alliance. Donald Trump, though, has since made clear this assumption of transatlantic protection can no longer be taken for granted. His administration has also gone further, attacking European leaders on domestic issues such as over immigration and free speech. In fact, vice president JD Vance, who led the US delegation in Munich a year ago, questioned whether European values were ones America should even be defending anymore. He did not return this time around. Washington's position instead was represented by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, who struck a more diplomatic, conciliatory tone. This was welcomed by delegates but his message was no less sharp - Europe needs to take greater responsibility for its own defences as the US steps away to focus on other priorities deemed to be more important to America's national interests. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said in his speech on the main stage. \"We believe that Europe must survive because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history's constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours.\" But he added: \"Under President Trump, the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration, driven by a vision of a future as proud as sovereign and as vital as our civilisation's past. And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference, and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe.\" Sir Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, did his best to say the UK and its European allies are stepping up to fix their hollowed-out defences. \"We must build our hard power because that is the currency of the age,\" he told delegates when it was his turn to speak. \"We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary we must be ready to fight. To do whatever it takes to protect our people, our values and our way of life. \"And as Europe, we must stand on our own two feet.\" Yet, military insiders were quick to point out that his rhetoric was a far cry from the reality of his own country's defence budget. The UK is only planning to inch up defence spending to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% by next year, with no funded plan to lift it to the new NATO target of 3.5% by 2035 and no sign of any intention to accelerate the timeline even though other states are going much faster. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of state for war policy, offered the clearest possible advice in an address he gave to NATO defence ministers in Brussels on the eve of the Munich summit about how they need to demonstrate action, not just words and numbers. \"It means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" he said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\""

        "Content": "Team GB will leave the 2026 Olympic Winter Games as history makers after securing two titles on the same day for the first time. Having never won two gold medals on a single day of any previous Winter Games, Britain finished top of the podium in mixed team snowboarding - their first-ever gold on snow - and again in mixed team skeleton. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale were the first pair to medal, delivering a stunning performance to take top spot at the Livigno Snow Park. As it happened: Team GB's record-breaking day The pair, world champions in 2023, beat Italy to the gold medal by 0.43seconds in the final. It was then the turn of Matt Weston and Tabby Stoecker on Sunday evening to win the next gold in mixed team skeleton. Having been the dominant winner of the men's title on Friday evening, Weston became the first British athlete to win two medals at the same Winter Olympics when he and Tabby Stoecker beat Germany by 0.17seconds. \n                  Winter Olympics as it happened: Team GB's record-breaking Winter Olympics continues with mixed team skeleton win\n                 \n                  Team USA skier Lindsey Vonn 'discharged from hospital' a week after horror Olympics crash\n                 \n                  Valentine's Day gift for Winter Olympians - more condoms\n                 Fellow Britons Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit were just edged into fourth place by the other German team of Jacqueline Pfeifer and Christopher Grotheer. Debut gold on snow After winning both their quarter-final and semi-final, all eyes were on Bankes and Nightingale in their bid to make history on the slopes. The impressive Bankes moved up to first place midway through the decisive women's race after Nightingale had finished a close second to France's Loan Bozzolo in the men's race. The gold medal marked a remarkable revival from the duo, who had both exited the heats in disappointing fashion in their respective individual events earlier in the Games. Their medal is Britain's best ever on snow, building on the bronzes previously won by Jenny Jones, Billy Morgan and Izzy Atkin. Bankes said: \"I'm happy with my riding all day. I found it again, which I've been struggling with for the last week here. \"At last I found some speed and made it count. I really used my carving, the drafting, made the right choices, and that's where it pays off.\" Late skeleton drama Hopes were high for another medal in the skeleton after Weston's individual gold on Friday. Stoecker had given her partner a tough task with her run of 1:00.77 - 0.30seconds off the pace of the Germans - but Weston put in a sublime 58.59seconds run to clinch the gold. The pair, ranked top seeds ahead of the event, won with a final time of 1:59.36, setting a new course record in the process. \"Luckily, I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston said. \"I took a load of confidence from the individual event and I almost had to be boring to get the job done and do it again.\" \"I can't believe it,\" Stoecker added. \"It's a team effort and when Matt came down and we were in the green, I was just in shock.\""

Those blunt verdicts frame Sir Keir Starmer's march into recess: a leader who has steadied himself enough to stave off immediate crisis, but whose authority and judgement are still being openly questioned as the party looks ahead to a decisive spring. Sir Keir has been on something of a charm offensive, hosting Scottish and Welsh colleagues at Chequers in a bid to reknit frayed loyalties. \"My God, he's actually got a sense of humour - why don't we ever see that side?\" one backbencher remarked afterwards. MPs I speak to are, broadly, in a better mood than they were 10 days ago. Even so, ministers concede the road ahead remains uncertain. \"I don't know,\" one says eventually when I ask whether the prime minister will survive beyond May. The \"only way\" of replacing him \"without too much pain\", another minister suggests, would be if Starmer chose to stand down himself. \"At some point there's only so much one man can take.\" The minister would not say whether that would be their preferred outcome. \n                  Greens and Reform hit back at Sir Keir Starmer after attacks in Munich speech\n                 \n                  Tackling misogyny should be sixth mission of Sir Keir Starmer's government, Harriet Harman says\n                 \n                  Starmer insists he'll lead Labour into next election as he attempts to move on from leadership crisis\n                 One backbencher, not a usual critic, puts Starmer's chances of surviving past May at 50 per cent. For now, the short-term outcome is continuity rather than catastrophe. One MP describes Monday's events as a \"remarkable\" turnaround: \"Shockingly, it seems like we've turned a corner.\" But, as one minister warns, \"the troublemakers will be happy for a few weeks and then find something else to complain about.\" And there are several flashpoints looming. The Gorton and Denton by-election is just two weeks away. Privately, Labour sources say the outlook on the ground is better than expected. Read more:Mandelson asked to testify in Epstein investigationForeign secretary denies the PM is 'rattled' Others argue the loudest voices are being heard, while the number of quietly loyal Labour MPs is being underestimated. \"I only got my seat because people around the leadership backed me,\" one MP tells me. \"So I'll stay loyal to Keir until the end.\" A pause. \"But that end may be fairly near.\" Those close to the prime minister say he can be at his best when his back is against the wall. His main line of defence to colleagues has been that he remains the best person for the job, and that there is no obvious alternative. It is that question of what comes next that may have saved him this week. The contest over potential successors is, for now, fragmented. Angela Rayner looms large. \"Ange won't go for it unless someone else moves first,\" says an ally. Even some who do not support her believe she could cut through on the doorstep. As one Red Wall MP puts it: \"It would give me something to say. There's a personality. There's a product.\" Any prospect of a Wes Streeting leadership bid appears, for now, to be on ice. His critics continue to brief openly against him; one described to me his pre-interview \"breath work\" as evidence he is not ready to lead the party. Defence Secretary John Healey has been floated by some as a steady, unity candidate. But a senior figure who has worked closely with him says: \"He's not ambitious like that.\" Another suggests he could act as a stalking horse, clearing the path for someone else. One scenario put to me is that Starmer serves a full first term but stands aside before the next general election, allowing another figure to lead the party into the contest, echoing the decision of former French president Francois Hollande not to seek re-election, with another candidate campaigning as would-be president. Of course, that election saw the Socialist Party vote collapse and Emmanuel Macron's new movement sweep to power. Sir Keir is being pulled in multiple directions. One minister argues he needs a more strategic view, particularly on Europe. Another frontbencher warns that a reset reshuffle designed to appease the soft left would \"pretty much finish him\". With so many MPs holding slim majorities, there is a degree of self-preservation. We are often \"fighting geography rather than ideology,\" one backbencher tells me. \"I understand people wanting to protect their own back yards.\" A Downing Street spokesperson stressed that Sir Keir, one of only four Labour leaders to have won an election outright, has a five-year mandate to \"deliver change, and that is what he will do\".  For now, \"Keir's hobbling on,\" as a senior Labour figure puts it. \"Everyone's going to let him muddle through until May.\" \"He's got nine lives,\" they add. He may need all of them come May."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring extended all the way to Africa's southern coast - held together by the invisible chains of psychological bondage that kept his victims ensnared for years at a time.  \"Invisible chains is a good way to put it, it was like I was handcuffed invisibly,\" says 43-year-old Juliette Bryant. \"I'd never even told my family, I never told anyone about what happened with him until he died.\" Juliette was recruited from Cape Town by Epstein in 2002, as a first-year university student and aspiring model. At only 20 years old, she thought her life was about to change for good. \"It just seemed like my dreams were all coming true because our family was struggling financially and I just really wanted to try and make a difference for my family.\" Juliette was on a flight to New York on her first overseas trip outside of South Africa, three weeks after meeting Epstein for the first time at a Cape Town restaurant with Bill Clinton, who was there on an official AIDS awareness trip accompanied by actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Hours barely passed after arriving in New York City when she was told she would be travelling on to the Caribbean. A driver dropped her off at a runway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and she boarded a private jet where Epstein and the women she says initially recruited her in Cape Town were waiting to fly to his private island. \"He patted the chair next to him... and then I went and sat there. It was such a confusing situation for a young person to be in. \"As the plane took off, he started forcibly touching me in between my legs, and I just freaked out and I suddenly realised - oh my God, my family aren't going to see me again, these people might kill me, you know? \"They [the women] were laughing. I was really petrified.\" It is unlikely she was the only young woman trafficked by Epstein from Cape Town. Emails from the Epstein files show flight details for unnamed female travellers being shuttled from Cape Town to London, Atlanta and New York up until late 2018. Juliette says she was not trafficked to other men but raped by Epstein repeatedly. \"I would see him at lunch, breakfast and dinner, and then I would be called to his room. Otherwise, I didn't see a lot of him, he was always off working. \"I spent a lot of time there on my own. I'd sit by the pool or read books, and I also found disposable cameras in the kitchen which I took to, so I took photos while I was there.\" Juliette's photos flit between beaming smiles in the embrace of other young women and haunting portraits of desolation and loneliness. \"There was no way of getting away, you know. They had my passport and by then we had landed on one of the Caribbean islands and then were taken on a helicopter to his island. There was just no way of getting away. I'm not strong enough to swim away. I wouldn't be able to swim off there.\" Read more:'I am too young and he is too old': Epstein survivors' diariesEpstein asked staff to install hidden video cameras at his homeHow Epstein made his money Her entrapment was more than physical. Even after she was sent back to Cape Town, she boarded more flights to Epstein's properties in New York, Palm Beach, Paris and New Mexico where she says she met women and underage girls from Brazil, Romania, France and Spain. Juliette tells us she is still piecing together the depth of Epstein's dark machinery while contending with her psychological recovery and constant exposure to news about her abuser. \"I look on Facebook, I see Epstein's face. I look on X, I see Epstein's face. I look at the news, there it is again. You know, there are times when it's made me feel physically ill, to be honest, it is just constantly there and there is no way of escaping it.\" The controversial US Department of Justice release of the latest Epstein files saw dozens of vulnerable victims exposed by insufficient redactions. Juliette's emails to Epstein were published unredacted and show her expressing support for him ahead of his trial in 2008 and continuing to contact him until 2017. \"Whenever I sent emails, it was always when I had been drinking or when I was having a bit of a breakdown... I always felt like he was watching me, and that was also why I emailed. \"I have nothing to hide. It has obviously been upsetting because it confuses people because obviously the man had a terrible grip on my mind.\""

        "Content": "The government has announced a sweeping \"crackdown\" on tech firms to protect children from illegal content. It will include measures to eliminate \"vile illegal content created by AI,\" and could even open the door to an Australia-style age limit on social media, a Number 10 spokesperson said. It also promises to shut down the loophole that has allowed chatbots to produce illegal content. On Sunday Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"no platform gets a free pass\" from the new restrictions. Under the plans, ministers will \"shut a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by illegal content duties in the Online Safety Act\", according to a government announcement. Introduced in 2023, the Online Safety Act imposes strict duties on social media platforms - particularly in protecting children from harmful content. The government has also promised a consultation with tech firms to discuss how to best safeguard children. \n                  How Trump's White House is helping Big Tech fight back against child safety campaigners\n                 \n                  Instagram use can be 'problematic' but not addictive, says app's chief\n                 \n                  Beth Rigby: The constant challenges I face keeping my kids safe in the new Wild West\n                 A spokesperson said that means \"being able to act quickly on measures like setting a minimum age limit for social media and restricting features like infinite scrolling that are harmful\". In December last year Australia became the first country in the world to introduce a mandatory minimum age of 16 for accessing social media platforms. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"As a dad of two teenagers, I know the challenges and the worries that parents face making sure their kids are safe online. \"Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up. With my government, Britain will be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to online safety. \"Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action. \"We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media.\" Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. \"That's why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values. \"We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media. \"We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at a time of rapid technological change.\" Read more from Sky News:Foreign secretary denies PM is 'rattled'Inside the UK's van dwelling hotspots Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott dismissed the proposals as \"more smoke and mirrors from a government that has chosen inaction when it comes to stopping under-16s accessing social media\". Ms Trott said the evidence that social media content harms under-16s is \"clear\" and said they \"should be prevented from accessing\" it. Britain, she said, \"is lagging behind while other countries have recognised the risks and begun to act\". Her view was echoed by Dr Becky Foljambe, founder of Health Professionals for Safer Screens, who said ministers should \"stop talking and act, as every day they dither, more children are harmed\"."

        "Content": "Team GB will leave the 2026 Olympic Winter Games as history makers after securing two titles on the same day for the first time. Having never won two gold medals on a single day of any previous Winter Games, Britain finished top of the podium in mixed team snowboarding - their first-ever gold on snow - and again in mixed team skeleton. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale were the first pair to medal, delivering a stunning performance to take top spot at the Livigno Snow Park. As it happened: Team GB's record-breaking day The pair, world champions in 2023, beat Italy to the gold medal by 0.43seconds in the final. It was then the turn of Matt Weston and Tabby Stoecker on Sunday evening to win the next gold in mixed team skeleton. Having been the dominant winner of the men's title on Friday evening, Weston became the first British athlete to win two medals at the same Winter Olympics when he and Tabby Stoecker beat Germany by 0.17seconds. \n                  Winter Olympics as it happened: Team GB's record-breaking Winter Olympics continues with mixed team skeleton win\n                 \n                  Team USA skier Lindsey Vonn 'discharged from hospital' a week after horror Olympics crash\n                 \n                  Valentine's Day gift for Winter Olympians - more condoms\n                 Fellow Britons Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit were just edged into fourth place by the other German team of Jacqueline Pfeifer and Christopher Grotheer. Debut gold on snow After winning both their quarter-final and semi-final, all eyes were on Bankes and Nightingale in their bid to make history on the slopes. The impressive Bankes moved up to first place midway through the decisive women's race after Nightingale had finished a close second to France's Loan Bozzolo in the men's race. The gold medal marked a remarkable revival from the duo, who had both exited the heats in disappointing fashion in their respective individual events earlier in the Games. Their medal is Britain's best ever on snow, building on the bronzes previously won by Jenny Jones, Billy Morgan and Izzy Atkin. Bankes said: \"I'm happy with my riding all day. I found it again, which I've been struggling with for the last week here. \"At last I found some speed and made it count. I really used my carving, the drafting, made the right choices, and that's where it pays off.\" Late skeleton drama Hopes were high for another medal in the skeleton after Weston's individual gold on Friday. Stoecker had given her partner a tough task with her run of 1:00.77 - 0.30seconds off the pace of the Germans - but Weston put in a sublime 58.59seconds run to clinch the gold. The pair, ranked top seeds ahead of the event, won with a final time of 1:59.36, setting a new course record in the process. \"Luckily, I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston said. \"I took a load of confidence from the individual event and I almost had to be boring to get the job done and do it again.\" \"I can't believe it,\" Stoecker added. \"It's a team effort and when Matt came down and we were in the green, I was just in shock.\""

Yvette Cooper also confirmed that the poison - found in the skin of Ecuadorian dart frogs - can also be manufactured in the laboratory and hinted that this could have been the case with the substance alleged to have killed the dissident, who died in a Russian prison two years ago. She was speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sunday, a day after the UK and a group of allies announced that their scientists had discovered that Mr Navalny, 47, had been poisoned with the frog toxin - called epibatidine. Classed as a chemical weapon, it is 200 times stronger than morphine and causes paralysis, respiratory failure and death. Indigenous tribes in South America are said to use the toxin in blow darts or blowguns when they hunt. But it can also be produced synthetically. Asked whether she could offer any details on whether the poison was manmade or had been taken from frogs, Ms Cooper said: \"I can't tell you the details of that. But as you say, this is a particular chemical. It can be produced synthetically. \"It can also be found in this particular frog in Ecuador.

Russia has previously claimed the death was not suspicious. Read more from Sky News:Fresh snow warning for parts of EnglandMeasles outbreak leaves dozens of children infected Ms Cooper said that Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Germany had spent the past two years investigating what happened to Mr Navalny at the penal colony in Siberia. \"We have worked with our European partners on pursuing the evidence and pursuing the truth,\" she said. \"And that is why we have together found the evidence of this lethal toxin that was found in Alexei Navalny's body at the time he died, and only the Russian regime had the motive, the means and the opportunity to administer this lethal poison while he was in prison in Russia. \"They wanted to silence him because he was a critic of their regime, and that's why we have exposed this barbaric Kremlin plot to do so and made sure that we have done so with evidence.\""

Sunday's rain, sleet and snow will clear eastwards followed by sunny spells and blustery showers from the west.

The snow warning for eastern England said \"a spell of snow may lead to some disruption to travel\". It added: \"Rain moving eastwards through Sunday morning is likely to turn increasingly to sleet and snow. \"Slushy accumulations of 1cm or so are likely, with a chance of 2-4cm should snow turn briefly heavier, this more likely for the Lincolnshire Wolds and parts of Norfolk and Suffolk.\" Read more from Sky News:'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak in LondonLos Angeles 2028 Olympics chief to sell talent agency Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said Sunday will have a blustery start for many and outbreaks of showery rain, with some hill snow.

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring extended all the way to Africa's southern coast - held together by the invisible chains of psychological bondage that kept his victims ensnared for years at a time.  \"Invisible chains is a good way to put it, it was like I was handcuffed invisibly,\" says 43-year-old Juliette Bryant. \"I'd never even told my family, I never told anyone about what happened with him until he died.\" Juliette was recruited from Cape Town by Epstein in 2002, as a first-year university student and aspiring model. At only 20 years old, she thought her life was about to change for good. \"It just seemed like my dreams were all coming true because our family was struggling financially and I just really wanted to try and make a difference for my family.\" Juliette was on a flight to New York on her first overseas trip outside of South Africa, three weeks after meeting Epstein for the first time at a Cape Town restaurant with Bill Clinton, who was there on an official AIDS awareness trip accompanied by actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Hours barely passed after arriving in New York City when she was told she would be travelling on to the Caribbean. A driver dropped her off at a runway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and she boarded a private jet where Epstein and the women she says initially recruited her in Cape Town were waiting to fly to his private island. \"He patted the chair next to him... and then I went and sat there. It was such a confusing situation for a young person to be in. \"As the plane took off, he started forcibly touching me in between my legs, and I just freaked out and I suddenly realised - oh my God, my family aren't going to see me again, these people might kill me, you know? \"They [the women] were laughing. I was really petrified.\" It is unlikely she was the only young woman trafficked by Epstein from Cape Town. Emails from the Epstein files show flight details for unnamed female travellers being shuttled from Cape Town to London, Atlanta and New York up until late 2018. Juliette says she was not trafficked to other men but raped by Epstein repeatedly. \"I would see him at lunch, breakfast and dinner, and then I would be called to his room. Otherwise, I didn't see a lot of him, he was always off working. \"I spent a lot of time there on my own. I'd sit by the pool or read books, and I also found disposable cameras in the kitchen which I took to, so I took photos while I was there.\" Juliette's photos flit between beaming smiles in the embrace of other young women and haunting portraits of desolation and loneliness. \"There was no way of getting away, you know. They had my passport and by then we had landed on one of the Caribbean islands and then were taken on a helicopter to his island. There was just no way of getting away. I'm not strong enough to swim away. I wouldn't be able to swim off there.\" Read more:'I am too young and he is too old': Epstein survivors' diariesEpstein asked staff to install hidden video cameras at his homeHow Epstein made his money Her entrapment was more than physical. Even after she was sent back to Cape Town, she boarded more flights to Epstein's properties in New York, Palm Beach, Paris and New Mexico where she says she met women and underage girls from Brazil, Romania, France and Spain. Juliette tells us she is still piecing together the depth of Epstein's dark machinery while contending with her psychological recovery and constant exposure to news about her abuser. \"I look on Facebook, I see Epstein's face. I look on X, I see Epstein's face. I look at the news, there it is again. You know, there are times when it's made me feel physically ill, to be honest, it is just constantly there and there is no way of escaping it.\" The controversial US Department of Justice release of the latest Epstein files saw dozens of vulnerable victims exposed by insufficient redactions. Juliette's emails to Epstein were published unredacted and show her expressing support for him ahead of his trial in 2008 and continuing to contact him until 2017. \"Whenever I sent emails, it was always when I had been drinking or when I was having a bit of a breakdown... I always felt like he was watching me, and that was also why I emailed. \"I have nothing to hide. It has obviously been upsetting because it confuses people because obviously the man had a terrible grip on my mind.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The old, rules-based order that evolved from the ashes of the Second World War no longer exists - at least that is the verdict of Germany's chancellor, and the evidence is clear to see. The United States signalled at a major security conference in Munich over the weekend that it is ready to go it alone, without its European allies - unless they get serious about rearming. Russia is showing no real desire to end its war in Ukraine. And China is gaining a level of strength and influence that can only be rivalled by America. It all means so-called big power competition - potentially leading to larger-scale conflict - is back, and small and medium-sized countries like the UK and its European allies need each other more than ever. That was a key message coming from this year's Munich Security Conference. It was delivered via speeches by prime ministers, presidents and foreign secretaries on a large stage inside a hotel surrounded by police, barricades and security cordons. \n                  Epstein survivor says women who recruited her 'laughed' as she was sexually assaulted on jet\n                 \n                  Epstein survivor says her recruiters 'laughed' as she was sexually assaulted on private jet\n                 \n                  Only Russia could poison Navalny - Yvette Cooper\n                 Friedrich Merz, the German leader, set the tone with his address on Friday, the first day of the event which stretched until Sunday morning. \"In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat,\" he said. \"The international order based on rights and rules... no longer exists in the way it once did.\" President Vladimir Putin and President Xi Jinping of China have already been working to undermine this global system that was created by design to favour liberal democracies and restrict authoritarian regimes by enshrining fundamental values such as human rights and the rule of law. But the end of the Cold War meant that many European governments chose to shift funding away from their respective armed forces that had given them the hard military strength to be able to defend and fight for these values were they ever to be challenged again in the future. Instead, and especially across western Europe, they relied on the United States to defend them in crisis as part of the NATO alliance. Donald Trump, though, has since made clear this assumption of transatlantic protection can no longer be taken for granted. His administration has also gone further, attacking European leaders on domestic issues such as over immigration and free speech. In fact, vice president JD Vance, who led the US delegation in Munich a year ago, questioned whether European values were ones America should even be defending anymore. He did not return this time around. Washington's position instead was represented by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, who struck a more diplomatic, conciliatory tone. This was welcomed by delegates but his message was no less sharp - Europe needs to take greater responsibility for its own defences as the US steps away to focus on other priorities deemed to be more important to America's national interests. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said in his speech on the main stage. \"We believe that Europe must survive because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history's constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours.\" But he added: \"Under President Trump, the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration, driven by a vision of a future as proud as sovereign and as vital as our civilisation's past. And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference, and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe.\" Sir Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, did his best to say the UK and its European allies are stepping up to fix their hollowed-out defences. \"We must build our hard power because that is the currency of the age,\" he told delegates when it was his turn to speak. \"We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary we must be ready to fight. To do whatever it takes to protect our people, our values and our way of life. \"And as Europe, we must stand on our own two feet.\" Yet, military insiders were quick to point out that his rhetoric was a far cry from the reality of his own country's defence budget. The UK is only planning to inch up defence spending to 2.5% of GDP from 2.3% by next year, with no funded plan to lift it to the new NATO target of 3.5% by 2035 and no sign of any intention to accelerate the timeline even though other states are going much faster. Elbridge Colby, the US under secretary of state for war policy, offered the clearest possible advice in an address he gave to NATO defence ministers in Brussels on the eve of the Munich summit about how they need to demonstrate action, not just words and numbers. \"It means moving beyond inputs and intentions toward outputs and capabilities,\" he said. \"Defence spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce: ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics and integrated command structures that work at scale under stress. \"It means prioritising war-fighting effectiveness over bureaucratic and regulatory stasis. It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics.\""

Three individuals, who are thought to be men, were seen wearing blue overalls and walking from a Volksbank branch in Stuhr, northwestern Germany, at around 1.20pm on Friday (13 February), authorities said. They added that the trio were walking towards a dark car, but witnesses have so far said they aren't sure whether they got in and drove away or walked past. The break-in comes just months after a huge heist in the city of Gelsenkirchen, a two-and-a-half-hour train journey from Stuhr. A gang of thieves took advantage of the Christmas holidays and drilled into a vault to steal millions of pounds worth of valuables. Witnesses saw several men carrying large bags into the stairwell of a garage next to the bank overnight on Saturday 27 December. CCTV footage then captured a black Audi leaving early in the morning on Monday 29 December. The men broke into thousands of deposit boxes, with initial estimates placing the value of the raid between €10m to €90m (£8.6m to £78m), according to a police spokesperson."

The offensive by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) included widespread atrocities that amounted to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the UN Human Rights Office said in a report. Rights violations in the final push for the city in Sudan underscored how \"persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence\", according to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk. The RSF and their allied Arab militias, known as Janjaweed, overran Al Fashir, the Sudanese army's only remaining stronghold in Darfur, on 26 October 2025 and rampaged through the city and its surroundings. It had previously been under siege for more than 18 months. The UN Human Rights Office said it documented the killing of at least 4,400 people inside the city between 25 October and 27 October, while more than 1,600 were killed as they were trying to flee the RSF rampage. The 29-page UN report detailed atrocities that it said ranged from mass killings, summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment to detention and disappearances. \n                  1,000 days of war in Sudan: 30 million people in need as bombing of key cities continues\n                 \n                  Sudan: UK sanctions four paramilitary commanders over 'mass killings'\n                 \n                  Sudan's RSF says it has captured Babanusa in West Kordofan \n                 In many cases, the attacks were ethnicity-motivated, it said.

The RSF did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The alleged atrocities in Al Fashir, the provincial capital of North Darfur, mirror a pattern of RSF conduct in other areas in its war against the Sudanese army, the report said.

        "Content": "The Indian and Pakistani cricket captains refused to shake hands at the coin toss before the T20 World Cup showdown on Sunday. Pakistan's captain Salman Agha had previously said he would leave it up to India's players to decide if they were to shake hands with his team before and after their T20 World Cup match. However, India's Suryakumar Yadav and Agha walked away from each other without making physical contact. The move comes amid political and military tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours who were on the brink of all-out war in May 2025. Sunday's match in Colombo, Sri Lanka, will be the first time the teams have met since an acrimonious clash last September at the Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates, won by India. On that occasion, players also refused to shake hands.

        "Content": "More than 1,000 ICE agents have left Minnesota after the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement operation that led to mass detentions, protests and the deaths of two US citizens. US homeland security secretary Tom Homan said on Sunday that an undefined \"small\" force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and keep investigating fraud allegations. They will respond \"when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control\", Mr Homan told CBS. \"We already removed well over 1,000 people and, as of Monday, Tuesday, we'll remove several hundred more,\" and \"get back to the original footprint [numbers],\" Mr Homan said. Thousands of officers were sent to Minneapolis and St Paul, known as the Twin Cities area of the state, for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE's) Operation Metro Surge.

Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, was wrestled to the floor by federal agents and shot multiple times in Minneapolis. Local officials, including the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, and state governor, Tim Walz, have been fiercely critical of heavy-handed tactics that have seen ICE officers grab some people off the street and have made it clear they want them out. Last week, Mr Homan said that more than 700 ICE agents would leave the state immediately, leaving more than 2,000 in the state. He said on Thursday that a \"significant drawdown\" was under way and would continue through this week. Immigration enforcement will continue in the Twin Cities and there will be no end to mass deportations across the country, he added.

Asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Mr Homan said \"it depends on the situation\". Operation Metro Surge was seen by some critics as an effort by Mr Trump to fulfil election promises to deport illegal immigrants and people without proper documentation. ICE officers have also been deployed in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, where their presence has also attracted anger from officials and significant protests."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring extended all the way to Africa's southern coast - held together by the invisible chains of psychological bondage that kept his victims ensnared for years at a time.  \"Invisible chains is a good way to put it, it was like I was handcuffed invisibly,\" says 43-year-old Juliette Bryant. \"I'd never even told my family, I never told anyone about what happened with him until he died.\" Juliette was recruited from Cape Town by Epstein in 2002, as a first-year university student and aspiring model. At only 20 years old, she thought her life was about to change for good. \"It just seemed like my dreams were all coming true because our family was struggling financially and I just really wanted to try and make a difference for my family.\" Juliette was on a flight to New York on her first overseas trip outside of South Africa, three weeks after meeting Epstein for the first time at a Cape Town restaurant with Bill Clinton, who was there on an official AIDS awareness trip accompanied by actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Hours barely passed after arriving in New York City when she was told she would be travelling on to the Caribbean. A driver dropped her off at a runway at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and she boarded a private jet where Epstein and the women she says initially recruited her in Cape Town were waiting to fly to his private island. \"He patted the chair next to him... and then I went and sat there. It was such a confusing situation for a young person to be in. \"As the plane took off, he started forcibly touching me in between my legs, and I just freaked out and I suddenly realised - oh my God, my family aren't going to see me again, these people might kill me, you know? \"They [the women] were laughing. I was really petrified.\" It is unlikely she was the only young woman trafficked by Epstein from Cape Town. Emails from the Epstein files show flight details for unnamed female travellers being shuttled from Cape Town to London, Atlanta and New York up until late 2018. Juliette says she was not trafficked to other men but raped by Epstein repeatedly. \"I would see him at lunch, breakfast and dinner, and then I would be called to his room. Otherwise, I didn't see a lot of him, he was always off working. \"I spent a lot of time there on my own. I'd sit by the pool or read books, and I also found disposable cameras in the kitchen which I took to, so I took photos while I was there.\" Juliette's photos flit between beaming smiles in the embrace of other young women and haunting portraits of desolation and loneliness. \"There was no way of getting away, you know. They had my passport and by then we had landed on one of the Caribbean islands and then were taken on a helicopter to his island. There was just no way of getting away. I'm not strong enough to swim away. I wouldn't be able to swim off there.\" Read more:'I am too young and he is too old': Epstein survivors' diariesEpstein asked staff to install hidden video cameras at his homeHow Epstein made his money Her entrapment was more than physical. Even after she was sent back to Cape Town, she boarded more flights to Epstein's properties in New York, Palm Beach, Paris and New Mexico where she says she met women and underage girls from Brazil, Romania, France and Spain. Juliette tells us she is still piecing together the depth of Epstein's dark machinery while contending with her psychological recovery and constant exposure to news about her abuser. \"I look on Facebook, I see Epstein's face. I look on X, I see Epstein's face. I look at the news, there it is again. You know, there are times when it's made me feel physically ill, to be honest, it is just constantly there and there is no way of escaping it.\" The controversial US Department of Justice release of the latest Epstein files saw dozens of vulnerable victims exposed by insufficient redactions. Juliette's emails to Epstein were published unredacted and show her expressing support for him ahead of his trial in 2008 and continuing to contact him until 2017. \"Whenever I sent emails, it was always when I had been drinking or when I was having a bit of a breakdown... I always felt like he was watching me, and that was also why I emailed. \"I have nothing to hide. It has obviously been upsetting because it confuses people because obviously the man had a terrible grip on my mind.\""

The ex-president did not mention Mr Trump by name, but said the \"decorum\" and \"respect for... office\" that used to guide US officials had been lost. After the video showing the Obamas as apes was shared on President Trump's Truth Social account, the leader refused to apologise and said he \"didn't make a mistake\". The depiction appeared towards the end of the footage, asserting debunked claims that the 2020 election - which he lost to Joe Biden - was stolen from him. When asked about the post by Brian Tyler Cohen on his podcast, Mr Obama said that while controversial language \"gets attention\", it was also a \"distraction\" and the majority of \"people find this behaviour deeply troubling\". The former president said that although most \"still believe in decency, courtesy and kindness, there's this sort of clown show\" on social media and television.

He branded \"rogue\" activity by agents as \"deeply concerning\" and \"dangerous\". \"The way that federal agents, ICE agents, were being deployed without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try and bait their parents, all the stuff we saw… the rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning,\" he said. The former president claimed that this type of behaviour has previously been \"seen in dictatorships, but not… in America\". However, he urged people to \"take a moment to appreciate the extraordinary outpouring of organising, community building, [and] decency\" in Minnesota, including Minneapolis. Tom Homan, who's leading the White House's anti-immigration campaign, said on Thursday that the Trump administration had agreed to end the ICE operation in the state.

Sky News understands that Mr Jansen, who now chairs Heathrow Airport and the London-listed marketing services group WPP, is to take the helm of Xplor Technologies, a private equity-backed company based in Atlanta, Georgia. Sources said that his appointment could be announced as soon as this week. The recruitment of Mr Jansen comes months after Xplor agreed to merge with Clubessential Holdings, a Cincinnati-based software company offering embedded payments solutions to tens of thousands of clients. The combined entity processes roughly $45bn in payment volumes annually, serving customers such as golf clubs, recreation venues, parks and childcare and education centres. Its client numbers and revenues are expected to continue growing at a rapid rate amid rising demand for more sophisticated payments-related software. Xplor, which accounted for roughly 80% of the enlarged company's aggregate payment volumes, was majority-owned by Advent International, a private equity firm with which Mr Jansen has enjoyed a long association. \n                  'Despondent, even mutinous' mood at UK's foreign office as government plans cuts\n                 \n                  BrewDog owners call time on craft beer pioneer\n                 \n                  The seven 'money languages' - and how they're impacting your relationship | Money blog\n                 He ran Worldpay, which was backed by Advent and Bain Capital before being taken public on the London Stock Exchange in 2015 in a £4.5bn flotation.

Subsequently, he spent more than five years as BT chief executive, stepping down from the role in 2024. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. His arrival at Xplor will come at a time when publicly traded software companies have endured a bruising few weeks, with stocks hammered by investors' fears that their business models face being decimated by developments in artificial intelligence (AI). Many industry experts believe, however, that such fears are overblown and anticipate a continued rush of mergers and takeovers in the sector. The enlarged Xplor remains controlled by Advent, with Clubessential's former shareholders - Silver Lake Partners and Battery Ventures - remaining invested as minority owners.

And determined to sacrifice the relationship we need on the altar of their ideology. \"The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again. But we will not let that happen.\" 'PM should focus on the issues' \n                  Police will not investigate activists going door-to-door asking people to stop buying Israeli products\n                 \n                  Green Party calls for free bus travel in England for under-22s\n                 \n                  Can Zack Polanski's anti-establishment message beat Nigel Farage on migration?\n                 In response, Mr Polanski told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips show: \"I think people are pretty bored of Keir Starmer making cheap political smears at other parties. \"People's wages are stuck in 2008. We know rents are going up, bills are going up. There's real problems both in this country and internationally, and the Green Party are offering solutions to that. \"And what I think Keir Starmer should be doing is actually focusing on the issues people face every single day, rather than making cheap attacks in terms of the lights going out.\" Specifically on the national security point, the Green Party leader said he takes it \"really seriously\", and accused the government of risking national security by bringing Peter Mandelson back as US ambassador, as well as not putting enough money into cybersecurity, pandemic resilience, and addressing the climate crisis. Mr Polanski also said that if he were prime minister, he would commit to all the NATO articles, including article five, which says: \"An armed attack against one or more of [the allies] in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\" 'We need a leader who will put British interests first' The prime minister also took questions at the Munich Security Conference, and in response to one about his own political position, he attacked Reform UK, describing the party as \"pro-Putin\", and said if they were in government, \"the coalition of the willing could not exist with UK participation in it\". Mr Yusuf hit back at Sir Keir, saying: \"It'd be quite the opposite\". He told Sky's Trevor Phillips: \"This is a laughable joke of a prime minister who, now, because he is so unpopular, frankly, it's actually a very dangerous thing to do, Trevor, because this is a dangerous time in the world. And we need a leader who is actually going to put the interests of British people first.\" Pushed on if his party is pro-Putin, Mr Yusuf said: \"That's obviously not true. Nigel [Farage] is the only political leader in this country who has confirmed on air that he would indeed shoot down Russian aircraft if they encroach into NATO airspace. Not a single other political leader said that, nor has Keir Starmer.\" Starmer insists he is in a strong political position Sir Keir Starmer also insisted that he has weathered the political storm at home, and his government is pressing on. \"I ended the week much stronger than I started it, and that's a very good place to be,\" he told the Munich Security Conference. However, his foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, did concede that errors have been made, but said the government is rectifying them. Asked about the appointment of Matthew Doyle to the House of Lords, despite the prime minister knowing that he had campaigned for a convicted sex offender, and if the government is certain there are no other issues set to emerge, she told Sky's Trevor Phillips: \"I think there's clearly been some significant process failures in this appointment. There is still a review under way on that.\" She insisted the government takes this \"extremely seriously\", and pointed to Labour's commitment to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. \"We have to always be focusing on the voices of victims and survivors, and that should be at the heart of what we do,\" she added. Trevor noted that was not a commitment that more government failures, like in the cases of Doyle and Peter Mandelson, are yet to emerge. Cooper replied: \"Well, what I can say is that we have strengthened the processes.\" She added: \"There can always be real concerns about people, unknown cases, where people have committed crimes in different areas. There always has to be a robust response, but you also have to make sure that you've got proper processes in advance as well.\" Lord Doyle has previously said his contact with Sean Morton was \"extremely limited\" after his conviction, and apologised for the mistakes he has made. Lord Mandelson has denied any wrongdoing, and has previously apologised for maintaining his relationship with Epstein, which he admitted went on for too long."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @AliFortescue\n \"Bloody shambles\", a senior minister sighs. \"Real question marks over his judgement.\" \"Still a shitshow\", another texts simply, adding: \"Terminal inability to make decisions\". Those blunt verdicts frame Sir Keir Starmer's march into recess: a leader who has steadied himself enough to stave off immediate crisis, but whose authority and judgement are still being openly questioned as the party looks ahead to a decisive spring. Sir Keir has been on something of a charm offensive, hosting Scottish and Welsh colleagues at Chequers in a bid to reknit frayed loyalties. \"My God, he's actually got a sense of humour - why don't we ever see that side?\" one backbencher remarked afterwards. MPs I speak to are, broadly, in a better mood than they were 10 days ago. Even so, ministers concede the road ahead remains uncertain. \"I don't know,\" one says eventually when I ask whether the prime minister will survive beyond May. The \"only way\" of replacing him \"without too much pain\", another minister suggests, would be if Starmer chose to stand down himself. \"At some point there's only so much one man can take.\" The minister would not say whether that would be their preferred outcome. \n                  Greens and Reform hit back at Sir Keir Starmer after attacks in Munich speech\n                 \n                  Tackling misogyny should be sixth mission of Sir Keir Starmer's government, Harriet Harman says\n                 \n                  Starmer insists he'll lead Labour into next election as he attempts to move on from leadership crisis\n                 One backbencher, not a usual critic, puts Starmer's chances of surviving past May at 50 per cent. For now, the short-term outcome is continuity rather than catastrophe. One MP describes Monday's events as a \"remarkable\" turnaround: \"Shockingly, it seems like we've turned a corner.\" But, as one minister warns, \"the troublemakers will be happy for a few weeks and then find something else to complain about.\" And there are several flashpoints looming. The Gorton and Denton by-election is just two weeks away. Privately, Labour sources say the outlook on the ground is better than expected. Read more:Mandelson asked to testify in Epstein investigationForeign secretary denies the PM is 'rattled' Others argue the loudest voices are being heard, while the number of quietly loyal Labour MPs is being underestimated. \"I only got my seat because people around the leadership backed me,\" one MP tells me. \"So I'll stay loyal to Keir until the end.\" A pause. \"But that end may be fairly near.\" Those close to the prime minister say he can be at his best when his back is against the wall. His main line of defence to colleagues has been that he remains the best person for the job, and that there is no obvious alternative. It is that question of what comes next that may have saved him this week. The contest over potential successors is, for now, fragmented. Angela Rayner looms large. \"Ange won't go for it unless someone else moves first,\" says an ally. Even some who do not support her believe she could cut through on the doorstep. As one Red Wall MP puts it: \"It would give me something to say. There's a personality. There's a product.\" Any prospect of a Wes Streeting leadership bid appears, for now, to be on ice. His critics continue to brief openly against him; one described to me his pre-interview \"breath work\" as evidence he is not ready to lead the party. Defence Secretary John Healey has been floated by some as a steady, unity candidate. But a senior figure who has worked closely with him says: \"He's not ambitious like that.\" Another suggests he could act as a stalking horse, clearing the path for someone else. One scenario put to me is that Starmer serves a full first term but stands aside before the next general election, allowing another figure to lead the party into the contest, echoing the decision of former French president Francois Hollande not to seek re-election, with another candidate campaigning as would-be president. Of course, that election saw the Socialist Party vote collapse and Emmanuel Macron's new movement sweep to power. Sir Keir is being pulled in multiple directions. One minister argues he needs a more strategic view, particularly on Europe. Another frontbencher warns that a reset reshuffle designed to appease the soft left would \"pretty much finish him\". With so many MPs holding slim majorities, there is a degree of self-preservation. We are often \"fighting geography rather than ideology,\" one backbencher tells me. \"I understand people wanting to protect their own back yards.\" A Downing Street spokesperson stressed that Sir Keir, one of only four Labour leaders to have won an election outright, has a five-year mandate to \"deliver change, and that is what he will do\".  For now, \"Keir's hobbling on,\" as a senior Labour figure puts it. \"Everyone's going to let him muddle through until May.\" \"He's got nine lives,\" they add. He may need all of them come May."

But cases have surged as vaccine rates have fallen, prompting a warning to parents to make sure children are protected.",
        "Content": "A \"fast-spreading\" measles outbreak in north London has left 34 children infected - and one fifth of them needing hospital treatment.  The cases have been confirmed in Enfield by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) between 1 January and 9 February. According to a message posted by Enfield's Ordnance Unity Centre for Health GP surgery, infections have been confirmed across at least seven schools - \"and it is spreading\". None of the infected children had been fully immunised, the surgery said, prompting renewed calls for parents to make sure their children are vaccinated. So what are the symptoms of measles, what should you do if you think your child has it - and why are some people hesitant to get the vaccine? What are the symptoms of measles? The first symptoms of measles include: • A high temperature• A runny or blocked nose• Sneezing• A cough• Red, sore or watery eyes Cold-like symptoms are followed a few days later by a rash, which starts on the face and behind the ears, before it spreads. The spots are usually raised and can join together to form blotchy patches which are not usually itchy. Some people may get small spots in their mouth too. What should you do if you think your child has measles? Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you think your child has measles. If your child has been vaccinated, it is very unlikely they have measles. You should not to go to the doctor without calling ahead, as measles is very infectious. If your child is diagnosed with measles by a doctor, make sure they avoid close contact with babies and anyone who is pregnant or has a weakened immune system. When should you keep your child off school? If your child has measles they should stay off school or nursery for at least four days after the rash first appears. Your child's school or local health protection team will let you know if your child has been in contact with someone who has measles, and tell you what you need to do. Those who are more susceptible to infection, for example unvaccinated siblings of a child with measles, may be told to stay off school for up to 21 days. What are the potential complications of measles? Measles can lead to serious problems if it spreads to the lungs or brain and in rare cases can result in death. Around one in 5,000 individuals with measles is likely to die. Last year, a child in Liverpool died after becoming ill with measles and other health problems. About 1 in 5 people with measles will need hospital treatment and 1 in 15 will develop severe complications. Measles can cause deafness, fits, pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and brain damage. People at higher risk of complications include babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immunity. What is the MMR jab? The measles vaccination is combined with protecting against mumps and rubella in the MMR jab. It is considered to be safe and highly effective. The MMR vaccine was introduced to the UK in 1988 and a measles vaccine has been available since 1968. There used to be between 160,000 and 800,000 cases a year in England and Wales, and around 100 people died from acute measles annually. But since the vaccine was introduced in 1968, it is estimated that 20 million cases and 4,500 deaths have been prevented. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are given, providing lifelong protection. The first dose is usually offered to babies aged one, with the second dose given at three years and four months. If either dose has been missed, you can still ask your GP for the vaccine. Falling vaccine rates, rising cases Falling immunisation rates have stoked fears of a widespread outbreak of the virus, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) warning that Britain had lost its measles elimination status last month. From 2021 to 2023, the country was considered to have \"eliminated\" the disease, but global health officials say measles transmission was re-established in the UK in 2024. Vaccination coverage has flatlined in recent years, with recorded measles infections in the UK soaring to 3,681 in 2024. The latest figures for England show that in 2024-25, just 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine doses, down year-on-year from 83.9%. This was the lowest level since 2009-10 and well short of the 95% recommended by the WHO to achieve herd immunity. When and why did people stop vaccinating? In 1998, a study by British doctor Andrew Wakefield was published in The Lancet linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The study was discredited, but not before causing mass hysteria over the safety of the vaccine after the study received global media coverage. MMR immunisations in the UK fell to about 80% nationally in the late 1990s and early 2000s and took many years to recover. In 2006, measles transmission became re-established in the UK, and in 2007, cases of measles exceeded 1,000 for the first time in 10 years. The Lancet retracted Wakefield's study in 2010, and he was struck off the UK medical register. Why are vaccination numbers still low? Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute, told Sky News a combination of things may be stopping parents from getting their children vaccinated. \"It is mainly due to lack of access,\" Professor Bedford said. \"People may not know when vaccines are due, how to make an appointment, then there's actually getting to the appointment. \"For some parents who are suffering the impact of poverty, paying a bus fare to get your child to a GP surgery may be a step too far, even though they understand vaccination is very important.\" Professor Bedford added since the COVID pandemic, more parents are asking questions about vaccinations, which can lead to them searching the internet for answers. \"We want parents to ask questions but unfortunately due to lack of personnel and health visitors, they can't always get answers or even an opportunity to have a discussion,\" she said. \"That's when they turn to other sources of information, like social media or the internet, where we know there is a lot of disinformation.\" Fears about the link to autism have persisted despite being proven false, and vaccine hesitancy has been fuelled by misinformation on social media."

        "Content": "\n          Entertainment reporter\n              @Debbie_Ridgard\n Nearly four years on from the emotional finale of Derry Girls, writer and creator Lisa McGee has released her new project on Netflix. How To Get To Heaven From Belfast blends her trademark humour with mystery as a group of women reunite following the death of their childhood friend. \"I've always loved murder mysteries from when I was a little girl,\" McGee told Sky News. \"I was obsessed with Jessica Fletcher and Murder, She Wrote, so it was really like whenever someone gave me the chance to do it, I was going to grab it. \"But I knew I needed to do it my way. I wanted it to be very female-led, have a big comedy element to it, a bit messy.\" The Irish writer's journey into storytelling began long before the worldwide success of Derry Girls - a comedy set in Northern Ireland in the 1990s about what it's like to be a teenage girl living amongst conflict. McGee detailed how, growing up, she'd create plays for the neighbourhood where she lived to act out. \n                  'Posh boys' playing gangsters: Eddie Marsan on TV and film industry's obsession with upper-class actors\n                 \n                  Paul Danan: Former Hollyoaks actor died by misadventure after taking cocktail of drugs, coroner rules\n                 \n                  Gladiators: Police investigate after Apollo 'harassed by stalker' \n                 She said: \"[I was] doing plays in my street and forcing everyone to be in them, even if they didn't want to, you know, because everyone's mum was just like, go and be in Lisa's play and give me peace for an hour. \"So, I was kind of the unofficial babysitter for the whole street. All the mums loved me, but the kids probably didn't because I was making them learn lines and stuff like that.\" McGee said, even at a young age, the stories she'd create had a darker element, possibly influenced by her upbringing in Derry before the Good Friday Agreement. \"I remember saying to the executive producer of Derry Girls, Liz Lewin, who works on How to Get to Heaven as well, when I was in London: do you know the way, the army would check your car? And she was like, 'No, no! What are you talking about?'\" \"So, like these little things, I started to realise, oh, there could be something interesting in telling these stories.\" She added: \"Outside of Ireland, people couldn't believe it, but that was what was going on. But it was so every day to us. It just became so part of your routine, and it was only like years later when I moved to London that I actually... realised that's probably not normal.\" She said it was that familiarity that sparked her interest in telling \"truthful\" depictions of what it was and is like living in Derry and Belfast. \"I wanted to see myself and my friends on screen, which sounds incredibly simple, but I feel like it doesn't happen that often and I sometimes feel particularly Irish stories and stories about Irish women, they can be quite tragic and serious, you know?,\" she said. \"I really want to keep making stories about where I come from and I feel just so lucky that I can do this now and I'll keep trying to do it until they tell me to stop. \"I think Ireland's such a complicated, but incredible place, you know? So much history that hasn't fully been explored, the people are very funny, so I'm really excited about that, about the new stories we're going to tell now.\" How To Get To Heaven From Belfast centres on three thirty-something women who reunite following the death of their childhood friend. Starring Roisin Gallagher, Sinead Keenan and Caoilfhionn Dunne, it sees several familiar faces from Derry Girls take on new characters in the murder mystery comedy. McGee has said a second season isn't a certainty, but she has her fingers crossed. \"I haven't asked, I have been talking about it and I don't know if I'm allowed to but I'd love to do it again because I love writing for those three women, I love those actors, they're just so talented and so funny. \"I would do it again in a heartbeat, it just depends on who watches it I guess and how many people watch it.\" How To Get To Heaven From Belfast is out on Netflix now."
