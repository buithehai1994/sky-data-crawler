        "Content": "Donald Trump has been presented with a Nobel Peace Prize medal by Maria Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, who won the award last year. Speaking to reporters outside the US Capitol after her meeting with the president, Ms Machado said she gave the medal to Trump. She told Sky's US correspondent James Matthews that it was in \"recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom\". Mr Trump, who has long coveted a Nobel Peace Prize, accepted the medal, according to a White House official, who briefed NBC News, Sky's US partner, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\". In a post on Truth Social, his own social network, the president wrote: \"She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. \"María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!\" The decision to award the prize to Ms Machado went down badly with the US president after it was revealed last year. White House director of communications Steven Cheung commented then that \"the Nobel committee proved they place politics over peace\". After accepting the prize, Ms Machado was quick to praise the US president, dedicating it to the people of Venezuela and Mr Trump for his \"decisive support\". She subsequently told Fox News she wanted to \"give it to him and share it with him\", which Mr Trump said would be \"a great honour\". But the committee that awards the prize has been unambiguous in shooting down her suggestion. \"A Nobel Prize can neither be revoked, shared, nor transferred to others,\" the committee said in a statement. \"Once the announcement has been made, the decision stands for all time.\" Ahead of the meeting at the White House, there was speculation that Ms Machado might hand over the prize. The Nobel committee appeared to address the speculation again on Thursday morning, offering two previous examples of the medal changing hands. \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,\" the committee added in the post on X. Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, Matthews said Ms Machado was \"trying to push all the buttons\" of the president. \"She said she gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, quite what he's done with that, we didn't get the answer to that,\" he said. \"She's certainly trying to push all the buttons with the American president, trying to make sure that he's got the Venezuelan politics in mind beyond access to Venezuelan oil reserves.\" For his part, the US president has been lukewarm on Ms Machado since losing out on the prize. After US forces captured Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a raid on Caracas earlier this month, Mr Trump backed the country's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to succeed him. Read more:Trump started with Venezuela - but may not stop therePolitical prisoners are being freed from a brutal jail in Caracas Ms Machado, he said, was \"not respected\" enough to lead the country. Prior to the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the president's assessment, saying it was \"based on realities on the ground\". \"At this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed,\" she said. She also said Venezuela's new leadership had been \"extremely cooperative\" and \"we'll expect that cooperation to continue\". Whether Ms Machado's medal will move the needle in her favour remains unclear, but Mr Trump did not address her gesture in a press conference after their meeting. Earlier in the day, the US seized another sanctioned tanker, the Veronica, this time in the Caribbean, in an operation confirmed by the US military's Southern Command."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Bobi Wine's house is heavily surveilled.  Motorbikes whiz back and forth in the street in front of his gate with a trained curiosity before a large riot truck full of masked police officers fills the narrow road. The relentless monitoring gives way to calm as we enter his high-walled home. I walked down the same garden path with him in 2018 when Wine was starting to shift the fanbase he built as a musician into explosive political popularity as a member of parliament, voicing opposition to President Museveni and the ruling party. Even then, the government was quick to crack down on his young, growing support base in the protests he led against a social media tax imposed by the government. What has changed since then? \"What has changed is that it has gone from bad to worse. There is more impunity. There is more violence every day as people are being abducted and they go missing. Some have been missing for years,\" he responds. The crackdown intensified in the lead up to Uganda's 2021 election when at least 54 people were killed and hundreds were disappeared by the security forces. Now, Wine's National Unity Party says that 300 of their supporters and party officials have been detained in the weeks building up to this election as he runs against Uganda's long-time ruler President Yoweri Museveni for the second time. As we speak in Wine's garden, the military is fully deployed to the streets of Kampala, there is a total internet blackout and the permits of at least nine local human rights organisations have been suspended - all while Ugandans vote for who they want to see govern the country for the next five years. \"Even my deputy president in charge of western Uganda has been picked up, and I'm told she's being detained in a military barracks - so it is crazy what is happening,\" Wine says. \"This is supposed to be an election, but besides switching off the internet, our agents are being picked by security to ensure that the election happens in the dark.\" President Museveni denies long-time allegations of election rigging and told me that it is the opposition that rigs the election. \"They try but they can't overturn us. We are too popular,\" he says. Read more:Uganda's president on shutting down the internetPop star politician aiming to end president's 40 years in power At President Museveni's last rally in Kampala, thousands of people wearing his face on bright yellow T-shirts filled the Kololo airstrip, where he was inaugurated after his first presidential election win in 1996. Foreign media are barred from filming inside the rally, but through the bars, a young man holding up a foam finger turns it into a thumbs down and yells \"Bobi!\" to us. In the narrow road by the airstrip, a man faithfully wipes the face of President Museveni clean on a large billboard before moving on to polish the face of his son, General Muhoozi, the current chief of the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF). If the opposition can't beat President Museveni's loyal following, then why target Wine so aggressively? \"Bobi Wine breaks the law, that is why. There are other people in opposition - you don't find us having problems with them. But if you take each case, you find that he is breaking the law,\" the president says. \"He says I break the law, but I'm not arrested. Why am I not arrested and charged?\" Wine replies. \"If I break the law, the only law that I break is to stand and challenge a 40-year-old dictatorship.\""

Demonstrations have persisted against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the US city, a week after an agent fatally shot a woman. Protesters were angered by another incident on Wednesday in Minneapolis, when a federal officer shot a man in the leg after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle. Sky's Martha Kelner said clashes happened outside Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a local branch of the US Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is part of. Kelner began by describing the scene: \"The police officers... trying to establish a bigger perimeter outside the federal building... you can hear some flash bangs going off... there's tear gas too, and people panicking trying to get away from the tear gas. \"They're firing tear gas... a massive load of tear gas coming out... [coughs].\" At that point, we see a cloud of tear gas pass the camera and Kelner, her nose and mouth covered by a mask, is unable to speak and continues to cough.

Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made a direct appeal to Donald Trump in a post on X. \"Let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,\" he wrote.

Alexander Cashford, 49, died in Leysdown-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey after being chased by three teenagers, a trial has heard. The 16-year-old boy denies murder but on Thursday pleaded guilty to a secondary charge of manslaughter. Another boy, 15, and a 16-year-old girl, who are related, also deny murder. They pleaded not guilty to manslaughter The jury previously heard Mr Cashford had gone to visit the girl on 10 August last year after meeting her by chance in a amusement arcade two days before. He claimed to be 30 years old and exchanged around 75 messages with the trio under the belief he was texting \"Sienna\" - a fake name. Woolwich Crown Court was told he had asked if she liked champagne and said he wanted to kiss her before they met. Jurors heard the messages he received from \"Sienna\" suggested they meet at the empty home of her parents and told Mr Cashford to bring alcohol. The two boys allegedly followed the pair for some distance along the promenade before launching the attack in the Kent town. Video of Mr Cashford being chased and falling over was also played to the jury when prosecutors opened their case on Wednesday. Allegedly found on the 16-year-old boy's phone and filmed by the girl, a voice is heard shouting \"f****** paedophile, I'm f****** 16\" and \"Get him\".

        "Content": "A former chief executive of the Countess of Chester NHS Trust, where Lucy Letby worked, has been awarded £1.4m in damages. Dr Susan Gilby took her case for unfair dismissal to an employment tribunal after she was suspended in December 2022. In February 2025, the tribunal ruled that Dr Gilby had been forced out of her job after lodging a formal whistleblowing complaint about the trust's then chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite. The British Medical Association (BMA) criticised what it called the \"appalling behaviour\" of the trust and described the payout as one of the largest ever made to a former NHS employee. Dr Gilby took over at the Countess of Chester NHS Trust, weeks after child killer Letby was arrested in 2018, and led the organisation through the pandemic. Speaking about her treatment by the trust and the outcome of her case, Dr Gilby said: \"I am deeply saddened that, having raised a protected disclosure in good faith, I was treated in such an appalling manner that I had no choice other than to seek justice. \"I am yet to receive any meaningful apology from the trust for the harm caused to me or for the needless ending of my career. \n                  Prosecutors consider more charges against Lucy Letby\n                 \n                  Three members of Lucy Letby hospital's senior leadership team arrested\n                 \n                  New miscarriage of justice watchdog chair calls leadership 'unimpressive'\n                 \"No amount of money can compensate me for the devastation of losing my career in this appalling manner.\" Her tribunal heard that in July 2022, the former CEO submitted a grievance against Mr Haythornthwaite over bullying, harassment and \"undermining behaviour\". Ian Radford, lead solicitor on the team acting for Dr Gilby, said the trust had agreed to pay £1.4m to Dr Gilby but that a further hearing in February had been scheduled to consider legal costs. He told Sky News: \"There are, sadly, numerous other NHS whistleblowers, many of whom have little hope of securing the justice that Dr Gilby has finally secured for the appalling way she was treated. \"Even now, the trust has consciously refused to make any apology for how it has acted.\" Read more from Sky News:Managers linked to Letby hospital arrestedLucy Letby will never be releasedTerminally ill man was told he was okay Dr Tom Dolphin, BMA council chair, said in a statement that there needed to be a change in the \"corrosive\" culture in the NHS. \"This should serve as a warning to others that the shameful treatment of whistleblowers can lead to consequences in the law courts. \"The horrific scale of this cover-up shows the length that some trusts are willing to go to in an attempt to silence doctors.\" The Countess of Chester NHS Trust has been contacted for comment."

Robert Jenrick has defected to Reform after Kemi Badenoch found some evidence and unceremoniously sacked him. This should and could have been a mega moment for Nigel Farage. Jenrick was a key Conservative face. He was in the shadow cabinet. He was really popular with party members. He had been a leadership rival to Badenoch - and he was still snapping at her heels But Badenoch shocked all of us on Thursday morning - including Farage - when she dropped this bombshell video sacking Jenrick, because she said she had evidence he was going to defect and badmouth his colleagues In doing that, in seizing the moment and surprising her enemies, she managed to turn what would have been a clear crisis into almost an opportunity as she took the momentum, showed the political authority and pushed Jenrick out before he jumped \n                  Local elections 2026: Over a third of councils offered a delay have requested one - is yours on the list?\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  Michael Gove reveals regret over Boris Johnson leadership bid\n                 What's the fallout?

Alexander Cashford, 49, died in Leysdown-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey after being chased by three teenagers, a trial has heard. The 16-year-old boy denies murder but on Thursday pleaded guilty to a secondary charge of manslaughter. Another boy, 15, and a 16-year-old girl, who are related, also deny murder. They pleaded not guilty to manslaughter The jury previously heard Mr Cashford had gone to visit the girl on 10 August last year after meeting her by chance in a amusement arcade two days before. He claimed to be 30 years old and exchanged around 75 messages with the trio under the belief he was texting \"Sienna\" - a fake name. Woolwich Crown Court was told he had asked if she liked champagne and said he wanted to kiss her before they met. Jurors heard the messages he received from \"Sienna\" suggested they meet at the empty home of her parents and told Mr Cashford to bring alcohol. The two boys allegedly followed the pair for some distance along the promenade before launching the attack in the Kent town. Video of Mr Cashford being chased and falling over was also played to the jury when prosecutors opened their case on Wednesday. Allegedly found on the 16-year-old boy's phone and filmed by the girl, a voice is heard shouting \"f****** paedophile, I'm f****** 16\" and \"Get him\".

        "Content": "One of Britain's most prolific train fare dodgers could face jail time for 112 unpaid tickets, a judge has said.  Charles Brohiri, 29, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday to 76 charges of failing to purchase a rail ticket after previously being convicted in absentia of 36 charges in August last year. He admitted not paying fares of approximately £3,266 for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) journeys between February 2024 and November 2025, and is also accused of failing to pay fines worth £48,682 from separate prosecutions brought between August 2019 and April 2025. Brohiri, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, is also accused of dodging GTR fares in December and January, the most recent instance alleged to have taken place just three days ago. The charges relate to unpaid fares on journeys from London to Brighton, and on Thameslink lines in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. Judge Nina Tempia said Brohiri could now \"face a custodial sentence because of the number of offences he has committed\" and, according to court documents, be ordered to pay back all unpaid fines as well as court fees totalling more than £15,000. The court heard that Brohiri had continued to dodge fares even after being banned from entering Thameslink stations as part of his bail conditions last April. A further bail condition in August banned Brohiri from getting on to Thameslink trains. \n                  New Birmingham to Manchester rail line to be built\n                 \n                  Great British Railways: How much of your cash has been spent on trains rebrand?\n                 \n                  Direct trains from UK to Germany 'one step closer', but nothing yet on journeys to Berlin\n                 Brohiri's bid to have his 36 convictions from last year overturned on a legal technicality was dismissed by Judge Tempia on Thursday. He claimed the charges were unlawful because they had not been brought by a qualified legal professional. Judge Tempia, however, insisted \"there has been no abuse of the court process\".

        "Content": "By Duncan Gardham, security journalist  A teenager accused of planning a terrorist attack on a nearby synagogue had a \"to-do list\" of weapons and explosives and spent Christmas Day researching mass killers, a court has heard. The boy, who was 15-years-old at the time and cannot be named because of his age, is accused of amassing an arsenal of weapons for a planned attack on a synagogue in Newcastle, after he joined a far-right group called 'The Base'. When officers raided the home he shared with his father in a village in Northumberland on 20 February last year, they found his bedroom was adorned with white supremacist flags. Jurors at Leeds Crown Court heard that the teenager had written out a plan in a journal which included a \"to-do list\" to \"get more crossbow bolts, body armour, build more muscle, plan, practice, set year, write manifesto, build main bomb\". The court heard that he had listed explosives and knives in his diary under \"things I will need\" and had written out a plan which included \"blowing up shit, killing with knives or machetes, then quickly head back to secluded area and wait for police\". The court also heard that he had a collection of weapons, including a crossbow. The boy wrote: \"I think the main reason I'm targeting the police and government is that they are the reason white people are killed raped and discriminated against by the invaders. \"The reason for this is to inspire others in countries as restrictive as mine and also to start a race war in the UK. \"Also do not charge anyone, this was my doing, nobody else would be involved.\" The jury heard how, in messages to 'The Base', the boy described himself as an \"eco-fascist\" and an \"accelerationist\" - someone who wants to encourage a race war through terrorist attacks - and said he wanted \"to be a part of a group that is active\". Teen researched school shooters, court heard In December, he downloaded the manifesto of Stephan Balliet, who killed two people in an attack on a synagogue in Halle, Germany, in 2019. The court also heard how on Christmas Eve, the teenager searched for a video of a homemade black powder rifle, and researched Arda Kucukyetim, an 18-year-old who livestreamed his mass stabbing in Turkey in August 2024. On Christmas Day, the teenager researched school shooters and watched a video of a homemade \"zip gun\". He shared a picture with 'The Base' on Boxing Day, which showed him posing with an air rifle, wearing a skull mask and German military camouflage jacket.The same day, he downloaded a document called the White Resistance Manual to his computer.

        "Content": "A former chief executive of the Countess of Chester NHS Trust, where Lucy Letby worked, has been awarded £1.4m in damages. Dr Susan Gilby took her case for unfair dismissal to an employment tribunal after she was suspended in December 2022. In February 2025, the tribunal ruled that Dr Gilby had been forced out of her job after lodging a formal whistleblowing complaint about the trust's then chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite. The British Medical Association (BMA) criticised what it called the \"appalling behaviour\" of the trust and described the payout as one of the largest ever made to a former NHS employee. Dr Gilby took over at the Countess of Chester NHS Trust, weeks after child killer Letby was arrested in 2018, and led the organisation through the pandemic. Speaking about her treatment by the trust and the outcome of her case, Dr Gilby said: \"I am deeply saddened that, having raised a protected disclosure in good faith, I was treated in such an appalling manner that I had no choice other than to seek justice. \"I am yet to receive any meaningful apology from the trust for the harm caused to me or for the needless ending of my career. \n                  Prosecutors consider more charges against Lucy Letby\n                 \n                  Three members of Lucy Letby hospital's senior leadership team arrested\n                 \n                  New miscarriage of justice watchdog chair calls leadership 'unimpressive'\n                 \"No amount of money can compensate me for the devastation of losing my career in this appalling manner.\" Her tribunal heard that in July 2022, the former CEO submitted a grievance against Mr Haythornthwaite over bullying, harassment and \"undermining behaviour\". Ian Radford, lead solicitor on the team acting for Dr Gilby, said the trust had agreed to pay £1.4m to Dr Gilby but that a further hearing in February had been scheduled to consider legal costs. He told Sky News: \"There are, sadly, numerous other NHS whistleblowers, many of whom have little hope of securing the justice that Dr Gilby has finally secured for the appalling way she was treated. \"Even now, the trust has consciously refused to make any apology for how it has acted.\" Read more from Sky News:Managers linked to Letby hospital arrestedLucy Letby will never be releasedTerminally ill man was told he was okay Dr Tom Dolphin, BMA council chair, said in a statement that there needed to be a change in the \"corrosive\" culture in the NHS. \"This should serve as a warning to others that the shameful treatment of whistleblowers can lead to consequences in the law courts. \"The horrific scale of this cover-up shows the length that some trusts are willing to go to in an attempt to silence doctors.\" The Countess of Chester NHS Trust has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has been presented with a Nobel Peace Prize medal by Maria Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, who won the award last year. Speaking to reporters outside the US Capitol after her meeting with the president, Ms Machado said she gave the medal to Trump. She told Sky's US correspondent James Matthews that it was in \"recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom\". Mr Trump, who has long coveted a Nobel Peace Prize, accepted the medal, according to a White House official, who briefed NBC News, Sky's US partner, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\". In a post on Truth Social, his own social network, the president wrote: \"She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. \"María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!\" The decision to award the prize to Ms Machado went down badly with the US president after it was revealed last year. White House director of communications Steven Cheung commented then that \"the Nobel committee proved they place politics over peace\". After accepting the prize, Ms Machado was quick to praise the US president, dedicating it to the people of Venezuela and Mr Trump for his \"decisive support\". She subsequently told Fox News she wanted to \"give it to him and share it with him\", which Mr Trump said would be \"a great honour\". But the committee that awards the prize has been unambiguous in shooting down her suggestion. \"A Nobel Prize can neither be revoked, shared, nor transferred to others,\" the committee said in a statement. \"Once the announcement has been made, the decision stands for all time.\" Ahead of the meeting at the White House, there was speculation that Ms Machado might hand over the prize. The Nobel committee appeared to address the speculation again on Thursday morning, offering two previous examples of the medal changing hands. \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,\" the committee added in the post on X. Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, Matthews said Ms Machado was \"trying to push all the buttons\" of the president. \"She said she gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, quite what he's done with that, we didn't get the answer to that,\" he said. \"She's certainly trying to push all the buttons with the American president, trying to make sure that he's got the Venezuelan politics in mind beyond access to Venezuelan oil reserves.\" For his part, the US president has been lukewarm on Ms Machado since losing out on the prize. After US forces captured Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a raid on Caracas earlier this month, Mr Trump backed the country's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to succeed him. Read more:Trump started with Venezuela - but may not stop therePolitical prisoners are being freed from a brutal jail in Caracas Ms Machado, he said, was \"not respected\" enough to lead the country. Prior to the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the president's assessment, saying it was \"based on realities on the ground\". \"At this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed,\" she said. She also said Venezuela's new leadership had been \"extremely cooperative\" and \"we'll expect that cooperation to continue\". Whether Ms Machado's medal will move the needle in her favour remains unclear, but Mr Trump did not address her gesture in a press conference after their meeting. Earlier in the day, the US seized another sanctioned tanker, the Veronica, this time in the Caribbean, in an operation confirmed by the US military's Southern Command."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Bobi Wine's house is heavily surveilled.  Motorbikes whiz back and forth in the street in front of his gate with a trained curiosity before a large riot truck full of masked police officers fills the narrow road. The relentless monitoring gives way to calm as we enter his high-walled home. I walked down the same garden path with him in 2018 when Wine was starting to shift the fanbase he built as a musician into explosive political popularity as a member of parliament, voicing opposition to President Museveni and the ruling party. Even then, the government was quick to crack down on his young, growing support base in the protests he led against a social media tax imposed by the government. What has changed since then? \"What has changed is that it has gone from bad to worse. There is more impunity. There is more violence every day as people are being abducted and they go missing. Some have been missing for years,\" he responds. The crackdown intensified in the lead up to Uganda's 2021 election when at least 54 people were killed and hundreds were disappeared by the security forces. Now, Wine's National Unity Party says that 300 of their supporters and party officials have been detained in the weeks building up to this election as he runs against Uganda's long-time ruler President Yoweri Museveni for the second time. As we speak in Wine's garden, the military is fully deployed to the streets of Kampala, there is a total internet blackout and the permits of at least nine local human rights organisations have been suspended - all while Ugandans vote for who they want to see govern the country for the next five years. \"Even my deputy president in charge of western Uganda has been picked up, and I'm told she's being detained in a military barracks - so it is crazy what is happening,\" Wine says. \"This is supposed to be an election, but besides switching off the internet, our agents are being picked by security to ensure that the election happens in the dark.\" President Museveni denies long-time allegations of election rigging and told me that it is the opposition that rigs the election. \"They try but they can't overturn us. We are too popular,\" he says. Read more:Uganda's president on shutting down the internetPop star politician aiming to end president's 40 years in power At President Museveni's last rally in Kampala, thousands of people wearing his face on bright yellow T-shirts filled the Kololo airstrip, where he was inaugurated after his first presidential election win in 1996. Foreign media are barred from filming inside the rally, but through the bars, a young man holding up a foam finger turns it into a thumbs down and yells \"Bobi!\" to us. In the narrow road by the airstrip, a man faithfully wipes the face of President Museveni clean on a large billboard before moving on to polish the face of his son, General Muhoozi, the current chief of the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF). If the opposition can't beat President Museveni's loyal following, then why target Wine so aggressively? \"Bobi Wine breaks the law, that is why. There are other people in opposition - you don't find us having problems with them. But if you take each case, you find that he is breaking the law,\" the president says. \"He says I break the law, but I'm not arrested. Why am I not arrested and charged?\" Wine replies. \"If I break the law, the only law that I break is to stand and challenge a 40-year-old dictatorship.\""

Their first stop was a hospital for an overnight stay, going through standard procedure and medical checks. As it happened: Agency gives update on astronaut At a press conference ahead of their journey to hospital, NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said that the four crew members are \"safe\" and in \"good spirits\". And according to Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator for NASA, it was only \"about a week ago\" when NASA decided to bring home Crew-11 early. \n                  International Space Station astronauts begin evacuation due to 'serious medical condition'\n                 \n                  Astronauts to begin return journey from space station due to 'medical concern'\n                 \n                  NASA will bring astronauts home early from ISS over medical issue\n                 He added that the team \"meticulously went through all the processes\". \"You saw the result of that today,\" he said, noting that the crew completed 140 experiments during their time in space. Science correspondent Spacecraft plunge back to Earth so frequently these days that it's almost routine. But this one was special; the first medical evacuation from the International Space Station. We don't know which of the four crew members had a problem that couldn't be resolved on the ISS, nor what the problem was. But NASA decided it was serious enough to bring the astronauts home a month early. The crew commander, Mike Fincke, described it as \"bittersweet\". A safe splashdown means medics will be able to extract the stricken astronaut and get them the care they need.\n\n Back up on the International Space Station, a skeleton crew of three will keep essential services running - until a SpaceX launch in the next few weeks brings four more astronauts to serve a six-month term on the orbiting laboratory. The four astronauts onboard the capsule were NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, as well as Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov. Officials have refused to identify the astronaut who developed the health problem last week or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. But Mr Isaacman said the \"crew member of concern is doing fine\". He said an update on their health would be given \"when it is appropriate to do so\". The return marks the first time that NASA had cut short the rotation of an ISS crew due to a health emergency. During the descent, the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour parachuted into calm seas off San Diego at about 12.45am eastern time (8.45am in the UK). In a radio transmission to the SpaceX flight-control centre near Los Angeles, Endeavour's commander, Ms Cardman, 38, was heard saying, \"It's good to be home.\" It's unclear what caused the medical issue, but the astronaut fell sick or was injured on 7 January, prompting NASA to call off the next day's spacewalk by Ms Cardman and Mr Fincke. NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer James Polk also noted that the medical emergency did not involve \"an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations\".

Emergency repair crews are working tirelessly to restore power in the Kyiv region, officials said on Wednesday, as the area is among the worst-affected by power cuts caused by Russia's sustained attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Follow the latest updates on Ukraine Mr Zelenskyy said he attending a meeting on the \"emergency situation in Ukraine's energy sector, with special attention to Kyiv\" as he posted on X: \"The consequences of Russian strikes and deteriorating weather conditions are severe. \"Repair crews, energy companies, municipal services, and the State Emergency Service of Ukraine continue to work around the clock to restore electricity and heating. \"Many issues require urgent resolution. I thank everyone involved and working at full efficiency.\" In Boryspil, a town in the Kyiv region, workers have been braving the snow amid temperatures of -15C from early morning till midnight to fix the damage to burned-out electrical systems, Yurii Bryzh, who leads the Boryspil regional department of private electricity provider DTEK, said. \n                  British diplomat expelled from Russia after being accused by Moscow of spying\n                 \n                  Arrests after nine newborn babies die at the same hospital in Russia in early January\n                 \n                  Russia is waging hybrid war on UK and Europe through 'disposable agents'\n                 They have managed to restore the supply for four hours a day. But Mr Bryzh said the problem was \"when the power comes back on, people turn on all the electrical equipment that is available in the house\" as they dash to wash, cook or recharge their phones\". All that activity crashes the system again, he said. Kyiv residents Mykhailo, 39, and Hanna, 43, said the temperature in their five-year-old daughter's room has dropped to -15C, so the family huddles in one bed at night under heavy blankets. Anton Gerashchenko, a former adviser to Ukraine's internal affairs minister, said on X: \"Kyiv hospitals have to use autonomous boiler houses to keep their patients warm and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.\" 'This is war' Zinaida Hlyha, 76, said she heats water on her gas stove and puts it in bottles that she tucks into bed. She said she doesn't complain because Ukrainian soldiers on the roughly 1,000km front line have it worse. Kyiv city mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram that heating had been restored to all but about 400 ‌of 6,000 affected apartment buildings and support centres were operating 24 hours a ⁠day.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has been presented with a Nobel Peace Prize medal by Maria Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, who won the award last year. Speaking to reporters outside the US Capitol after her meeting with the president, Ms Machado said she gave the medal to Trump. She told Sky's US correspondent James Matthews that it was in \"recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom\". Mr Trump, who has long coveted a Nobel Peace Prize, accepted the medal, according to a White House official, who briefed NBC News, Sky's US partner, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\". In a post on Truth Social, his own social network, the president wrote: \"She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. \"María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!\" The decision to award the prize to Ms Machado went down badly with the US president after it was revealed last year. White House director of communications Steven Cheung commented then that \"the Nobel committee proved they place politics over peace\". After accepting the prize, Ms Machado was quick to praise the US president, dedicating it to the people of Venezuela and Mr Trump for his \"decisive support\". She subsequently told Fox News she wanted to \"give it to him and share it with him\", which Mr Trump said would be \"a great honour\". But the committee that awards the prize has been unambiguous in shooting down her suggestion. \"A Nobel Prize can neither be revoked, shared, nor transferred to others,\" the committee said in a statement. \"Once the announcement has been made, the decision stands for all time.\" Ahead of the meeting at the White House, there was speculation that Ms Machado might hand over the prize. The Nobel committee appeared to address the speculation again on Thursday morning, offering two previous examples of the medal changing hands. \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,\" the committee added in the post on X. Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, Matthews said Ms Machado was \"trying to push all the buttons\" of the president. \"She said she gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, quite what he's done with that, we didn't get the answer to that,\" he said. \"She's certainly trying to push all the buttons with the American president, trying to make sure that he's got the Venezuelan politics in mind beyond access to Venezuelan oil reserves.\" For his part, the US president has been lukewarm on Ms Machado since losing out on the prize. After US forces captured Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a raid on Caracas earlier this month, Mr Trump backed the country's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to succeed him. Read more:Trump started with Venezuela - but may not stop therePolitical prisoners are being freed from a brutal jail in Caracas Ms Machado, he said, was \"not respected\" enough to lead the country. Prior to the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the president's assessment, saying it was \"based on realities on the ground\". \"At this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed,\" she said. She also said Venezuela's new leadership had been \"extremely cooperative\" and \"we'll expect that cooperation to continue\". Whether Ms Machado's medal will move the needle in her favour remains unclear, but Mr Trump did not address her gesture in a press conference after their meeting. Earlier in the day, the US seized another sanctioned tanker, the Veronica, this time in the Caribbean, in an operation confirmed by the US military's Southern Command."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Minneapolis after it again became the scene of protests against federal officers sent to enforce an immigration crackdown.  Protests broke out in the Minnesota city on Wednesday night after a Venezuelan man was shot in the leg by an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officer just miles from where mother-of-three Renee Good was killed by a agent last week. Protesters had assembled near the scene of the shooting, and were met by federal agents and police officers who fired tear gas into the crowd. By early Thursday, only a few demonstrators and law enforcement officers remained at the scene. President Trump said in a social media post: \"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State.\" Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison said he would challenge any such deployment in court. The president has repeatedly threatened to invoke the rarely used federal law, which dates back to 1807, to deploy the US military or federalise the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, over the objections of state governors. Minneapolis has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and tensions have flared since the fatal shooting of Ms Good. She was shot in her car by an officer from ICE on 7 January. The Trump administration claimed the officer acted in self defence after Ms Good used her vehicle as a weapon - a version of events rejected by state and local officials. The latest shooting came after hundreds more agents were deployed to the city. It took place about four-and-a-half miles north of where Ms Good was killed. According to the Department for Homeland Security, it happened shortly before 7pm local time on Wednesday after a targeted traffic stop of an illegal immigrant from Venezuela. Follow the latest news from Minneapolis in our blog \"In an attempt to evade arrest, the subject fled the scene in his vehicle and crashed into a parked car,\" it said in a statement. \"The subject then fled on foot.\" After catching up, the officer was assaulted as the man resisted arrest, added the statement. The statement added: \"As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broomstick. \"Fearing for his life and safety, as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg.\" The officer and man who was shot are in hospital, while the other two people are in custody. City mayor Jacob Frey urged calm, but reiterated calls for ICE to \"leave the city and state immediately\". The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was launching an \"independent\" investigation into the latest ICE shooting in Minneapolis. The FBI removed state investigators from the probe into the shooting of Renee Good, sparking outrage among local officials. But after the second ICE shooting in the city in a week, the Minnesota BCA said it was going it alone this time. It said: \"BCA Force Investigation Unit is investigating the use-of-force incident that occurred earlier tonight in Minneapolis involving an ICE officer. \"Our team has processed the scene and left the area. This will be an independent BCA investigation. No further information is available tonight. More information will be released in the coming days.\" Martha Kelner, Sky News' US correspondent, has been at the scene of the latest protests. She said: \"You can really sense the level of anger here being directed at ICE agents, people in Minneapolis say that ICE simply has no part in their city.\" Kelner also described how some people had been \"smashing up\" a vehicle believed to have been used by ICE. Protesters had been throwing snowballs and sometimes setting off fireworks towards immigration officials, who have responded with pepper bullets and flash bangs, she said. At a press conference held after the most recent shooting, Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara and Mr Frey urged protesters to go home.Mr O'Hara said the crowd was \"engaging in unlawful acts,\" while Mr Frey said \"we cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos\". Mr Frey added that he had \"seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable\". He accused ICE and border control agents of \"creating chaos\" throughout the city and the state. The mayor later posted on X, saying: \"There's 600 Minneapolis Police Department officers working to keep our streets safe. Meanwhile, they've sent in 3,000 federal agents. America, this is not the path we can be on.\" Read more from Sky News:Iran's regime could fall, says TrumpX to block Grok from undressing images 'Organised brutality' It came after a judge gave the Trump administration time to respond to a request to suspend its crackdown in the city, with assistant attorney general Brian Carter telling a court, \"the temperature needs to be lowered\". Governor Tim Walz has described what's happening in Minnesota as \"a campaign of organised brutality\", and said \"accountability\" would come through the courts. The Department of Homeland Security said it had made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December. The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist the government's case."

        "Content": "Boeing had known since at least 2011 that a part which failed on a UPS plane moments before it crashed, killing 15 people, had failed four times on three different aircraft, according to a new report.  The three-engine plane only got 30ft off the ground after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky after losing its left engine while travelling down the runway on November 4 last year. The plane, which was bound for Honolulu in Hawaii, then crashed, killing 12 people on the ground as well as the three crew. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Wednesday that Boeing had warned airlines in 2011 about the broken part, which helps secure the engines to the wings. However, at that point, the NTSB said the plane maker \"determined it would not result in a safety of flight condition\". The service bulletin that Boeing issued didn't require plane owners to make repairs like a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness directive would, and the aviation regulator didn't issue such a directive. Former federal crash investigator Alan Diehl told AP that the notice from Boeing recommended replacing the bearings with a redesigned part that was less likely to fail. \n                  Radar 'technical issue' halts flights to Birmingham Airport\n                 \n                  JetBlue passenger plane and US Air Force aircraft in near miss by Venezuela\n                 \n                  Flying taxis could be in UK skies from 2028 and end up being as cheap as an Uber\n                 But operators were still allowed to replace defective bearings with another older bearing that had demonstrated it was prone to failing. The NTSB had previously said investigators found cracks in some of the parts that held the engine to the wing. Those cracks, which weren't caught in regular maintenance done on the plane, raise questions about the adequacy of the aircraft's maintenance schedule. The last time the cracked parts were examined closely was in October 2021, and the plane wasn't due for another detailed inspection until it had done around 7,000 more take-offs and landings.

All MD-11s and 10 of the related DC-10 aircraft type have been grounded since the crash. The NTSB report is almost certain to be referenced to in lawsuits filed over the crash, with the first one having been filed last month. Those companies and organisations involved are limited on what they can say while the NTSB investigation continues. However, a Boeing spokesperson told Sky News that: \"We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. \"Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.\" UPS said in a statement: \"We remain profoundly saddened by the Flight 2976 accident. \"Our thoughts continue to be with the families and Louisville community who are grieving, and we remain focused on the recovery effort. \"The NTSB controls the flow of information developed in the investigation. As UPS continues to cooperate fully as a party to the investigation, we are unable to comment on any aspect of it.\" The FAA has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The UK economy recorded growth of 0.3% in November, according to official figures, showing an improvement for output at a time when households and businesses were anxiously awaiting details of the budget. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported an improvement for industrial production on the previous month amid the phased restart of manufacturing at Jaguar Land Rover after August's cyber attack. The ONS measured growth on a rolling three-month basis at 0.1% - a rise on the upwardly revised zero growth covering August-October. Money latest: Why you may have a trust fund you don't know about Economists have partly put that performance down to paralysis caused by the build-up to a budget dominated by signals of more pain to come, including an income tax hike. Private sector surveys have suggested that consumer spending picked up following guidance, in mid-November, that the chancellor had backed away from imposing that measure. The ONS data supported that view as services - the dominant force behind the UK economy - was the only major sector to show growth at the back end of the September-November window. \n                  Why ending the manufacture of a humdrum substance would be final nail in the coffin of an industry that was once Britain's pride\n                 \n                  'Banter' warning as number of pensioners in work hits record high | Money blog\n                 \n                  Water company probed after tens of thousands of homes lose supply\n                 ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said: \"The economy grew slightly in the latest three months, led by growth in the services sector, which performed better in November following a weak October. \"This was partially offset by a fall in manufacturing, where three-monthly growth was still affected by the cyber incident that impacted car production earlier in the autumn. \"However, data for the latest month show that this industry has now largely recovered. \"Construction contracted again, registering its largest three-monthly fall in nearly three years.\" Construction has endured tough times across the board for more than a year, with the housebuilding sector worst hit. Challenges have included weak business confidence and higher than expected borrowing costs, raising fears that the government's target of 1.5 million new homes for England by the end of the parliament will be missed by a large margin. Recent surveys indicate, however, that the worst may be over and confidence is improving more widely now that the budget is behind firms and government has not ruled out help on business rates hikes beyond just pubs. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said of the ONS data: \"With the worst of the uncertainty behind businesses, we expect growth momentum to continue over the coming months. \"Nonetheless, businesses remain concerned about the potential need for further taxes rises before Parliament ends and geopolitical tensions may also threaten growth this year. \"Despite the relatively mooted consumer sentiment so far and consumer-facing services output declining in November, there are some tentative signs of a pick-up in household spending. Inflation is also projected to decline, thanks to easing food and energy prices, which could support a recovery in discretionary spending.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The petrol forecourts giant founded in Blackburn by brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa will next week kick off formal plans for a $9bn (£6.7bn) US stock market listing. Sky News has learnt that EG Group, about 25% of which is owned by each of the brothers, will hold a beauty parade of banks in London ahead of a flotation expected to take place this year. Banking sources said Barclays, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were all likely to take part in next week's selection process. EG Group has become one of the world's largest fuel retailing multinationals, expanding its foodservice offering and generating significant profits. The company, which may choose to list in New York under the name Cumberland Farms, is currently chaired by Lord Rose, the former Marks & Spencer and Asda chairman. EG Group is roughly 50pc-owned by TDR Capital, the London-based private equity firm which also owns a controlling stake in Asda. Under TDR's ownership, EG Group has recruited an experienced executive leadership team led by Russell Colaco. \n                  Why ending the manufacture of a humdrum substance would be final nail in the coffin of an industry that was once Britain's pride\n                 \n                  'Banter' warning as number of pensioners in work hits record high | Money blog\n                 \n                  Economy records 0.3% growth in November\n                 Mr Colaco is based in the US, which is now the company's biggest single market. Its global headquarters is shifting to Charlotte, North Carolina, and while the company was founded in Britain, bankers believe a US listing is more logical than a London flotation. In total, EG Group employs about 33,000 people and operates roughly 4,300 sites. It serves 1 billion customers every year. In recent years, EG has substantially reduced its borrowings by selling assets, including offloading the majority of its UK sites to Asda. It continues to trade in Britain from about 150 Starbucks-branded outlets, with these also potentially changing hands. The group has also sold its operations in Italy, while the disposal of its Australian unit is going through competition clearance. One banker said that after taking the disposals into account, it was likely to be valued at between $8bn and $9bn. An EG spokesman declined to comment."

Geoblocking prevents access to a feature for people based in particular countries, but the change still leaves open the possibility that it could be circumvented with a VPN. The restriction will apply to all users, including paid subscribers, while image editing and creation will be limited to premium users. Shortly after posting on social media, Sir Keir told broadcasters during a visit to Scotland: \"Those images, sexualised images, were disgusting, absolutely disgusting, and we made it clear that we wouldn't tolerate them and that we wouldn't back down. \"So I am glad that action has now been taken.

Mr Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX, who has previously called for Sir Keir to be voted out of office, has claimed - along with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - that a ban would be an attack on free speech.

Sky News has learnt that Trojan Energy, which is part-owned by the BGF, is working with advisers on a review of its strategic options, including a sale to new investors. City sources said that bids for the company, which is being marketed by Interpath Advisory, were due this week. Money latest: The hidden government savings account worth £2k Founded in 2016, Trojan Energy raised £26m two years ago from investors including BGF and the Scottish National Investment Bank. The BGF was set up by the UK's major retail lenders in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, with a multibillion-pound mandate to invest in small and mid-sized British companies. Trojan Energy provides on-street and kerbside EV charging points, and now has a network of more than 1,500 connections, according to its website. \n                  Why ending the manufacture of a humdrum substance would be final nail in the coffin of an industry that was once Britain's pride\n                 \n                  'Banter' warning as number of pensioners in work hits record high | Money blog\n                 \n                  Economy records 0.3% growth in November\n                 It is also contracted to install hundreds more, which information circulated to potential buyers said positioned it \"for rapid UK and international scale-up\". However, there are growing doubts about future demand for EVs following the chancellor's decision to slap a 3p-per-mile tax on electric cars from 2028. Reports said last weekend that the Treasury was reviewing this charge as well as the imposition of VAT on the use of chargers which are not located on motorists' driveways. Interpath declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Live news reporter\n              @markgwyatt\n Whether used as a natural sweetener in cooking, as a home remedy for a sore throat or simply for drowning your pancakes, honey is a staple in cupboards across the country. But what's the best stuff? What do you look for on the label? And can you get good honey in supermarkets? Read all the latest Money news In the first of our new monthly series on buying products like a pro, we've got the answers from top experts. The issue with supermarket honey David Wagstaff, commercial beekeeper and founder of More Bees Please, told the Money blog the primary issues with supermarket honey were adulteration, lack of transparency and heavy processing. A large proportion of cheaper supermarket honey is blended from imports, often labelled vaguely as \"blend of EU and non-EU honeys\", he said. \n                  Why ending the manufacture of a humdrum substance would be final nail in the coffin of an industry that was once Britain's pride\n                 \n                  'Banter' warning as number of pensioners in work hits record high | Money blog\n                 \n                  Economy records 0.3% growth in November\n                 \"Many tests suggest this kind of honey may be diluted with cheap sugar syrups (like corn or rice syrup) or misrepresented as pure honey,\" he said. Industrial honey is often pasteurised and filtered for clarity and a long shelf life, Wagstaff added. This process can remove pollen, enzymes and antioxidants that are present in raw, unprocessed honey. Could a £3 supermarket product labelled as honey not actually be proper honey? \"Yes, it can happen,\" Wagstaff said. \"A £3 supermarket jar labelled as 'honey' is legally allowed to be sold, but it's often very different from what most people imagine as real, natural honey. \"A £3 jar is typically priced that way because it is produced at massive scale, sourced globally and processed for consistency - not because it is raw, local or single-source.\" What should you look for on the label? Dr Gino Jabbar, chairman of the Honey Guild of the United Kingdom, told the Money blog that consumers should always start by looking at the country of origin. \"Check if it's from a single country or a blend from many regions,\" he explained. Single original honey is generally more expensive than blends from many regions, but it is less likely to be adulterated. \"See the description of the producer and any information on the aroma, style of beekeeping and make an informed choice,\" says Dr Jabbar. \"Although a high price does not guarantee that a honey is genuine, the higher the cost, the less likely the product is affected by global honey fraud.\" Is anything changing? Honey is expensive to produce, limited in its supply and commands a price, meaning retail shelves are full of cheaper options. Dr Jabbar says the British public is \"wholly unaware\" of these facts and the \"amazing flavours and diversity\" of real honey, meaning it's unlikely high quality options ever reach the shelves. \"This lack of honey education and a honey culture in the UK remains the main reason for the high demand for low cost honey. Until customers demand the right to pay high prices for honey, retailers will not take the risk to stock high quality honey varieties, afraid it will not sell.\" Read more:How to get free food from Pret, Costa and local bakeriesThe food industry's dirty secretThe rise of Michelin-starred fast food Experts say: buy local \"100% yes,\" David Wagstaff, commercial beekeeper and founder of More Bees Please, told Money. \"When you buy from a beekeeper or local shop, you can often find out exactly where the honey came from - down to hive location and floral source. \"Independent tests have shown that honey from dedicated beekeepers is much more likely to be genuine compared with many supermarket products. \"Buying local supports sustainable, bee-friendly practices and helps keep healthy colonies in your region, which benefits wider plant pollination.\" Not only is buying directly from the producer the recommended way to buy honey, Dr Jabbar suggests buying in bulk for a year's supply at a time. \"Honey is a finite resource with a unique flavour profile to that batch, season and terroir. Potential places to look are producers' own websites, farmers' markets and retailers that stock UK and quality foreign produce.\" English honey Honey is imported into the UK from across the world but is also produced all over the country - the colours, textures and aromas vary dramatically depending on the flowers that the bees have foraged on. For example, honey made from the fields of Borage in Essex is a very runny, pale yellow honey with a mild flavour. By contrast, Ling Heather honey, produced in wilder areas like the Yorkshire Moors and Scotland, is thick and amber coloured with a rich flavour. Why is Manuka so in demand/expensive? Manuka honey is a special type of honey produced by bees that pollinate the Manuka bush, a plant native to New Zealand. It's often sold as having health benefits due to its methylglyoxal content, which gives it specific antimicrobial properties. Maureen Conquer is a professional honey taster and a world-renowned authority on Manuka honey. She told the Money blog the limited supply of Manuka bushes and remote nature of the sites where it can be produced ramps up the price, as well as the strict extraction practises. \"Medicinal grade Manuka is extracted and processed in sophisticated hospital standard extraction plants with double doors, sanitiser and disinfectant foot baths and full sterile clothing,\" she explains. \"It's temperature-controlled in secure facilities with high-tech extraction and packaging equipment.\" Buyers should look for UMF certification, which means the manufacturer is licensed with the Unique Manuka Factor Honey Association. Can you tell just by looking whether a honey is off? Honey generally does not go off, Dr Jabbar says, but its aroma, active nutritional compounds and enzyme activity will depreciate with time, so he says it's best to consume before the stated best before date for maximum enjoyment. He says some people mistake the crystallisation of honey as a problem, when it's not. \"All honeys naturally crystallise. Indeed, some people prefer the texture of crystallised honey to liquid honey. It may be unexpected, but this is natural and does not affect the quality of the honey.\" Dr Jabbar says indirectly warming honey at around 35C for a few hours will return the honey to its liquid state. What about organic vs non-organic? Organic honey is produced using criteria set out for organic beekeeping practices, and the producer is licensed by an organic authorising body. Crucially, organic honey does not equate to better tasting or higher aromatic quality produce, only that the presence of foreign chemicals in the honey are likely to be lower. This means most consumers won't even recognise organic honey, but those who may wish to support food produced under organic principles might prefer to buy it. Even then, as Wagstaff explains, it's incredibly difficult to prove honey is 100% organic: \"It is almost impossible for a beekeeper to guarantee that every flower a bee visits within a three to five-mile radius is organic. Because of this, many ethical beekeepers choose not to label their honey as organic.\" \"I would encourage people to look for raw, natural, single-source honey from a trusted producer over focusing purely on an 'organic' label,\" he adds. I've bought the honey, how should I store it? Now you've made your well-informed purchase, it's time to take your honey home and enjoy it... but how best to store it? Dr Jabbar says honey should not be exposed to the air for long periods of time, and also stored appropriately in an airtight container if removed from the original jar. \"Once used, close the lid and store the jar. As honey is hygroscopic, it absorbs moisture from the air and thus its water content rises, which weakens the honeys preservative qualities.\""

The newest former Tory MP member of Reform then launched a scathing attack on the Tories, saying they \"don't have the stomach for the radical change this country needs\". \n                  Local elections 2026: Over a third of councils offered a delay have requested one - is yours on the list?\n                 \n                  Labour MPs anticipate 'politically inept' U-turn on social media ban\n                 \n                  Badenoch turned a crisis into an opportunity - but her Reform problems aren't over\n                 He said both the Tories and Labour \"broke Britain\" and have no senior members with \"the competence or the backbone needed to fix it\". Conservatives 'failed so badly' Now Reform's seventh MP, he hit out at several Conservatives by name, saying his efforts as a Tory minister were \"let down\" by Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. \"I can't - in good conscience - stick with a party that's failed so badly. That isn't sorry and hasn't changed,\" he said. Mr Jenrick, who said he first reached out to Mr Farage in September, said he did not intend to call a by-election in his Newham constituency and said Reform's leader is the only person who should be prime minister at the next election.

However, she was shown \"very clear evidence\" in the form of a defection speech he was going to give. \"I think Reform needs to be looking at what kind of person it is they're taking in: someone who's very happy to hurt his colleagues,\" she added. How Farage was convinced Mr Farage admitted he had doubts about Mr Jenrick's political journey, from centrist Tory remainer to staunchly anti-immigration, but he was convinced over the summer that he had been \"on a genuine journey, is viewing the country very differently\". He said Mr Jenrick will be \"joining our front line team\" and thinks he will \"bring a lot more people and voters to us\". Mr Farage revealed they had been in \"advanced talks\" about Mr Jenrick joining Reform, but it had not been planned for Thursday, or even this week or month. No more defections after 7 May Mr Jenrick said he did not know he was going to leave the Tories when he woke up on Thursday, but was resolved he would at some point, and said he can now get on with helping Mr Farage sooner. The MP is the second senior Conservative to have defected to Reform this week, after ex-chancellor Nadhim Zahawi moved over on Monday. Mr Farage said potential defectors have until the local elections on 7 May to switch to Reform. \"Don't think you're joining us on the back of a massive success on May 7th,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Times really have changed. What the hell has just happened? Robert Jenrick has defected to Reform after Kemi Badenoch found some evidence and unceremoniously sacked him. This should and could have been a mega moment for Nigel Farage. Jenrick was a key Conservative face. He was in the shadow cabinet. He was really popular with party members. He had been a leadership rival to Badenoch - and he was still snapping at her heels But Badenoch shocked all of us on Thursday morning - including Farage - when she dropped this bombshell video sacking Jenrick, because she said she had evidence he was going to defect and badmouth his colleagues In doing that, in seizing the moment and surprising her enemies, she managed to turn what would have been a clear crisis into almost an opportunity as she took the momentum, showed the political authority and pushed Jenrick out before he jumped \n                  Local elections 2026: Over a third of councils offered a delay have requested one - is yours on the list?\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  Michael Gove reveals regret over Boris Johnson leadership bid\n                 What's the fallout?

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n In an interview with Sky News during last autumn's Conservative conference, Robert Jenrick appeared to leave the door open to a Tory deal with Reform UK. He was asked by deputy political editor Sam Coates: \"You'd never support a pact?\" And he infuriated Tory loyalists by replying: \"That is not our priority. That's not a priority.\" Politics latest: Robert Jenrick sacked from shadow cabinet In a 2024 interview with Sky News political editor Beth Rigby, he said he would have \"no problem\" with Mr Farage being a member of the Conservative Party. No wonder, then, that he has now joined forces with Mr Farage after Kemi Badenoch delivered a political bombshell earlier today by sacking him. Until he challenged Mrs Badenoch for the Conservative leadership in 2024, Mr Jenrick was perhaps best known as the minister who unlawfully intervened in a planning decision involving publisher Richard Desmond. As immigration minister, he ordered murals of Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters designed to welcome child asylum seekers to a reception centre in Dover to be painted over. After Mrs Badenoch became leader and appointed him to the key post of shadow justice secretary, he never hid his ambition to undermine her and ultimately oust her. He also continued to court headlines and controversy in equal measure, never more so than when he published a video of himself delivering \"vigilante justice\" to people he accused of fare dodging. At the Manchester conference, when he gave his revealing interview to Sky News, he theatrically held up a box and pulled out a judge's wig as he attacked what he called \"activist\" judges. All politicians go on a journey of one sort or another during their career. But Mr Jenrick's has already been one of the most turbulent and may be about to take an even more sensational right turn. Read more:Ex-Tory chancellor Zahawi defects to ReformStarmer's three big woes revealed While Mrs Badenoch's journey brought her more than 3,000 miles from West Africa to the top of the Conservative Party, Mr Jenrick's has been political and ideological. For example, three years after becoming an MP in a by-election, he attended Donald Trump's first inauguration as US president in 2017, though he insisted his presence was not an endorsement. His remarkable transformation has taken him from a compassionate centrist and Cameron Remainer in the 2016 referendum to an anti-immigration zealot and standard-bearer of the Brexiteer hard right. Among Conservative MPs, his ideological journey has earned him the nickname \"Robert Generic\". His response: he's been called worse things, he says. He served in government under five Conservative prime ministers, though that's a comment on the torrid state of the Conservative party over the past decade or more. \"My values haven't changed one bit,\" he told Sophy Ridge in a Sky News interview during the Tory leadership campaign. But after the latest astonishing developments, his critics would fiercely dispute that. His leadership campaign saw him take an uncompromising hard-line stance on immigration, almost to the exclusion of other issues. His core policy was to quit the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), which is now party policy. The leading backers in his campaign were the hard men of the Tory right, including veteran Brexiteers Mark Francois and Sir John Hayes, who was previously viewed as Suella Braverman's \"brain\" and leading tactician. It was a big shift from the days when, along with Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden, he was one of the Tories' \"Three Musketeers\", seen as a trio of centrist rising stars. But Mr Jenrick has not just been on a journey from Remain to Brexit and from centrist to hard-line right winger. He's also spoken about how his upbringing in Wolverhampton shaped his values. He's described his father as a \"white van man\" who started his own business. He told party activists in a \"fireside chat\" at the 2024 Tory conference in Birmingham that he grew up in a \"working-class background\". His grandmother paid for him to go to fee-paying Wolverhampton Grammar School, he said. From there it was Cambridge University, where he read history, then political science at the University of Pennsylvania, before qualifying as a solicitor and then a job at Christie's, the art auctioneers. It was while working as a solicitor that he met his American wife, Michal Berkner, a high-flying corporate lawyer who is eight years older than Mr Jenrick. They have three children. He wooed the Tory activists with the disclosure that the middle name of his second daughter, Sophia, is Thatcher, because she was born the year Mrs Thatcher died. Throughout his leadership campaign, his extroverted wife was his chief cheerleader, highly visible in the front row of the audience at most events. His wife is Jewish and Mr Jenrick, who describes himself as \"the father of a Jewish family\", has been a strong pro-Israel voice, including wearing a \"Hamas are terrorists\" hoodie during the leadership campaign. Many Tory MPs also believe his wife is the driving force behind his ambition. Anecdotally, it's even been claimed that she orders for him at dinner. Mr Jenrick fought Newcastle-under-Lyme for the Tories in 2010 and was only 1,500 votes behind Labour's Paul Farrelly, before winning Newark in a by-election caused by former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer being exposed in a lobbying scandal in 2014. Ironically, on the day Mr Mercer announced his resignation, Mr Farage said he was tempted to stand as a candidate for his United Kingdom Independence Party, and though he didn't, UKIP came second in the by-election. Once in parliament, for three years from 2015 to 2018 under David Cameron and then Theresa May, Mr Jenrick was a parliamentary private secretary to four high-profile ministers: Esther McVey, Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Amber Rudd. Then he got his first ministerial job, a junior minister at the Treasury, before his big break when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, and his career really took off, with promotion to the cabinet as housing and local government secretary. But that was when Mr Jenrick started to become a highly controversial figure. Two major controversies stand out: a planning row involving Mr Desmond - Tory donor, property developer and publisher - and allegations he broke lockdown rules during the COVID pandemic. First, he survived a huge row over his decision to fast-track planning permission for a £1bn property scheme in east London two weeks before Mr Desmond donated £12,000 to the Conservative party. The pair had sat next to each other at a fundraising dinner, at which Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the development on his mobile phone. It was hugely controversial because Mr Jenrick's decision, later overturned, saved the Express Newspapers tycoon £45m in a local tax on property developments in the borough of Tower Hamlets. Weeks later, Mr Jenrick was in trouble again. During COVID lockdowns, it was revealed he travelled to his parents' home in Shropshire and to his family home, a 17th-century manor house in Herefordshire, more than 150 miles from London and 130 miles from his Newark constituency. Although Mr Jenrick said he was delivering food and medicine to his elderly parents and did not enter their house, his visit came after he appealed to people not to visit their families on Mother's Day. He survived the furore again, but was later sacked by Mr Johnson in a September 2021 reshuffle in which his job went to Michael Gove. But he returned to government under Liz Truss, as a health minister, and then Mr Sunak appointed him immigration minister under Ms Braverman. It was claimed he was not happy - and cried. Accused of being heartless over the painting over of the asylum centre murals, he told Sky News: \"It's not something I would do again. I would never want to do anything that was anything other than compassionate towards children. I'm a dad of three young children.\" Then, in December 2023, he abruptly resigned, claiming the government's contentious legislation to deport illegal asylum seekers to Rwanda was not tough enough and was \"fatally flawed\". By then, Tory MPs were convinced Mr Jenrick already had leadership ambitions and was positioning himself for a bid. Not true, he insisted at the time. There were also claims that he was furious at not being appointed to succeed Ms Braverman when she was sacked, the job going instead to James Cleverly - later a leadership rival - in the reshuffle that saw Lord Cameron's surprise appointment as foreign secretary. Mr Jenrick's resignation and his obvious manoeuvring ahead of a leadership bid also coincided with a new trendy \"Caesar\" haircut and a dramatic weight loss of four stone, which he later admitted was partly due to taking the slimming drug Ozempic for six weeks. In the early rounds of voting by Tory MPs in the 2024 leadership election, Mr Jenrick surged into the lead and was the candidate with momentum, only for Mr Cleverly to seize the momentum with a bravura performance at the Tory conference. But in the final stage of the contest, the momentum moved to Mrs Badenoch. Despite claiming his values are the same as when he entered parliament in 2014, his views and his policies have changed significantly. He has shifted dramatically from the Tory mainstream to the party's right flank. And now...beyond that. In words that will delight Mr Farage, he said when he stood for the Tory leadership: \"If I were an American citizen, I would be voting for Donald Trump.\" And if, as now seems likely, Mr Jenrick becomes Reform UK's leading voice on tackling illegal immigration, we can surely expect some Trump-style policies. During a trip to the US-Mexico border in 2024, he declared: \"There are areas we can learn from Donald Trump and the Republican Party, one of which is illegal migration.\" His days as a pro-Cameron, anti-Brexit centrist in the Tory mainstream are now a long way behind him."

        "Content": "An astronaut who had a \"serious medical condition\" onboard the International Space Station is safely back on Earth, after the first-ever emergency return space flight. The astronaut and three others returned from a mission in space a month early, making a middle-of-the-night splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego early on Thursday. With assistance from SpaceX, the capsule landed less than 11 hours after the astronauts exited the International Space Station (ISS). Their first stop was a hospital for an overnight stay, going through standard procedure and medical checks. As it happened: Agency gives update on astronaut At a press conference ahead of their journey to hospital, NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said that the four crew members are \"safe\" and in \"good spirits\". And according to Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator for NASA, it was only \"about a week ago\" when NASA decided to bring home Crew-11 early. \n                  International Space Station astronauts begin evacuation due to 'serious medical condition'\n                 \n                  Astronauts to begin return journey from space station due to 'medical concern'\n                 \n                  NASA will bring astronauts home early from ISS over medical issue\n                 He added that the team \"meticulously went through all the processes\". \"You saw the result of that today,\" he said, noting that the crew completed 140 experiments during their time in space. Science correspondent Spacecraft plunge back to Earth so frequently these days that it's almost routine. But this one was special; the first medical evacuation from the International Space Station. We don't know which of the four crew members had a problem that couldn't be resolved on the ISS, nor what the problem was. But NASA decided it was serious enough to bring the astronauts home a month early. The crew commander, Mike Fincke, described it as \"bittersweet\". A safe splashdown means medics will be able to extract the stricken astronaut and get them the care they need.\n\n Back up on the International Space Station, a skeleton crew of three will keep essential services running - until a SpaceX launch in the next few weeks brings four more astronauts to serve a six-month term on the orbiting laboratory. The four astronauts onboard the capsule were NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, as well as Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov. Officials have refused to identify the astronaut who developed the health problem last week or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. But Mr Isaacman said the \"crew member of concern is doing fine\". He said an update on their health would be given \"when it is appropriate to do so\". The return marks the first time that NASA had cut short the rotation of an ISS crew due to a health emergency. During the descent, the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour parachuted into calm seas off San Diego at about 12.45am eastern time (8.45am in the UK). In a radio transmission to the SpaceX flight-control centre near Los Angeles, Endeavour's commander, Ms Cardman, 38, was heard saying, \"It's good to be home.\" It's unclear what caused the medical issue, but the astronaut fell sick or was injured on 7 January, prompting NASA to call off the next day's spacewalk by Ms Cardman and Mr Fincke. NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer James Polk also noted that the medical emergency did not involve \"an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations\".

        "Content": "The Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X will no longer be able to undress pictures of real people, the company has announced. \"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" said a statement. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\" It comes amid mounting condemnation in the UK and US of the chatbot's image editing capabilities, with British government ministers threatening the platform with action. Sir Keir Starmer has described nonconsensual sex images produced by Grok as \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\", and media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation. The statement from X came hours after California announced its own state-level probe into the spread of sexualised images created by Grok, including of children.

Mr Musk, the billionaire owner of SpaceX and Tesla who has previously called for Sir Keir to be voted out of office, has claimed - along with Reform leader Nigel Farage - that a ban would be an attack on free speech. Musk defends Grok safety measures After the prime minister's comments at PMQs, Mr Musk wrote on X he was \"not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok\". \"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,\" he said. \"When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. \"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.\" X had already announced in an earlier response to the political pressure that image creation and editing would be restricted to paid subscribers. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall dismissed the move as merely \"monetising abuse\" and said the government would support Ofcom in whatever action it decides to take. Ofcom's powers fall under the Online Safety Act, which states that online platforms have to make sure they're not hosting illegal content. If X is found to not comply with the Online Safety Act, Ofcom can issue a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, and if that is not enough, can go as far as getting a court approval to block the site."

        "Content": "Prince Harry is expected to appear at the High Court in London next week to give evidence in his privacy case against the publisher of the Daily Mail. The Duke of Sussex and six others, including Sir Elton John and Liz Hurley, allege Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) hired private detectives to commit a series of unlawful acts between 1993 and 2011. Alleged activities included placing listening devices inside cars, using deception, or \"blagging\" private records, such as flight details and medical records and accessing private phone conversations. Harry's case explained Harry is expected to spend a full day on the stand next Thursday, a draft trial timetable suggests. Sir Elton, Ms Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence are also expected to give evidence at the nine-week trial, which is due to begin on Monday. Elton John's husband David Furnish, actress Sadie Frost and former Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes are the others involved in the case. The group launched its lawsuit against Associated, the publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, in October 2020. Associated Newspapers denies all the allegations, calling them \"preposterous smears\". A number of outstanding issues were dealt with at the court on Thursday, including a challenge by the claimants' lawyers against some of the wording in ANL's proposed opening arguments relating to an alleged \"scheme of camouflage\". At the hearing, Mr Justice Nicklin heard that ANL lawyers have made \"serious allegations\" of dishonesty and fraud against some representatives in the claimants' legal team. In written submissions, David Sherborne, for the claimants, said: \"The allegations made by the defendants are exceptionally serious, of fraud, dishonesty and professional misconduct. \"They cannot be introduced by assertion in opening written submissions and are not simply commentary on pleaded issues.\" He added: \"The allegations made by the defendants are not confined to the credibility of witnesses, as above, the defendant explicitly seeks findings, and also asserts as a fact that actions amount to a 'calculated attempt to withhold the true position from the court'.\" Antony White KC, for ANL, told the court the submissions were simply an \"attack\" on the credibility of some of the witnesses. He said in court: \"It is not necessary to plead a case if the other side's witnesses are not telling the truth.\" Read more on Sky News:Astronauts back on EarthWoman in her 60s murdered12-hour NHS trolley waits Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that ANL's trial opening note should be amended, saying \"the camouflage scheme that is relied upon by the defendants goes far further than an attack on credibility\". He added: \"It seems to be that the requirements of fairness mean that the defendant must seek to amend its defence.\" Mr White told the court he would condense the claims in his opening note. The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday."
