        "Headline": "A hospital boss tells Sky News his A&E staff are seeing \"more and more people coming here as their first port of call\". However, waiting times for these cases have risen and overnight beds in mental health units are down almost 3,700 in a decade.",
        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  \"We've got two,\" explains Emer Szczygiel, emergency department head of nursing at King George Hospital, as she walks inside a pastel coloured room.   \"If I had my time back again, we would probably have four, five, or six because these have helped us so much in the department with the really difficult patients.\" On one wall, there's floral wallpaper. It is scored through with a graffiti scrawl. The words must have been scratched out with fingernails. There are no other implements in here. Patients being held in this secure room would have been searched to make sure they are not carrying anything they can use to harm themselves - or others. There is a plastic bed secured to the wall. No bedding though, as this room is \"ligature light\", meaning nothing in here could be used for self harm. On the ceiling, there is CCTV that feeds into a control room on another part of the Ilford hospital's sprawling grounds. \"So this is one of two rooms that when we were undergoing our works, we recognised, about three years ago, mental health was causing us more of an issue, so we've had two rooms purpose built,\" Emer says. \"They're as compliant as we can get them with a mental health room - they're ligature light, as opposed to ligature free. They're under 24-hour CCTV surveillance.\" There are two doors, both heavily reinforced. One can be used by staff to make an emergency escape if they are under any threat. What is unusual about these rooms is that they are built right inside a busy accident and emergency department. The doors are just feet away from a nurse's station, where medical staff are trying to deal with acute ED (emergency department) attendances. The number of mental health patients in a crisis attending A&E has reached crisis levels. Some will be experiencing psychotic episodes and are potentially violent, presenting a threat to themselves, other patients, clinical staff and security teams deployed to de-escalate the situation. Like physically-ill patients, they require the most urgent care but are now facing some of the longest waits on record. On a fairly quiet Wednesday morning, the ED team is already managing five mental health patients. One, a diminutive South Asian woman, is screaming hysterically. She is clearly very agitated and becoming more distressed by the minute. Despite her size, she is surrounded by at least five security guards. She has been here for 12 hours and wants to leave, but can't as she's being held under the Mental Capacity Act. Her frustration boils over as she pushes against the chests of the security guards who encircle her. \"We see about 150 to 200 patients a day through this emergency department, but we're getting on average about 15 to 20 mental health presentations to the department,\" Emer explains. \"Some of these patients can be really difficult to manage and really complex.\" \"If a patient's in crisis and wants to harm themselves, there's lots of things in this area that you can harm yourself with,\" the nurse adds. \"It's trying to balance that risk and make sure every emergency department in the country is deemed a place of safety. But there is a lot of risk that comes with emergency departments, because they're not purposeful for mental health patients.\" In a small side room, Ajay Kumar and his wife are waiting patiently by their son's bedside. He's experienced psychotic episodes since starting university in 2018 and his father says he can become unpredictable and violent. Ajay says his son \"is under a section three order - that means six months in hospital\". \"They sectioned him,\" he tells us. \"He should be secure now, he shouldn't go out in public. Last night he ran away [from hospital] and walked all the way home. It took him four and a half hours to come home. \"I mean, he got three and a half hours away. Even though he's totally mental, he still finds his way home and he was so tired and the police were looking for him.\" Now they are all back in hospital and could be waiting \"for days\", Ajay says. \"I don't know how many. They're not telling us anything.\" Matthew Trainer, chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, is at pains to stress nobody is blaming the patients. \"We've seen, particularly over the last few years, a real increase in the number of people in mental health crisis coming into A&E for support,\" he says. \"And I don't know if this is because of the pandemic or wider economic pressures, but what we're seeing every day is more and more people coming here as their first port of call.\" The hospital boss adds: \"If you get someone who's really distressed, someone who is perhaps experiencing psychosis etc, I'm seeing increasing numbers of complaints from other patients and their families about the environment they've had to wait in. \"And they're not blaming the mental health patients for being here. \"But what they're saying is being in a really busy accident & emergency with ambulances, with somebody highly distressed, and you're sat there with an elderly relative or a sick child or whatever - it's hard for everyone. \"There's no blame in this. It's something we've got to work together to try to fix.\" New Freedom of Information data gathered by the Royal College of Nursing shows that over the last five years, more than 1.3 million people in a mental health crisis presented to A&E departments. That's expected to be a significant underestimate however, as only around a quarter of English trusts handed over data. For these patients, waits of 12 hours or more for a mental health bed have increased by more than 380%. Over the last decade, the number of overnight beds in mental health units declined by almost 3,700. That's around 17%. The Department for Health and Social Care told Sky News: \"We know people with mental health issues are not always getting the support or care they deserve and incidents like this are unacceptable. \"We are transforming mental health services - including investing £26m to support people in mental health crisis, hiring more staff, delivering more talking therapies, and getting waiting lists down through our Plan for Change.\" Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, also told Sky News: \"While we know there is much more to do to deal with record demand including on waits, if a patient is deemed to need support in A&E, almost all emergency departments now have a psychiatric liaison team available 24/7 so people can get specialist mental health support alongside physical treatment. \"The NHS is working with local authorities to ensure that mental health patients are given support to leave hospital as soon as they are ready, so that space can be freed up across hospitals including A&Es.\" Patients in a mental health crisis and attending hospital are stuck between two failing systems. A shortage of specialist beds means they are left untreated in a hospital not designed to help them. And they are failed by a social care network overwhelmed by demand and unable to provide the early intervention care needed."

        "Content": " Aid distribution centres in Gaza will be closed on Wednesday, the US-backed organisation operating them has announced, after Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli gunfire near one of its sites. In a post on Facebook, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - which is endorsed by Israel - said the centres would be shut \"for renovations, organisation, and efficiency improvements\". \"Due to the ongoing upgrades, entry into the distribution centre areas is strictly prohibited,\" it added. \"Please avoid the site and adhere to the general instructions. Operations will resume on Thursday.\" Following the announcement, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) told people in Gaza that \"travel is prohibited\" on Wednesday \"via the roads leading to the distribution centres, which are considered combat zones, and entry into the distribution centre areas is strictly prohibited\". It comes after 27 Palestinians were killed while waiting for aid to be distributed in the Rafah area of southern Gaza early on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry claimed that more than 90 people were injured in what it called a \"massacre\", with some of the wounded in a serious condition. The IDF said it fired \"near a few individual suspects\" who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots, about half a kilometre from the aid distribution site of the GHF. It added that people were moving towards its forces in a way that \"posed a threat to them\". Later, IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin said accusations that the Israeli military shot at civilians at the aid centre were \"completely unfounded and false\". \"We are debriefing this event, and we will find out the truth,\" he added. The media office of the Gaza government, which is run by Hamas, said in a statement that Israel was transforming aid distribution centres \"into mass death traps and bloodbaths\" with 102 people killed and 490 more injured in just eight days since the centres opened on 27 May. The aid centres were \"luring starving civilians to them as a result of the crippling famine\", said the media office, which called for humanitarian aid delivered through UN agencies and neutral international organisations rather than the GHF. The IDF said in a statement: \"Earlier today (Tuesday), during the movement of the crowd along the designated routes toward the aid distribution site - approximately half a kilometre from the site - IDF troops identified several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes. \"The troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops.\" Sky News pressed Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer on whether any of these individuals had weapons - but he failed to answer the question. Mencer told Sky's Kamali Melbourne: \"The warning shots were fired away from the aid distribution point in response to the threat perceived by IDF troops.\" Read more from Sky News:How Israeli-backed aid plan in Gaza is unravellingEx-Biden official says Israel committed war crimes The GHF said in a statement on Tuesday: \"While the aid distribution was conducted safely and without incident at our site today, we understand that IDF is investigating whether a number of civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone. This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area. \"We recognise the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when travelling to our distribution sites. Questions regarding the potential incident should be referred to the IDF Spokesperson.\" Middle East correspondent The Israeli government says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is supposed to prevent aid from going to Hamas. That's almost certainly not being achieved. The operation is in chaos – every morning tens of thousands of people make the journey south on foot to get food when the two hubs open after dawn. It's first come, first served. It's the survival of the fittest in a place where almost everyone is already starving. The pictures of massive crowds grabbing food boxes in a frenzied manner aren't just an indication of the desperation, but would also appear to undermine Israel's claims the aid isn't going to Hamas. Amid the chaos and thousands of people (mostly men) scrabbling for aid, how could they possibly know who is getting it? The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah received 184 casualties. A spokesperson added that 19 of those were declared dead upon arrival, and eight died of their wounds shortly after. There were three children and two women among the dead, according to Mohammed Saqr, who is the head of nursing at Nasser Hospital in Gaza. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) launched its first aid distribution sites at the end of May to combat widespread hunger among the population in Gaza. The GHF, a private group endorsed by Israel, operates as part of a controversial new aid system established by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in May that Israel would be \"taking control of food distribution\" in Gaza after it accused Hamas of diverting and seizing aid supplies. Hamas has denied stealing aid. GHF's aid plan has been criticised by UN agencies and established charities, which have refused to work with the new distribution system.  The UN and major aid groups said the aid plan violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory.  The IDF said in a statement that the GHF \"operate(s) independently in order to enable the distribution of aid to the Gazan residents - and not to Hamas\".  It also highlighted that Israeli troops were \"not preventing the arrival of Gazan civilians to the humanitarian aid distribution sites\". Israel has said it ultimately wants the UN to work through the GHF, which is using private US security and logistics groups to bring aid into Gaza for distribution by civilian teams at so-called secure distribution sites.  There have been repeated reports of Palestinians being killed near Rafah as they gathered at the aid distribution site to get desperately needed supplies. A spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights, Jeremy Laurence, said: \"For a third day running, people were killed around an aid distribution site run by the 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation'.\" Mr Laurence's office said the impediment of access to food and relief for civilians in Gaza may constitute a war crime, describing attacks on civilians trying to access food aid as \"unconscionable\". The alleged shooting comes just two days after reports that 31 people were killed as they walked to a distribution centre run by the GHF in the Rafah area. Witnesses said the deaths came after Israeli forces opened fire, while Palestinian and Hamas-linked media attributed the deaths they reported to an Israeli airstrike. The IDF later said its forces \"did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false\".  On Monday, three more Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was \"appalled\" by reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid. He called for an independent investigation and said: \"It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.\" The IDF said that three of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, in what appeared to be the deadliest attack on Israeli forces since the ceasefire with Hamas ended in March. Officials said the soldiers, all in their early 20s, died in northern Gaza, with Israeli media reporting that they were killed in an explosion in the Jabaliya area. Last week, Israel accepted a US-brokered ceasefire proposal, which would see the release over the course of a week of nine living hostages and half of the known hostages who have died. But Hamas said that it was seeking amendments to the proposed 60-day truce, offering 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners."

        "Content": "By Dan Whitehead, Sky correspondent, in Praia da Luz   Dense shrubs, empty barns, disused wells and dirt tracks - the police here have got their work cut out if they're to find evidence relating to Madeleine McCann's disappearance.  At 6am, before police cordons were put up, we spoke with an officer - a balaclava covering his face - manning one of the forensic tents. \"It's a large area,\" he told me. \"A different place will be searched each day.\" Gusty winds blow up dust on the dirt tracks. The land is used by dog walkers and hikers, and is sparsely populated. But as the crow flies, it's only a mile or so from where the three-year-old was last seen while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz in 2007. As we stood by the police van, out for his morning run was Tony Gallagher, a Brit who has lived within this new search area for 20 years. He remembers when it all happened. \"I know for a fact that they searched up here 20 years ago,\" he said. \"I'm not sure what they're hoping to find, because even locals were searching.\" It's one of the big unanswered questions: Just what intelligence is this latest search based on? Has someone come forward? \"It feels strange, you know,\" Tony adds. \"I think it will be for the people in Praia da Luz... because it had a whole negative impact there 20 years ago in terms of business and tourists coming and everything. \"And I hope for the locals that doesn't happen again.\"  At 9am, two vans and three cars arrived, all with German number plates. Inside, police - some in camouflage uniforms - were ready to begin the search. Police in Germany had asked officials in Portugal for access back in April, so this has been in the planning for weeks. Madeleine's disappearance is one of the most high-profile missing-person investigations in the world. It's why every new search brings the world's media. At one point, more than 20 journalists were broadcasting live alongside us, lining the road opposite the police. While this new search brings fresh hope, journalists and, more importantly, Kate and Gerry McCann have been here before, many times. Around two years ago, a dam about 45 minutes from here was searched, but nothing was found.

        "Content": "Elon Musk has criticised US President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it \"outrageous\" and a \"disgusting abomination\". The bill, which includes multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks, was passed by the House Republicans in May, and has been described by the president as a \"big, beautiful bill\". The tech billionaire hit out at the tax cuts on his platform X, writing: \"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" In American politics, \"pork\" is a political metaphor used when government spending is allocated to local projects, usually to benefit politicians' constituencies. Musk left the administration abruptly last week after working to cut costs with his team, the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency - known as DOGE - with the ambition of sacking federal workers and cutting red tape. \n                  Is Trump politicising an 'act of terrorism'?\n                 \n                  'Without a doubt': Why a former state department spokesperson believes Israel has committed war crimes \n                 \n                  Strategic Defence Review: UK 'moving to warfighting readiness' as it commits to build attack submarines\n                 The White House brushed Musk's comments aside, claiming they did not surprise the president. In a press conference on Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill\". She added: \"This is one, big, beautiful bill. \"And he's sticking to it.\" The White House on Tuesday asked Congress to cut back $9.4bn in already approved spending, taking money away from DOGE.  The billionaire tweeted: \"It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!!) and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.\" He also suggested voting out politicians who advanced the president's tax bill. \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\" Musk wrote in another X post. How Musk's mission to cut government spending fell flat Last Thursday, Musk revealed on X that his scheduled time as a \"special government employee\" was coming to an end. Before the news broke, Musk's father told Sky News his son was \"not a very good politician\". But speaking to Gillian Joseph on The World, Errol Musk insisted there was \"no rift between Elon and Donald Trump\". Musk's time at DOGE was controversial, with drastic cuts to America's humanitarian efforts sparking particular criticism. Questions have also been raised about whether the department has actually saved taxpayers as much money as suggested. Musk initially had ambitions to slash government spending by $2trn (£1.5trn) - but this was dramatically reduced to $1trn (£750bn) and then to just $150bn (£111bn). The 53-year-old, who famously brought his son X Æ A-12 to the Oval Office, also expressed frustration about resistance to his ideas and clashed with other senior members of the Trump administration. He recently told The Washington Post: \"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised. I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC to say the least.\" By law, status as a \"special government employee\" means he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which would have ended around 30 May."

Jillian added that when her family arrived in Albufeira, police told them they had spotted Mr Monks twice on CCTV footage walking around the residential area. The area where the 38-year-old was last seen had a lot of \"rough terrain\" - including rocky outcrops and cliffs - and was more than an hour's walk from the Albufeira Strip, where he was thought to have left his friends.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  A week today, Rachel Reeves presents the spending review; how the budget is divided between government departments between 2026 and 2029 - the bulk of this parliament.  It's a foundational moment for this government - and a key to determining the success of this administration. UK exempt from Trump's latest tariff hike: politics latest So, what's going to happen? The chancellor did boost spending significantly in her first year, and this year there was a modest rise. However, the uplift to day-to-day spending in the years ahead is more modest - and pared back further in March's spring statement because of adverse financial conditions. Plus, where will the £113bn of capital - project - spending go? So, we've done a novel experiment. We've taken Treasury documents, ministerial statements and reports from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. We put them all into AI - into the deep research function of ChatGPT - and asked it to write the spending review, calculate the winners and losers and work out what goes where, and why. It comes with a health warning. We're using experimental technology that is sometimes wrong, and while ChatGPT can access up-to-date data from across the web, it's only trained on information up to October 2023. There are no answers because discussions are still going on. Think of it like a polling projection - clues about the big picture as things move underneath. But, critically, the story it tells tallies with the narrative I'm hearing from inside government too. The winners? Defence, health and transport, with Angela Rayner's housing department up as well. Everywhere else is down, compared with this year's spending settlement. The Home Office, justice, culture, and business - facing real terms squeezes from here on in. The aid budget from the Foreign Office, slashed - the Ministry of Defence the beneficiary. You heard about that this week. Health - a Labour priority. I heard from sources a settlement of around 3%. This AI model puts it just above. Transport - a surprise winner. Rachel Reeves thinks this is where her capital budget should go. Projects in the north to help hold voters who live there. But, could this spell trouble? More from Sky News:Who is the public's favourite minister?Chancellor threatens to sue Abramovich Education - down overall. Now this government will protect the schools budget. It will say 'per pupil' funding is up. But adult education is at risk. Is this where they find the savings? So much else - Home Office down, but is that because asylum costs are going down. Energy - they're haggling over solar panels versus home insulation. Justice should get what it wants, I am told. This isn't about exact percentages. But you can see across lots of departments - things are tight. Even though Rachel Reeves has already set the budgets for last year and this, and only needs to decide spending allocations from 2026 onwards, the graphs the Treasury will produce next week compare what will be spent to the last set of Tory plans. This means their graphs will include the big spending increases they made last year - and flatter them more. They'll say that's fair enough, others will disagree. But in the end, will it be enough for public services?"

        "Content": " The family of the man accused of throwing petrol bombs at a pro-Israel group in Colorado have been taken into custody. Immigration officers detained Mohamed Soliman's relatives, believed to be his wife and five children. Soliman, an Egyptian national, moved to the US three years ago and lived in Colorado Springs but was there illegally after his visa and work authorisation expired. He reportedly has two teenage children and three younger children. \"We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,\" said homeland security secretary Kristi Noem on X. Soliman, 45, is being held after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a group doing a walk for Israeli hostages in Boulder on Sunday. The attacker allegedly yelled \"Free Palestine\" and had a total of 18 petrol bombs - but police said he \"got scared\" and only tossed a couple. Soliman also had a makeshift flamethrower in the form of gas in a backpack sprayer, according to a FBI statement, but told investigators he did not use it. Twelve people were injured, authorities said. The victims were aged between 52 and 88 and three of them were still being treated in hospital on Tuesday. Soliman was allegedly dressed as a gardener to get as close as he could to the small group. Authorities said he told them he had no regrets. He has been charged with a hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder in federal and state cases. Court papers said he planned the attack for a year and told authorities that no one, including his family, was aware of the plot. An FBI statement said Soliman left an iPhone hidden in a drawer at his home with messages for his family but that his wife handed it to police. The family are said to be cooperating with investigators. Soliman admitted taking gun training to try to get a permit but was denied as he wasn't a US citizen, according to police and the FBI. Barred from buying a firearm, he allegedly used YouTube to learn how to make petrol bombs.

The incident follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC last month. Tensions are simmering in the US over Israel's war in Gaza. There has been an increase in antisemitic hate crime, as well as moves by some supporters of Israel to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic."

Four-year-old Sofia, whose real name we are not using, is being treated at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

Sofia was born with short bowel syndrome, a debilitating life-threatening condition. She and her mother, Deysi, entered the US legally in July 2023 and were granted humanitarian parole to access medical care for two years.

Her mother has now received an approval notice for humanitarian parole for another year. The move will be a relief for Deysi, who said she had \"so much anxiety\" over whether they would be deported and her daughter's life put at risk. \"It's always in my mind that my daughter can die,\" she said. \"It may not sound real, but it is really what will happen if my daughter is not connected to her treatment.\" Read more from Sky News:Colorado attack suspect's wife and children detainedMusk calls Trump-backed tax bill 'disgusting abomination' The Department of Homeland Security said in a previous statement that claims the family were being deported were false. \"This family applied for humanitarian parole on May 14, 2025, and the application is still being considered,\" it said. A tough stance on immigration is one of Donald Trump's key policies and popular with his voters, but has been criticised for being too harsh and indiscriminate."

        "Content": "A foot scanner that uses AI to recognise the warning signs of heart failure could be used at home to keep people out of hospital, researchers have said. The device takes and analyses almost 2,000 pictures a minute, in a similar manner to facial recognition, to calculate the level of fluid in the feet and ankles. Such water retention, known as oedema, is one of three major warning signs heart failure is becoming more severe and potentially life threatening. The AI scanner is roughly the size of a smart speaker and can alert healthcare professionals so they can take action, such as increasing the patient's medication. The device, developed by Cambridge-based start-up Heartfelt Technologies, is mounted to the wall and typically installed at a patient's bedside. It automatically takes 1,800 pictures a minute of the foot and lower leg and multiple angles, only scanning the legs to a height of 50cm off the floor, and then uses AI to calculate the level of fluid they contain. It also works without wifi. The Foot Study, which is being presented at the British Cardiovascular Society annual conference in Manchester, suggests the alerts come 13 days before a person would end up in hospital. \n                  Voiceover artist Gayanne Potter urging ScotRail to remove her voice from new AI announcements\n                 \n                  Mum can continue lawsuit against AI chatbot firm she holds responsible for son's death\n                 \n                  Former spy chief on Gaza, China, and cyber warfare\n                 It used the AI device to monitor 26 heart failure patients from five NHS trusts who were enrolled between 2020 and 2022 and asked them to weigh themselves using Bluetooth-enabled scales. Seven instances of worsening heart failure were detected in six patients, while one death from the condition was recorded. Researchers found in patients enrolled in the study for at least two weeks before an alert was triggered, the average lead time before hospital admission was 13 days. The lead time averaged eight days when all five triggers picked up by the device were analysed. The study also found monitoring using scales failed to predict any heart failure-related hospital admissions, with researchers suggesting this was because patients struggled to stick to tracking their weight, whereas the AI device did not require any action. The early warning provided by the device could allow specialist staff to react quickly to changes in a patient's condition, potentially allowing them to stay out of hospital. Dr Philip Keeling, senior author of the study and a consultant cardiologist at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"Only about half of people admitted to hospital with heart failure currently get assigned an early review by a heart failure nurse who can check to see if they are suffering a harmful build-up of fluid because their heart is not working properly. \"Amid a shortage of heart failure nurses, a device like this can be like a virtual nurse, tracking people's health.\" Heart failure is a long-term condition where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly, typically because it has become too weak or stiff, and is estimated to affect 920,000 people in the UK. The three main symptoms indicating the condition is getting worse are increased breathlessness, weight gain and swelling in the legs or ankles. Discussing the findings, Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: \"This small study suggests a simple device could significantly improve outcomes for at-risk patients with heart failure by keeping them out of hospital. \"This study is a good example of how technology might aid earlier interventions and treatment, by allowing people to track a key sign of their heart health at home.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Voters in South Lanarkshire will go to the polls on Thursday to elect a new MSP for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. The by-election comes following the death of SNP government minister Christina McKelvie. The contest takes place less than a year before the Scottish parliament election, with the result potentially offering a snapshot of how the political landscape north of the border will look in 2026. The SNP will be seeking to hold on to the seat, given the heavy losses to Labour at last year's UK general election. However, all eyes are on Reform UK and whether it will enjoy a \"tartan bounce\" following the party's recent slew of local election wins in England. Campaigning has been heated, with Reform UK accused of running a \"racist\" ad on Facebook against Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has continued to double down, accusing his rival of \"sectarian politics\". \n                  Tube fare dodgers and Robert Jenrick clash at Stratford station - as he chases them at barriers for social media video\n                 \n                  'She's a goner': Dominic Cummings predicts timing of Kemi Badenoch's downfall\n                 \n                  Post-Brexit EU reset negotiations 'going to the wire', says minister\n                 In response, the Scottish Labour MSP has branded Mr Farage a \"poisonous little man\" and \"chief clown\", while SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney said: \"He poses a threat to our values and must be stopped.\" But who will come out on top following Thursday's vote? Here are the candidates vying for support: Collette Bradley, Scottish Socialist Party  Scottish Socialist Party candidate Collette Bradley told Sky News that locals she has met while out campaigning have been angry about \"poverty, inequality and Labour's attacks on welfare, our NHS and services\". She added: \"They have little faith in Labour or the SNP delivering change. \"We've offered hope with our unique policy of a socialist MSP who'll remain on the average worker's wage, keeping us firmly in step with constituents' living conditions - we alone reject the corrupting influence of the £75,000 MSP salary. \"We're offering concrete socialist alternatives to the miserable status quo - redistribution of wealth from the millionaires to the millions via progressive taxation.\" Ms Bradley said the party stands for a society built around the \"needs of people, not profit\". She added: \"Ordinary lives can be transformed with measures like a £15-an-hour minimum wage; free public transport; and investment in jobs, wages, quality council housing, NHS, education, welfare and pensions. \"We urge voters to reject the continued failure of the political mainstream and be bolder in their demands by voting Scottish Socialist.\" Andy Brady, Scottish Family Party Candidate Andy Brady told Sky News that Scottish Family Party policies and principles are \"built upon honesty, integrity and a passion to see real change in our nation\". He said: \"My time spent speaking to the locals over the past several weeks has revealed a common response - people are fed up being let down.\" Mr Brady said there had been \"failed promises\" to help local businesses, to repair the roads, and to bring life to the town centres and high streets. He said: \"The general feeling is that communities are feeling jaded and frustrated.\" Urging voters to back the Scottish Family Party, he added: \"We value the families, businesses and the education of our local communities and if we can support them, communities will flourish.\" Ross Lambie, Reform UK South Lanarkshire councillor Ross Lambie is hoping to bring Reform UK's \"turquoise tide\" to Scotland. If Mr Farage's party wins, it will put Scotland's first minister on notice ahead of Holyrood 2026. Mr Lambie, who defected from the Scottish Conservatives, told Sky News: \"It's been refreshing spending the past five or so weeks out on the doors in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"What's been very clear is that people everywhere are fed up, angry and scunnered with the entire Scottish political establishment. \"They're fed up with SNP, Tory and Labour lies and are looking for hope. \"Reform UK is offering people a chance of real and radical change by cutting tax, scrapping net zero, ending wokery and fighting for common sense. \"This is now a clear fight between the SNP and Reform - it's that simple.\" Katy Loudon, Scottish National Party South Lanarkshire councillor Katy Loudon is hoping to retain the seat for the SNP. The former teacher told Sky News she had been speaking to people across the region \"about what matters to them\". She said: \"People understandably feel let down by Labour.\" Ms Loudon highlighted the UK government's axing of the universal winter fuel payment, which led to the Scottish government following suit before a partial U-turn. Scottish Labour-run South Lanarkshire Council also intends to reduce its school transport provision, which Ms Loudon said will affect thousands of children. She added: \"The Labour Party has lost its way, Farage is on the rise as a result. With an invisible candidate, they've totally given up in this by-election. \"Meanwhile, the SNP is focusing on what matters to people and taking action to make things better - with record investment in our NHS, bringing back the winter fuel payment, scrapping peak rail fares and ending Labour's two-child cap. \"Labour know they can't win. Only the SNP can beat Farage on 5 June.\" Janice MacKay, UK Independence Party UKIP candidate Janice MacKay told Sky News that her party would abolish the Scottish parliament if given the opportunity. Speaking of \"widespread disillusionment\" amongst voters, she added: \"UKIP offer something different. \"We wish to radically reduce the number of inadequate politicians in Scotland by abolishing altogether the Holyrood parliament. \"It is merely a glorified and expensive form of local authority. To that end, it is unnecessary.\" Ms MacKay believes the nation's 32 local authorities should be given \"strengthened powers\", with Westminster making the \"main decisions\" affecting the UK. Ms MacKay added: \"Were UKIP to win any seats in the Holyrood talking shop, we should donate 40% of our MSP salary to a Scottish veterans charity.\" Ann McGuinness, Scottish Green Party Scottish Green Party candidate Ann McGuinness is the director of a charity which promotes rural connections and champions rural diversity. The mother-of-two says her own lived experiences of poverty and disability provide her with \"valuable insight\" into the challenges faced by many whose voices are often unheard in the public discourse. She has been described by her party as a \"dedicated feminist and environmental justice campaigner\". As well as promoting climate education, Ms McGuinness is also said to have a \"strong track record of working across party lines to support women in politics\". Ms McGuinness said: \"Every vote for the Scottish Greens will be a positive vote for a fairer and greener Scotland and a brighter future for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"If we are to build a truly just and green future, we need to empower every town and village and ensure that no one is left behind.\" Aisha Mir, Scottish Liberal Democrats Scottish Liberal Democrats candidate Aisha Mir told Sky News she has entered politics to \"get things done\". She added: \"For too many people, it feels like nothing works anymore. \"The SNP have failed Scotland for 18 years. The Conservatives are lurching to extremes. Labour are already letting people down. Reform have no real solutions. \"I want to be a hard-working local champion who will put your priorities first.\" Ms Mir said her party offers a vision of Scotland \"that is back to its best\". She added: \"A Scotland where people can see a GP and an NHS dentist in good time. A Scotland that once again gives our children a world-class education. \"A Scotland with a growing economy and growing businesses, where the government looks after your money and works with our neighbours. \"Vote Scottish Liberal Democrats for a candidate who is focused on what really matters to you.\" Richard Nelson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Scottish Conservatives candidate Richard Nelson told Sky News he got into politics \"to make a difference\". The South Lanarkshire councillor and NHS worker said: \"People across this constituency want politicians to be focused on what really matters to them rather than left-wing politicians focusing on their fringe obsessions.\" Mr Nelson said he has seen \"first-hand as an NHS employee the damage the SNP have done to the health service during their 18 years in power\". He added: \"My wife disgracefully had to spend 50 hours on a trolley in A&E recently due to the SNP's neglect of frontline care. \"If people in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse want to have an MSP who will stand up for those who just want politicians to show some common sense for a change, then you should vote for myself and the Scottish Conservatives on Thursday.\" Davy Russell, Scottish Labour Party Scottish Labour candidate Davy Russell told Sky News he has seen \"first-hand the damage the SNP has done\" to the community after almost two decades in power. He said: \"Throughout this campaign, I have been speaking to people who are feeling abandoned by this SNP government. \"People are languishing on long NHS waiting lists, worried about the state of our schools, and sick of seeing our high streets decline - but this is not as good as it gets. \"The SNP don't deserve to win here, and the divisive politics of Reform cannot win. This by-election is a straight choice between more of the same SNP failure or a new direction with Scottish Labour.\" Mr Russell vowed to \"fight tirelessly for the community I love\" if he wins. He added: \"I will stand firmly against the downgrading of the Wishaw Neonatal Unit, campaign for an end to SNP cuts to our local services, and demand real action to tackle the crisis in our NHS. \"This is a chance to not only select a local champion for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, but to begin to chart a new direction for the whole of Scotland.\" Marc Wilkinson, Independent Marc Wilkinson, a pizza shop owner from the Scottish capital, is the leader of the Edinburgh People party. The businessman is also behind the South Scotland People party, which is part of a bid to establish regional parties across the nation for the Holyrood list vote next year. Mr Wilkinson's aim is for \"the people of Scotland to choose to vote for themselves\". Pledging to take instruction directly from the constituents if he were to win the upcoming by-election, he added: \"Elect me and you will be my boss. Don't choose protest. Choose progress.\""

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  \"We've got two,\" explains Emer Szczygiel, emergency department head of nursing at King George Hospital, as she walks inside a pastel coloured room.   \"If I had my time back again, we would probably have four, five, or six because these have helped us so much in the department with the really difficult patients.\" On one wall, there's floral wallpaper. It is scored through with a graffiti scrawl. The words must have been scratched out with fingernails. There are no other implements in here. Patients being held in this secure room would have been searched to make sure they are not carrying anything they can use to harm themselves - or others. There is a plastic bed secured to the wall. No bedding though, as this room is \"ligature light\", meaning nothing in here could be used for self harm. On the ceiling, there is CCTV that feeds into a control room on another part of the Ilford hospital's sprawling grounds. \"So this is one of two rooms that when we were undergoing our works, we recognised, about three years ago, mental health was causing us more of an issue, so we've had two rooms purpose built,\" Emer says. \"They're as compliant as we can get them with a mental health room - they're ligature light, as opposed to ligature free. They're under 24-hour CCTV surveillance.\" There are two doors, both heavily reinforced. One can be used by staff to make an emergency escape if they are under any threat. What is unusual about these rooms is that they are built right inside a busy accident and emergency department. The doors are just feet away from a nurse's station, where medical staff are trying to deal with acute ED (emergency department) attendances. The number of mental health patients in a crisis attending A&E has reached crisis levels. Some will be experiencing psychotic episodes and are potentially violent, presenting a threat to themselves, other patients, clinical staff and security teams deployed to de-escalate the situation. Like physically-ill patients, they require the most urgent care but are now facing some of the longest waits on record. On a fairly quiet Wednesday morning, the ED team is already managing five mental health patients. One, a diminutive South Asian woman, is screaming hysterically. She is clearly very agitated and becoming more distressed by the minute. Despite her size, she is surrounded by at least five security guards. She has been here for 12 hours and wants to leave, but can't as she's being held under the Mental Capacity Act. Her frustration boils over as she pushes against the chests of the security guards who encircle her. \"We see about 150 to 200 patients a day through this emergency department, but we're getting on average about 15 to 20 mental health presentations to the department,\" Emer explains. \"Some of these patients can be really difficult to manage and really complex.\" \"If a patient's in crisis and wants to harm themselves, there's lots of things in this area that you can harm yourself with,\" the nurse adds. \"It's trying to balance that risk and make sure every emergency department in the country is deemed a place of safety. But there is a lot of risk that comes with emergency departments, because they're not purposeful for mental health patients.\" In a small side room, Ajay Kumar and his wife are waiting patiently by their son's bedside. He's experienced psychotic episodes since starting university in 2018 and his father says he can become unpredictable and violent. Ajay says his son \"is under a section three order - that means six months in hospital\". \"They sectioned him,\" he tells us. \"He should be secure now, he shouldn't go out in public. Last night he ran away [from hospital] and walked all the way home. It took him four and a half hours to come home. \"I mean, he got three and a half hours away. Even though he's totally mental, he still finds his way home and he was so tired and the police were looking for him.\" Now they are all back in hospital and could be waiting \"for days\", Ajay says. \"I don't know how many. They're not telling us anything.\" Matthew Trainer, chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, is at pains to stress nobody is blaming the patients. \"We've seen, particularly over the last few years, a real increase in the number of people in mental health crisis coming into A&E for support,\" he says. \"And I don't know if this is because of the pandemic or wider economic pressures, but what we're seeing every day is more and more people coming here as their first port of call.\" The hospital boss adds: \"If you get someone who's really distressed, someone who is perhaps experiencing psychosis etc, I'm seeing increasing numbers of complaints from other patients and their families about the environment they've had to wait in. \"And they're not blaming the mental health patients for being here. \"But what they're saying is being in a really busy accident & emergency with ambulances, with somebody highly distressed, and you're sat there with an elderly relative or a sick child or whatever - it's hard for everyone. \"There's no blame in this. It's something we've got to work together to try to fix.\" New Freedom of Information data gathered by the Royal College of Nursing shows that over the last five years, more than 1.3 million people in a mental health crisis presented to A&E departments. That's expected to be a significant underestimate however, as only around a quarter of English trusts handed over data. For these patients, waits of 12 hours or more for a mental health bed have increased by more than 380%. Over the last decade, the number of overnight beds in mental health units declined by almost 3,700. That's around 17%. The Department for Health and Social Care told Sky News: \"We know people with mental health issues are not always getting the support or care they deserve and incidents like this are unacceptable. \"We are transforming mental health services - including investing £26m to support people in mental health crisis, hiring more staff, delivering more talking therapies, and getting waiting lists down through our Plan for Change.\" Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, also told Sky News: \"While we know there is much more to do to deal with record demand including on waits, if a patient is deemed to need support in A&E, almost all emergency departments now have a psychiatric liaison team available 24/7 so people can get specialist mental health support alongside physical treatment. \"The NHS is working with local authorities to ensure that mental health patients are given support to leave hospital as soon as they are ready, so that space can be freed up across hospitals including A&Es.\" Patients in a mental health crisis and attending hospital are stuck between two failing systems. A shortage of specialist beds means they are left untreated in a hospital not designed to help them. And they are failed by a social care network overwhelmed by demand and unable to provide the early intervention care needed."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  The UK will be forced to agree this month to increase defence spending to 3.5% of national income within a decade as part of a NATO push to rearm and keep the US on side, Sky News understands. The certainty of a major policy shift means there is bemusement in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) about why Sir Keir Starmer's government has tied itself in knots over whether to describe an earlier plan to hit 3% of GDP by the 2030s as an ambition or a commitment, when it is about to change. The problem is seen as political, with the prime minister needing to balance warfare against welfare - more money for bombs and bullets or for winter fuel payments and childcare. Follow live updates: Does the UK need an 'Iron Dome' system? Sir Keir is due to hold a discussion to decide on the defence spending target as early as today, it is understood. As well as a rise in pure defence spending to 3.5% by 2035, he will also likely be forced to commit a further 1.5% of GDP to defence-related areas such as spy agencies and infrastructure. Militaries need roads, railway networks, and airports to deploy at speed. This would bolster total broader defence spending to 5% - a target Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, wants all allies to sign up to at a major summit in the Netherlands later this month. It is being referred to as the \"Hague investment plan\". Asked what would happen at the summit, a defence source said: \"3.5% without a doubt.\" Yet the prime minister reiterated the 3% ambition when he published a major defence review on Monday that placed \"NATO first\" at the heart of UK defence policy.  The defence source said: \"How can you have a defence review that says NATO first\" and then be among the last of the alliance's 32 member states - along with countries like Spain - to back this new goal? Unlike Madrid, London presents itself as the leading European nation in the alliance. A British commander is always the deputy supreme allied commander in Europe - the second most senior operational military officer - under an American commander, while the UK's nuclear weapons are committed to defending the whole of NATO. Even Germany, which has a track record of weak defence spending despite boasting the largest economy, has recently signalled it plans to move investment towards the 5% level, while Canada, also previously feeble, is making similar noises.  The source signalled it was inconceivable the UK would not follow suit and said officials across Whitehall understand the spending target will rise to 3.5%. The source said it would be met by 2035, so three years later than the timeline Mr Rutte has proposed. Defence spending is currently at 2.3%. A second defence source said the UK has to commit to this spending target, \"or else we can no longer call ourselves a leader within NATO\". NATO, as an alliance, cannot force any member state to take a particular decision. But the UK's desire to remain a leading member coupled with the reality that most other allies are agreeing to increase defence spending in line with Mr Rutte's new target is what will force London to act, the defence sources said. George Robertson, former NATO secretary general from 1999 to 2003, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on the Politics Hub 3.5% is \"a little bit beyond\" what most countries are capable of. \"I think 3.5% is beyond Italy, Spain, Portugal, who are all under 2% at the moment, Canada, which is at 1.1% - there's a degree of unrealism about it which encourages people to fake the truth,\" he said. \"In any event, we should be focusing on what the money has been spent on, not the quantity of money itself.\"  Read more:UK to build weapons factoriesRussian-linked hackers targeted MoD Sky News's political editor Beth Rigby challenged the prime minister on the discrepancy between his spending ambitions and those of his allies at a press conference on Monday. Sir Keir seemed to hint change might be coming. \"Of course, there are discussions about what the contribution should be going into the NATO conference in two or three weeks' time,\" he said. \"But that conference is much more about what sort of NATO will be capable of being as effective in the future as it's been in the last 80 years. It is a vital conversation that we do need to have, and we are right at the heart of that.\" New Sky News podcast launches on 10 June - The Wargame simulates an attack by Russia to test UK defences Mr Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, said last week he assumes alliance members will agree to a broad defence spending target of 5% of gross domestic product during the summit in The Hague on 24 and 25 June. NATO can only act if all member states agree. \"Let's say that this 5%, but I will not say what is the individual breakup, but it will be considerably north of 3% when it comes to the hard spend [on defence], and it will be also a target on defence-related spending,\" the secretary general said. The call for more funding comes at a time when allies are warning of growing threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea as well as challenges posed by China. But it also comes as European member states need to make NATO membership seem like a good deal for Donald Trump. The leaders of all allies will meet in The Hague for the two-day summit. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 The US president has repeatedly criticised other member states for failing to meet a current target of spending 2% of national income on defence and has warned the United States would not come to the aid of any nation that is falling short. Since returning to the White House, he has called for European countries to allocate 5% of their GDP to defence. This is more than the 3.4% of GDP currently spent by the US. Mr Rutte is being credited with squaring away a new deal with Mr Trump in a meeting that would see allies increase their defence spending in line with the US president's wishes. The NATO chief is due to visit London on Monday, it is understood."

        "Content": "By Dan Whitehead, Sky correspondent, in Praia da Luz   Dense shrubs, empty barns, disused wells and dirt tracks - the police here have got their work cut out if they're to find evidence relating to Madeleine McCann's disappearance.  At 6am, before police cordons were put up, we spoke with an officer - a balaclava covering his face - manning one of the forensic tents. \"It's a large area,\" he told me. \"A different place will be searched each day.\" Gusty winds blow up dust on the dirt tracks. The land is used by dog walkers and hikers, and is sparsely populated. But as the crow flies, it's only a mile or so from where the three-year-old was last seen while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz in 2007. As we stood by the police van, out for his morning run was Tony Gallagher, a Brit who has lived within this new search area for 20 years. He remembers when it all happened. \"I know for a fact that they searched up here 20 years ago,\" he said. \"I'm not sure what they're hoping to find, because even locals were searching.\" It's one of the big unanswered questions: Just what intelligence is this latest search based on? Has someone come forward? \"It feels strange, you know,\" Tony adds. \"I think it will be for the people in Praia da Luz... because it had a whole negative impact there 20 years ago in terms of business and tourists coming and everything. \"And I hope for the locals that doesn't happen again.\"  At 9am, two vans and three cars arrived, all with German number plates. Inside, police - some in camouflage uniforms - were ready to begin the search. Police in Germany had asked officials in Portugal for access back in April, so this has been in the planning for weeks. Madeleine's disappearance is one of the most high-profile missing-person investigations in the world. It's why every new search brings the world's media. At one point, more than 20 journalists were broadcasting live alongside us, lining the road opposite the police. While this new search brings fresh hope, journalists and, more importantly, Kate and Gerry McCann have been here before, many times. Around two years ago, a dam about 45 minutes from here was searched, but nothing was found. Read more:New search for Maddie could be 'last throw of dice'What we know about new searchesMcCanns remember daughter on anniversary of disappearance In May, on the anniversary of these tragic events, her parents said they will leave \"no stone unturned\" in the search for their daughter.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  A week today, Rachel Reeves presents the spending review; how the budget is divided between government departments between 2026 and 2029 - the bulk of this parliament.  It's a foundational moment for this government - and a key to determining the success of this administration. UK exempt from Trump's latest tariff hike: politics latest So, what's going to happen? The chancellor did boost spending significantly in her first year, and this year there was a modest rise. However, the uplift to day-to-day spending in the years ahead is more modest - and pared back further in March's spring statement because of adverse financial conditions. Plus, where will the £113bn of capital - project - spending go? So, we've done a novel experiment. We've taken Treasury documents, ministerial statements and reports from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. We put them all into AI - into the deep research function of ChatGPT - and asked it to write the spending review, calculate the winners and losers and work out what goes where, and why. It comes with a health warning. We're using experimental technology that is sometimes wrong, and while ChatGPT can access up-to-date data from across the web, it's only trained on information up to October 2023. There are no answers because discussions are still going on. Think of it like a polling projection - clues about the big picture as things move underneath. But, critically, the story it tells tallies with the narrative I'm hearing from inside government too. The winners? Defence, health and transport, with Angela Rayner's housing department up as well. Everywhere else is down, compared with this year's spending settlement. The Home Office, justice, culture, and business - facing real terms squeezes from here on in. The aid budget from the Foreign Office, slashed - the Ministry of Defence the beneficiary. You heard about that this week. Health - a Labour priority. I heard from sources a settlement of around 3%. This AI model puts it just above. Transport - a surprise winner. Rachel Reeves thinks this is where her capital budget should go. Projects in the north to help hold voters who live there. But, could this spell trouble? More from Sky News:Who is the public's favourite minister?Chancellor threatens to sue Abramovich Education - down overall. Now this government will protect the schools budget. It will say 'per pupil' funding is up. But adult education is at risk. Is this where they find the savings? So much else - Home Office down, but is that because asylum costs are going down. Energy - they're haggling over solar panels versus home insulation. Justice should get what it wants, I am told. This isn't about exact percentages. But you can see across lots of departments - things are tight. Even though Rachel Reeves has already set the budgets for last year and this, and only needs to decide spending allocations from 2026 onwards, the graphs the Treasury will produce next week compare what will be spent to the last set of Tory plans. This means their graphs will include the big spending increases they made last year - and flatter them more. They'll say that's fair enough, others will disagree. But in the end, will it be enough for public services?"

The by-election comes following the death of SNP government minister Christina McKelvie. The contest takes place less than a year before the Scottish parliament election, with the result potentially offering a snapshot of how the political landscape north of the border will look in 2026. The SNP will be seeking to hold on to the seat, given the heavy losses to Labour at last year's UK general election. However, all eyes are on Reform UK and whether it will enjoy a \"tartan bounce\" following the party's recent slew of local election wins in England. Campaigning has been heated, with Reform UK accused of running a \"racist\" ad on Facebook against Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has continued to double down, accusing his rival of \"sectarian politics\". \n                  Tube fare dodgers and Robert Jenrick clash at Stratford station - as he chases them at barriers for social media video\n                 \n                  'She's a goner': Dominic Cummings predicts timing of Kemi Badenoch's downfall\n                 \n                  Post-Brexit EU reset negotiations 'going to the wire', says minister\n                 In response, the Scottish Labour MSP has branded Mr Farage a \"poisonous little man\" and \"chief clown\", while SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney said: \"He poses a threat to our values and must be stopped.\" But who will come out on top following Thursday's vote? Here are the candidates vying for support: Collette Bradley, Scottish Socialist Party  Scottish Socialist Party candidate Collette Bradley told Sky News that locals she has met while out campaigning have been angry about \"poverty, inequality and Labour's attacks on welfare, our NHS and services\". She added: \"They have little faith in Labour or the SNP delivering change. \"We've offered hope with our unique policy of a socialist MSP who'll remain on the average worker's wage, keeping us firmly in step with constituents' living conditions - we alone reject the corrupting influence of the £75,000 MSP salary. \"We're offering concrete socialist alternatives to the miserable status quo - redistribution of wealth from the millionaires to the millions via progressive taxation.\" Ms Bradley said the party stands for a society built around the \"needs of people, not profit\". She added: \"Ordinary lives can be transformed with measures like a £15-an-hour minimum wage; free public transport; and investment in jobs, wages, quality council housing, NHS, education, welfare and pensions. \"We urge voters to reject the continued failure of the political mainstream and be bolder in their demands by voting Scottish Socialist.\" Andy Brady, Scottish Family Party Candidate Andy Brady told Sky News that Scottish Family Party policies and principles are \"built upon honesty, integrity and a passion to see real change in our nation\". He said: \"My time spent speaking to the locals over the past several weeks has revealed a common response - people are fed up being let down.\" Mr Brady said there had been \"failed promises\" to help local businesses, to repair the roads, and to bring life to the town centres and high streets. He said: \"The general feeling is that communities are feeling jaded and frustrated.\" Urging voters to back the Scottish Family Party, he added: \"We value the families, businesses and the education of our local communities and if we can support them, communities will flourish.\" Ross Lambie, Reform UK South Lanarkshire councillor Ross Lambie is hoping to bring Reform UK's \"turquoise tide\" to Scotland. If Mr Farage's party wins, it will put Scotland's first minister on notice ahead of Holyrood 2026. Mr Lambie, who defected from the Scottish Conservatives, told Sky News: \"It's been refreshing spending the past five or so weeks out on the doors in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"What's been very clear is that people everywhere are fed up, angry and scunnered with the entire Scottish political establishment. \"They're fed up with SNP, Tory and Labour lies and are looking for hope. \"Reform UK is offering people a chance of real and radical change by cutting tax, scrapping net zero, ending wokery and fighting for common sense. \"This is now a clear fight between the SNP and Reform - it's that simple.\" Katy Loudon, Scottish National Party South Lanarkshire councillor Katy Loudon is hoping to retain the seat for the SNP. The former teacher told Sky News she had been speaking to people across the region \"about what matters to them\". She said: \"People understandably feel let down by Labour.\" Ms Loudon highlighted the UK government's axing of the universal winter fuel payment, which led to the Scottish government following suit before a partial U-turn. Scottish Labour-run South Lanarkshire Council also intends to reduce its school transport provision, which Ms Loudon said will affect thousands of children. She added: \"The Labour Party has lost its way, Farage is on the rise as a result. With an invisible candidate, they've totally given up in this by-election. \"Meanwhile, the SNP is focusing on what matters to people and taking action to make things better - with record investment in our NHS, bringing back the winter fuel payment, scrapping peak rail fares and ending Labour's two-child cap. \"Labour know they can't win. Only the SNP can beat Farage on 5 June.\" Janice MacKay, UK Independence Party UKIP candidate Janice MacKay told Sky News that her party would abolish the Scottish parliament if given the opportunity. Speaking of \"widespread disillusionment\" amongst voters, she added: \"UKIP offer something different. \"We wish to radically reduce the number of inadequate politicians in Scotland by abolishing altogether the Holyrood parliament. \"It is merely a glorified and expensive form of local authority. To that end, it is unnecessary.\" Ms MacKay believes the nation's 32 local authorities should be given \"strengthened powers\", with Westminster making the \"main decisions\" affecting the UK. Ms MacKay added: \"Were UKIP to win any seats in the Holyrood talking shop, we should donate 40% of our MSP salary to a Scottish veterans charity.\" Ann McGuinness, Scottish Green Party Scottish Green Party candidate Ann McGuinness is the director of a charity which promotes rural connections and champions rural diversity. The mother-of-two says her own lived experiences of poverty and disability provide her with \"valuable insight\" into the challenges faced by many whose voices are often unheard in the public discourse. She has been described by her party as a \"dedicated feminist and environmental justice campaigner\". As well as promoting climate education, Ms McGuinness is also said to have a \"strong track record of working across party lines to support women in politics\". Ms McGuinness said: \"Every vote for the Scottish Greens will be a positive vote for a fairer and greener Scotland and a brighter future for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"If we are to build a truly just and green future, we need to empower every town and village and ensure that no one is left behind.\" Aisha Mir, Scottish Liberal Democrats Scottish Liberal Democrats candidate Aisha Mir told Sky News she has entered politics to \"get things done\". She added: \"For too many people, it feels like nothing works anymore. \"The SNP have failed Scotland for 18 years. The Conservatives are lurching to extremes. Labour are already letting people down. Reform have no real solutions. \"I want to be a hard-working local champion who will put your priorities first.\" Ms Mir said her party offers a vision of Scotland \"that is back to its best\". She added: \"A Scotland where people can see a GP and an NHS dentist in good time. A Scotland that once again gives our children a world-class education. \"A Scotland with a growing economy and growing businesses, where the government looks after your money and works with our neighbours. \"Vote Scottish Liberal Democrats for a candidate who is focused on what really matters to you.\" Richard Nelson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Scottish Conservatives candidate Richard Nelson told Sky News he got into politics \"to make a difference\". The South Lanarkshire councillor and NHS worker said: \"People across this constituency want politicians to be focused on what really matters to them rather than left-wing politicians focusing on their fringe obsessions.\" Mr Nelson said he has seen \"first-hand as an NHS employee the damage the SNP have done to the health service during their 18 years in power\". He added: \"My wife disgracefully had to spend 50 hours on a trolley in A&E recently due to the SNP's neglect of frontline care. \"If people in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse want to have an MSP who will stand up for those who just want politicians to show some common sense for a change, then you should vote for myself and the Scottish Conservatives on Thursday.\" Davy Russell, Scottish Labour Party Scottish Labour candidate Davy Russell told Sky News he has seen \"first-hand the damage the SNP has done\" to the community after almost two decades in power. He said: \"Throughout this campaign, I have been speaking to people who are feeling abandoned by this SNP government. \"People are languishing on long NHS waiting lists, worried about the state of our schools, and sick of seeing our high streets decline - but this is not as good as it gets. \"The SNP don't deserve to win here, and the divisive politics of Reform cannot win. This by-election is a straight choice between more of the same SNP failure or a new direction with Scottish Labour.\" Mr Russell vowed to \"fight tirelessly for the community I love\" if he wins. He added: \"I will stand firmly against the downgrading of the Wishaw Neonatal Unit, campaign for an end to SNP cuts to our local services, and demand real action to tackle the crisis in our NHS. \"This is a chance to not only select a local champion for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, but to begin to chart a new direction for the whole of Scotland.\" Marc Wilkinson, Independent Marc Wilkinson, a pizza shop owner from the Scottish capital, is the leader of the Edinburgh People party. The businessman is also behind the South Scotland People party, which is part of a bid to establish regional parties across the nation for the Holyrood list vote next year. Mr Wilkinson's aim is for \"the people of Scotland to choose to vote for themselves\". Pledging to take instruction directly from the constituents if he were to win the upcoming by-election, he added: \"Elect me and you will be my boss. Don't choose protest. Choose progress.\""

        "Content": " Three Britons could face the death penalty in Bali after appearing in court charged with smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Indonesia. Jonathan Christopher Collyer and Lisa Ellen Stocker were arrested on 1 February after customs officers stopped them at an X-ray machine after finding suspicious items in their luggage, prosecutors claimed. A lab test result confirmed that 10 sachets of Angel Delight powdered dessert mix in Collyer's luggage and seven similar sachets in his partner's suitcase contained 993.56g, or over 2lbs, of cocaine, worth an estimated 6bn rupiah (£272,000), prosecutor I Made Dipa Umbara told the District Court in the regional capital Denpasar. Phineas Ambrose Float, 31, was arrested two days later after police set up a controlled delivery in which the other two suspects allegedly handed him the drug in the parking area of a hotel in Denpasar. He is being tried separately. The drugs were brought from England to Indonesia via Qatar, Mr Umbara said. The group had successfully brought cocaine into the country twice before, Ponco Indriyo, the deputy director of the Bali Police Narcotics Unit, told reporters in February.

About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, according to figures from the country's ministry of immigration and corrections. One of them, Briton Lindsay Sandiford, now 69, has been on death row for more than a decade after 3.8kg of cocaine was found in her luggage in 2012. Despite its strict laws, Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub, the UN has said, partly because international syndicates target its young population. Last week, Thomas Parker, from Cumbria, was sentenced to 10 months in jail in Bali for drug offences after a charge that could carry the death penalty was dropped.

An Australian man, Lamar Aaron Ahchee, 43, from Cairns in north Queensland, was arrested on 22 May after police allegedly seized 1.7kg (3.7lbs) of cocaine during a raid on his rented home in Kuta Beach. A police chief said anti-drug surveillance teams reported Ahchee had received two suspicious packages sent by mail to Denpasar from England. He too could face the death penalty."

Six people were arrested across England on Tuesday morning, with the lead suspect, a 37-year-old Botswana national, detained in Cheltenham. Four other men and one woman, aged between 33 and 50, were also arrested in Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Bradford. Politics latest: Trump's tariffs announcement casts doubt over UK-US deal The suspected gang is alleged to have helped migrants use fake documents to submit asylum claims and gain employment in care homes without adequate training. The Home Office said intelligence suggested the suspected lead smuggler lured people here under false pretences and forced them to do unpaid work. The \"scale of the threat\" meant this was one of the government's highest priority investigations, according to Phillip Parr, an inspector with the Immigration Enforcement's criminal and financial investigation unit. Mr Parr said there was \"no place for those who profit from human misery\" and the operation safeguarded potentially hundreds of people from further exploitation. The raids are part of the government's latest efforts to tackle people smuggling gangs and stop small boat crossings.

On Saturday, 1,195 people made the crossing, the highest figure so far for 2025.  Speaking to Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips this weekend, Defence Secretary John Healey said Britain had \"lost control of its borders over the last five years\". The government said it was tightening UK visa controls and reducing reliance on overseas workers. Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said Tuesday's raids demonstrate the UK \"will use the full force of the law against those who facilitate illegal entry into the UK for exploitation\"."

        "Content": " Aid distribution centres in Gaza will be closed on Wednesday, the US-backed organisation operating them has announced, after Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli gunfire near one of its sites. In a post on Facebook, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - which is endorsed by Israel - said the centres would be shut \"for renovations, organisation, and efficiency improvements\". \"Due to the ongoing upgrades, entry into the distribution centre areas is strictly prohibited,\" it added. \"Please avoid the site and adhere to the general instructions. Operations will resume on Thursday.\" Following the announcement, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) told people in Gaza that \"travel is prohibited\" on Wednesday \"via the roads leading to the distribution centres, which are considered combat zones, and entry into the distribution centre areas is strictly prohibited\". It comes after 27 Palestinians were killed while waiting for aid to be distributed in the Rafah area of southern Gaza early on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry claimed that more than 90 people were injured in what it called a \"massacre\", with some of the wounded in a serious condition. The IDF said it fired \"near a few individual suspects\" who left the designated route, approached its forces and ignored warning shots, about half a kilometre from the aid distribution site of the GHF. It added that people were moving towards its forces in a way that \"posed a threat to them\". Later, IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin said accusations that the Israeli military shot at civilians at the aid centre were \"completely unfounded and false\". \"We are debriefing this event, and we will find out the truth,\" he added. The media office of the Gaza government, which is run by Hamas, said in a statement that Israel was transforming aid distribution centres \"into mass death traps and bloodbaths\" with 102 people killed and 490 more injured in just eight days since the centres opened on 27 May. The aid centres were \"luring starving civilians to them as a result of the crippling famine\", said the media office, which called for humanitarian aid delivered through UN agencies and neutral international organisations rather than the GHF. The IDF said in a statement: \"Earlier today (Tuesday), during the movement of the crowd along the designated routes toward the aid distribution site - approximately half a kilometre from the site - IDF troops identified several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes. \"The troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops.\" Sky News pressed Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer on whether any of these individuals had weapons - but he failed to answer the question. Mencer told Sky's Kamali Melbourne: \"The warning shots were fired away from the aid distribution point in response to the threat perceived by IDF troops.\" Read more from Sky News:How Israeli-backed aid plan in Gaza is unravellingEx-Biden official says Israel committed war crimes The GHF said in a statement on Tuesday: \"While the aid distribution was conducted safely and without incident at our site today, we understand that IDF is investigating whether a number of civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone. This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area. \"We recognise the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when travelling to our distribution sites. Questions regarding the potential incident should be referred to the IDF Spokesperson.\" Middle East correspondent The Israeli government says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is supposed to prevent aid from going to Hamas. That's almost certainly not being achieved. The operation is in chaos – every morning tens of thousands of people make the journey south on foot to get food when the two hubs open after dawn. It's first come, first served. It's the survival of the fittest in a place where almost everyone is already starving. The pictures of massive crowds grabbing food boxes in a frenzied manner aren't just an indication of the desperation, but would also appear to undermine Israel's claims the aid isn't going to Hamas. Amid the chaos and thousands of people (mostly men) scrabbling for aid, how could they possibly know who is getting it? The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah received 184 casualties. A spokesperson added that 19 of those were declared dead upon arrival, and eight died of their wounds shortly after. There were three children and two women among the dead, according to Mohammed Saqr, who is the head of nursing at Nasser Hospital in Gaza. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) launched its first aid distribution sites at the end of May to combat widespread hunger among the population in Gaza. The GHF, a private group endorsed by Israel, operates as part of a controversial new aid system established by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in May that Israel would be \"taking control of food distribution\" in Gaza after it accused Hamas of diverting and seizing aid supplies. Hamas has denied stealing aid. GHF's aid plan has been criticised by UN agencies and established charities, which have refused to work with the new distribution system.  The UN and major aid groups said the aid plan violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory.  The IDF said in a statement that the GHF \"operate(s) independently in order to enable the distribution of aid to the Gazan residents - and not to Hamas\".  It also highlighted that Israeli troops were \"not preventing the arrival of Gazan civilians to the humanitarian aid distribution sites\". Israel has said it ultimately wants the UN to work through the GHF, which is using private US security and logistics groups to bring aid into Gaza for distribution by civilian teams at so-called secure distribution sites.  There have been repeated reports of Palestinians being killed near Rafah as they gathered at the aid distribution site to get desperately needed supplies. A spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights, Jeremy Laurence, said: \"For a third day running, people were killed around an aid distribution site run by the 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation'.\" Mr Laurence's office said the impediment of access to food and relief for civilians in Gaza may constitute a war crime, describing attacks on civilians trying to access food aid as \"unconscionable\". The alleged shooting comes just two days after reports that 31 people were killed as they walked to a distribution centre run by the GHF in the Rafah area. Witnesses said the deaths came after Israeli forces opened fire, while Palestinian and Hamas-linked media attributed the deaths they reported to an Israeli airstrike. The IDF later said its forces \"did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false\".  On Monday, three more Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was \"appalled\" by reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid. He called for an independent investigation and said: \"It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.\" The IDF said that three of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, in what appeared to be the deadliest attack on Israeli forces since the ceasefire with Hamas ended in March. Officials said the soldiers, all in their early 20s, died in northern Gaza, with Israeli media reporting that they were killed in an explosion in the Jabaliya area. Last week, Israel accepted a US-brokered ceasefire proposal, which would see the release over the course of a week of nine living hostages and half of the known hostages who have died. But Hamas said that it was seeking amendments to the proposed 60-day truce, offering 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners."

Earlier, an exit poll from three of South Korea's broadcasters put the Democratic Party leader on 51.7% and Mr Kim on 39.3% It caps off a tumultuous six months for South Korea, with the country plunged into crisis after former president Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law on 3 December.  Troops had entered the National Assembly building as police and protesters clashed outside after he made the announcement, only for him to reverse the move six hours later. Mr Yoon was impeached later that month, and his dismissal was upheld in April after South Korea's constitutional court ruled the conservative leader \"violated his duty as commander-in-chief by mobilising troops,\" triggering the snap election.  Mr Lee, a former human rights lawyer, will be sworn in as president immediately for a single full term of five years without the usual two-month transition period. He had previously called the snap election \"judgement day\" against the martial law decision, and accused the PPP of condoning the attempt by not fighting harder to oust Mr Yoon. Park Chan-dae, acting leader of the Democratic Party, told South Korea broadcaster KBS that #\"people made a fiery judgement against the insurrection regime\"."

        "Content": "By Dan Whitehead, Sky correspondent, in Praia da Luz   Dense shrubs, empty barns, disused wells and dirt tracks - the police here have got their work cut out if they're to find evidence relating to Madeleine McCann's disappearance.  At 6am, before police cordons were put up, we spoke with an officer - a balaclava covering his face - manning one of the forensic tents. \"It's a large area,\" he told me. \"A different place will be searched each day.\" Gusty winds blow up dust on the dirt tracks. The land is used by dog walkers and hikers, and is sparsely populated. But as the crow flies, it's only a mile or so from where the three-year-old was last seen while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz in 2007. As we stood by the police van, out for his morning run was Tony Gallagher, a Brit who has lived within this new search area for 20 years. He remembers when it all happened. \"I know for a fact that they searched up here 20 years ago,\" he said. \"I'm not sure what they're hoping to find, because even locals were searching.\" It's one of the big unanswered questions: Just what intelligence is this latest search based on? Has someone come forward? \"It feels strange, you know,\" Tony adds. \"I think it will be for the people in Praia da Luz... because it had a whole negative impact there 20 years ago in terms of business and tourists coming and everything. \"And I hope for the locals that doesn't happen again.\"  At 9am, two vans and three cars arrived, all with German number plates. Inside, police - some in camouflage uniforms - were ready to begin the search. Police in Germany had asked officials in Portugal for access back in April, so this has been in the planning for weeks. Madeleine's disappearance is one of the most high-profile missing-person investigations in the world. It's why every new search brings the world's media. At one point, more than 20 journalists were broadcasting live alongside us, lining the road opposite the police. While this new search brings fresh hope, journalists and, more importantly, Kate and Gerry McCann have been here before, many times. Around two years ago, a dam about 45 minutes from here was searched, but nothing was found.

        "Content": "By Ben van der Merwe, Michelle Inez Simon, Kaitlin Tosh and Sam Doak, Data & Forensics Unit  Dozens of Palestinians have been killed near aid distribution compounds in recent days, prompting renewed criticism of the controversial new Israeli-backed aid system for the Gaza Strip. Only one of the four compounds has opened every day since 27 May, when the new system was launched. It lies in the far south-west of the Gaza Strip, near the ruins of a town known as Swedish Village. In just eight days, at least 64 people have been killed while seeking aid at the Swedish Village compound, according to Gaza's health ministry. Until recently, aid into Gaza was managed by the United Nations, which would distribute food and medicine from hundreds of points around the territory. Israel says this aid was being routinely diverted towards Hamas, though it has not provided evidence of this. Under the new system implemented by Israel and the new US-based organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, aid is supposed to be distributed from four militarised compounds - three of which are in the far south of the Gaza Strip. The project has been criticised by the UN and the charity sector, who say it puts Palestinians at risk and forces them to travel many miles to receive aid. That includes 27 who were reportedly killed on Tuesday morning, according to local officials and the nearby Red Cross field hospital. Late on Tuesday the aid sites' operator said none of the centres would be open on Wednesday due to \"renovations, organisation and efficiency improvements\" and the IDF said the areas around them would be considered \"combat zones.\" Speaking about the shootings on Tuesday, the IDF said its forces had opened fire on \"individual suspects who advanced towards troops\" after \"deviating from the designated access routes\" near the distribution centre, and said it was looking into reports of casualties. \"Warning shots were fired approximately half a kilometre away from the humanitarian aid distribution site toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops in such a way that posed a threat to them,\" a spokesperson said. \"After the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced towards the troops.\" The shootings happened at the al Alam roundabout, around 1km from the aid compound, and began at around 4am, according to witnesses. In the footage below, verified by Sky News, gunfire can be heard as hundreds of Palestinians walk southwards towards the aid compound. The attack on Tuesday was the fourth to take place at al Alam roundabout, and the third in three days. Two days earlier, on 1 June, at least 31 people were reportedly killed. Sky News has verified footage, too graphic to publish, that shows eight bodies scattered on the beach near al Alam. Eye-witness testimonies suggest a similar cause - that some Palestinians strayed from the indicated route, or advanced towards the compound too early, and were shot by the IDF. \"I didn't expect to see such a large number of people in the distribution area,\" wrote one man in a social media post. \"Tanks were firing at the ground [...] to try to scare people and prevent them from approaching al Alam, but people did not listen to it and began to move forward.\" The IDF says its troops did not fire at civilians near or within the aid compound, and has said reports to the contrary are false. Later that day, the GHF released undated footage which it said showed that aid was distributed at the site without incident. Sky News was not able to verify the footage, which had been edited, but it showed the inside of an aid compound rather than the roundabout area where the shooting is alleged to have taken place. The Israeli military later published footage which it said showed gunmen shooting at people collecting aid. On Tuesday, Israeli deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel said this footage \"shows some of Hamas's tactics to actually try and prevent Gazan civilians from coming and collecting aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund collection centres and humanitarian distribution points\". However, Sky News has confirmed the footage was taken in a Khan Younis neighbourhood far from any GHF distribution compound. Why is the new aid system so dangerous?  Sky News has analysed video from the area, heard eye-witness testimony, combed social media and spoken to Gaza aid experts to understand what has been happening. In an official GHF WhatsApp channel on Tuesday morning, Palestinians complained about the rush to secure packages inside the distribution centre and the failure of the guards to maintain order. \"Literally, in less than five minutes it was finished,\" said one user who attended the Swedish Village site that morning. \"I went there four times and did not receive anything,\" said another. \"I entered at the appointed time and found people upset, having gone in two hours early. God knows how.\" Sam Rose, acting director of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in Gaza, told Sky News the lack of order at the distribution sites means Palestinians have little incentive to obey the rules if that means they will be pushed to the back of the queue. \"People are just grabbing whatever food parcels they can get their hands on,\" he says. When UNRWA was in charge of distributing aid, Rose says, \"we would do orderly distributions where a certain number of people are called and invited to receive their food every day at hundreds of distribution points\". \"When they receive that food, they were counted off, and those details were then shared with other food providers to ensure that food is distributed as equitably and as comprehensively as possible,\" he says. \"We're seeing nothing of that. We're basically just seeing riots.\"  Instructions have been chaotic and contradictory Sky News analysis suggests that issues with aid distribution are being compounded by poor communication from the group organising the sites, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The group's website has no information about opening times or where to find this information. A Facebook page under the GHF's name, marked as \"verified\" by Meta, appears to be the only official channel for updates. It has just 3.8 thousand followers, with its posts regularly receiving fewer than 50 engagements. Even those closely following the page to learn when and where to find aid rarely receive more than an hour's notice. On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday this week, the opening of the Swedish Village site was announced after 4am, with the site due to open at 5am. The instructions given to Palestinians are also confusing and contradictory. In the post on Tuesday morning, for instance, the GHF instructed Palestinians that they were not allowed to proceed south past the al Alam roundabout until 5am. The accompanying map indicated the point at which Palestinians were to stop, along with coordinates. However, this was not the al Alam roundabout, but a junction 740 metres earlier. It is not clear whether the IDF expected Palestinians to stop at the roundabout or at the indicated location. Eyewitnesses later reported that the IDF shot and killed 27 Palestinians near the roundabout. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said that those killed were shot \"after moving beyond the designated safe corridor\". The new system has only provided 13% of the necessary meals Problems with crowds at the new aid distribution centres began on the first day they came into operation. On 27 May, the Swedish Village aid compound was overwhelmed by a crowd of Palestinians seeking aid. The crowd, which had been contained inside a fenced entrance area, was able to easily topple the fences and scale the sand berms which surround the compound. Analysis of footage from that day shows that the fences do not appear to be fixed to concrete foundations, making them relatively flimsy. \"As long as two million people try to come every day, there will definitely be massacres,\" said one user in the GHF WhatsApp group. \"Of course, the reason is due to the idea that there is only one point for receiving - other points must be opened.\" The UN estimates that half of Gaza's 2.1 million people live in the north of the territory, yet the GHF has not set up any aid distribution sites in this region. It has three sites in the far south of the Gaza Strip, and one in the central region. The latter has only opened once so far, for a single day. UNRWA's Sam Rose says this set-up makes it \"inevitable\" that \"thousands upon thousands\" of people would seek aid at the Swedish Village compound, which has been the only open compound in recent days. \"[The GHF] are simply not able to cope with the crowds, with the complete desperation of people who have absolutely no choice, if they want to get food for themselves and their family, but to go through this,\" he says. \"Wave upon wave of people are seeking the only means to get food, and this is the inevitable consequence of it. \"No entity with any clue about distribution of aid would have proposed such an inhumane system.\" This issue is compounded by the limited quantities of food available. Even by its numbers, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is feeding only a fraction of Gaza's population. On Monday, the organisation said it had distributed 5.9 million meals during its first week in operation, or an average of 840,000 per day. The organisation has previously said three meals are enough to feed one person per day, meaning over the past week, it has distributed enough meals to feed just 13% of Gaza's population. \"It seems that the group's goal is to make us look like a barbaric people,\" said one Palestinian in the GHF WhatsApp. \"If there was a system, everyone would get what they want, and things would be fine.\" The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "Content": "Five people have been killed and several more injured after an attack on an aid convoy in the Sudanese region of North Darfur. The number of dead was revealed in a statement from the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF on Tuesday. Earlier, it was reported that a UN convoy delivering food to El Fasher, North Darfur, came under attack overnight, with initial reports indicating there had been \"multiple casualties\". According to the joint statement, the convoy of 15 trucks had travelled 1,120 miles from Port Sudan - and was trying to negotiate access to El Fasher when it was targeted on Monday night. \"Multiple trucks were burned and critical humanitarian supplies were damaged in addition to the deaths and injuries,\" the statement said. Aid deliveries have regularly been caught in the crossfire of the two-year war between the Sudanese Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, leaving more than half the Sudanese population facing acute levels of hunger. Last week, WFP premises in El Fasher were targeted, damaging a workshop, office building, and clinic. Several medics were killed in a separate attack on El Obeid hospital in North Kordofan last month. Read moreAnalysis: Sudan war is at dangerous new stageParamilitary launch drone attack on wartime capitalEyewitness: Man separated from family for two years returns The joint WFP-UNICEF statement reads: \"The WFP and UNICEF condemn an attack on a joint humanitarian convoy near Al Koma, North Darfur, last night. \"Following months of escalating violence, hundreds of thousands of people in El Fasher - many of them children - are at high risk of malnutrition and starvation if supplies do not urgently reach them. \"As is standard with our humanitarian convoys, the route was shared in advance, and parties on the ground were notified and aware of the location of the trucks. \"Under international humanitarian law, aid convoys must be protected, and parties have the obligation to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. \"Both agencies demand an immediate end to attacks on humanitarian personnel, their facilities and vehicles - a violation under international humanitarian law.\" Humanitarian attacks continuing 'with impunity' The two agencies called for an \"urgent investigation\" into the incident and for the \"perpetrators to be held to account\". They offered their condolences to the families of those killed and their \"heartfelt sympathy and support to all those injured\". \"It is devastating that the supplies have not reached the vulnerable children and families they were intended to,\" the joint statement concluded. \"Attacks on humanitarian staff, aid, operations, as well as civilians and civilian infrastructure in Sudan have continued for far too long with impunity. \"WFP and UNICEF colleagues remain on the ground despite the insecurity, but call for safe, secure operating conditions and for international humanitarian law to be respected by all parties. The lives of millions in Sudan, including in locations like El Fasher in Darfur, depend on it.\""

        "Content": " The head of World Boxing has apologised after the organisation singled out Imane Khelif in an announcement about making sex testing mandatory. The Algerian boxer was mentioned by name when the boxing body released its new policy on Friday. Khelif won gold at the Paris Games last summer amid scrutiny over a failed gender eligibility test, which was conducted by a different controversial boxing body, the International Boxing Association (IBA). World Boxing is the new international federation that will run boxing at the next Olympic Games.  World Boxing's president, Boris van der Vorst, contacted the Algerian Boxing Federation to apologise. \"I am writing to you all personally to offer a formal and sincere apology for this and acknowledge that her privacy should have been protected,\" he wrote in a letter seen by The Associated Press. Van der Vorst added he hoped by \"reaching out to you personally we show our true respect to you and your athletes\". World Boxing had said there will be mandatory testing of all boxers from 1 July in order to \"ensure the safety of all participants and deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women\". All athletes over 18 years old in its competitions must undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth, it said. The test detects chromosomal material through a mouth swab, saliva or blood. If an athlete intending to compete in the women's categories is determined to have male chromosomal material, \"initial screenings will be referred to independent clinical specialists for genetic screening, hormonal profiles, anatomical examination or other valuation of endocrine profiles by medical specialists,\" World Boxing said. An appeals process is also included in the policy. Khelif had intended to compete in the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands from 5 June, but will no longer be able to because of the mandatory testing. The 26-year-old plans to defend her gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, but some boxers and their federations have already criticised her inclusion."

Jonathan Christopher Collyer and Lisa Ellen Stocker were arrested on 1 February after customs officers stopped them at an X-ray machine after finding suspicious items in their luggage, prosecutors claimed. A lab test result confirmed that 10 sachets of Angel Delight powdered dessert mix in Collyer's luggage and seven similar sachets in his partner's suitcase contained 993.56g, or over 2lbs, of cocaine, worth an estimated 6bn rupiah (£272,000), prosecutor I Made Dipa Umbara told the District Court in the regional capital Denpasar. Phineas Ambrose Float, 31, was arrested two days later after police set up a controlled delivery in which the other two suspects allegedly handed him the drug in the parking area of a hotel in Denpasar. He is being tried separately. The drugs were brought from England to Indonesia via Qatar, Mr Umbara said. The group had successfully brought cocaine into the country twice before, Ponco Indriyo, the deputy director of the Bali Police Narcotics Unit, told reporters in February.

About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, according to figures from the country's ministry of immigration and corrections. One of them, Briton Lindsay Sandiford, now 69, has been on death row for more than a decade after 3.8kg of cocaine was found in her luggage in 2012. Despite its strict laws, Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub, the UN has said, partly because international syndicates target its young population. Last week, Thomas Parker, from Cumbria, was sentenced to 10 months in jail in Bali for drug offences after a charge that could carry the death penalty was dropped. He was accused of collecting a package containing MDMA from a motorcycle taxi driver on a nearby street.

An Australian man, Lamar Aaron Ahchee, 43, from Cairns in north Queensland, was arrested on 22 May after police allegedly seized 1.7kg (3.7lbs) of cocaine during a raid on his rented home in Kuta Beach. A police chief said anti-drug surveillance teams reported Ahchee had received two suspicious packages sent by mail to Denpasar from England. He too could face the death penalty."

        "Content": "A euthanasia advocate has died after being detained following a woman's \"suicide capsule\" death in Switzerland. Content warning: this article contains references to suicide Dr Florian Willet, who was arrested over the first reported use of the Sarco pod, died on 5 May, months after falling from the third floor of his building, according to an obituary written by Australian-born doctor Philip Nitschke, who invented the capsule. Dr Willet was the co-president of The Last Resort, a Swiss affiliate of assisted dying group Exit International, and was the only person present during the death of a 64-year-old American woman in a forest cabin in Merishausen, northern Switzerland, in September 2024. Exit International said the woman suffered from \"severe immune compromise\" and she was the first person to die using the 3D-printed Sarco pod, which it said cost more than $1m (£747,440) to develop. The capsule is designed to allow a person inside to push a button that begins the assisted dying procedure. Dr Willet was arrested in the Swiss forest and placed in pre-trial detention for 70 days, with a prosecutor alleging that the pod had not worked and the woman had instead suffered injuries consistent with strangulation. Exit International claimed there was \"no foundation\" for the allegation, and previously said in a statement that the assisted suicide had been filmed and the footage had been provided to the prosecution. Dr Willet had described the woman's death as \"peaceful, fast and dignified\", Exit International said. Dr Nitschke, who lives in the Netherlands, said he was \"pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed... to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing\". He added that his organisation received advice from Swiss lawyers that using the Sarco would be legal in the country. Dr Willet was released from pre-trial detention in early December, but \"he was a changed man\" who lost his smile and self-confidence, whose \"spirit was broken\" and who \"seemed deeply traumatised by the experience of incarceration and the wrongful accusation of strangulation\", according to Dr Nitschke. The 47-year-old sought psychiatric support in Zurich at Christmas, but discharged himself from the clinic before New Year's Eve. In January, Dr Willet fell from the third floor of his Zurich flat. \"He did serious damage,\" Dr Nitschke said, claiming doctors had diagnosed Dr Willet with an acute polymorphic disorder brought on by \"the stress of the pre-trial detention and the associated pressures\". Dr Willet had surgery and went to rehab for his injuries in the three months after his fall. On 5 May, he died by assisted suicide in Cologne, Germany, Dutch newspaper Volkskrant reports. Assisted dying is legal in Germany. Swiss law allows assisted suicide so long as the person takes his or her life with no \"external assistance\" and those who help the person die do not do so for \"any self-serving motive\".

It is home to several organisations dedicated to helping people achieve this. However, some politicians have argued the law is unclear and sought to close what they say are legal loopholes, with health minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider suggesting the use of the Sarco would not be legal.

Immigration officers detained Mohamed Soliman's relatives, believed to be his wife and five children. Soliman, an Egyptian national, moved to the US three years ago and lived in Colorado Springs but was there illegally after his visa and work authorisation expired. He reportedly has two teenage children and three younger children. \"We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,\" said homeland security secretary Kristi Noem on X. Soliman, 45, is being held after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a group doing a walk for Israeli hostages in Boulder on Sunday. The attacker allegedly yelled \"Free Palestine\" and had a total of 18 petrol bombs - but police said he \"got scared\" and only tossed a couple. Soliman also had a makeshift flamethrower in the form of gas in a backpack sprayer, according to a FBI statement, but told investigators he did not use it. Twelve people were injured, authorities said. The victims were aged between 52 and 88 and three of them were still being treated in hospital on Tuesday. Soliman was allegedly dressed as a gardener to get as close as he could to the small group. Authorities said he told them he had no regrets. He has been charged with a hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder in federal and state cases. Court papers said he planned the attack for a year and told authorities that no one, including his family, was aware of the plot. An FBI statement said Soliman left an iPhone hidden in a drawer at his home with messages for his family but that his wife handed it to police. The family are said to be cooperating with investigators. Soliman admitted taking gun training to try to get a permit but was denied as he wasn't a US citizen, according to police and the FBI.

The tech billionaire hit out at the tax cuts on his platform X, writing: \"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" In American politics, \"pork\" is a political metaphor used when government spending is allocated to local projects, usually to benefit politicians' constituencies. Musk left the administration abruptly last week after working to cut costs with his team, the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency - known as DOGE - with the ambition of sacking federal workers and cutting red tape. \n                  Is Trump politicising an 'act of terrorism'?\n                 \n                  'Without a doubt': Why a former state department spokesperson believes Israel has committed war crimes \n                 \n                  Strategic Defence Review: UK 'moving to warfighting readiness' as it commits to build attack submarines\n                 The White House brushed Musk's comments aside, claiming they did not surprise the president. In a press conference on Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill\". She added: \"This is one, big, beautiful bill. \"And he's sticking to it.\" The White House on Tuesday asked Congress to cut back $9.4bn in already approved spending, taking money away from DOGE.  The billionaire tweeted: \"It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!!) and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.\" He also suggested voting out politicians who advanced the president's tax bill. \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\" Musk wrote in another X post. How Musk's mission to cut government spending fell flat Last Thursday, Musk revealed on X that his scheduled time as a \"special government employee\" was coming to an end. Before the news broke, Musk's father told Sky News his son was \"not a very good politician\". But speaking to Gillian Joseph on The World, Errol Musk insisted there was \"no rift between Elon and Donald Trump\". Musk's time at DOGE was controversial, with drastic cuts to America's humanitarian efforts sparking particular criticism. Questions have also been raised about whether the department has actually saved taxpayers as much money as suggested. Musk initially had ambitions to slash government spending by $2trn (£1.5trn) - but this was dramatically reduced to $1trn (£750bn) and then to just $150bn (£111bn). The 53-year-old, who famously brought his son X Æ A-12 to the Oval Office, also expressed frustration about resistance to his ideas and clashed with other senior members of the Trump administration. He recently told The Washington Post: \"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised. I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC to say the least.\" By law, status as a \"special government employee\" means he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which would have ended around 30 May."

Jonathan Joss, 59, was found injured by police in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday evening. Officers tried to save him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The actor's husband claimed the gunman shouted \"violent homophobic slurs\" before opening fire, and that Joss had pushed him out the way to save his life. \"He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other,\" alleged Tristan Kern de Gonzales on Facebook. He said the couple had previously faced harassment from neighbours, much of it \"openly homophobic\". Joss's husband said they had been checking for mail at his old home - which earlier this year burned down in a fire that killed their three dogs - when they noticed the skull of one of the animals in front of the property. He said they began \"yelling and crying\" and claimed they were approached by a man who threatened them with a gun. \"We were standing side by side,\" said Mr Kern de Gonzales. \"When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\" However, San Antonio police said it had found no evidence that the shooting was a hate crime. \"Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly,\" said a statement. A 56-year-old man, Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, has already been charged with murder. Joss is best known for voicing Native American character John Redcorn in cult show King Of The Hill, which ran for 13 series and more than 250 episodes from 1997 to 2009.

A statement from Hamas said comments by Matt Miller, who as State Department Spokesman articulated the views of the US government, amounted to a \"significant admission that condemns the occupation and exposes its crimes\". On the Trump 100 podcast, Mr Miller was asked if he agreed with the view that Israel's actions in Gaza amounted to genocide. \"I don't think it's a genocide, but I think, I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes,\" Mr Miller said.  In a written statement, Hamas said Mr Miller's words reveal that he was, quote, \"not allowed to speak the truth while in office and was forced to adhere to the US government's official narrative regarding the occupation's practices\". \"This exposes the deep political complicity of US administrations with the occupation and their criminal cover-up of its brutal violations,\" it added.

The United States government had not concluded that they committed war crimes, still have not concluded [that].\"  Pressed further on why he didn't offer such views while serving as State Department spokesman, Mr Miller told Trump100: \"The State Department did release a report in the spring of last year where, look, there was a bunch of bureaucratic legalese language as the government always [uses] where they did say it's reasonable to assess that Israel has at times acted in violation of the laws of war, or something similar.\" He continued: \"So the State department itself had concluded - they didn't phrase it in these terms - but I think I did it at the podium, a few times, conclude that it was likely that Israel had committed war crimes, but I do think it's almost certain that they have.\"  Mr Miller offered a qualifying distinction between state-sanctioned war crimes and individual illegal acts by soldiers. \"There are two ways to think about the commission of war crimes: One is if the state has pursued a policy to deliberately commit war crimes or is acting reckless in a way that aids and abets war crimes. \"Is the [Israeli] state committing war crimes? That, I think, is an open question. I think what is almost certainly not an open question is that there have been individual incidents that have been war crimes where Israeli soldiers, members of the Israeli military, have committed war crimes.\" Read more:Hamas calls shooting near aid centre in Gaza 'massacre'IDF deny reports at least 31 people killed near aid distribution siteHow the rollout of new Gaza aid system collapsed into chaos Sky News put Mr Miller's accusations to Israeli government spokesman David Mencer. \"Of course, when there are claims like that, they need to be fairly investigated, but I can tell you that Israel upholds the highest levels of international law that is key in the strategy of releasing our hostages and destroying this terrorist organisation,\" he said. But to that, Mr Miller, out of office, now echoes a point repeatedly put to him by journalists while he was in office, at the podium: that Israeli investigations so often go nowhere. At the podium, he repeated phrases like \"...we are asking the Israelis to investigate...\", \"...we are concerned by what we have seen...\", \"...we are waiting for the results of the Israeli investigation...\". Now, Mr Miller says: \"We do know that Israel has opened investigations, but look, we are many months into those investigations and we're not seeing Israeli soldiers held accountable. \"We have not yet seen them hold sufficient numbers of the military accountable and I think it's an open question whether they are going to.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n One of Britain's top corporate troubleshooters is being lined up to spearhead a multibillion pound rescue of Thames Water after the company's preferred bidder walked away. Sky News can reveal that Mike McTighe is working with Thames Water's largest group of creditors on a plan to restructure the company's debts and inject new funds in the hope of avoiding nationalisation. Mr McTighe, whose portfolio of chairmanships includes the Daily Telegraph's publisher and Openreach, BT Group's infrastructure arm, is said to have begun meeting stakeholders in recent weeks. If the Class A creditors' proposal is successfully executed, Mr McTighe would probably take over as chairman of Thames Water, according to people close to the situation. Mr McTighe has earned a reputation as a turnaround expert, but also chairs companies such as IG Group, the financial spreadbetting company, and Together Financial Services, the non-bank lender. The recruitment of such a prominent businessman to lead the lenders' efforts will add momentum to a plan which increasingly looks like the only alternative to landing British taxpayers with a vast rescue bill. The group's proposal would include swapping several billion pounds of Thames Water's debt for equity, as well as injecting substantial new funding. \n                  Thames crisis underlines scale of water industry turnaround task\n                 \n                  Thames Water survival hopes suffer fresh blow\n                 \n                  Thames Water hit with largest-ever fine issued by regulator Ofwat\n                 Thames Water is Britain's largest water utility, serving more than 15 million customers. However, decades of poor performance and financial engineering have left it carrying close to £20bn of debt and facing hundreds of millions of pounds in regulatory fines. The Class A creditor group, which represents about £13bn of Thames Water's borrowings, includes some of the world's most powerful investors. Elliott Management, the New York-based firm, is among those exposed to a collapse that could leave Thames Water in a special administration regime (SAR) - a government-sponsored insolvency process aimed at providers of key infrastructure services. Other members of the creditor group include institutions such as Aberdeen, Invesco, Apollo Global Management and M&G. A source close to the creditor group said: \"We have done a huge amount of diligence and work on a plan to turnaround Thames. \"We are the only bidders who will be able to complete this transaction within the necessary timeframe.\" The fact that Mr McTighe has been persuaded to join their effort will revive hope that a private sector solution to Thames Water's crisis can still be found. On Tuesday, the company announced that KKR, its preferred equity partner for the last two months, had decided not to proceed with a deal. Sky News revealed that talks between Henry Kravis, the KKR co-founder, and Sir Keir Starmer's top business adviser had taken place over the weekend in an effort to prevent the deal from collapsing. Money latest: 'Death by 1,000 increases' - three major lenders push mortgage rates up It was unclear on Tuesday whether CKI, the Hong Kong-based company which controls swathes of UK infrastructure assets, might seek to revive its interest in a deal with Thames Water. Sir Adrian Montague, the company's current chairman, said: \"Whilst today's news is disappointing, we continue to believe that a sustainable recapitalisation of the company is in the best interests of all stakeholders and continue to work with our creditors and stakeholders to achieve that goal.\" In recent weeks, Thames Water has been fined a record £123m by Ofwat for separate transgressions relating to dividend payments and environmental pollution, and found itself embroiled in a bitter political row over whether retention payments it had lined up for executives were classified as bonuses. The company has also been at the centre of a legal battle which culminated in the Class A group of lenders providing a £3bn emergency loan in March following a court challenge launched by a smaller creditor group. The government described Thames Water as \"stable\" on Tuesday, but said it was ready to step in and take control of the company if required to. The company effectively faces a deadline of late July to finalise a rescue deal because of a referral of its five-year regulatory settlement to the Competition and Markets Authority. A spokesperson for the Class A creditors declined to comment on Tuesday evening."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The private equity firm that had been the frontrunner to lead a rescue of the UK's largest water provider - Thames Water - has pulled out. Thames Water Utilities, which is staring down the prospect of a special administration process without fresh investment, said an alternative plan was now under discussion after KKR's exit from the process. It is understood that the company hopes a new transaction could be agreed by July. KKR was handed preferred bidder status back in March as Thames, which serves 15 million customers but has a £22.8bn debt pile, moved to secure fresh equity. Money latest: Capital gains tax explained for second home sellers Thames said that KKR had indicated it was not in a position to proceed. No reasons are understood to have been given. But its withdrawal was announced a week after Thames was handed a record fine by the industry regulator for failures related to its wastewater operations and dividend payouts.  The move was also divulged shortly after an interim report for the government raised the prospect of a super regulator being created to bolster and streamline oversight of the water industry. Thames said it was now progressing talks with senior creditors for an alternative to stabilise its finances, and was also planning discussions with the regulator Ofwat on that plan. The watchdog is understood to be studying a 400-page document which includes proposals for new equity and debt facilities. It is hoped that a transaction could be completed by next month.  Read more money news from Sky News:Rachel Reeves threatens to sue Roman AbramovichThe rise of the prenup - and why so many are getting them The company's chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, said: \"Whilst today's news is disappointing, we continue to believe that a sustainable recapitalisation of the company is in the best interests of all stakeholders and continue to work with our creditors and stakeholders to achieve that goal. \"The company will therefore progress discussions on the senior creditors' plan with Ofwat and other stakeholders.  \"The board would like to thank the senior creditors for their continuing support.\" A government spokesperson responded: \"The company remains stable and the government is closely monitoring the situation. It would be inappropriate to comment further on the financial matters of a private company.\" Cash-strapped Thames secured a £3bn lifeline to tide it over back in March as it moved to secure fresh investment to guarantee its long-term survival. It had kept open the prospect of an alternative solution, given there was no certainty over a KKR deal being agreed. A failure to find new investment again raises the prospect of Thames falling into a special administration process. That would effectively see the company come under temporary government ownership to maintain vital services until a new owner, or ownership solution, is found. A spokesperson for the industry lobby group Water UK responded: \"Everyone agrees that the water industry is not working. We hope this report will be a starting point for the fundamental reforms the sector needs. We need a less complicated system which allows investment to get quickly to where it needs to go.  \"In the meantime, companies are focused on investing a record £104bn over the next 5-years to secure our water supplies, end sewage entering our rivers and seas and support economic growth.\" Chair of the environment committee of MPs, Alistair Carmichael, said: \"In our evidence session with Thames Water bosses in May we raised serious concerns that Thames had only pursued one bidder at an early stage for its takeover bid, against the wishes of Ofwat, and highlighted the risks this could pose if KKR chose not to proceed. Unfortunately, our concerns have been realised, putting Thames in a perilous position. \"The Government has shied away from acknowledging the potential impact of this scenario on the public finances and must ensure that any takeover is in the public interest and does not line the pockets of financial institutions further to the detriment of customers and operational performance.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n As an independent review sets out a vision for cleaning up the water industry, a real-world example of why the sector is in such deep trouble floats into view. The announcement that Thames Water's preferred investor KKR will not after all be injecting £4bn for an equity stake is, first and foremost, a crisis for the debt-laden company, increasing the chances taxpayers will have to throw it a lifeline. Yet it also encapsulates the fundamental challenges Sir Jon Cunliffe's Independent Water Commission is trying to address. Money latest: How much does it cost for a comfortable retirement? A regulated utility that should offer a regular, predictable, low-risk flow of water to customers and returns to investors, is instead sinking under the weight of its own debt and a failing system. Rapacious mismanagement and misguided regulation may have allowed historic investors in Thames to make a killing, but its current shareholders have been wiped out, its creditors are facing substantial losses on £20bn of debt, and now even a private equity giant immortalised as \"the barbarians at the gate\" of corporate America cannot stomach a stake. Sky News understands one factor in their decision was the political risk of investing in water, given criticism of the sector from ministers, campaigners and the media, and uncertainty over the future of regulation. \n                  Thames Water creditors line up McTighe to spearhead rescue deal\n                 \n                  Thames Water survival hopes suffer fresh blow\n                 \n                  Thames Water hit with largest-ever fine issued by regulator Ofwat\n                  In the short term Thames thinks it can fill the hole left by KKR by turning to its senior creditors, a group including institutional investors BlackRock and Aberdeen and hedge funds Elliott and Silver Point. With control of around £12bn of the £16bn of regulated company debt, they are already the effective owners and have battled through the courts to retain influence in any restructuring, and with it a say in the size of their inevitable losses. The creditors have already added a £3bn emergency loan to Thames' liabilities, which they say will be followed by an equity stake, as well as a write down of the debt they hold as part of a refinancing. That could see a debt-for-equity swap, in which loans are exchanged for a share of the company. Following the KKR announcement, Thames' bonds were trading at less than 70p in the pound. That implies a 30% write-down for creditors, though they may have other ideas. Whatever level is agreed, their business plan will need to convince Ofwat that it is sustainable and a 400-page proposal, including plans to replace Thames' current chairman Sir Adrian Monatgue, is with the regulator. If it floats, a restructuring process could begin as soon as next month. By then, Sir Jon will be finalising recommendations intended to ensure that Thames' plight cannot be repeated. His interim findings diagnose the problems with chalk-stream clarity. Weak strategic direction from government, misdirected and muddled regulation, companies that have failed both public and private interests and investors who have lost their appetite. Sir Jon has left the door open to the creation of a 'super-regulator', bringing together the responsibilities of Ofwat and the Environment Agency, to create a regime that delivers for customers, the environment, and long-term investors for whom water used to be a safe bet, but is now a poisoned chalice."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The Chinese owner of British Steel has hired a leading City law firm to explore the recovery of hundreds of millions of pounds it invested in the Scunthorpe-based company before the government seized control of its operations in April. Sky News has learnt that Jingye Group has appointed Linklaters - which advised it on its purchase of British Steel in 2020 - to evaluate legal options for recouping part of its outlay. It was unclear on Tuesday which potential routes Jingye was exploring with Linklaters, or whether a formal legal challenge to the government was under consideration. Money latest: How much does it cost for a comfortable retirement? British Steel's balance sheet bears debts worth close to £1bn, most of which is said to be owed to Jingye in the form of inter-company loans. The Financial Times reported last month that ministers were exploring the controversial use of new legislation to wipe out those debts in order to smooth a path to the sale of the business. The government and Jingye had been at loggerheads for weeks over the future of the Scunthorpe plant's blast furnaces. \n                  Thames Water creditors line up McTighe to spearhead rescue deal\n                 \n                  Thames Water survival hopes suffer fresh blow\n                 \n                  Thames crisis underlines scale of water industry turnaround task\n                  Since Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, moved to commandeer control of the UK's second-biggest steel producer, the government has sourced additional supplies of raw materials to ensure the furnaces' continued operations. Jingye had been preparing to close them - with the loss of thousands of jobs - after seeking £1bn in state aid to facilitate the site's transition to greener steelmaking. Mr Reynolds has indicated that Jingye's shares in British Steel - which has not yet been formally nationalised - are worthless, and that the government does not intend to offer to pay to acquire them. A Jingye spokesperson said: \"Jingye can confirm that Linklaters has been appointed; they were the original advisers on the acquisition in 2020.\" A spokesman for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We acted quickly to ensure the continued operations of the blast furnaces but recognise that securing British Steel's long-term future requires private sector investment. \"We are working closely with Jingye and a range of third parties on options for the future, and we will continue work on determining the best long-term sustainable future for the site.\""

Sky News has learnt Sir Christopher, whose previous companies have included Biovex and Chiroscience, is in the advanced stages of securing the capital for Ellipses Pharma.

Sky News has learnt that Henry Kravis, one of the architects of KKR's ascent to becoming one of the world's most powerful investors, discussed its plan to bail out Britain's biggest water company with Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's top business adviser, over the weekend. Sources close to the now-abandoned deal said the call between the pair had been organised following a request from Thames Water and its advisers at Rothschild. Money latest: Capital gains tax explained for second home sellers An insider said the discussion had been \"constructive\", with Mr Chandra said to have sought to reassure Mr Kravis that the government was supportive of the deal. One source close to KKR said, however, that its senior New York-based executives were unable to get comfortable with the level of operational and financial risk attached to investing as much as £4bn of equity into Thames Water. They were also concerned about negative rhetoric directed at Thames Water and the rest of the industry in recent weeks by Steve Reed, the environment secretary, and other ministers, the source added. \n                  Thames Water creditors line up McTighe to spearhead rescue deal\n                 \n                  Thames Water survival hopes suffer fresh blow\n                 \n                  Thames crisis underlines scale of water industry turnaround task\n                 KKR's decision to pull out of the discussions leaves the water company, which serves more than 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, relying on an alternative deal being assembled by its biggest bondholders. That proposal is being progressed, Thames Water said on Tuesday, although the spectre of temporary nationalisation continues to loom over it. The company was fined a record £123m by Ofwat, the industry regulator, last week, and faces further substantial penalties in the coming months. KKR has been contacted for comment."

The Independent Water Commission (IWC), established last year and led by a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, was scathing of government and regulatory oversight of the industry - long blighted by criticism over performance, particularly over sewage spills, shareholder payouts and bonuses for bosses. Money latest: Change to mortgage rules could drive up house prices Sir Jon Cunliffe said: \"There is no simple, single change, no matter how radical, that will deliver the fundamental reset that is needed for the water sector. \"We have heard of deep-rooted, systemic and interlocking failures over the years - failure in government's strategy and planning for the future, failure in regulation to protect both the billpayer and the environment and failure by some water companies and their owners to act in the public, as well as their private, interest. \"My view is that all of these issues need to be tackled to rebuild public trust and make the system fit for the future.

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n  A week today, Rachel Reeves presents the spending review; how the budget is divided between government departments between 2026 and 2029 - the bulk of this parliament.  It's a foundational moment for this government - and a key to determining the success of this administration. UK exempt from Trump's latest tariff hike: politics latest So, what's going to happen? The chancellor did boost spending significantly in her first year, and this year there was a modest rise. However, the uplift to day-to-day spending in the years ahead is more modest - and pared back further in March's spring statement because of adverse financial conditions. Plus, where will the £113bn of capital - project - spending go? So, we've done a novel experiment. We've taken Treasury documents, ministerial statements and reports from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. We put them all into AI - into the deep research function of ChatGPT - and asked it to write the spending review, calculate the winners and losers and work out what goes where, and why. It comes with a health warning. We're using experimental technology that is sometimes wrong, and while ChatGPT can access up-to-date data from across the web, it's only trained on information up to October 2023. There are no answers because discussions are still going on. Think of it like a polling projection - clues about the big picture as things move underneath. But, critically, the story it tells tallies with the narrative I'm hearing from inside government too. The winners? Defence, health and transport, with Angela Rayner's housing department up as well. Everywhere else is down, compared with this year's spending settlement. The Home Office, justice, culture, and business - facing real terms squeezes from here on in. The aid budget from the Foreign Office, slashed - the Ministry of Defence the beneficiary. You heard about that this week. Health - a Labour priority. I heard from sources a settlement of around 3%. This AI model puts it just above. Transport - a surprise winner. Rachel Reeves thinks this is where her capital budget should go. Projects in the north to help hold voters who live there. But, could this spell trouble? More from Sky News:Who is the public's favourite minister?Chancellor threatens to sue Abramovich Education - down overall. Now this government will protect the schools budget. It will say 'per pupil' funding is up. But adult education is at risk. Is this where they find the savings? So much else - Home Office down, but is that because asylum costs are going down. Energy - they're haggling over solar panels versus home insulation. Justice should get what it wants, I am told. This isn't about exact percentages. But you can see across lots of departments - things are tight. Even though Rachel Reeves has already set the budgets for last year and this, and only needs to decide spending allocations from 2026 onwards, the graphs the Treasury will produce next week compare what will be spent to the last set of Tory plans. This means their graphs will include the big spending increases they made last year - and flatter them more. They'll say that's fair enough, others will disagree. But in the end, will it be enough for public services?"

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Voters in South Lanarkshire will go to the polls on Thursday to elect a new MSP for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. The by-election comes following the death of SNP government minister Christina McKelvie. The contest takes place less than a year before the Scottish parliament election, with the result potentially offering a snapshot of how the political landscape north of the border will look in 2026. The SNP will be seeking to hold on to the seat, given the heavy losses to Labour at last year's UK general election. However, all eyes are on Reform UK and whether it will enjoy a \"tartan bounce\" following the party's recent slew of local election wins in England. Campaigning has been heated, with Reform UK accused of running a \"racist\" ad on Facebook against Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has continued to double down, accusing his rival of \"sectarian politics\". \n                  Tube fare dodgers and Robert Jenrick clash at Stratford station - as he chases them at barriers for social media video\n                 \n                  'She's a goner': Dominic Cummings predicts timing of Kemi Badenoch's downfall\n                 \n                  Post-Brexit EU reset negotiations 'going to the wire', says minister\n                 In response, the Scottish Labour MSP has branded Mr Farage a \"poisonous little man\" and \"chief clown\", while SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney said: \"He poses a threat to our values and must be stopped.\" But who will come out on top following Thursday's vote? Here are the candidates vying for support: Collette Bradley, Scottish Socialist Party  Scottish Socialist Party candidate Collette Bradley told Sky News that locals she has met while out campaigning have been angry about \"poverty, inequality and Labour's attacks on welfare, our NHS and services\". She added: \"They have little faith in Labour or the SNP delivering change. \"We've offered hope with our unique policy of a socialist MSP who'll remain on the average worker's wage, keeping us firmly in step with constituents' living conditions - we alone reject the corrupting influence of the £75,000 MSP salary. \"We're offering concrete socialist alternatives to the miserable status quo - redistribution of wealth from the millionaires to the millions via progressive taxation.\" Ms Bradley said the party stands for a society built around the \"needs of people, not profit\". She added: \"Ordinary lives can be transformed with measures like a £15-an-hour minimum wage; free public transport; and investment in jobs, wages, quality council housing, NHS, education, welfare and pensions. \"We urge voters to reject the continued failure of the political mainstream and be bolder in their demands by voting Scottish Socialist.\" Andy Brady, Scottish Family Party Candidate Andy Brady told Sky News that Scottish Family Party policies and principles are \"built upon honesty, integrity and a passion to see real change in our nation\". He said: \"My time spent speaking to the locals over the past several weeks has revealed a common response - people are fed up being let down.\" Mr Brady said there had been \"failed promises\" to help local businesses, to repair the roads, and to bring life to the town centres and high streets. He said: \"The general feeling is that communities are feeling jaded and frustrated.\" Urging voters to back the Scottish Family Party, he added: \"We value the families, businesses and the education of our local communities and if we can support them, communities will flourish.\" Ross Lambie, Reform UK South Lanarkshire councillor Ross Lambie is hoping to bring Reform UK's \"turquoise tide\" to Scotland. If Mr Farage's party wins, it will put Scotland's first minister on notice ahead of Holyrood 2026. Mr Lambie, who defected from the Scottish Conservatives, told Sky News: \"It's been refreshing spending the past five or so weeks out on the doors in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"What's been very clear is that people everywhere are fed up, angry and scunnered with the entire Scottish political establishment. \"They're fed up with SNP, Tory and Labour lies and are looking for hope. \"Reform UK is offering people a chance of real and radical change by cutting tax, scrapping net zero, ending wokery and fighting for common sense. \"This is now a clear fight between the SNP and Reform - it's that simple.\" Katy Loudon, Scottish National Party South Lanarkshire councillor Katy Loudon is hoping to retain the seat for the SNP. The former teacher told Sky News she had been speaking to people across the region \"about what matters to them\". She said: \"People understandably feel let down by Labour.\" Ms Loudon highlighted the UK government's axing of the universal winter fuel payment, which led to the Scottish government following suit before a partial U-turn. Scottish Labour-run South Lanarkshire Council also intends to reduce its school transport provision, which Ms Loudon said will affect thousands of children. She added: \"The Labour Party has lost its way, Farage is on the rise as a result. With an invisible candidate, they've totally given up in this by-election. \"Meanwhile, the SNP is focusing on what matters to people and taking action to make things better - with record investment in our NHS, bringing back the winter fuel payment, scrapping peak rail fares and ending Labour's two-child cap. \"Labour know they can't win. Only the SNP can beat Farage on 5 June.\" Janice MacKay, UK Independence Party UKIP candidate Janice MacKay told Sky News that her party would abolish the Scottish parliament if given the opportunity. Speaking of \"widespread disillusionment\" amongst voters, she added: \"UKIP offer something different. \"We wish to radically reduce the number of inadequate politicians in Scotland by abolishing altogether the Holyrood parliament. \"It is merely a glorified and expensive form of local authority. To that end, it is unnecessary.\" Ms MacKay believes the nation's 32 local authorities should be given \"strengthened powers\", with Westminster making the \"main decisions\" affecting the UK. Ms MacKay added: \"Were UKIP to win any seats in the Holyrood talking shop, we should donate 40% of our MSP salary to a Scottish veterans charity.\" Ann McGuinness, Scottish Green Party Scottish Green Party candidate Ann McGuinness is the director of a charity which promotes rural connections and champions rural diversity. The mother-of-two says her own lived experiences of poverty and disability provide her with \"valuable insight\" into the challenges faced by many whose voices are often unheard in the public discourse. She has been described by her party as a \"dedicated feminist and environmental justice campaigner\". As well as promoting climate education, Ms McGuinness is also said to have a \"strong track record of working across party lines to support women in politics\". Ms McGuinness said: \"Every vote for the Scottish Greens will be a positive vote for a fairer and greener Scotland and a brighter future for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. \"If we are to build a truly just and green future, we need to empower every town and village and ensure that no one is left behind.\" Aisha Mir, Scottish Liberal Democrats Scottish Liberal Democrats candidate Aisha Mir told Sky News she has entered politics to \"get things done\". She added: \"For too many people, it feels like nothing works anymore. \"The SNP have failed Scotland for 18 years. The Conservatives are lurching to extremes. Labour are already letting people down. Reform have no real solutions. \"I want to be a hard-working local champion who will put your priorities first.\" Ms Mir said her party offers a vision of Scotland \"that is back to its best\". She added: \"A Scotland where people can see a GP and an NHS dentist in good time. A Scotland that once again gives our children a world-class education. \"A Scotland with a growing economy and growing businesses, where the government looks after your money and works with our neighbours. \"Vote Scottish Liberal Democrats for a candidate who is focused on what really matters to you.\" Richard Nelson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Scottish Conservatives candidate Richard Nelson told Sky News he got into politics \"to make a difference\". The South Lanarkshire councillor and NHS worker said: \"People across this constituency want politicians to be focused on what really matters to them rather than left-wing politicians focusing on their fringe obsessions.\" Mr Nelson said he has seen \"first-hand as an NHS employee the damage the SNP have done to the health service during their 18 years in power\". He added: \"My wife disgracefully had to spend 50 hours on a trolley in A&E recently due to the SNP's neglect of frontline care. \"If people in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse want to have an MSP who will stand up for those who just want politicians to show some common sense for a change, then you should vote for myself and the Scottish Conservatives on Thursday.\" Davy Russell, Scottish Labour Party Scottish Labour candidate Davy Russell told Sky News he has seen \"first-hand the damage the SNP has done\" to the community after almost two decades in power. He said: \"Throughout this campaign, I have been speaking to people who are feeling abandoned by this SNP government. \"People are languishing on long NHS waiting lists, worried about the state of our schools, and sick of seeing our high streets decline - but this is not as good as it gets. \"The SNP don't deserve to win here, and the divisive politics of Reform cannot win. This by-election is a straight choice between more of the same SNP failure or a new direction with Scottish Labour.\" Mr Russell vowed to \"fight tirelessly for the community I love\" if he wins. He added: \"I will stand firmly against the downgrading of the Wishaw Neonatal Unit, campaign for an end to SNP cuts to our local services, and demand real action to tackle the crisis in our NHS. \"This is a chance to not only select a local champion for Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, but to begin to chart a new direction for the whole of Scotland.\" Marc Wilkinson, Independent Marc Wilkinson, a pizza shop owner from the Scottish capital, is the leader of the Edinburgh People party. The businessman is also behind the South Scotland People party, which is part of a bid to establish regional parties across the nation for the Holyrood list vote next year. Mr Wilkinson's aim is for \"the people of Scotland to choose to vote for themselves\". Pledging to take instruction directly from the constituents if he were to win the upcoming by-election, he added: \"Elect me and you will be my boss. Don't choose protest. Choose progress.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  The UK will be forced to agree this month to increase defence spending to 3.5% of national income within a decade as part of a NATO push to rearm and keep the US on side, Sky News understands. The certainty of a major policy shift means there is bemusement in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) about why Sir Keir Starmer's government has tied itself in knots over whether to describe an earlier plan to hit 3% of GDP by the 2030s as an ambition or a commitment, when it is about to change. The problem is seen as political, with the prime minister needing to balance warfare against welfare - more money for bombs and bullets or for winter fuel payments and childcare. Follow live updates: Does the UK need an 'Iron Dome' system? Sir Keir is due to hold a discussion to decide on the defence spending target as early as today, it is understood. As well as a rise in pure defence spending to 3.5% by 2035, he will also likely be forced to commit a further 1.5% of GDP to defence-related areas such as spy agencies and infrastructure. Militaries need roads, railway networks, and airports to deploy at speed. This would bolster total broader defence spending to 5% - a target Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, wants all allies to sign up to at a major summit in the Netherlands later this month. It is being referred to as the \"Hague investment plan\". Asked what would happen at the summit, a defence source said: \"3.5% without a doubt.\" Yet the prime minister reiterated the 3% ambition when he published a major defence review on Monday that placed \"NATO first\" at the heart of UK defence policy.  The defence source said: \"How can you have a defence review that says NATO first\" and then be among the last of the alliance's 32 member states - along with countries like Spain - to back this new goal? Unlike Madrid, London presents itself as the leading European nation in the alliance. A British commander is always the deputy supreme allied commander in Europe - the second most senior operational military officer - under an American commander, while the UK's nuclear weapons are committed to defending the whole of NATO. Even Germany, which has a track record of weak defence spending despite boasting the largest economy, has recently signalled it plans to move investment towards the 5% level, while Canada, also previously feeble, is making similar noises.  The source signalled it was inconceivable the UK would not follow suit and said officials across Whitehall understand the spending target will rise to 3.5%. The source said it would be met by 2035, so three years later than the timeline Mr Rutte has proposed. Defence spending is currently at 2.3%. A second defence source said the UK has to commit to this spending target, \"or else we can no longer call ourselves a leader within NATO\". NATO, as an alliance, cannot force any member state to take a particular decision. But the UK's desire to remain a leading member coupled with the reality that most other allies are agreeing to increase defence spending in line with Mr Rutte's new target is what will force London to act, the defence sources said. George Robertson, former NATO secretary general from 1999 to 2003, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on the Politics Hub 3.5% is \"a little bit beyond\" what most countries are capable of. \"I think 3.5% is beyond Italy, Spain, Portugal, who are all under 2% at the moment, Canada, which is at 1.1% - there's a degree of unrealism about it which encourages people to fake the truth,\" he said. \"In any event, we should be focusing on what the money has been spent on, not the quantity of money itself.\"  Read more:UK to build weapons factoriesRussian-linked hackers targeted MoD Sky News's political editor Beth Rigby challenged the prime minister on the discrepancy between his spending ambitions and those of his allies at a press conference on Monday. Sir Keir seemed to hint change might be coming. \"Of course, there are discussions about what the contribution should be going into the NATO conference in two or three weeks' time,\" he said. \"But that conference is much more about what sort of NATO will be capable of being as effective in the future as it's been in the last 80 years. It is a vital conversation that we do need to have, and we are right at the heart of that.\" New Sky News podcast launches on 10 June - The Wargame simulates an attack by Russia to test UK defences Mr Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, said last week he assumes alliance members will agree to a broad defence spending target of 5% of gross domestic product during the summit in The Hague on 24 and 25 June. NATO can only act if all member states agree. \"Let's say that this 5%, but I will not say what is the individual breakup, but it will be considerably north of 3% when it comes to the hard spend [on defence], and it will be also a target on defence-related spending,\" the secretary general said. The call for more funding comes at a time when allies are warning of growing threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea as well as challenges posed by China. But it also comes as European member states need to make NATO membership seem like a good deal for Donald Trump. The leaders of all allies will meet in The Hague for the two-day summit. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 The US president has repeatedly criticised other member states for failing to meet a current target of spending 2% of national income on defence and has warned the United States would not come to the aid of any nation that is falling short. Since returning to the White House, he has called for European countries to allocate 5% of their GDP to defence. This is more than the 3.4% of GDP currently spent by the US. Mr Rutte is being credited with squaring away a new deal with Mr Trump in a meeting that would see allies increase their defence spending in line with the US president's wishes. The NATO chief is due to visit London on Monday, it is understood."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  Barely a day after lift-off for the Strategic Defence Review, there are serious questions about whether the government needs to go further. It has emerged senior defence figures believe the prime minister will have to bow to pressure from NATO to announce a target of spending 3.5% of GDP within a decade. Trump tariffs cast doubt on UK-US deal - politics latest It's no surprise the 32-member defence alliance - facing its greatest twin challenge since the end of the Cold War - is calling for more money. With Russia bringing war to Europe, and Donald Trump making clear the US is not willing to fund its security indefinitely, countries are already stepping up like never before. What is stark is the widespread acknowledgement in Whitehall that spending 3%, which is still only a government ambition for the next parliament, will be a minimum. The authors of the Strategic Defence Review make clear Britain is most likely to fight a future war not on its own, but as a leader in NATO - and NATO's spending ambitions are soaring.  Money is tight - and there are plenty of priorities The secretary general of NATO, Mark Rutte, is calling for 3.5% on hardware and an overall 5% target for military, cyber and intelligence spending. Keir Starmer's spokesman insisted today it is \"not just about cash\" - the UK steps up as a member with its nuclear programme, combat aircraft, carriers, and the quality of its personnel. But with only a firm commitment to a rise to 2.5% in two years' time, and the Ministry of Defence already over budget on its current commitments, the ambitions set out for 12 new attack submarines, F35 aircraft carrying nuclear warheads and a home guard will require further injections of cash. The government's reluctance to go further at this stage is understandable. The rise to 2.5%, announced by the prime minister in February, required a controversial cut to the foreign aid budget - and the resignation of a cabinet minister. Welfare reforms are causing Labour MPs further pain. As one put it to me: \"The party doesn't, in the main, oppose any of the defence decisions. The fault line will be that if there's money for that, why can't there be money for public services.\" Read more:PM couldn't be clearer - we must prepare for war  Are tax rises inevitable? The price tag of a rise to 3.5%, from 2.5%, would be £30bn a year. Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said \"chunky\" tax rises would be required. \"We could get away with not having tax increases if the economy starts growing much, much faster than it has over the last 15 years,\" he told Sky News. \"But if it doesn't and the government can't think of other bits to stop or cut then inevitably we'll have tax rises.\" 'We have to up our game' Tan Dhesi, chair of the Commons defence committee, who visited the US and spoke to Pentagon and State Department officials last week, said the UK had to \"up its game\" - but also its messaging. \"We've got growing concerns that the wider public may not be aware of,\" he said. \"Firstly, we've got the US. Their stated intention is to focus more elsewhere, on homeland security and the Pacific. They want the Europeans effectively to fund more for themselves. So, we collectively have to increase our focus on spending on defence. \"We've also got the fact that Russia in Ukraine and spending more than 40% of its budget on defence. They're rearming at a rate of knots. Likewise, 30% with China. \"The UK is also the third most targeted nation on the planet in terms of cyberattacks. For all those reasons, we have to up our game.\" He said the push to 3.5% was \"inexorable\", and the prime minister then has \"a very difficult decision to make.\"  Polling by YouGov on Monday showed public support for making cuts in other areas to fund defence spending hikes was 29%, with 53% opposed. The prime minister often says the first duty of his government is to keep people safe. It's particularly acute for him, because of the legacy of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, and because Mr Trump and his push for a ceasefire in Ukraine, which Europe would police, has changed the calculations. But hiking defence spending further will require taking the public with him - and he may not have long to start that work."

Six people were arrested across England on Tuesday morning, with the lead suspect, a 37-year-old Botswana national, detained in Cheltenham. Four other men and one woman, aged between 33 and 50, were also arrested in Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Bradford. Politics latest: Trump's tariffs announcement casts doubt over UK-US deal The suspected gang is alleged to have helped migrants use fake documents to submit asylum claims and gain employment in care homes without adequate training. The Home Office said intelligence suggested the suspected lead smuggler lured people here under false pretences and forced them to do unpaid work. The \"scale of the threat\" meant this was one of the government's highest priority investigations, according to Phillip Parr, an inspector with the Immigration Enforcement's criminal and financial investigation unit. Mr Parr said there was \"no place for those who profit from human misery\" and the operation safeguarded potentially hundreds of people from further exploitation. The raids are part of the government's latest efforts to tackle people smuggling gangs and stop small boat crossings.

However, so far this year a record 13,617 people have crossed the Channel in small boats, compared with 10,775 for the same period last year, and more than previous comparable years. On Saturday, 1,195 people made the crossing, the highest figure so far for 2025.  Speaking to Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips this weekend, Defence Secretary John Healey said Britain had \"lost control of its borders over the last five years\". The government said it was tightening UK visa controls and reducing reliance on overseas workers. Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said Tuesday's raids demonstrate the UK \"will use the full force of the law against those who facilitate illegal entry into the UK for exploitation\"."

        "Content": "Two activists have been convicted of harassing a government minister over the Israel-Hamas war. The pair were found guilty of the charge against Alex Davies-Jones, the Labour MP for Pontypridd. Ayeshah Behit, 31, and Hiba Ahmed, 26, filmed a confrontation with Ms Davies-Jones, who had been campaigning in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, ahead of last year's general election. In evidence she gave during the trial, Ms Davies-Jones said she was \"terrified\" after being confronted on 26 June last year. As she made her way to the meeting place, she saw the defendants with leaflets which described her as a \"full-blown supporter of this genocide\" - referring to the Israel-Hamas conflict. \"They asked me about the ceasefire and why I had abstained. I clarified I hadn't abstained, I wasn't in the country, I was paired in that vote,\" Ms Davies-Jones said. \"It was escalating in terms of passion and intensity. We walked off in the opposite direction. We felt scared and intimidated, and we wanted to leave the situation.\" She said the defendants began to follow her and \"a number of young members\" and were \"shouting and bellowing down the street\" at them. 'Like a unicorn in the wild' Later that day, Behit and Ahmed put posters, that referred to politicians \"enabling genocide\", on Ms Davies-Jones's campaign office in Pontypridd. A video of the confrontation was also uploaded to social media, describing Ms Davies-Jones as racist. Ahmed said the action taken against Ms Davies-Jones \"wasn't really about her, it was about Palestine\". \"I was genuinely really surprised when I saw her. I've lived in Treforest for a couple of years, I've never seen her,\" she said. \"It was like seeing a celebrity almost, like a unicorn in the wild.\" Behit added that their intention was \"to show a different perspective, to get people to do their own research\". Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring sentenced the defendants to a conditional discharge, and both were ordered to pay £650 costs and a £26 court surcharge. \"This was part of a deliberate and sustained campaign targeting the complainant,\" he said. \"This course of conduct was clearly designed to cause alarm and distress to her and she did experience alarm and distress. She stopped canvassing.\" The judge said the case went \"beyond the boundaries\" of freedom of speech and was \"beyond robust scrutiny or political process\". Ahmed, a final-year architecture student at Cardiff University with no previous convictions, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge. Behit, who has a previous conviction relating to a protest in Cardiff last year, was given an 18-month conditional discharge. \"I would love to say you are remorseful. I suspect you are not,\" Mr Goldspring added.

Ms Davies-Jones said in a statement after the conviction that she was \"not the first politician to experience this kind of abuse, and unfortunately probably won't be the last\". \"What today's verdict has shown is that harassment and intimidation of politicians is unacceptable. We are human beings doing our jobs. And now, I'm back to getting on with mine,\" she added."

The device takes and analyses almost 2,000 pictures a minute, in a similar manner to facial recognition, to calculate the level of fluid in the feet and ankles. Such water retention, known as oedema, is one of three major warning signs heart failure is becoming more severe and potentially life threatening. The AI scanner is roughly the size of a smart speaker and can alert healthcare professionals so they can take action, such as increasing the patient's medication. The device, developed by Cambridge-based start-up Heartfelt Technologies, is mounted to the wall and typically installed at a patient's bedside. It automatically takes 1,800 pictures a minute of the foot and lower leg and multiple angles, only scanning the legs to a height of 50cm off the floor, and then uses AI to calculate the level of fluid they contain. It also works without wifi. The Foot Study, which is being presented at the British Cardiovascular Society annual conference in Manchester, suggests the alerts come 13 days before a person would end up in hospital. \n                  Voiceover artist Gayanne Potter urging ScotRail to remove her voice from new AI announcements\n                 \n                  Mum can continue lawsuit against AI chatbot firm she holds responsible for son's death\n                 \n                  Former spy chief on Gaza, China, and cyber warfare\n                 It used the AI device to monitor 26 heart failure patients from five NHS trusts who were enrolled between 2020 and 2022 and asked them to weigh themselves using Bluetooth-enabled scales. Seven instances of worsening heart failure were detected in six patients, while one death from the condition was recorded. Researchers found in patients enrolled in the study for at least two weeks before an alert was triggered, the average lead time before hospital admission was 13 days. The lead time averaged eight days when all five triggers picked up by the device were analysed. The study also found monitoring using scales failed to predict any heart failure-related hospital admissions, with researchers suggesting this was because patients struggled to stick to tracking their weight, whereas the AI device did not require any action. The early warning provided by the device could allow specialist staff to react quickly to changes in a patient's condition, potentially allowing them to stay out of hospital. Dr Philip Keeling, senior author of the study and a consultant cardiologist at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"Only about half of people admitted to hospital with heart failure currently get assigned an early review by a heart failure nurse who can check to see if they are suffering a harmful build-up of fluid because their heart is not working properly. \"Amid a shortage of heart failure nurses, a device like this can be like a virtual nurse, tracking people's health.\" Heart failure is a long-term condition where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly, typically because it has become too weak or stiff, and is estimated to affect 920,000 people in the UK. The three main symptoms indicating the condition is getting worse are increased breathlessness, weight gain and swelling in the legs or ankles. Discussing the findings, Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: \"This small study suggests a simple device could significantly improve outcomes for at-risk patients with heart failure by keeping them out of hospital. \"This study is a good example of how technology might aid earlier interventions and treatment, by allowing people to track a key sign of their heart health at home.\""

A study which followed almost 50,000 women over a 32-year period found those who drank caffeinated coffee in midlife were more likely to stay sharp, strong and mentally well as they aged. However, the researchers did not find any links with tea or decaf coffee. They also found drinking caffeinated soft drinks such as cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy ageing. \"While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee's impact across multiple domains of ageing over three decades,\" said Dr Sara Mahdavi, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University. \"The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee - not tea or decaf - may uniquely support ageing trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function.\" The study collected dietary and health data from 47,513 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study every four years from 1984, with the researchers assessing caffeine intake using food frequency questionnaires that included the consumption of major contributors of caffeine such as coffee, tea, cola and decaffeinated coffee. Healthy ageing was defined as living to the age of 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, having good mental health and physical function, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints. By 2016, 3,706 women met those requirements, and among them they typically consumed an average of 315mg of caffeine a day - roughly the equivalent of three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups. The study found each extra cup of coffee a day was linked to a 2-5% higher chance of doing well later in life - up to five cups, or around 2.5 cups according to today's measures. The study also found each additional small glass of fizzy drink was associated with a 20-26% lower likelihood of healthy ageing.

They said coffee contains a range of compounds that could act together to influence ageing pathways and said they plan to investigate how specific bioactive compounds in coffee interact with genetic and metabolic markers, especially in women. \"These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,\" said Dr Mahdavi. \"Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviours such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking. \"While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy ageing, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.\" Dr Mahdavi presented the team's findings at the American Society for Nutrition's annual conference in Orlando. The NHS says for most adults consuming up to 400mg of caffeine, roughly the equivalent of four cups of coffee, is generally considered safe."

Jonathan Joss, 59, was found injured by police in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday evening. Officers tried to save him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The actor's husband claimed the gunman shouted \"violent homophobic slurs\" before opening fire, and that Joss had pushed him out the way to save his life. \"He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other,\" alleged Tristan Kern de Gonzales on Facebook. He said the couple had previously faced harassment from neighbours, much of it \"openly homophobic\". Joss's husband said they had been checking for mail at his old home - which earlier this year burned down in a fire that killed their three dogs - when they noticed the skull of one of the animals in front of the property. He said they began \"yelling and crying\" and claimed they were approached by a man who threatened them with a gun. \"We were standing side by side,\" said Mr Kern de Gonzales. \"When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way.

Joss is best known for voicing Native American character John Redcorn in cult show King Of The Hill, which ran for 13 series and more than 250 episodes from 1997 to 2009.

The suspect is being held in a detention centre in San Antonio, but the lawyer representing him could not be traced as they were not listed in court records."

        "Content": " An Australian woman accused of murdering her estranged husband's parents and an aunt by serving them a beef wellington laced with poisonous mushrooms has given evidence in court. Mother-of-two Erin Patterson, 50, is charged with the 2023 murders of her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail Patterson's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66, along with the attempted murder of Reverend Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband. Patterson denies all the charges, claiming the deaths were a \"terrible accident\". The prosecution alleges she served guests the meal knowing it contained deadly death cap mushrooms, also known as Amanita phalloides. Appearing as a witness for her own defence at the Supreme Court of Victoria, Patterson said she had been foraging mushrooms since 2020. She also became emotional when speaking about Don and Gail. Patterson's estranged husband, as well as the sole survivor of the alleged poisoning, Reverend Wilkinson, previously took to the stand, offering new details about what allegedly happened. Here's what we know so far. An unexpected invitation Patterson invited the four alleged victims for lunch at her home in Leongatha, a small town in Melbourne, on 29 July 2023, along with her estranged husband Simon Patterson. Mr Patterson told the court that although he and Erin Patterson had separated amicably in 2015, their relationship had deteriorated by late 2022. He said he had listed them as financially separated on a tax return, which triggered a series of child support payments that meant he would no longer pay their two children's private school fees directly, he told the court. Speaking to the court through tears, Mr Patterson said: \"I was sure she was very upset about that.\" Their soured relationship meant he repeatedly declined invitations to his estranged wife's home for lunch - including on the day in question. He told the court he did not feel comfortable attending. Text messages between Patterson and her husband read out in court revealed she found his decision not to come \"really disappointing\" as she had spent time and money preparing the \"special meal\". Reverend Wilkinson told the court that Patterson asked his wife Heather if the couple were free for the lunch. He said they had most of their interactions with Patterson at social gatherings such as Christmas parties at Don and Gail Patterson's house. \"There was no reason given for the lunch, and I remember talking to Heather wondering why the sudden invitation,\" Mr Wilkinson told the court, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). But he said the pair were \"very happy to be invited\". Later the couple found out Don and Gail were invited, too. Patterson's daughter, according to ABC, told the court that her mum organised a trip to the cinema for her and her brother in advance of the lunch. Sole survivor gives details about the lunch Reverend Wilkinson recalled his wife being keen to see Patterson's pantry because she was organising a similar space at their home. According to ABC, he told the court he noticed Patterson was \"very reluctant\" about them going to see it, and thought it was possibly because it was a mess, but he didn't go to look. He told the court Heather and Gail offered to help plate up the food, but Patterson rejected the offer and prepared the plates alone. Each plate had a serving of mashed potatoes, green beans and an individual beef wellington. The death cap is one of the most toxic mushrooms on the planet and is involved in the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide.  The species contains three main groups of toxins: amatoxins, phallotoxins, and virotoxins.  From these, amatoxins are primarily responsible for the toxic effects in humans.  The alpha-amanitin amatoxin has been found to cause protein deficit and ultimately cell death, although other mechanisms are thought to be involved.  The liver is the main organ that fails due to the poison, but other organs are also affected, most notably the kidneys.  The effects usually begin after a short latent period and include gastrointestinal disorders followed by jaundice, seizures, coma, and, eventually, death.  Patterson said the mushrooms were a mixture of button mushrooms purchased at a supermarket, and dried mushrooms purchased at an Asian grocery store in Melbourne several months ago, which were in a hand-labelled packet. Reverend Wilkinson said the four guests were given large grey dinner plates, while Patterson ate from a smaller, tan-coloured plate. He said he remembered his wife pointing this out after they became ill. The reverend said he and his wife ate their full servings, while Don ate his own and half of his wife's. Reverend Wilkinson said that after the meal, Patterson fabricated a cancer diagnosis, suggesting the lunch was put together so that she could ask them the best way to tell her children about the illness. The prosecution said she did this to justify the children's absence. The defence does not dispute that Patterson lied about having cancer. Patterson tears up in court Appearing as a witness for her own defence at the beginning of June, Patterson said she accepted there must have been death cap mushrooms in the beef wellington she made, according to the ABC. She also said she began foraging for mushrooms around the towns of Korumburra and Leongatha during the COVID lockdowns in 2020. After picking the mushrooms, she said she would use a food dehydrator to dry and preserve them to have them available later in the year. Prosecutors earlier claimed the defendant denied ever owning a food dehydrator, but police traced one owned by her to a nearby dump that was later found to contain death cap mushrooms. Defence lawyer Colin Mandy also questioned Patterson about a series of expletive-laden messages sent to friends regarding the Patterson family. \"I wish I'd never said it. I feel ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn't have to hear that I said that,\" Patterson told the court about the messages. Talking through tears, she added: \"I was really frustrated with Simon, but it wasn't Don and Gail's fault.\" The court previously heard the relationship between Patterson and her estranged husband deteriorated shortly before the alleged murders due to a disagreement over child support. It is not known how long Patterson will give evidence for or whether she will be cross-examined by the prosecution. Patterson's children 'ate leftovers after guests went to hospital' All four alleged victims had fallen ill and were experiencing severe vomiting and diarrhoea by midnight on the day of the lunch. Patterson says she also became ill hours after eating the meal. Her daughter, according to the ABC, told the court she remembers Patterson telling her she had diarrhoea that night. Her four guests were taken to hospital the following day, with all of their liver tests showing \"abnormal\" results, the court was told. Patterson claims she and her children ate leftovers from the beef wellington on the same day. Her daughter told the court she remembered this, and that her mum didn't eat much because she was still feeling unwell. The mum said she scraped the mushrooms off the plates in advance because she knew her children didn't like them. Patterson went to hospital two days after the lunch, where she initially discharged herself against medical advice, the court was told. She had mild symptoms of illness, but further tests revealed no evidence of toxins consistent with death cap mushroom poisoning, the prosecution said. A nurse at the hospital where she was treated told the court she \"didn't look unwell like Ian and Heather\", who were at the same hospital. Hospital staff have said Patterson resisted attempts by doctors to have her two children tested after she told them they had eaten some of the leftovers, saying she did not want to frighten them. Gail and Heather died on Friday 4 August 2023, while Don died a day later. Reverend Wilkinson spent seven weeks in hospital but survived. Police previously said the symptoms of all four of those who became ill were consistent with poisoning from death cap mushrooms, which are responsible for 90% of all toxic mushroom-related fatalities.
