        "Content": " A father has been found guilty of murdering his daughter after he stabbed her in the heart at their home in Darlington. Simon Vickers, 50, was convicted of murder at Teesside Crown Court on Monday. He gave different accounts of what happened in the moments before he plunged a kitchen knife into his daughter Scarlett's chest last July. Vickers claimed his daughter was wounded during a family play-fight in the kitchen and that it was a \"freak accident\". But prosecutors said the 11cm wound was too deep to have been caused accidentally, and the knife must have been \"held firmly\" at the time. The 14-year-old died at the scene. Vickers had been drinking wine, watching the Euros football tournament on television and had smoked cannabis that day. Scarlett's mother, Sarah Hall, was making spaghetti bolognese for the family and, when Scarlett came down from her bedroom, they all started throwing grapes at each other for fun. She said she then snipped at her partner with tongs and when he complained that it hurt, their daughter made reference to him being \"wimpy\". Ms Hall said she turned away to serve the meal and then heard Scarlett say \"ow\" and immediately saw that their only child was bleeding heavily. She made a 999 call and told the operator they had been \"messing about\" and that her partner had thrown something at their daughter \"and he didn't realise\". Prosecutor Mark McKone KC told jurors paramedic Andrew Crow said initially Vickers and Ms Hall were unsure how the injury occurred. \"Then Scarlett's mum said that Scarlett and her dad were play-fighting and 'chucking' knives at each other,\" Mr McKone continued. \"Mr Crow said that the defendant picked up a knife off the side counter of the kitchen and said 'We were messing, we were play-fighting and she lunged towards me and it just went in'.\" Giving evidence in his defence, Vickers claimed he had swiped what he thought were tongs along a work surface, into Scarlett's chest, and didn't realise it was a knife. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton told the jury the way the knife went into the teenager's chest meant it must have been held in a hand, with force. Scarlett's mother - the only other person in the kitchen at the time - stood by her partner of 27 years and told the court Vickers loved their daughter and would never harm her. Mr McKone said the prosecution accepted Vickers was \"devastated\" and loved his daughter - but the blow could not have been caused by the knife being accidentally swiped across a work surface and so deeply into her body. Jurors took 13 hours and 21 minutes to convict Vickers of murder by a majority of 10-2, rather than the less serious alternative of manslaughter, or to clear him. Vickers did not visibly react in the dock, while Ms Hall and other family members in the public gallery looked stunned by the verdict.

He said Vickers \"will bear moral responsibility for his daughter's death for the rest of his life\". Mr Lumley added: \"However, he denies completely that he did anything unlawful or deliberate to cause that tragic death.\" Detective Superintendent Craig Rudd, of Durham Constabulary, said: \"Scarlett Vickers would have celebrated her 16th birthday this year. She had her whole life ahead of her. Yet it was cruelly cut short by her own father - a man who was meant to protect her. \"We may never know why or what caused Simon Vickers to do what he did that night. \"Sadly, today's verdict will not bring Scarlett back, but he will now face the consequences of his actions.\" Vickers - who had denied both the murder and the manslaughter of his only child - will be sentenced on 10 February."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n  Congolese soldiers solemnly moved through the streets of downtown Goma - with white bands around their heads and their hands empty of guns.  They are battered from days of non-stop fighting and surrendering to the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels taking control of the regional capital and humanitarian hub. Congolese soldiers laid down their fatigues on the road near the watch posts we saw them in just 24 hours before. The sounds of nearby shelling break the sombre mood. The sense of capture is palpable. But some soldiers are still fighting. There are pockets of resistance in streets across town and the sounds of automatic gunfire and shelling are almost constant. Our hotel has become a shelter for some families waiting to see what happens next. As the hours of battle drag on, some are sleeping on couches in the lobby. The hotel staff watch the windows as the fight comes to the street in front of our gate. \"I am scared but hoping peace will prevail. I am concerned for my family because I haven't seen them since yesterday. I have only been communicating with them over the phone,\" says 27-year-old driver Bahati Jean Claude. \"I just want the conflict to end. I don't care who is in charge of Goma, all I care about is peace.\" Eyewitness:Sky News team in DRC attacked as civilians flee Peace is far from reality in Goma right now - at least 17 people have been killed and 370 injured. Prisoners who had been working to escape the central prison on Monday morning managed to break out by the afternoon. Looting was reported in the airport and other parts of town. In a day of echoing blasts and the crack of bullets, the sounds started from a different direction. High-level security sources in town confirmed mortars and artillery coming from Rwanda as we heard the shift. Foreign news reporter Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) risks spilling over into a regional war, it is feared, as Rwanda-backed rebels claim to have captured the key city of Goma. The leader of a rebel alliance that includes the M23 group said fighters have taken the city, after making significant territorial gains in recent weeks. Hundreds of people are being wounded every day as fighting in the central African country continues, worsening the humanitarian crisis there. Read more on the fighting in the DRC and why it's happening. We spoke to the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) spokesperson, who says they fired into eastern DRC in retaliation. \"Rockets were fired across the DRC/Rwanda border in Rubavu district, western province, and five civilians have lost their lives and 35 were seriously injured,\" Brigadier-General Ronald Rwivanga tells us on a video call. \"They are currently undergoing medical treatment in the medical facilities nearby. We are just taking all necessary defensive measures to protect the population living along the border. \"And we will continue to play our role, our primary role of protecting the territory or integrity of Rwanda.\" Throughout the day, videos emerged of Congolese troops surrendering to Rwandan soldiers - wearing the white headbands we saw on those walking in the street in front of our hotel. Brigadier-General Rwivanga denies the presence of Rwandan troops in DRC and arms support to M23 rebels. A UN panel of experts reported, however, that around 3,000 to 5,000 Rwandan troops were in DRC as of last year. On Sunday, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the RDF to stop supporting the M23 and \"to withdraw from the territory of the DRC\"."

        "Content": "David Coote has revealed he turned to drugs because he feared coming out as gay while working as a Premier League referee in his first interview since being sacked. The 42-year-old was fired in December by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after a video emerged of him appearing to make derogatory remarks about Liverpool and their former manager Jurgen Klopp. In an interview with The Sun, he talked about the challenges of his work schedule, the abuse he received as a referee and his \"struggles dealing with hiding\" his sexuality.  \"I don't recognise myself in the cocaine video,\" he said. \"I can't resonate with how I felt then, but that was me. I was struggling with the schedule and there was no opportunity to stop. And so I found myself in that position - escaping.\" He said: \"I felt a deep sense of shame during my teenage years in particular. \"I didn't come out to my parents until I was 21. I didn't come out to my friends until I was 25. \"My sexuality isn't the only reason that led me to be in that position. But I'm not telling an authentic story if I don't say that I'm gay, and that I've had real struggles dealing with hiding that. \"I hid my emotions as a young ref and I hid my sexuality as well - a good quality as a referee but a terrible quality as a human being. \"And that's led me to a whole course of behaviours.\" In a statement to Sky News, Coote said: \"This has been one of the most difficult periods of my life. I take full responsibility for my actions, which fell way below what was expected of me. \"I am truly sorry for any offence caused by my actions and for the negative spotlight it put on the game that I love. \"I hope people will understand that they were private moments taken during very low times in my life. They do not reflect who I am today or what I think. \"My focus now is on continuing to prioritise my mental health and wellbeing. I hope that my experiences, both on and off the field, can be utilised in football at some point in the future.\" Coote went on to thank those who have supported him. In November, the Football Association launched a separate investigation into allegations Coote discussed giving a yellow card ahead of a Leeds match in 2019. Coote refutes the allegations."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Chipmaker Nvidia saw almost $600bn wiped off its market value - the biggest drop in US stock market history - as a low-cost AI competitor from China took chunks out of several tech firms.  Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet all saw their stocks come under pressure as investors questioned whether their share prices, already widely viewed as overblown following a two-year AI-led frenzy, were justified. Market analysts put the combined losses in market value across US tech at well over $1trn (£802bn). Money latest: Cost of European holidays surge Leading AI chipmaker Nvidia's shares bled 11% at the open on Wall Street but were up to 17% lower during afternoon dealing, while the tech-focused Nasdaq index slid by more than 3%. The declines were all put down to the emergence late last week of a Chinese AI chatbot that uses lower-cost chips. It has since become the most popular free application on Apple's App Store across the US. \n                  Money blog: Top credit card firms face lawsuit which could be worth £4bn; Britain's oldest brewer warns prices to rise\n                 \n                  Luxury yacht-builder Fairline collapses just weeks after sale\n                 \n                  Heathrow: What are the airport's expansion plans and why are they controversial?\n                 Analysis: AI now not just a contest between Californian tech bros with macho budgets, but between superpowers Start-up DeepSeek said its free app uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players' own large language assistants. The market response intensified later in the day despite revelations DeepSeek was limiting new registrations due to the fallout from a cyberattack and complications caused by high demand. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said the company's cost claims had placed in doubt the market's AI-led dominance of the past two years that have seen AI-linked stocks repeatedly hit new highs. He said of the repercussions: \"It could mean less demand for chips, less need for a massive build-out of power production to fuel the models, and less need for large-scale data centres. \"However, it could also mean that AI becomes more accessible and help kickstart the development of a wide array of useful applications,\" he added. DeepSeek's AI assistant is certainly proving popular, having overtaken ChatGPT on the App Store. The chatbot's performance has even attracted praise from US rivals despite questions continuing to swirl over the 2023-founded company's technological development. It was achieved despite tech export controls, designed to protect US patents, imposed on China by president Joe Biden in 2021. Nvidia responded to the sell-off in its shares with a statement suggesting that DeepSeek's progress demonstrated the usefulness of its chips for the Chinese market and argued that more of its chips will be needed in future to meet demand for DeepSeek's services. The share price movements will likely be of concern to Mr Biden's successor in the White House, Donald Trump, who has long accused Chinese firms of profiting from US technology. Read more from Sky News:Ryanair profits nearly 10 times higherHobbycraft owner circles WH Smith It also remains to be seen whether he will see the competition as aggressive towards US firms, having already indicated he is minded to allow Chinese-owned TikTok to escape a US ban but through shared ownership to help offset national security concerns. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said DeepSeek's progress could mark an own goal for the world's largest economy. \"The US government - both under Donald Trump and previously under Joe Biden - have been trying to stop China from accessing Western technology. \"That strategy might have backfired as it looks to have encouraged China to ramp up efforts to build its own technology and we're now seeing evidence that the country is making waves.\" Market experts said AI customers could ultimately benefit from a share price bounce once the market settled due to improved competition bringing down prices. Away from the United States, another company licking its wounds on Monday was SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm. Its shares were 8% down on the day, erasing all the gains seen since last week when Mr Trump announced SoftBank was part of an investment of up to $500bn (£400bn) in US AI infrastructure."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n  Members of one of Scotland's largest paedophile gangs - who ran a \"monstrous\" child sex abuse ring in a Glasgow drugs den - have each been sentenced to an order for lifelong restriction. Warning: This story contains graphic content and details of sexual abuse An order for lifelong restriction (OLR) is a life-long sentence usually reserved for the most serious court cases in Scotland that do not involve murder. During a two-month trial, a court heard how three children were introduced to a world of Class A drugs and alcohol where they were regularly exposed to sexual abuse and violence. A jury heard how there had been \"rape nights\" at the hands of the heroin addicts. The youngsters, who referred to the location of their abuse as the \"beastie house\", claimed money was exchanged after the heinous sex attacks while some of the attackers laughed. Judge Lord Beckett described the trial at the High Court in Glasgow in 2023 as \"unpleasant and shocking\". He added: \"It plunges to the depths of human depravity.\" Seven people - Iain Owens, Elaine Lannery, Lesley Williams, Paul Brannan, Scott Forbes, Barry Watson, and John Clark - were all found guilty of rape and sexual assault. Owens, Lannery, Williams and Brannan were also found guilty of attempting to murder a child by trapping them in various places including a microwave and a cupboard. In addition, Owens, Williams and Brannan were convicted of drugs offences. All seven were handed an OLR and placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely when they appeared back in the dock on Monday. Owens was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years behind bars; Lannery 17 years; Williams 14 years; Brannan 15 years; Forbes eight years; Watson nine-and-a-half years; and Clark 10 years. If ever paroled from jail following the \"punishment part\" of their sentence, they will be subject to risk management for the rest of their life. If they go on to commit another crime once released back into the community, they will face being recalled back to prison. 'You may never be released' Sentencing them, Lord Beckett warned: \"What you - and the community - should understand is that you may never be released.\" The judge added: \"This court is used to hearing about some of the worst examples of human behaviour but such depravity as you displayed against young children is beyond my experience. \"As was said in the aftermath of the trial, this is not typical behaviour. Such extreme abuse of children seems to be rare. \"In contrast to your awful abuse, the trial also heard evidence demonstrating the best of human qualities. \"[The] children showed extraordinary fortitude, strength and stamina undergoing months and years of interviews as investigators struggled to discover and comprehend the full extent of what you had done to them.\"  'No remorse' An eighth person, Marianne Gallagher, was convicted of assault but was cleared of all other charges. The 40-year-old, who hit and kicked a child, had her sentence deferred for a year for good behaviour and was released on bail. Returning to the dock earlier in January 2025, it was noted by Lord Beckett that Gallagher had shown \"no remorse\". The judge told Gallagher, who gave birth to a son last year and continues to struggle with addiction: \"If you offend further, you will find yourself in pretty severe trouble.\" A further three people - Mark Carr, Richard Gachagan, and Leona Laing - were acquitted by the jury. 'Off the scale devious' argument dismissed The offences, involving the children, happened between 2012 and 2019. Defence lawyers had argued the children may not have been telling the truth, but prosecutors said it would be \"off the scale devious\" to make up crimes of the \"most monstrous kind\". Charges related to causing the children to take part in seances and witchcraft were dropped by the prosecution, and all 11 of those who stood trial were acquitted of killing dogs. Following the gang's conviction in November 2023, the NSPCC's development director Matt Forde told Sky News it was a \"truly shocking\" case. Mr Forde added: \"You can only imagine the terror and miserable existence that these children had.\" Police Scotland said more than 1,000 lines of inquiry were progressed by the investigation team. Detective Inspector Lesley-Ann McGee said: \"I hope today's outcome can help the young victims in moving forward. \"This was a long, complex and challenging investigation for a team of officers and staff who had to work through the most harrowing evidence to bring those responsible for these despicable crimes to justice.\" Read more from Sky News:Father guilty of murdering daughter after 'play-fight'E-fit released after woman 'pushed into car and raped' The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) commended the bravery of the young victims. Katrina Parkes, Scotland's procurator fiscal for high court sexual offences, added: \"Their strength has resulted in the conviction and sentence of their abusers for these heinous crimes. \"Prosecuting this case has been complex and a challenging task for our experienced prosecutors. \"Consideration of the trauma these children suffered was utmost while working to secure these convictions.\" Colin Anderson, independent chair of Glasgow's Child Protection Committee, said he has initiated the process of undertaking a case learning review. The overall purpose of a learning review is to improve and develop systems to better protect children and young people."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Ed Miliband has said the expansion of Heathrow and other airports \"won't go ahead\" if they don't meet the UK's emissions targets - putting him on a potential collision course with Rachel Reeves. The chancellor has not commented directly on whether she would support a third runway at Heathrow, but she has indicated she would be prepared to overrule environmental objections to allow the project to go ahead. Ms Reeves has been emphasising that growth is the UK's number one priority and is expected to use a speech on Wednesday to support the expansion, as well as similar plans for Gatwick and Luton. But appearing in front of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, Mr Miliband - the cabinet minister responsible for pushing forward the government's net zero agenda - struck a different tone to the chancellor. He told MPs that any aviation expansion must take place within the UK's carbon budgets, including the 2050 target to reduce emissions by 100% compared with 1990 levels. Independent advisers on the government's Climate Change Committee (CC) have called for no net airport expansion without a proper national plan to curb emissions from the aviation sector and manage passenger capacity.

Asked directly if she would now put the runway, along with expansion at Gatwick and Luton ahead of the UK's net zero commitments, Ms Reeves said: \"I'm not going to comment on speculation, but what I would say is when the last government faced difficult decisions about whether to support infrastructure investment, the answer always seemed to be no. \"We can't carry on like that, because if we do, we will miss out on crucial investment here into Britain. You've already seen a number of decisions, including on Stansted and City Airport, on energy projects, on transport infrastructure, because we are determined to grow the economy.\"  On Monday evening Ms Reeves addressed a meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Party (PLP) to push the case for growth - but did not mention Heathrow specifically. She told Labour MPs her speech on Wednesday would be about \"economic growth built on the platform of stability\", adding there were \"no easy routes out\". She said: \"There are always reasons for government to say no. \"Over the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying no. That must change. We must start saying yes.\" A spokesman for the chancellor said there had been \"overwhelming support\" for her as she addressed the PLP and that Ruth Cadbury, the chair of the Transport Select Committee, was the only dissenting voice. They said Ms Reeves declined to comment on speculation about an announcement regarding the runway. He said: \"There was overwhelming support for what Rachel had to say, overwhelming support for the need to build infrastructure, overwhelming support for the government's agenda to reform the planning system.\" Last week Mr Miliband ruled out resigning from the government if it gives the third runway the go-ahead.

One Labour MP in London told Sky News they would only support Heathrow expansion if it met the tests Labour outlined in its manifesto around air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits. \"Heathrow have to put their money where their mouth is and present the evidence,\" they said."

        "Content": "Fresh weather warnings for heavy rain and wind have been issued for parts of England and Wales by the Met Office after a weekend of battering by Storm Eowyn. Following miserable weekend weather which saw record wind speeds of 114mph as Storm Eowyn swept through the UK, new warnings have been put in place as the low pressure that caused Spanish-named Storm Herminia arrives. A warning for periods of heavy rain that could cause some flooding of roads and properties was in place for most of Wales and some of the West Midlands until 9pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office predicting 20mm to 40mm to fall quite widely and 50mm to 60mm on higher ground. A yellow warning for rain was also in place in London as well as the southeast and southwest of England until 10am Tuesday. A yellow wind warning is in place for the east of England, London and the southeast, the southwest of England and Wales until 6am Tuesday. A major incident has been declared in Somerset due to overnight flooding, with residents in the worst-hit areas being evacuated from their homes. More than 50 flood warnings are in place for England and two in Scotland as the country recovers from Storm Eowyn. In the coming days, much of the week will see rain in various parts of the UK. Sky weather producer Chris England said: \"Looking further ahead, it will be very windy again tomorrow in the south with widespread heavy showers, some prolonged, and a risk of hail and thunder. \"On Wednesday, it will be calmer with showers in the north, mainly near north-facing coasts, with the possibility of rain in the Channel brushing the far south of England. \"Thursday will be mostly fine, but rain will move across Ireland and Northern Ireland into the northwest later, and this could be heavy over western Scotland for a time overnight. \"Then, on Friday, one band of mostly light rain will clear the southeast across England by early afternoon, with more rain moving into the northwest overnight.\" It comes after Storm Eowyn wreaked havoc in different parts of the UK and Ireland, with the Met Office issuing a swathe of red warnings as record wind speeds were recorded. Hundreds of thousands lost power after Storm Eowyn hit on Friday, bringing hurricane-force winds to parts of Ireland and the UK. Around 65,000 homes and businesses remained without power in Northern Ireland, 278,000 in Ireland and 8,000 in Scotland following Storm Eowyn, as at 11.30am. Hundreds of thousands have been reconnected. Ten schools in Northern Ireland remain closed on Monday due to storm damage, with around 80 schools still without power. There was ongoing travel disruption due to the high winds, with Network Rail working on repairs and reopening lines when safe to do so, after train operator ScotRail reported it had received reports of 500 incidents across its network and more than 120 trees falling on to tracks. Two men aged 19 and 20 died in two separate incidents relating to Storm Eowyn. The 19-year-old died after his car was struck by a falling tree in Mauchline, East Ayrshire, on Friday morning, Kacper Dudek, 20, died in County Donegal, Ireland, on Friday morning when a tree fell on his car. While not as powerful as Storm Eowyn, Storm Herminia was named by meteorologists in Spain as it formed in the north Atlantic. It was expected to bring strong winds as it headed toward the UK. Chris England said that while it is a storm, it is unlikely that it would have been a named storm in the UK as it's effects won't be felt as strongly as they will in Spain and France. He added: \"That doesn't mean it won't have impacts here, especially with structural weakening following Eowyn.\""

Christopher Bell, 45, ran out of his house barefoot after Ian Langley, 54, who had thrown a stone and smashed a window at his home in Shiney Row near Sunderland on 3 October 2023. Bell left the door open and his two XL bully dogs got out, joining the chase and overtaking their owner, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said Mr Langley had run for about 100m before he was brought to the floor by the larger of the two dogs, Titan, who latched on to his neck. Bell was eventually able to pull the dog off and drag him back to his house, before he returned to the scene and called emergency services. Mr Langley was taken to hospital but had suffered \"catastrophic injuries to his neck\" and was pronounced dead. Titan was destroyed at the scene, while Bell's other dog, Sapphire, was taken away and euthanised, the court heard. Titan had attacked two dogs in the months leading up to the incident and was \"known to local residents,\" the court heard. Mr Perks said on 26 July 2022 the dog ran into the street and attacked a Yorkshire terrier, while Bell \"asked bystanders for a cigarette lighter to burn his dog's nose\" to get him to release the terrier. In June 2023, both Bell's dogs were off leads when they attacked another dog in a \"savage\" incident lasting five to 10 minutes. It was only halted when Bell appeared and threw water over them. Mr Perks said Bell had failed to act on prior knowledge of his dog's behaviour.

He taught me to make time for others and give to those less fortunate.\" He said changes to the law following an \"alarming increase in fatal dog attacks\" in 2023 \"sadly came too late for my dad\". The court heard Bell was \"profoundly sorry for what has happened\". A judge heard Bell \"had no quarrel\" with Mr Langley and what prompted him to smash the window remains unknown. Judge Carolyn Scott jailed Bell for three years and banned him from owning a dog indefinitely."

        "Content": "Bristol City Council could become the first local authority in England to collect black bin household waste every four weeks. The council said it \"firmly\" believes that collecting black bin waste every three or four weeks instead of once a fortnight \"will increase the amount of waste our city recycles, reduce costs and significantly lower carbon emissions\". The Guardian reported that if it does move to four-weekly collections, the council will be the first in England to do so. Bristol's Green-led council launched a six-week consultation on managing household waste on Monday. Explaining the consultation on its website, Councillor Martin Fodor, chair of the council's environment and sustainability committee, said changing to less frequent collections could cut the amount of waste going to landfill or being burned by \"between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes\". He referenced the examples of Salford and Rhondda Cynon Taf as evidence. Black bin waste is collected every three weeks in both areas. Bristol is home to about 483,000 people living in more than 191,000 households, with each person creating up to 400kg (882 lbs) of household waste a year. For the past two years, the city has recycled about 45% of its household waste, which puts it \"amongst the top tier of cities in the UK\", but the rate is dropping, and the national target is to recycle 65% by 2035. Councillor Fodor said the current methods of dealing with black bin waste - incineration or landfill - have \"serious environmental and cost issues\". New charges on disposing of black bin waste by those methods will cost the city a further £8m a year, meaning, he said, it will \"very soon start to cost every household a lot more unless we do something about it\". \"Burning or leaving waste to decompose in landfill releases carbon and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. This in turn pollutes the air around us and also contributes to fuelling climate change,\" he added.

I take full responsibility for my actions, which fell way below what was expected of me. \"I am truly sorry for any offence caused by my actions and for the negative spotlight it put on the game that I love. \"I hope people will understand that they were private moments taken during very low times in my life.

        "Content": " A father has been found guilty of murdering his daughter after he stabbed her in the heart at their home in Darlington. Simon Vickers, 50, was convicted of murder at Teesside Crown Court on Monday. He gave different accounts of what happened in the moments before he plunged a kitchen knife into his daughter Scarlett's chest last July. Vickers claimed his daughter was wounded during a family play-fight in the kitchen and that it was a \"freak accident\". But prosecutors said the 11cm wound was too deep to have been caused accidentally, and the knife must have been \"held firmly\" at the time. The 14-year-old died at the scene. Vickers had been drinking wine, watching the Euros football tournament on television and had smoked cannabis that day. Scarlett's mother, Sarah Hall, was making spaghetti bolognese for the family and, when Scarlett came down from her bedroom, they all started throwing grapes at each other for fun. She said she then snipped at her partner with tongs and when he complained that it hurt, their daughter made reference to him being \"wimpy\". Ms Hall said she turned away to serve the meal and then heard Scarlett say \"ow\" and immediately saw that their only child was bleeding heavily. She made a 999 call and told the operator they had been \"messing about\" and that her partner had thrown something at their daughter \"and he didn't realise\". Prosecutor Mark McKone KC told jurors paramedic Andrew Crow said initially Vickers and Ms Hall were unsure how the injury occurred. \"Then Scarlett's mum said that Scarlett and her dad were play-fighting and 'chucking' knives at each other,\" Mr McKone continued. \"Mr Crow said that the defendant picked up a knife off the side counter of the kitchen and said 'We were messing, we were play-fighting and she lunged towards me and it just went in'.\" Giving evidence in his defence, Vickers claimed he had swiped what he thought were tongs along a work surface, into Scarlett's chest, and didn't realise it was a knife. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton told the jury the way the knife went into the teenager's chest meant it must have been held in a hand, with force. Scarlett's mother - the only other person in the kitchen at the time - stood by her partner of 27 years and told the court Vickers loved their daughter and would never harm her. Mr McKone said the prosecution accepted Vickers was \"devastated\" and loved his daughter - but the blow could not have been caused by the knife being accidentally swiped across a work surface and so deeply into her body. Jurors took 13 hours and 21 minutes to convict Vickers of murder by a majority of 10-2, rather than the less serious alternative of manslaughter, or to clear him. Vickers did not visibly react in the dock, while Ms Hall and other family members in the public gallery looked stunned by the verdict.

Yet it was cruelly cut short by her own father - a man who was meant to protect her. \"We may never know why or what caused Simon Vickers to do what he did that night. \"Sadly, today's verdict will not bring Scarlett back, but he will now face the consequences of his actions.\" Vickers - who had denied both the murder and the manslaughter of his only child - will be sentenced on 10 February."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n A retired senior police chief has told an inquiry the Royal Military Police's initial investigation into alleged war crimes by UK Special Forces in Afghanistan was \"slow to commence, sluggish in its progress, and never properly resourced\". Alan Pughsley QPM, who has 39 years of experience in investigating serious and organised crimes, had been asked by the Independent Inquiry Relating to Afghanistan to produce a desktop review of two RMP investigations including Operation Northmoor which began in March 2014. The inquiry is investigating claims made in a BBC Panorama programme that innocent Afghan civilians were executed by three out of four SAS squadrons between 2010 and 2013. Evidence submitted to the inquiry suggests as many as 80 people were killed this way during a campaign of night raids. The RMP launched Operation Northmoor on 31 March 2014, three years after the alleged war crimes. Mr Pughsley, whose conclusions have not yet been finalised, said the most senior investigating officer (SIO) lacked experience for such a significant investigation. He identified Operation Northmoor as a Category A investigation - the most serious of its kind but said it \"did not progress at the pace, breadth or depth that is required for a Category A investigation\". He said the investigation's gold commanders kept few records, minutes were scant, and very few key witnesses were spoken to on time. Guidance from independent advisors was often not heeded, he said, adding he had not seen sufficient evidence of proper handovers being made when multiple changes were made to investigating staff. The inquiry heard there was a \"confusing landscape,\" where at one time four external advisers were offering differing guidelines to the RMP investigators. A critical delay in starting the investigation, which Mr Pughsley said was not the fault of the RMP, denied early opportunities for gathering contemporaneous witness accounts. The former police chief criticised the appointment of some investigators saying many lacked skills and experience, including an SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) who had only just attended the relevant training course and had never acted as the SIO in any, or any serious, investigation. \"There was consideration to whether or not a Home Office Police Force could or should've been utilised as lead investigators\", Mr Pughsley said before explaining that the Ministry of Defence chose the RMP instead to lead. \"I would've asked a Home Office police force to identify an incredibly experienced ISO,\" he said. The inquiry's counsel Mr Oliver Glasgow KC put to Mr Pughsley: \"We remind ourselves, this would have been an enormous challenge for even a highly experienced SIO from the Home Office Police Force.\" Mr Pughsley replied: \"Absolutely right.\" Four years to set up resources Operation Northmoor was described by the former police chief as \"a complex and incredibly serious investigation that was fundamentally poorly resourced.\" The inquiry heard how it took two years to find premises and two more to get all the required resources in place. \"If you feel not supported whether as an investigator or one of the senior officers, I think you would feel very, very disappointed and I guess you would feel 'how seriously are we taking this?' Or are we just rubber-stamping the definition and not putting the resources into it?' I hope that's not the case,\" Mr Pughsley said. Later, the inquiry heard £7m was spent on the creation of a forensics data handling centre which was eventually blocked from being used. Closure 'inappropriate and premature' Mr Pughsley said there were \"clearly outstanding lines of enquiry that were not followed\", including a large number of potential witnesses in Afghanistan and data and digital evidence. He added the decision to close Operation Northmore was \"inappropriate and premature\". Operation Northmoor was set up in 2014 to examine allegations of executions by special forces, including those of children. No charges were ever brought.

Law firm Leigh Day, representing the bereaved families at the inquiry, said its clients have always maintained Operation Northmoor was deeply flawed. \"Mr Pughsley… has raised potential failings at almost every stage of the investigation,\" said Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day. \"Perhaps most concerningly, he considers that the investigation was closed prematurely and inappropriately with major lines of enquiry still outstanding. \"Plainly the inquiry now needs to take further evidence from those who were involved with both running and overseeing Operation Northmoor to find out how this complex, multi-homicide military police investigation went so badly wrong.\" The inquiry continues."

        "Content": "A man has been jailed for three years for owning a dangerously out-of-control XL bully dog that killed his neighbour. Christopher Bell, 45, ran out of his house barefoot after Ian Langley, 54, who had thrown a stone and smashed a window at his home in Shiney Row near Sunderland on 3 October 2023. Bell left the door open and his two XL bully dogs got out, joining the chase and overtaking their owner, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said Mr Langley had run for about 100m before he was brought to the floor by the larger of the two dogs, Titan, who latched on to his neck. Bell was eventually able to pull the dog off and drag him back to his house, before he returned to the scene and called emergency services. Mr Langley was taken to hospital but had suffered \"catastrophic injuries to his neck\" and was pronounced dead. Titan was destroyed at the scene, while Bell's other dog, Sapphire, was taken away and euthanised, the court heard. Titan had attacked two dogs in the months leading up to the incident and was \"known to local residents,\" the court heard. Mr Perks said on 26 July 2022 the dog ran into the street and attacked a Yorkshire terrier, while Bell \"asked bystanders for a cigarette lighter to burn his dog's nose\" to get him to release the terrier. In June 2023, both Bell's dogs were off leads when they attacked another dog in a \"savage\" incident lasting five to 10 minutes. It was only halted when Bell appeared and threw water over them. Mr Perks said Bell had failed to act on prior knowledge of his dog's behaviour.

He taught me to make time for others and give to those less fortunate.\" He said changes to the law following an \"alarming increase in fatal dog attacks\" in 2023 \"sadly came too late for my dad\". The court heard Bell was \"profoundly sorry for what has happened\". A judge heard Bell \"had no quarrel\" with Mr Langley and what prompted him to smash the window remains unknown. Judge Carolyn Scott jailed Bell for three years and banned him from owning a dog indefinitely."

        "Content": "Bristol City Council could become the first local authority in England to collect black bin household waste every four weeks. The council said it \"firmly\" believes that collecting black bin waste every three or four weeks instead of once a fortnight \"will increase the amount of waste our city recycles, reduce costs and significantly lower carbon emissions\". The Guardian reported that if it does move to four-weekly collections, the council will be the first in England to do so. Bristol's Green-led council launched a six-week consultation on managing household waste on Monday. Explaining the consultation on its website, Councillor Martin Fodor, chair of the council's environment and sustainability committee, said changing to less frequent collections could cut the amount of waste going to landfill or being burned by \"between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes\". He referenced the examples of Salford and Rhondda Cynon Taf as evidence. Black bin waste is collected every three weeks in both areas. Bristol is home to about 483,000 people living in more than 191,000 households, with each person creating up to 400kg (882 lbs) of household waste a year. For the past two years, the city has recycled about 45% of its household waste, which puts it \"amongst the top tier of cities in the UK\", but the rate is dropping, and the national target is to recycle 65% by 2035. Councillor Fodor said the current methods of dealing with black bin waste - incineration or landfill - have \"serious environmental and cost issues\". New charges on disposing of black bin waste by those methods will cost the city a further £8m a year, meaning, he said, it will \"very soon start to cost every household a lot more unless we do something about it\". \"Burning or leaving waste to decompose in landfill releases carbon and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. This in turn pollutes the air around us and also contributes to fuelling climate change,\" he added. Read more from Sky News:More severe weather on way for UKE-fit after woman 'pushed into car and raped''Monstrous' paedophile gang jailed Other possible ideas raised in the consultation included increasing the use of recycling sacks and the council said it must also invest in its services, particularly in collection vehicles.

        "Content": " The King has warned of the \"dangerous re-emergence of antisemitism\" and met with Holocaust survivors on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. During a visit to the Jewish Community Centre of Krakow - which he opened in 2008 - King Charles said Holocaust Memorial Day \"is a moment when we recall the depths to which humanity can sink when evil is allowed to flourish\". The King then joined survivors and other dignitaries at Auschwitz, marking the first time that a serving British monarch has visited the concentration camp where more than a million people were murdered at the hands of the Nazi regime. Before he laid a candle as the UK's representative at the ceremony in Poland, three Holocaust survivors shared their stories. Tova Friedman explained her traumatic experiences left her feeling it was \"normal\" that \"as a Jewish child they all had to die\". Janina Iwanska also said: \"It is difficult to calculate all the people killed here.\" Follow latest:Survivors recount Auschwitz horrors Kate, William and PM pay respects Kate, the Princess of Wales, also joined Prince William at a Holocaust commemoration ceremony in London, where she hugged and held hands with survivors. She also told Olivia Marks-Woldman, the chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, that the commemorations are \"so important,\" and added: \"It is great to be here today with my husband.\" In a short speech, William said attending the event at Guildhall was \"a great honour\". \"I am honoured to join you today to mark Holocaust Memorial Day and to remember the millions murdered during the Holocaust and in subsequent genocides,\" he said. \"We also remember those survivors who have lived with scars, both mental and physical. \"Their bravery, in sharing with us the most harrowing moments of their lives, is extremely powerful and ensures that we never forget. I assure them we never will.\" The prince also read an extract from the book Holocaust Heroes, which references the efforts made by his great-grandmother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, to help a Jewish family in need during the Second World War. In his own speech at the Guildhall event, Sir Keir Starmer said the Holocaust was a \"collective endeavour\" by ordinary people \"consumed by the hatred of difference\". The prime minister said: \"As we remember, we must also act. Because we say never again, but where was never again in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, or the acts of genocide against Yazidi? \"Today, we have to make those words mean more. So we will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour.\" Communities correspondent Survivors lit candles and gave their own moving testimonies at the London commemorations of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides.  The London Youth Chamber Choir performed Even When He Is Silent - remembering six million lost Jewish voices.  The Prince of Wales spoke about remembering not only survivors but also recalled those who risked their own lives to protect those fleeing - which included his great-grandmother Alice who gave refuge to a Jewish widow and her children in Athens. \n The message of the ceremony to the congregation and beyond at a time of growing fears over anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish sentiment - to light candles of their own and stand against prejudice and hatred.\n Candles to light the darkness 'for a better future'. But the heightened security ahead of and at the venue at a time of continuing conflict in the world tells us lessons are still to be learnt on this 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.  'Remembering the evils of the past remains vital' Speaking in Krakow earlier on Monday, the King said: \"In a world that remains full of turmoil and strife, and has witnessed the dangerous re-emergence of antisemitism, there can be no more important message. \"As the number of Holocaust survivors regrettably diminishes with the passage of time, the responsibility of remembrance rests far heavier on our shoulders and on those of generations yet unborn. \"The act of remembering the evils of the past remains a vital task, and in so doing, we inform our present and shape our future. \"Here in Krakow, from the ashes of the Holocaust, the Jewish community has been reborn.\" Read more: Survivors mark liberation from Auschwitz 80 years ago'My mother sacrificed herself for me' The King went on to say there is \"no greater symbol\" of that rebirth than the centre he was speaking at. \"In a post-Holocaust world, projects such as this, this centre, is how we recover our faith in humanity,\" he said. \"They also show us there is much work still to be done,\" he said, adding that it's important not just to remember the past, \"but to use it to inspire us to build a kinder and more compassionate world for future generations\". \"This remains the sacred task of us all,\" he added. Later, the King joined world leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Auschwitz, as those who lived through the Holocaust shared their stories of survival. Royal correspondent The King had a clear purpose as he made his first visit to Auschwitz. Remembrance - but also the high cost of forgetting.  It was right at the heart of a speech he gave at a Jewish community centre in Krakow, which he opened in 2008; a reminder of his enduring work to champion religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue, ever mindful of what he can do with his global profile. In the auditorium at Auschwitz, he was one of the most recognisable attendees. But as is so often the case with the Royal Family, his intention was to use his presence to draw even greater attention to those who really matter, the survivors. The Holocaust Educational Trust described his attendance as elevating the event on a global stage, a signal to the world of its significance.  It was a display of his lifelong commitment to humanise and give a voice to those who 80 years ago were so savagely dehumanised at the hands of the Nazis. 'I remember watching children driven to their deaths' Survivor Janina Iwanska said that while the camp was originally for political prisoners, in March 1942, \"the operators of the camp started building gas chambers and the crematorium\". \"It was no longer a POW camp, a Soviet camp - this is when the killing machine started its operation,\" she added. \"It is difficult to calculate all the people killed here.\" Fellow survivor Tova Friedman also told those in attendance: \"I remember as a five-year-old child watching from my hiding place as all my little friends were rounded up and driven to their deaths while the heartbreaking cries of their parents fell on deaf ears. \"After all the children were gone and the courtyard was empty - I thought 'am I the only Jewish child left in the world?'\" She recalled that while held in Auschwitz, she \"was being beaten mercilessly by a guard for fidgeting\" after \"not being able to stand still for hours,\" as she looked into her mother's eyes. \"She was pleading with me 'don't cry'. And I didn't. At five I had the rebellion in me that I would not let them know the pain they are inflicting on me,\" Ms Friedman added.  More than a million people were murdered at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp during the Second World War, most of whom were Jews but also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and other nationalities. Six million Jewish men, women and children died during the Holocaust.  Commemorations at the former death camp began earlier when Poland's President Andrzej Duda joined Auschwitz survivors laying wreaths and candles at the site. Their tributes were left at a reconstruction of the Death Wall, the site where several thousand people, mainly Polish political prisoners, were executed. In a speech, Mr Duda said \"we Poles are the guardians of memory today\" and had a duty to maintain the life stories of the survivors."

        "Content": "Fresh weather warnings for heavy rain and wind have been issued for parts of England and Wales by the Met Office after a weekend of battering by Storm Eowyn. Following miserable weekend weather which saw record wind speeds of 114mph as Storm Eowyn swept through the UK, new warnings have been put in place as the low pressure that caused Spanish-named Storm Herminia arrives. A warning for periods of heavy rain that could cause some flooding of roads and properties was in place for most of Wales and some of the West Midlands until 9pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office predicting 20mm to 40mm to fall quite widely and 50mm to 60mm on higher ground. A yellow warning for rain was also in place in London as well as the southeast and southwest of England until 10am Tuesday. A yellow wind warning is in place for the east of England, London and the southeast, the southwest of England and Wales until 6am Tuesday. A major incident has been declared in Somerset due to overnight flooding, with residents in the worst-hit areas being evacuated from their homes. More than 50 flood warnings are in place for England and two in Scotland as the country recovers from Storm Eowyn. In the coming days, much of the week will see rain in various parts of the UK. Sky weather producer Chris England said: \"Looking further ahead, it will be very windy again tomorrow in the south with widespread heavy showers, some prolonged, and a risk of hail and thunder. \"On Wednesday, it will be calmer with showers in the north, mainly near north-facing coasts, with the possibility of rain in the Channel brushing the far south of England. \"Thursday will be mostly fine, but rain will move across Ireland and Northern Ireland into the northwest later, and this could be heavy over western Scotland for a time overnight. \"Then, on Friday, one band of mostly light rain will clear the southeast across England by early afternoon, with more rain moving into the northwest overnight.\" It comes after Storm Eowyn wreaked havoc in different parts of the UK and Ireland, with the Met Office issuing a swathe of red warnings as record wind speeds were recorded. Hundreds of thousands lost power after Storm Eowyn hit on Friday, bringing hurricane-force winds to parts of Ireland and the UK. Around 65,000 homes and businesses remained without power in Northern Ireland, 278,000 in Ireland and 8,000 in Scotland following Storm Eowyn, as at 11.30am. Hundreds of thousands have been reconnected. Ten schools in Northern Ireland remain closed on Monday due to storm damage, with around 80 schools still without power. There was ongoing travel disruption due to the high winds, with Network Rail working on repairs and reopening lines when safe to do so, after train operator ScotRail reported it had received reports of 500 incidents across its network and more than 120 trees falling on to tracks. Two men aged 19 and 20 died in two separate incidents relating to Storm Eowyn. The 19-year-old died after his car was struck by a falling tree in Mauchline, East Ayrshire, on Friday morning, Kacper Dudek, 20, died in County Donegal, Ireland, on Friday morning when a tree fell on his car. While not as powerful as Storm Eowyn, Storm Herminia was named by meteorologists in Spain as it formed in the north Atlantic. It was expected to bring strong winds as it headed toward the UK. Chris England said that while it is a storm, it is unlikely that it would have been a named storm in the UK as it's effects won't be felt as strongly as they will in Spain and France. He added: \"That doesn't mean it won't have impacts here, especially with structural weakening following Eowyn.\""

They are battered from days of non-stop fighting and surrendering to the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels taking control of the regional capital and humanitarian hub. Congolese soldiers laid down their fatigues on the road near the watch posts we saw them in just 24 hours before. The sounds of nearby shelling break the sombre mood. The sense of capture is palpable. But some soldiers are still fighting. There are pockets of resistance in streets across town and the sounds of automatic gunfire and shelling are almost constant. Our hotel has become a shelter for some families waiting to see what happens next. As the hours of battle drag on, some are sleeping on couches in the lobby. The hotel staff watch the windows as the fight comes to the street in front of our gate. \"I am scared but hoping peace will prevail. I am concerned for my family because I haven't seen them since yesterday. I have only been communicating with them over the phone,\" says 27-year-old driver Bahati Jean Claude. \"I just want the conflict to end. I don't care who is in charge of Goma, all I care about is peace.\" Eyewitness:Sky News team in DRC attacked as civilians flee Peace is far from reality in Goma right now - at least 17 people have been killed and 370 injured. Prisoners who had been working to escape the central prison on Monday morning managed to break out by the afternoon. Looting was reported in the airport and other parts of town. In a day of echoing blasts and the crack of bullets, the sounds started from a different direction. High-level security sources in town confirmed mortars and artillery coming from Rwanda as we heard the shift. Foreign news reporter Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) risks spilling over into a regional war, it is feared, as Rwanda-backed rebels claim to have captured the key city of Goma. The leader of a rebel alliance that includes the M23 group said fighters have taken the city, after making significant territorial gains in recent weeks. Hundreds of people are being wounded every day as fighting in the central African country continues, worsening the humanitarian crisis there. Read more on the fighting in the DRC and why it's happening. We spoke to the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) spokesperson, who says they fired into eastern DRC in retaliation. \"Rockets were fired across the DRC/Rwanda border in Rubavu district, western province, and five civilians have lost their lives and 35 were seriously injured,\" Brigadier-General Ronald Rwivanga tells us on a video call. \"They are currently undergoing medical treatment in the medical facilities nearby. We are just taking all necessary defensive measures to protect the population living along the border. \"And we will continue to play our role, our primary role of protecting the territory or integrity of Rwanda.\" Throughout the day, videos emerged of Congolese troops surrendering to Rwandan soldiers - wearing the white headbands we saw on those walking in the street in front of our hotel. Brigadier-General Rwivanga denies the presence of Rwandan troops in DRC and arms support to M23 rebels. A UN panel of experts reported, however, that around 3,000 to 5,000 Rwandan troops were in DRC as of last year. On Sunday, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the RDF to stop supporting the M23 and \"to withdraw from the territory of the DRC\"."

        "Content": "By defence editor Deborah Haynes and producers Azad Safarov and Katy Scholes in northeast Ukraine   North Korean troops appear to have temporarily pulled back from the frontline in Russia after suffering heavy losses, a Ukrainian special forces commander has told Sky News. The commander, who goes by the codename \"Puls\", said Kim Jong Un's men were likely either learning lessons from mistakes made during their first, bloody clashes with Ukrainian soldiers, tending to their wounded or waiting for reinforcements. \"I think they'll be back soon,\" he said, speaking at a secret base in northeastern Ukraine. Interviews with several Ukrainian troops reveal remarkable details about how the North Koreans have been fighting since they arrived on the battlefield in the Russian region of Kursk last month. This includes: • An apparent initial lack of awareness about the threats from drones and artillery, with North Korean soldiers attacking on foot \"like something out of World War Two\" in groups of 20, 40 or even 60 men, making themselves easy targets • \"Brainwashing\" which means they keep pushing forward despite being under Ukrainian fire and with comrades being killed and wounded around them • A desire to remove evidence of their presence from the warzone, with North Koreans in white helmets spotted trying to recover the wounded and the dead \n                  Volodymyr Zelenskyy offers captured North Korean soldiers for Ukrainians held by Russia\n                 \n                  Ukraine says it has captured two North Korean soldiers on the battlefield in Russia\n                 \n                  US charges North Koreans in £70m identity theft case\n                 • A refusal to be taken alive, with claims that North Koreans have been seen blowing themselves up with grenades rather than risk capture. Puls even claimed a North Korean has been heard shouting \"For General Kim Jong Un\" before killing himself • Poor coordination between North Korean and Russian forces because of the language barrier. One soldier claimed radio intercepts revealed North Koreans accidentally targeted Russian positions. He also said they would storm Ukrainian positions, suffering losses, but Russian troops would then fail to exploit the gains • Better kit than many Russians, including rifles and uniform, but a lack of heavy armour, with North Koreans only moving on foot and using golf buggies to transport ammunition. \"They were all clean-shaven and perfectly groomed, like models,\" said Puls. \"Every single one - no beards, unkempt hair, or bald heads… It was also hard to determine their age. They all looked between 25 and 35, maybe up to 40.\" North Korean troop deployment not officially confirmed Ukraine and its Western allies say Pyongyang has sent 11,000 troops to join Russia's war, focusing on bolstering infantry lines in the Kursk region where Ukrainian troops captured swathes of territory in a daring invasion last August. Neither Kim Jong-Un nor Vladimir Putin have officially confirmed the deployment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed last week that some 4,000 North Korean soldiers have already been killed or injured. Read more from Sky News:Civilians in Democratic Republic of Congo face frenzy of fearLukashenko set to extend 30-year presidential rule in Belarus Puls commands the 1st Combat Divers Battalion of Special Operations Forces. His elite commandos were tasked with capturing DNA samples and documents from a unit of about 25 North Korean soldiers who were killed in a drone and artillery barrage about a fortnight ago inside Kursk. Body camera footage from the mission has been shared with Sky News. Edited clips have also been posted on social media. Forensic samples taken Ukrainian soldiers can be seen carefully sticking cottonwool buds into the mouths of dead North Korean troops to take samples of saliva and place them in an evidence bag. They then remove the troops' helmets, cutting clumps of hair and bagging them as well. In addition, body armour is cut away so the Ukrainians can more easily access the documents and other items on each soldier, including military identity cards, dog tags, handwritten notes and photographs. 'North Koreans only had ammo and chocolate' One of Puls's men, who took part in the operation and goes by the codename \"Trainer\", said he was surprised that the North Koreans only had ammunition and chocolate as supplies to sustain them in the fight. \"Not a single soldier had a water bottle,\" he said. \"They rely on the idea that they will storm through, take positions, and then eat and survive off our supplies.\" Asked what personal belongings he found, Trainer said: \"There were letters. Of course, there were notebooks, notes. There were hand-drawn maps… There were photos of children, mothers, letters they tried to send home.\" The military identity cards were Russian - a seemingly clumsy attempt to hide the true ethnicity of the soldiers. Trainer said some of the notes appeared to be of soldiers' experiences in battle. He said it seemed as though they were trying to learn from their exposure to modern warfare. \"It's the experience they are accumulating for their country, for conflicts they might face in the future,\" he said. North Koreans 'more disciplined' Puls described how the North Koreans fought differently from the Russians. \"They are far more disciplined, with exceptional morale and determination - completely brainwashed, really,\" he said. Puls said about a fortnight ago he noticed the North Koreans pulling back. \"The Russians are standing, working everywhere along the frontline, but no Koreans,\" he said. \"Either they're analysing their mistakes, or tending to their wounds, or maybe they're waiting for reinforcements. There's talk that Kim Jong-Un is sending more North Koreans here. That's the situation.\" He said intercepted Russian communications appeared to indicate they would be returning. \"They're still present, training or waiting for reinforcements. Something is happening, they'll be back soon.\""

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) risks spilling over into a regional war, it is feared, as Rwanda-backed rebels claim to have captured the key city of Goma. The leader of a rebel alliance that includes the M23 group said fighters have taken the city, after making significant territorial gains in recent weeks. Hundreds of people are being wounded every day as fighting in the central African country continues, worsening the humanitarian crisis there. There is also an international element to the decades-long situation, with UN peacekeepers killed in the conflict and Rwandan troops accused of fighting alongside the rebels. Sky News' Africa correspondent Yousra Elbagir says the situation is \"extremely volatile\" and there are fears of a Rwandan \"invasion\". Who are the M23 rebels and what do they want? The name M23 refers to a March 23, 2009 accord which ended a previous revolt in eastern DRC led by ethnic Tutsis. \n                  'I am scared': Inside Congolese city overrun by rebels as echoing blasts and crack of bullets force families to hide\n                 \n                  Displaced civilians in Democratic Republic of Congo face frenzy of fear and uncertainty\n                 \n                  Rebels in Democratic Republic of Congo say they have taken key city of Goma\n                 M23 has accused the DRC government of not living up to that peace deal and fully integrating Congolese Tutsis into the army and administration. It is mostly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the army and launched its current rebellion in 2022. It has vowed to defend Tutsi interests, particularly against ethnic Hutu militias such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which was founded by Hutus who fled Rwanda after participating in the 1994 genocide of more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  Eyewitness: Sky News team in DRC attacked as civilians flee However critics have claimed it's a pretext for Rwanda to obtain economic and political influence over eastern DRC. M23 controls territory in the east of the country, including the mining region of Rubaya which has rich deposits of coltan, a mineral used in the production of smartphones. It's estimated M23 gets $800,000 (£640,000) a month through a production tax on the region, the UN says. How is Rwanda involved? Rwanda, which borders the M23-controlled region of the DRC, has been accused of supporting the group and there have been increasing fears that its actions are essentially an \"invasion\". UN experts say Rwanda has thousands of troops in the region which have been operating alongside the rebels in a violation of the DRC's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In a report for the UN Security Council, the panel of experts said Rwandan forces' \"de facto control and direction over M23 operations\" renders Rwanda \"liable for the actions of M23\". On Sunday, the UN's special representative in the DRC said that M23 and Rwandan forces had entered the outskirts of the city of Goma, which rebels have subsequently claimed to have captured. The DRC has now severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda. A \"declaration of war\" by the DRC against Rwanda would risk turning \"into a regional conflict in East Africa\", according to Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. Why is Goma important? A city home to around two million people, Goma is a key regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts. Since 2021, DRC forces have been supported by troops from neighbouring Burundi as well as UN peacekeepers in keeping the rebels away from the city. M23 briefly controlled Goma in 2012 and it now claims to once again be in control. Its fall to the rebels would also have a \"catastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of civilians, putting them at risk of heightened exposure to human rights violations and abuses\", said Ravina Shamdasani from the UN's human rights office."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n A retired senior police chief has told an inquiry the Royal Military Police's initial investigation into alleged war crimes by UK Special Forces in Afghanistan was \"slow to commence, sluggish in its progress, and never properly resourced\". Alan Pughsley QPM, who has 39 years of experience in investigating serious and organised crimes, had been asked by the Independent Inquiry Relating to Afghanistan to produce a desktop review of two RMP investigations including Operation Northmoor which began in March 2014. The inquiry is investigating claims made in a BBC Panorama programme that innocent Afghan civilians were executed by three out of four SAS squadrons between 2010 and 2013. Evidence submitted to the inquiry suggests as many as 80 people were killed this way during a campaign of night raids. The RMP launched Operation Northmoor on 31 March 2014, three years after the alleged war crimes. Mr Pughsley, whose conclusions have not yet been finalised, said the most senior investigating officer (SIO) lacked experience for such a significant investigation. He identified Operation Northmoor as a Category A investigation - the most serious of its kind but said it \"did not progress at the pace, breadth or depth that is required for a Category A investigation\". He said the investigation's gold commanders kept few records, minutes were scant, and very few key witnesses were spoken to on time. Guidance from independent advisors was often not heeded, he said, adding he had not seen sufficient evidence of proper handovers being made when multiple changes were made to investigating staff. The inquiry heard there was a \"confusing landscape,\" where at one time four external advisers were offering differing guidelines to the RMP investigators. A critical delay in starting the investigation, which Mr Pughsley said was not the fault of the RMP, denied early opportunities for gathering contemporaneous witness accounts. The former police chief criticised the appointment of some investigators saying many lacked skills and experience, including an SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) who had only just attended the relevant training course and had never acted as the SIO in any, or any serious, investigation. \"There was consideration to whether or not a Home Office Police Force could or should've been utilised as lead investigators\", Mr Pughsley said before explaining that the Ministry of Defence chose the RMP instead to lead. \"I would've asked a Home Office police force to identify an incredibly experienced ISO,\" he said. The inquiry's counsel Mr Oliver Glasgow KC put to Mr Pughsley: \"We remind ourselves, this would have been an enormous challenge for even a highly experienced SIO from the Home Office Police Force.\" Mr Pughsley replied: \"Absolutely right.\" Four years to set up resources Operation Northmoor was described by the former police chief as \"a complex and incredibly serious investigation that was fundamentally poorly resourced.\" The inquiry heard how it took two years to find premises and two more to get all the required resources in place. \"If you feel not supported whether as an investigator or one of the senior officers, I think you would feel very, very disappointed and I guess you would feel 'how seriously are we taking this?' Or are we just rubber-stamping the definition and not putting the resources into it?' I hope that's not the case,\" Mr Pughsley said. Later, the inquiry heard £7m was spent on the creation of a forensics data handling centre which was eventually blocked from being used. Closure 'inappropriate and premature' Mr Pughsley said there were \"clearly outstanding lines of enquiry that were not followed\", including a large number of potential witnesses in Afghanistan and data and digital evidence. He added the decision to close Operation Northmore was \"inappropriate and premature\". Operation Northmoor was set up in 2014 to examine allegations of executions by special forces, including those of children. No charges were ever brought. Read more:Arrest warrant for Taliban duoSAS had 'golden pass' in Afghanistan Operation Cestro, which followed, referred three soldiers to the Service Prosecuting Authority but there were no prosecutions. Law firm Leigh Day, representing the bereaved families at the inquiry, said its clients have always maintained Operation Northmoor was deeply flawed. \"Mr Pughsley… has raised potential failings at almost every stage of the investigation,\" said Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day. \"Perhaps most concerningly, he considers that the investigation was closed prematurely and inappropriately with major lines of enquiry still outstanding. \"Plainly the inquiry now needs to take further evidence from those who were involved with both running and overseeing Operation Northmoor to find out how this complex, multi-homicide military police investigation went so badly wrong.\" The inquiry continues."

The statement signals an early sign of tension with a key demographic which helped push President Trump over the line in November. A critical number of Arab-Americans in places like Michigan helped propel Mr Trump to victory. Small margins in cities like Dearborn and Hamtramck were key to Mr Trump's success.  The statement, released late on Sunday and described as an \"urgent press release\", said: \"We strongly believe that the ONLY resolution to the Israel-Palestine is a two-state solution… Arab Americans for Trump thank the President for imposing a ceasefire in Gaza. \"We expect that the President and his team work on the rebuilding of Gaza and launching the process that would culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.\" Dr Bahbah, who is Palestinian by birth and has since become a successful American businessman, was pivotal in his efforts to persuade Arab-Americans to choose Mr Trump. \n                  Day 8: Trump calls Starmer\n                 \n                  Colombia quickly found out Trump has no intention of backing down\n                 \n                  Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer speak on phone and 'agree to meet soon'\n                 He rallied an army of influencers in a successful \"ground game\" throughout the election campaign to energise support for President Trump. He has told Sky News that President Trump personally committed to a two-state solution and that he believes the president has a \"contract\" with the Arab-Americans who voted for him. \"Mr President, we have a contract….\" he said. \"We held up our end of the contract and voted for you. We are with you to ensure that your administration fulfils your part of the contract.\" Over the weekend, President Trump suggested that Gaza could be \"cleaned out\" and that Palestinians could be moved to Jordan or Egypt. \"I'd like him to take people,\" the president said, referring to his conversation with Jordan's King Abdullah on Saturday. \"You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing. You know, over the century, it's had many, many conflicts. And I don't know, something has to happen… I'd like Egypt to take people,\" Mr Trump said, adding that he plans to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi.

The ceasefire in Gaza was seen to be an early validation of their choice but has been quickly cast into doubt by Mr Trump's comments on Sunday. As with so many policies and decisions, President Trump's judgement seems to be set through a transactional prism. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Dr Bahbah believes President Trump recognises that regional realignment and peace require a resolution to the Palestinian issue, with a two-state solution, and that Mr Trump sees a legacy-defining win in Middle East peace. However, the last week has shown that American foreign policy can now shift swiftly, and is dependent on an attractive transactional offer or the persuasiveness of the person who manages to be the last in the room with the president."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Chipmaker Nvidia saw almost $600bn wiped off its market value - the biggest drop in US stock market history - as a low-cost AI competitor from China took chunks out of several tech firms.  Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet all saw their stocks come under pressure as investors questioned whether their share prices, already widely viewed as overblown following a two-year AI-led frenzy, were justified. Market analysts put the combined losses in market value across US tech at well over $1trn (£802bn). Money latest: Cost of European holidays surge Leading AI chipmaker Nvidia's shares bled 11% at the open on Wall Street but were up to 17% lower during afternoon dealing, while the tech-focused Nasdaq index slid by more than 3%. The declines were all put down to the emergence late last week of a Chinese AI chatbot that uses lower-cost chips. It has since become the most popular free application on Apple's App Store across the US. \n                  Money blog: Top credit card firms face lawsuit which could be worth £4bn; Britain's oldest brewer warns prices to rise\n                 \n                  Luxury yacht-builder Fairline collapses just weeks after sale\n                 \n                  Heathrow: What are the airport's expansion plans and why are they controversial?\n                 Analysis: AI now not just a contest between Californian tech bros with macho budgets, but between superpowers Start-up DeepSeek said its free app uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players' own large language assistants. The market response intensified later in the day despite revelations DeepSeek was limiting new registrations due to the fallout from a cyberattack and complications caused by high demand. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said the company's cost claims had placed in doubt the market's AI-led dominance of the past two years that have seen AI-linked stocks repeatedly hit new highs. He said of the repercussions: \"It could mean less demand for chips, less need for a massive build-out of power production to fuel the models, and less need for large-scale data centres. \"However, it could also mean that AI becomes more accessible and help kickstart the development of a wide array of useful applications,\" he added. DeepSeek's AI assistant is certainly proving popular, having overtaken ChatGPT on the App Store. The chatbot's performance has even attracted praise from US rivals despite questions continuing to swirl over the 2023-founded company's technological development. It was achieved despite tech export controls, designed to protect US patents, imposed on China by president Joe Biden in 2021. Nvidia responded to the sell-off in its shares with a statement suggesting that DeepSeek's progress demonstrated the usefulness of its chips for the Chinese market and argued that more of its chips will be needed in future to meet demand for DeepSeek's services. The share price movements will likely be of concern to Mr Biden's successor in the White House, Donald Trump, who has long accused Chinese firms of profiting from US technology. Read more from Sky News:Ryanair profits nearly 10 times higherHobbycraft owner circles WH Smith It also remains to be seen whether he will see the competition as aggressive towards US firms, having already indicated he is minded to allow Chinese-owned TikTok to escape a US ban but through shared ownership to help offset national security concerns. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said DeepSeek's progress could mark an own goal for the world's largest economy. \"The US government - both under Donald Trump and previously under Joe Biden - have been trying to stop China from accessing Western technology. \"That strategy might have backfired as it looks to have encouraged China to ramp up efforts to build its own technology and we're now seeing evidence that the country is making waves.\" Market experts said AI customers could ultimately benefit from a share price bounce once the market settled due to improved competition bringing down prices. Away from the United States, another company licking its wounds on Monday was SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm. Its shares were 8% down on the day, erasing all the gains seen since last week when Mr Trump announced SoftBank was part of an investment of up to $500bn (£400bn) in US AI infrastructure."

Sky News has learnt that Fairline Yachts, which is based in Oundle, Northamptonshire, had fallen into insolvency proceedings after DF Capital, the company's main lender, triggered the appointment of Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) as administrators. One staff member said they had been briefed on the news by A&M on Monday morning. Fairline Yachts is understood to employ about 250 people, with no redundancies being triggered by the insolvency. Money latest: Cost of European holidays surge The collapse of Fairline Yachts is surprising because the company was only sold early last month by Hanover Investors to Arrowbolt Propulsion Systems, which was described in an announcement about the deal as a \"clean propulsion technology company\". Further details of that deal were unclear, although the statement in December said that Arrowbolt was appointing Peter Hamlyn, an experienced industry executive, as Fairline Yachts' new chief executive. In a statement provided in response to an enquiry from Sky News, Michael Magnay, joint administrator to Fairline Yachts Limited, said: \"The business is continuing to trade as usual. \"We are thankful for the support and understanding of staff and there are no redundancies at this time. \"We are actively pursuing a sale of the business and are confident of a substantial amount of interest given the recognised brand and strong heritage. \"We encourage interested parties to make contact with us.\" Read more from Sky News:Ryanair profits nearly 10 times higherHobbycraft owner circles WH Smith Fairline Yachts' collapse comes nearly two years after rival Princess Yachts was sold to investor KPS Capital Partners.

        "Headline": "The west London airport has been pushing for permission to build a third runway for nearly two decades, but has faced sustained backlash from environmental groups. ",
        "Content": "Heathrow Airport's expansion plans may finally go ahead after almost 20 years of debates and delays. Its potential revival comes after Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated she would overrule environmental objections to allow London's biggest airport to carry out its plans in order to prioritise economic growth. She is expected to use a speech this week to support the expansion, as well as similar plans for Gatwick and Luton. But what exactly does the airport want to do, and why has it proved so controversial? Heathrow wants a new runway The west London hub wants to build a third runway to the north-west of the existing two, which it says would enable an additional 260,000 flights per year and \"allow Britain as a sovereign nation to compete more effectively for trade\". Its plans also include a new terminal building to the west of Terminal 5 and the eventual demolition of Terminal 3 to make way for a series of new satellite terminals and more public transport. Despite being given parliamentary approval in 2018, plans have been delayed by legal challenges and the COVID pandemic. Why is it controversial? Environmental groups have campaigned against the expansion since the plans were drawn up. Last week, Jenny Bates, transport campaigner at Friends of the Earth, called the proposal for another runway at Heathrow \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\", while Alethea Warrington, from climate charity Possible, said: \"Approving airport expansions would be a catastrophic misstep for a government which claims to be a climate leader.\" It has had critics across politics over the years, including from Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan, on the basis of the impact on air quality, noise and net-zero targets. Boris Johnson was a long-standing opponent of the plans, and promised to \"lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop construction\" when he was London mayor for the Conservatives - though he toned down his rhetoric once he was prime minister. One of the louder critics has been Ed Miliband, who threatened to resign from Gordon Brown's cabinet over the plans in 2009 when he was energy and climate change secretary. In 2018, he said an expansion was \"very likely\" to make air pollution worse. Mr Miliband, now net zero secretary, has said he will not resign from the government if the expansion goes ahead, adding that the government's position is for any aviation expansion to take place within the UK's carbon budgets, which are part of plans to meet the country's 2050 target of reducing emissions by 100% compared with 1990 levels. \"We believe that we can meet our growth mission - our number one priority - and keep within carbon budgets and indeed that our clean energy mission is crucial and a central part of meeting our growth mission,\" he said last week. \"Far from them being in contradiction, they are absolutely complimentary.\" Other London airports also pushing for expansions Gatwick and Luton airports are also hoping to expand in the near future. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has a deadline of 27 February to make a decision on a second runway at Gatwick, which would effectively involve modifying an existing taxiway. Gatwick's majority owners, VINCI Airports, said the £2.2bn project would create 14,000 jobs and generate £1bn a year in economic benefits. But Communities Against Gatwick Noise and Emissions (CAGNE) insisted they would legally challenge any second runway. Meanwhile, Luton Airport, owned by the local council in Bedfordshire, has applied to build a new terminal and asked for permission to increase its passenger numbers to 32 million a year. It carried about 16.7 million in 2024. Dr Alex Chapman, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), said he believes the suggested growth benefits of UK airport expansion don't stack up. He added: \"The massive climate damage caused by these schemes will create deep physical and economic hardship for millions and will wipe out any benefit from the government's other climate policy efforts almost overnight.\" What has Rachel Reeves said?  The chancellor dropped a heavy hint on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that she intends to dismiss climate concerns and back Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton expansions as she said \"growth is the number one mission of this government\". Asked directly if she would now put the runway, along with expansion at Gatwick and Luton, ahead of the UK's net zero commitments, Ms Reeves said: \"I'm not going to comment on speculation, but what I would say is when the last government faced difficult decisions about whether to support infrastructure investment, the answer always seemed to be no. \"We can't carry on like that, because if we do, we will miss out on crucial investment here into Britain. You've already seen a number of decisions, including on Stansted and City Airport, on energy projects, on transport infrastructure because we are determined to grow the economy.\" Conservative leader in favour of Heathrow expansion  Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips she \"certainly would\" back Heathrow's plans. \"I've had to vote on this before, and I voted in support of the third runway,\" Ms Badenoch, whose North West Essex constituency includes London Stansted Airport, said. \"I know that it is very difficult for a lot of people when there's an airport in your area. I know, because I'm the MP for an airport as well. I have never opposed growth or development. \"What I want to do is make sure it's done in the right way.\" Ms Badenoch added if the airport thinks it is able to deliver a third runway that meets all the criteria it has set, then we should \"do the right thing\". \"We are talking about the future,\" she said, adding: \"I think that we need to make sure that we deliver infrastructure. I voted for it before, so why would I change my mind?\" What has Heathrow said? A spokesperson for Heathrow would not comment on reporting about a third runway, but said \"growing the economy means adding capacity at the UK's hub airport which is full\". In a statement to Sky News, the airport added it was \"looking at potential options to deliver a third runway at Heathrow in line with strict tests on carbon, noise and air quality\"."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The owner of Hobbycraft is among a pack of suitors circling WH Smith, the 233-year-old high street chain which has been put up for sale. Sky News has learnt that Modella Capital, whose executives have previously been involved in retailers including Paperchase and Tie Rack, is one of a handful of parties to have held discussions with WH Smith and its advisers. The likelihood of Modella completing a deal to acquire the 500-store chain was unclear on Monday. Modella's executives include Steve Curtis, whose biography on the firm's website describes his \"successful transactions [as including] Jigsaw, Paperchase, Feather & Black, Rolling Luggage and Tie Rack\". One of the firm's investment advisers is Jamie Constable, a prominent turnaround investor who is associated with firms including Rcapital, Quilam Capital and Blazehill Capital. Money blog: Price of European holidays surges City sources said that WH Smith - which confirmed at the weekend that it was considering a sale of the business following a Sky News report - was keen to wrap up a deal during the spring. The disposal would, if completed, leave London-listed WH Smith as a company focused on its more lucrative travel retail operation in airports, railway stations and hospitals, which comprises about 1,200 stores globally. Modella is said to be bidding against a number of other experienced retail investors, including the Apollo-backed firm Alteri, which owns the Bensons for Beds chain. WH Smith, which is being advised by bankers at Greenhill, declined to comment on Monday, while Modella has been contacted for comment. A sale of its high street arm would mark a watershed moment for the UK high street, which first saw the appearance of the name in 1792. The business, which specialises in selling items such as greeting cards and stationery, employs about 5,000 people across the country. Run by Carl Cowling, chief executive, the disposal of its high street arm and repositioning as a pure-play travel retail company was welcomed by investors on Monday, with shares in WH Smith rising by about 2.5%. The division recorded flat operating profit of £32m last year, with WH Smith's travel business accounting for 75% of the company's revenue and 85% of trading profit. There have been questions about the future of WH Smith's high street division for many years amid carnage elsewhere in the sector, with the likes of BHS, Debenhams and Comet all ceasing to trade from physical stores in the last 15 years. Last week, it emerged that roughly 15 WH Smith shops would be closed this year - part of an annual rationalisation of its store estate. In 2006, the company's news distribution arm, now known as Smiths News, was demerged into a separate London-listed company. Reiterating its weekend response to Sky News's report, WH Smith told the London Stock Exchange on Monday: \"WH Smith plc notes the recent press speculation regarding its high street business. \"WHSmith confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options for this profitable and cash-generating part of the group, including a possible sale. \"Over the past decade, WHSmith has become a focused global travel retailer. The group's travel business has over 1,200 stores across 32 countries, and three-quarters of the group's revenue and 85% of its trading profit comes from the travel business. \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached, and further updates will be provided as and when appropriate.\""

Ryanair's profit after tax rose to €149m (£125.36m) in the three months from October to December, up from €15m (£12.62m) the same time a year earlier. Money blog: Dentist reveals how you can earn up to £150k It is in part due to pricier tickets with customers booking closer to departure time, the low-cost carrier said, despite its forecast fares would fall. In August Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Sky News he estimated fares would drop a further 5% coming into winter.  Fares had fallen 15% in the first three months of Ryanair's financial year and 7% in the second. Bucking the trend, the airline on Monday morning said fares rose 1% in the months running up to Christmas. \n                  Ryanair suing 'disruptive passenger' for causing flight to divert\n                 \n                  Ryanair sees profits dive after challenging summer\n                 \n                  Boeing to meet union in bid to end crippling two-week strike\n                 Those higher fares were attributed to \"stronger close-in Christmas/New Year bookings\". Despite the fact tickets became more expensive, passenger numbers rose 9%, reaching 45 million. However, the airline has slashed its passenger forecast once again, blaming aircraft delivery delays from Boeing. Four million fewer people will fly with Ryanair in the 2026 fiscal year due to ordered planes not arriving, the airline said. The figure would still represent a 3% growth in passenger numbers. It has revised down its anticipated passenger numbers from 210 million to 206 million as \"we no longer expect Boeing to deliver sufficient aircraft\" ahead of the summer. Boeing has been beset by delays as it grappled with safety concerns following the mid-flight door blowout early last year. The budget airline is Europe's largest based on the number of aircraft it has and the destinations it serves."

This week we chat to James Davies, a specialist orthodontist at Quayside Orthodontics in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire... People think my job is... something they would not want to do. Looking in people's mouths all day! What I'd say to them is... it's better than working with smelly feet. One thing I'd change about the industry is... the NHS contract. Dentists used to be paid for what they did, now they are paid per course of treatment. In short, if you do one filling or 20 you get paid the same. This discourages the treatment of those in high need unless the dentist becomes a charity. What we have seen over the past 20 years is privatisation by stealth. Make the NHS contract so difficult to undertake profitably that dentists vote with their feet - then the government can blame the \"greedy dentist\". Being able to build a quick rapport is vital... Working in people's mouths is an intrusive process, so being able to reduce anxieties and tensions over difficult, potentially painful procedures is key. Communication is the most important skill - manual dexterity is a close second to this. Every dentist will have a small number of patients...who they would gladly pay to go elsewhere. The biggest mistake I made with a patient was... is miscommunication. A larger lady entered the practice and I asked her \"when she was due\". To my embarrassment, she replied \"I had the baby 12 weeks ago.\" Cringe! \n                  Money blog: Top credit card firms face lawsuit which could be worth £4bn; Britain's oldest brewer warns prices to rise\n                 \n                  DeepSeek: Tech firm suffers biggest drop in US stock market history as low-cost Chinese AI company bites Silicon Valley\n                 \n                  Luxury yacht-builder Fairline collapses just weeks after sale\n                 Watching the complete life transformation of a patient... who has finished their course of treatment is the most rewarding thing. Often within orthodontics, patients walk in unwilling to smile and with low self-esteem. They can walk out beaming and overflowing with positivity into their new lives.

There is so much dentists can do to improve people's smiles, but there is an overly complex set of rules of what constitutes NHS and private (cosmetic) treatment. A practice I worked at was bought out by a multinational... and I was left working for a company that put profits over patient care and treated everybody as a number. On the positive flip, it motivated me to set up my own practice to be everything they were not, and it has been a runaway success. Kindness and the personal touch cost nothing!

I have always worked four days a week, which gives me a day to pursue other interests, be it DIY, gardening or learning Welsh. My day begins at... around 8am with a bowl of cornflakes (something I think is grossly underrated). I always buy an i newspaper on my way to work and see my first patient by 9am. I tend to see 25 patients a day and try to fit a 5km run at lunchtime twice a week. My evenings are spent ferrying my children to various activities before retiring at 10pm. When you're staring into someone's mouth... the mind does wonder. I think about things going on in the family, ambitions/dreams and how to strive to be a better person. Dentistry in the UK is a five-year course... to attain a bachelor in dental science degree from one of 16 dental schools. It is usually an undergraduate degree, though graduate entry is available from Aberdeen and Preston. Upon graduation, you enter on a dental foundation programme within the NHS. This currently pays £38,472 a year. Most dentists can expect to earn around £60,000 to £100,000 in subsequent years. There are 13 specialisms within dentistry that dentists can choose to study and attain postgraduate qualifications. I undertook a career in orthodontics, which required a three-year post graduate degree. I would hope to semi-retire at... 60. I am lucky enough to have a NHS pension - a defined benefit pension scheme underwritten by the government. For a dentist joining today, you will have to be 67. If I am enjoying it, which I hope I still am, I would happily work two days a week for as long as I can or am allowed! If I had my time again I would have... slowed down and lived my life at a jog rather than a sprint. I would have worried less about the future and enjoyed the journey more rather than the destination."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Ed Miliband has said the expansion of Heathrow and other airports \"won't go ahead\" if they don't meet the UK's emissions targets - putting him on a potential collision course with Rachel Reeves. The chancellor has not commented directly on whether she would support a third runway at Heathrow, but she has indicated she would be prepared to overrule environmental objections to allow the project to go ahead. Ms Reeves has been emphasising that growth is the UK's number one priority and is expected to use a speech on Wednesday to support the expansion, as well as similar plans for Gatwick and Luton. But appearing in front of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, Mr Miliband - the cabinet minister responsible for pushing forward the government's net zero agenda - struck a different tone to the chancellor. He told MPs that any aviation expansion must take place within the UK's carbon budgets, including the 2050 target to reduce emissions by 100% compared with 1990 levels. Independent advisers on the government's Climate Change Committee (CC) have called for no net airport expansion without a proper national plan to curb emissions from the aviation sector and manage passenger capacity. The CCC is publishing its next carbon budget - the legal limit for UK net emissions of greenhouse gases from 2038 to 2042 - on 26 February. \n                  Starmer accused of 'pathetic bullying' by environmental campaigner after NIMBY article\n                 \n                  More than 30 dolphins wash up dead on beach after oil spill near southern Russia\n                 \n                  Creatives having to be even more creative as National Theatre overhauls how it stages productions\n                 The energy secretary did not say whether a potential third runway could be approved before that. Mr Miliband, who has been a vocal opponent of Heathrow expansion in the past, told MPs: \"I just want to sort of provide this element of reassurance to you, which is 100% any aviation expansion must be justified within carbon budgets, and if it can't be justified, it won't go ahead.\" His comments put him at odds with Ms Reeves, who told Sky News at the World Economic Forum in Davos, that she would back infrastructure projects even where they are unpopular. Asked directly if she would now put the runway, along with expansion at Gatwick and Luton ahead of the UK's net zero commitments, Ms Reeves said: \"I'm not going to comment on speculation, but what I would say is when the last government faced difficult decisions about whether to support infrastructure investment, the answer always seemed to be no. \"We can't carry on like that, because if we do, we will miss out on crucial investment here into Britain. You've already seen a number of decisions, including on Stansted and City Airport, on energy projects, on transport infrastructure, because we are determined to grow the economy.\"  On Monday evening Ms Reeves addressed a meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Party (PLP) to push the case for growth - but did not mention Heathrow specifically. She told Labour MPs her speech on Wednesday would be about \"economic growth built on the platform of stability\", adding there were \"no easy routes out\". She said: \"There are always reasons for government to say no. \"Over the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying no. That must change. We must start saying yes.\" A spokesman for the chancellor said there had been \"overwhelming support\" for her as she addressed the PLP and that Ruth Cadbury, the chair of the Transport Select Committee, was the only dissenting voice. They said Ms Reeves declined to comment on speculation about an announcement regarding the runway. He said: \"There was overwhelming support for what Rachel had to say, overwhelming support for the need to build infrastructure, overwhelming support for the government's agenda to reform the planning system.\" Last week Mr Miliband ruled out resigning from the government if it gives the third runway the go-ahead. Read more:Why are Heathrow's expansion plans controversial?Will the chancellor's plans finally boost growth? Heathrow has not yet submitted a full application for a third runway - something it has been pushing for several years.

One Labour MP in London told Sky News they would only support Heathrow expansion if it met the tests Labour outlined in its manifesto around air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits. \"Heathrow have to put their money where their mouth is and present the evidence,\" they said."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has brought some \"Order! Order!\" to ITV's Emmerdale by playing a cameo role in the hard-hitting TV soap. Proud Lancastrian Sir Lindsay turned up in the fictional Yorkshire Dales village playing a rambler visiting its bar and bistro, wearing a tweed jacket and wellies. Since the long-running soap first broadcast in 1972, its dramatic storylines have included more than 150 deaths, 100 weddings and a plane crash in the village. But Sir Lindsay's appearance, displaying the theatrical aplomb he employs in the Speaker's chair, was much more low-key, complimenting the bistro's proprietor on her Yorkshire tea. It was also very brief. He headed into the bistro, paid for his cuppa and said: \"It was a lovely cup of tea.\" Then, told: \"See you again,\" he replied: \"I hope so.\" And that was that. Soap fan Sir Lindsay visited Emmerdale set to mark its 10,000th episode in May last year, but the broadcasting of his visit was postponed because of the general election campaign. Speaking before his cameo aired, he said: \"Incredibly, Emmerdale has been on our screens for more than half a century, shining a light on the lived experience of others, entertaining viewers with its hard-hitting storylines, while also making a major economic contribution to the north. \n                  Roger Daltrey bounced by Mr Speaker over Commons misbehaviour\n                 \n                  'Get your acts together': Speaker attacks Rachel Reeves for failing to inform MPs of key budget announcement\n                 \n                  Assassination attempt on Trump is a wake-up call for UK MPs\n                 \"It has been an honour to help the cast celebrate the 10,000th episode of this enduring Yorkshire-based soap, with a visit to the Woolpack.\" And he added, tongue-in-cheek: \"As a Lancastrian, I'm hugely impressed by the talent and warmth of our friends on the other side of the Pennines.\" Sir Lindsay is not the first senior politician to appear in a top TV soap, however. In 2009, when he was London mayor, Boris Johnson turned up in Albert Square in a storyline that saw Barbara Windsor's character Peggy Mitchell decide to stand as a local election candidate. The scene for his arrival was set with an irate Peggy declaring she would \"give him a piece of her mind\" if she ever clapped eyes on him. Lo and behold, a \"bicycle puncture\" saw Mr Johnson appear at the Queen Vic, briefly propping up the bar to deliver four brief lines, starting with: \"Oh please, call me Boris.\" As Peggy said she nearly became involved in politics herself, Mr Johnson replied: \"If you have any ideas for how I could help Walford, here's my card.\" But the soap of choice for prime minister down the years has been Coronation Street, visited by Baroness Thatcher 1990 and Tony Blair in 2005. During a Commons debate on Corrie's 60th anniversary in 2020, culture minister John Whittingdale, who was her political secretary before becoming an MP, recalled Maggie's visit. \"I too have twice visited the set of Coronation Street,\" he told MPs. \"The first time I did so was actually with Baroness Thatcher in January 1990 and it was indeed the case that I had to brief her on the way to the set on the characters who were stars at that particular time. \"And I did indeed go through all the various storylines and she was particularly keen to visit Alf Roberts' corner shop, because of course, her own father was Alfred Roberts who ran the grocer's shop in Grantham.\" Read more:Trump and Starmer speak on phone and 'agree to meet soon'The enduring legacy of Churchill But the most bizarre link between a top politician and a TV soap came in 1998 when Mr Blair intervened in a Coronation Street storyline, pleading for the release of Deirdre Barlow after she was convicted of a crime she did not commit. Deirdre, a stalwart of the cobbles played by Anne Kirkbride, was jailed for mortgage and credit card fraud while her conman lover Jon Lindsay walked free. After newspapers launched campaigns to free her, the prime minister joined in, announcing he would order the home secretary Jack Straw to investigate Deirdre's case. Sir Lindsay's appearance in Emmerdale was far less controversial."

It is an embarrassing but perhaps predictable end to years of ambitious talk about finally coming up with a solution to the social care crisis. In a statement at Holyrood, the government tore up parts of the bill that would require major structural changes to the Scottish social care system. The downfall of the plan wasn't money or lack of ambition necessarily. And there was cross-party agreement on what needed to be done. The problem was a frustrating lack of consensus on how to get there. It is also the end of the process that has been costly too. More than £30m has already been spent on planning the policy cover the last three years. \n                  Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk failed to disclose more payments made to healthcare groups - watchdog\n                 \n                  ARFID: The little-known eating disorder that is on the rise\n                 \n                  Woman becomes world's longest-living recipient of pig organ transplant: 'I feel like superwoman'\n                 It was one of the boldest public service reforms of the SNP's 17 years in power, with the scheme forming a key policy of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon's administration.

Now, the plan is in tatters, and it tells us a lot about how difficult social care reform is and what might lie in store for the Westminster government. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has unveiled plans to reform the social care system with his own version of a National Care Service, designed to bring it closer to the National Health Service.  Mr Streeting announced the formation of an independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, to develop comprehensive proposals for organising and funding social care.  But the past is littered with broken promises when it comes to social care reform. Successive governments from Tony Blair right through to Boris Johnson have failed to grasp the nettle and implement plans. It is in part due to the billions of pounds that would be needed to pay for it - likely raised through taxes - but it has also failed because political parties haven't been able to work together to make reform a reality. The failure of the Scottish plan does not bode well for future social care reforms across the rest of the UK."

        "Content": "A human case of bird flu has been found in England, health officials have said. The virus was detected in a person in the West Midlands region who is said to have been infected while on a farm, having had \"close and prolonged contact with a large number of infected birds\". The birds had the DI.2 genotype - which is known to be circulating in birds in the UK this season, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Monday. It is different to strains circulating among mammals and birds in the US. Anyone the individual has been in contact with has been contacted by officials and those at highest risk of exposure have been offered antiviral treatment, the agency said in a statement. The person concerned is \"currently well\" and being treated at a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) unit. The risk to the wider public is \"very low\", the agency said, adding that it's rare for people to catch the H5N1 virus, also called avian influenza, from birds. No cases of human-to-human transmission have been detected despite what the UKHSA called \"extensive recent surveillance of influenza A(H5N1)\" amid multiple bird flu outbreaks in birds across the country. The case was detected as part of routine surveillance for bird flu by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), which discovered an outbreak in a flock of birds. Professor Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at UKHSA, said the risk of avian flu to the general public is still \"very low\", and there is currently \"no evidence of onwards transmission\" from the case. She said the public should not \"touch sick or dead birds\" and follow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) advice about reporting any suspected cases. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said it's very rare for a human to catch the disease, even though it is \"highly contagious\" in birds. All the infected birds are being \"humanely culled\" and the premises \"cleaned and disinfected\". She warned of a \"growing number of avian flu cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country\". Andrew Gwynne, Minister for Public Health and Prevention, said his department is \"monitoring this situation closely\", but the risk of wider or onward transmission is \"very low\". The government has stocked up on H5 vaccine, which protects against bird flu, he said.

On Saturday, the UK Chief Veterinary Officer ordered a new Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) covering the whole of England and Scotland following the rise in cases. Last month, scientists at the University of Glasgow said bird flu can infect horses without causing any symptoms, raising fears that the virus could be spreading undetected."

        "Content": "Bristol City Council could become the first local authority in England to collect black bin household waste every four weeks. The council said it \"firmly\" believes that collecting black bin waste every three or four weeks instead of once a fortnight \"will increase the amount of waste our city recycles, reduce costs and significantly lower carbon emissions\". The Guardian reported that if it does move to four-weekly collections, the council will be the first in England to do so. Bristol's Green-led council launched a six-week consultation on managing household waste on Monday. Explaining the consultation on its website, Councillor Martin Fodor, chair of the council's environment and sustainability committee, said changing to less frequent collections could cut the amount of waste going to landfill or being burned by \"between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes\". He referenced the examples of Salford and Rhondda Cynon Taf as evidence. Black bin waste is collected every three weeks in both areas. Bristol is home to about 483,000 people living in more than 191,000 households, with each person creating up to 400kg (882 lbs) of household waste a year. For the past two years, the city has recycled about 45% of its household waste, which puts it \"amongst the top tier of cities in the UK\", but the rate is dropping, and the national target is to recycle 65% by 2035. Councillor Fodor said the current methods of dealing with black bin waste - incineration or landfill - have \"serious environmental and cost issues\". New charges on disposing of black bin waste by those methods will cost the city a further £8m a year, meaning, he said, it will \"very soon start to cost every household a lot more unless we do something about it\". \"Burning or leaving waste to decompose in landfill releases carbon and other harmful substances into the atmosphere.

        "Content": "Heathrow Airport's expansion plans may finally go ahead after almost 20 years of debates and delays. Its potential revival comes after Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated she would overrule environmental objections to allow London's biggest airport to carry out its plans in order to prioritise economic growth. She is expected to use a speech this week to support the expansion, as well as similar plans for Gatwick and Luton. But what exactly does the airport want to do, and why has it proved so controversial? Heathrow wants a new runway The west London hub wants to build a third runway to the north-west of the existing two, which it says would enable an additional 260,000 flights per year and \"allow Britain as a sovereign nation to compete more effectively for trade\". Its plans also include a new terminal building to the west of Terminal 5 and the eventual demolition of Terminal 3 to make way for a series of new satellite terminals and more public transport. Despite being given parliamentary approval in 2018, plans have been delayed by legal challenges and the COVID pandemic. Why is it controversial? Environmental groups have campaigned against the expansion since the plans were drawn up. Last week, Jenny Bates, transport campaigner at Friends of the Earth, called the proposal for another runway at Heathrow \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\", while Alethea Warrington, from climate charity Possible, said: \"Approving airport expansions would be a catastrophic misstep for a government which claims to be a climate leader.\" It has had critics across politics over the years, including from Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan, on the basis of the impact on air quality, noise and net-zero targets. Boris Johnson was a long-standing opponent of the plans, and promised to \"lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop construction\" when he was London mayor for the Conservatives - though he toned down his rhetoric once he was prime minister. One of the louder critics has been Ed Miliband, who threatened to resign from Gordon Brown's cabinet over the plans in 2009 when he was energy and climate change secretary. In 2018, he said an expansion was \"very likely\" to make air pollution worse. Mr Miliband, now net zero secretary, has said he will not resign from the government if the expansion goes ahead, adding that the government's position is for any aviation expansion to take place within the UK's carbon budgets, which are part of plans to meet the country's 2050 target of reducing emissions by 100% compared with 1990 levels. \"We believe that we can meet our growth mission - our number one priority - and keep within carbon budgets and indeed that our clean energy mission is crucial and a central part of meeting our growth mission,\" he said last week. \"Far from them being in contradiction, they are absolutely complimentary.\" Other London airports also pushing for expansions Gatwick and Luton airports are also hoping to expand in the near future. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has a deadline of 27 February to make a decision on a second runway at Gatwick, which would effectively involve modifying an existing taxiway. Gatwick's majority owners, VINCI Airports, said the £2.2bn project would create 14,000 jobs and generate £1bn a year in economic benefits. But Communities Against Gatwick Noise and Emissions (CAGNE) insisted they would legally challenge any second runway. Meanwhile, Luton Airport, owned by the local council in Bedfordshire, has applied to build a new terminal and asked for permission to increase its passenger numbers to 32 million a year. It carried about 16.7 million in 2024. Dr Alex Chapman, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), said he believes the suggested growth benefits of UK airport expansion don't stack up. He added: \"The massive climate damage caused by these schemes will create deep physical and economic hardship for millions and will wipe out any benefit from the government's other climate policy efforts almost overnight.\" What has Rachel Reeves said?  The chancellor dropped a heavy hint on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that she intends to dismiss climate concerns and back Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton expansions as she said \"growth is the number one mission of this government\". Asked directly if she would now put the runway, along with expansion at Gatwick and Luton, ahead of the UK's net zero commitments, Ms Reeves said: \"I'm not going to comment on speculation, but what I would say is when the last government faced difficult decisions about whether to support infrastructure investment, the answer always seemed to be no. \"We can't carry on like that, because if we do, we will miss out on crucial investment here into Britain. You've already seen a number of decisions, including on Stansted and City Airport, on energy projects, on transport infrastructure because we are determined to grow the economy.\" Conservative leader in favour of Heathrow expansion  Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips she \"certainly would\" back Heathrow's plans. \"I've had to vote on this before, and I voted in support of the third runway,\" Ms Badenoch, whose North West Essex constituency includes London Stansted Airport, said. \"I know that it is very difficult for a lot of people when there's an airport in your area. I know, because I'm the MP for an airport as well. I have never opposed growth or development. \"What I want to do is make sure it's done in the right way.\" Ms Badenoch added if the airport thinks it is able to deliver a third runway that meets all the criteria it has set, then we should \"do the right thing\". \"We are talking about the future,\" she said, adding: \"I think that we need to make sure that we deliver infrastructure. I voted for it before, so why would I change my mind?\" What has Heathrow said? A spokesperson for Heathrow would not comment on reporting about a third runway, but said \"growing the economy means adding capacity at the UK's hub airport which is full\". In a statement to Sky News, the airport added it was \"looking at potential options to deliver a third runway at Heathrow in line with strict tests on carbon, noise and air quality\"."

        "Content": "\n          Social affairs and health reporter\n              @megbaynes\n The company behind popular weight-loss drugs failed to disclose even more money it paid to healthcare groups and patient organisations , a pharmaceutical watchdog has said.  Novo Nordisk - which manufactures Wegovy, Ozempic and Saxenda - misreported, under-reported or did not disclose funding it gave to pharmacy firms, obesity charities and other professional bodies, according to the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA). It's not the first time Novo Nordisk has failed to disclose the payments it has made. In 2023, it admitted to the PMCPA it had not disclosed £7.8m it paid to more than 150 organisations over three years. A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said the organisation was \"dedicated to working transparently and ethically, taking the reporting of these historical transfers of value extremely seriously\". The new complaint was submitted by the University of Bath and Lund University and looked at £1.2m in undisclosed payments made by Novo Nordisk to healthcare and patient organisations. Some of the payments (£609,027) had previously been disclosed voluntarily by the company in 2023. But the latest investigation revealed that Novo Nordisk still failed to disclose a further £635,000 in payments. The company said the figures submitted in their voluntary admission were a \"best estimate\". The PMCPA said the complaint \"raised questions about the culture of the company and demonstrated poor governance and a lack of care\". Payments were also misattributed to the wrong organisations, including £338,435 paid to the World Obesity Federation that was originally listed as paid to the Association for British HealthTech Industries. The investigation, led by researchers from the University of Bath, UK and Lund University, Sweden, uncovered a number of serious breaches of the pharmaceutical industry's code of practice, which the watchdog upheld. Dr Emily Rickard said: \"The failure to disclose payments is especially troubling, given it coincided with the UK launch of blockbuster weight-loss drugs like Wegovy. It raises serious questions about transparency and accountability.\" \"We have already implemented mitigating actions to future-proof how we track and disclose transfers of value, and continue to collaborate with external partners to ensure robust systems and processes are in place,\" Novo Nordisk said \"This has enabled us to resubmit all relevant historical data to Disclosure UK and ensure all future transfers of value are accurately and efficiently tracked and disclosed.\" Read more:'King Kong' weight loss drug to be given to fraction of eligible peopleWhy obesity rates may start falling this year One doctor called for a \"total overhaul\" following the findings. \"When a company as large as Novo Nordisk doesn't disclose payments, it's not just damaging to their reputation - it undermines trust in the entire healthcare system,\" said Dr Piotr Ozieranski. \"Transparency in the UK's pharmaceutical industry is transparency in name only. A total overhaul is urgently needed.\" '20 patients every hour' It comes as pharmacy leaders issued a fresh warning over the sale of weight-loss jabs in the UK, amid reports some online sellers have set targets for clinicians to process more than 20 patients every hour. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) said it was aware of people who had a history of eating disorders, or low body weight, being prescribed the jabs. A Sky News investigation found the drugs are easily available via online pharmacies. The NPA has written to the General Pharmaceutical Council saying current rules leave the door open for medicines to be supplied without appropriate checks \"and the risk to patient safety remains\". Weight loss jabs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by reducing food cravings. Hundreds of thousands of patients are estimated to be buying these drugs privately via online pharmacies. The NPA has previously urged patients against buying the jabs from unregulated sellers, who may be selling counterfeit products."

The 61-year-old, who has not been named, helped men and women \"gain an unfair advantage\" in the Life in the UK Test, the Home Office said.
