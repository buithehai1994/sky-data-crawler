        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n A headline tax-raising measure expected in today's budget is an extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. The amount people pay is dependent on how much they earn, with different tax bands kicking in at different income levels. Read more: Chancellor to announce tax rises in budget In the past, these thresholds have been increased in line with inflation. But more recently they have been frozen, leaving people paying more to the exchequer even if actual tax rates stay the same. The Conservative government began the thresholds freeze in 2021. At last year's budget, Rachel Reeves said the Labour government would extend the freeze though not beyond 2028, as to do so would \"hurt working people\". Sky News looks at what the thresholds are, the implications of freezing them, and how that causes \"fiscal drag\". Income tax thresholds England, Northern Ireland and Wales all have the same income tax rates, set by the British government. Scotland's income tax bands are set by the Scottish government, so Westminster budget announcements on income tax do not affect workers in Scotland. For England, Northern Ireland and Wales, there is a \"personal allowance\" of £12,570, under which no income tax is paid. For those earning above £100,000, the personal allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 of income, and can go down to zero, so a person can end up paying income tax on all of their income. What does freezing thresholds do? Thresholds were previously increased annually by consumer price index (CPI) inflation - the estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought by households. But, because income tax thresholds have been frozen while wages continue to rise, more people are being brought into higher bands and having to pay more income tax. A worker whose earnings just keep up with inflation is paying a larger proportion of their salary in tax due to the freeze. This means more money for the government - a lot more.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates a continuing freeze in thresholds would raise about £42.9bn annually by the 2027/28 tax year. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has projected that freezes to the basic and higher rates of income tax alone would raise £39bn a year by 2029-30. That is roughly similar to the amount of revenue that would be raised by increasing all income tax rates by 3.5 percentage points.  Fiscal drag Freezing income tax thresholds without tax rates increasing has been branded a \"stealth tax\", as the government collects more revenue without having to pass a law to raise tax rates. It is also known as fiscal drag, as more people are pulled into paying tax, or into paying tax at a higher rate. The OBR estimates the freeze will bring nearly four million more people into paying income tax, three million more people into the higher rate (40%) and 400,000 more into the additional rate (45%) by 2028-29."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has claimed Russia is \"making concessions\" in talks to end the Ukraine war - and that Kyiv is \"happy\" with how talks are progressing. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew out to his Florida estate for Thanksgiving, Mr Trump said \"we're making progress\" on a deal and said he would be willing to meet with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy once they are close to an agreement. He also said his previously announced deadline of Thursday, which is Thanksgiving, was no longer in place - and that the White House's initial 28-point peace plan, which sparked such concern in Kyiv, \"was just a map\". Asked if Ukraine had been asked to hand over too much territory, Mr Trump suggested that \"over the next couple of months [that] might be gotten by Russia anyway\". Moscow's concessions are a promise to stop fighting, \"and they don't take any more land\", he said. \"The deadline for me is when it's over,\" he added. \"And I think everybody's tired of fighting at this moment.\"  Before boarding the plane, Mr Trump had claimed only a few \"points of disagreement\" remain between the two sides. Mr Trump's negotiator Steve Witkoff will be meeting with Mr Putin in Moscow next week, the president said, while American army secretary Daniel Driscoll is due to travel to Kyiv for talks this week. The chief of Ukraine's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote: \"Ukraine has never been and will never be an obstacle to peace. We are grateful to the US for all its support. \"The meeting between the presidents will be thoroughly and promptly prepared on our part.\" Zelenskyy warns against 'behind our back' deal Yesterday, a virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting that featured Ukraine's allies took place, which was attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. In a speech, Mr Zelenskyy told attendees: \"We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe. \"Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work.\"  A joint statement from coalition leaders Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Friedrich Merz said they had agreed with Mr Rubio \"to accelerate joint work\" with the US on the planning of security guarantees for Ukraine. But a Ukrainian diplomat has warned major sticking points remain in the peace deal being thrashed out - primarily the prospect of territorial concessions. A warning from the Kremlin Meanwhile, Moscow has stressed that it will not allow any agreement to stray too far from its own objectives. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned any amended peace plan must reflect the understanding reached between Mr Trump and Mr Putin over the summer. \"If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation,\" he said, referring to the two leaders' meeting in Alaska.

Meanwhile, three people died and homes were damaged after Ukraine launched an attack on southern Russia. 'A critical juncture' French President Emmanuel Macron has said peace efforts are gathering momentum, but \"are clearly at a critical juncture\". And during the annual White House turkey pardon ahead of Thanksgiving, Mr Trump told reporters: \"I think we're getting close to a deal. We'll find out. \"I thought that would have been an easier one, but I think we're making progress.\""

Trump is due to travel to his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago tonight, where he will remain until Sunday. He set a deadline of Thursday - Thanksgiving - for some sort of agreement on his plan.

        "Content": " The British Army has paused the use of its new Ajax armoured fighting vehicles after \"around 30\" soldiers suffered vibration and hearing problems following a training exercise at the weekend. A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Tuesday the two-week pause comes after \"a small number of soldiers reported symptoms of noise and vibration\" in the exercise, which was \"immediately stopped\". The spokesperson said \"around 30 personnel presented noise and vibration symptoms\" after tests were carried out, but the \"vast majority of these have now been medically cleared and are continuing on duty\".  A small number \"continue to receive expert medical care\", they said. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the minister for defence readiness and industry [Luke Pollard] has asked the army to pause all use of Ajax for training and exercising for two weeks, while a safety investigation is carried out into the events this weekend. \"A small amount of testing of the vehicle will continue, in order to ensure that any issues can to identified and resolved.\" The MoD said the decision \"underlines our absolute commitment to the safety of our personnel.

The Ajax, which costs nearly £10m and weighs more than 40 tonnes, is being billed by the ministry as a \"next generation\" fighting machine. As heavy as a Russian tank, the vehicle is equipped with cameras, protective armour and a 40mm gun, with bullets that can rip through concrete. Soldiers were taken to hospital this summer after suffering hearing and other injuries because of loud noise and vibrations coming from the vehicles. Earlier this month, the MoD confirmed that a \"small number\" of troops had reported noise and vibration concerns following trials on three variants of the tracked vehicle. Read more on Sky News:Is the Ajax any good?UK defence plan's 'glacial' progressDamning report into UK's fast jets programme A spokesperson said an investigation was carried out and \"no systemic issues were found\". An internal review published in 2021 found that senior soldiers and MoD officials had known for up to two years that earlier faults with the Ajax vehicle had been putting troops at risk of harm. The health and safety report revealed that issues such as potential hearing damage had first been raised in December 2018, but trials were not suspended until November 2020. At that time, more than 300 soldiers were offered hearing tests, with 17 still under specialist care as of December 2021. A total of 589 of the various Ajax models have been ordered by the army, which it expects to receive by 2030. The Ajax could be deployed to Ukraine to support any possible peace deal, the MoD has indicated."

        "Content": "By Mollie Malone, home news correspondent and Mhari Aurora, political correspondent   Ministers have been briefed on major curbs to the jury service which could see juries only used to decide on cases of murder, rape or manslaughter, Sky News understands. The move would see the majority of cases heard by a judge alone, except for the most serious or those in the \"public interest\". The change is expected to be formally announced by the government next week. Sky News previously reported the Ministry of Justice was set to remove the right to trial by jury for thousands of cases, in a controversial measure which would mark a move away from a core pillar of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. A memo sent by David Lammy to fellow ministers, seen by the Times, says there is \"no right\" to jury trials in the UK and that drastic action was needed to cut the backlog of cases in the crown courts, nearing 80,000. A spokesman for the government confirmed changes are coming soon to deal with the backlog.  Speaking to Sky News' Politics Hub programme, work and pensions secretary Pat McFadden did not deny the changes were on the way. \n                  Tasers to be used in prisons to tackle 'unacceptably high' levels of violence \n                 \n                  Foreign prisoners to be deported earlier under new plans \n                 \n                  Sentencing guidelines for ethnic minority suspects delayed after backlash\n                 He said he \"wouldn't be surprised if my colleagues at the [Ministry of Justice] are looking at perhaps some radical ways they could reduce that backlog\". McFadden said that backlogs in the courts system are getting too long and not showing any sign of shortening. He referenced the saying that \"justice delayed is justice denied\" - implying that a non-jury trial is better than no trial at all. In the summer, retired Court of Appeal judge, Sir Brian Leveson, made recommendations to government, including a suggestion to end jury trials for many serious offences, saying they could be dealt with by a judge alone or a judge with two magistrates. This would have been done by creating a new intermediate court, called the Crown Court Bench Division, sitting between magistrates courts and crown courts. The plans in the leaked document go further than that, with suggestions that offences likely to receive a sentence of up to five years would be heard by judges alone. When Mr Lammy took up his position in September, it is understood he saw the courts as his 'crisis' to tackle, with his predecessor, Shabana Mahmood, having been seen to have gripped the immediacy of the prison overcrowding crisis. Sir Brian suggested a judge and two magistrates should hear cases with a maximum sentence of three years. These measures will be highly controversial, with the leader of the Conservatives Kemi Badenoch saying the move \"risks fairness, undermines public trust and erodes the very foundation of our justice system\". The Criminal Bar Association said the plans would \"eviscerate the jury trial as we know it\". Read more from Sky News:Man arrested in connection to waste dumpHeathrow's £33bn third runway plan chosen A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"No final decision has been taken by government. \"We have been clear there is a crisis in the courts, causing pain and anguish to victims - with 78,000 cases in the backlog and rising - which will require bold action to put right.\""

At a Downing Street vigil on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the group said urgent reforms to policing and sentencing are needed \"to address systemic failures\". Yasmin Javed, whose daughter Fawziyah Javed was killed after being pushed by her husband from Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, said authorities had ignored Fawziyah's reports of abuse. \"It fell on deaf ears,\" she told Sky News, explaining that Fawziyah, 31, who was pregnant when she died, had made complaints about her husband but had been murdered days before she was set to leave him. \"We've had our hearts ripped into millions of pieces. It's not getting any easier, it's getting more and more difficult.\" Kashif Anwar was convicted of Fawziyah's murder and was jailed for at least 20 years in 2023. Tuesday's vigil highlighted key legislative amendments the families, led by campaign group Southall Black Sisters, are championing. The amendments include Banaz's Law, named after 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod, who was subjected to an horrific assault, strangled and stuffed in a suitcase by family members on the orders of her father. The amendment seeks to explicitly recognise \"honour-based\" abuse as an aggravating factor in sentencing for relevant offences. The families also want courts to impose sentences equivalent to murder for self-harm and suicides driven by domestic and \"honour\"-based abuse, and say the government must ensure all women have equal access to safety and support, regardless of immigration status. Banaz Mahmod's sister Bekhal, who testified against her relatives to help secure their conviction, said nearly two decades after the murder, efforts to protect women had not progressed. Speaking from an undisclosed location in the witness protection scheme, she said the murder \"happened in 2006, and we're almost in 2026 - that's 20 years later. Not much has changed and it's very, very disappointing. \"What happened to Banaz has happened, but what we could do is prevent it from happening to other people. I don't understand why much more hasn't been done to better the situation for others.\""

        "Headline": "Chancellors can raise lots more income tax without actually increasing headline rates. The Conservatives began the practice in 2021, Labour have continued it, and are expected to extend it further today. This is how it works.",
        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n A headline tax-raising measure expected in today's budget is an extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. The amount people pay is dependent on how much they earn, with different tax bands kicking in at different income levels. Read more: Chancellor to announce tax rises in budget In the past, these thresholds have been increased in line with inflation. But more recently they have been frozen, leaving people paying more to the exchequer even if actual tax rates stay the same. The Conservative government began the thresholds freeze in 2021. At last year's budget, Rachel Reeves said the Labour government would extend the freeze though not beyond 2028, as to do so would \"hurt working people\". Sky News looks at what the thresholds are, the implications of freezing them, and how that causes \"fiscal drag\". Income tax thresholds England, Northern Ireland and Wales all have the same income tax rates, set by the British government. Scotland's income tax bands are set by the Scottish government, so Westminster budget announcements on income tax do not affect workers in Scotland. For England, Northern Ireland and Wales, there is a \"personal allowance\" of £12,570, under which no income tax is paid. For those earning above £100,000, the personal allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 of income, and can go down to zero, so a person can end up paying income tax on all of their income. What does freezing thresholds do? Thresholds were previously increased annually by consumer price index (CPI) inflation - the estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought by households. But, because income tax thresholds have been frozen while wages continue to rise, more people are being brought into higher bands and having to pay more income tax. A worker whose earnings just keep up with inflation is paying a larger proportion of their salary in tax due to the freeze. This means more money for the government - a lot more.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates a continuing freeze in thresholds would raise about £42.9bn annually by the 2027/28 tax year. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has projected that freezes to the basic and higher rates of income tax alone would raise £39bn a year by 2029-30. That is roughly similar to the amount of revenue that would be raised by increasing all income tax rates by 3.5 percentage points.  Fiscal drag Freezing income tax thresholds without tax rates increasing has been branded a \"stealth tax\", as the government collects more revenue without having to pass a law to raise tax rates. It is also known as fiscal drag, as more people are pulled into paying tax, or into paying tax at a higher rate. The OBR estimates the freeze will bring nearly four million more people into paying income tax, three million more people into the higher rate (40%) and 400,000 more into the additional rate (45%) by 2028-29."

Sir Sadiq said it is \"great news for London\" and said the tax will \"directly support London's economy and help cement our reputation as a global tourism and business destination\". The Greater London Authority previously estimated a £1 a day levy could raise £91m, and a 5% levy could raise £240m. Mr Burnham said the tax will allow Greater Manchester to \"invest in the infrastructure these visitors need, like keeping our streets clean and enhancing our public transport system through later running buses and trams, making sure every experience is a positive and memorable one\".

Kate Nicholls, chair of UKHospitality, warned the \"damaging holiday tax\" could cost the public up to £518 million, adding: \"Make no mistake - this cost will be passed directly on to consumers, drive inflation and undermine the government's aim to reduce the cost of living.\" The plans will be subject to a consultation running until 18 February, which will include considering whether there should be a cap on the amount."

A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said on Tuesday the two-week pause comes after \"a small number of soldiers reported symptoms of noise and vibration\" in the exercise, which was \"immediately stopped\". The spokesperson said \"around 30 personnel presented noise and vibration symptoms\" after tests were carried out, but the \"vast majority of these have now been medically cleared and are continuing on duty\".  A small number \"continue to receive expert medical care\", they said. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the minister for defence readiness and industry [Luke Pollard] has asked the army to pause all use of Ajax for training and exercising for two weeks, while a safety investigation is carried out into the events this weekend. \"A small amount of testing of the vehicle will continue, in order to ensure that any issues can to identified and resolved.\" The MoD said the decision \"underlines our absolute commitment to the safety of our personnel.

As heavy as a Russian tank, the vehicle is equipped with cameras, protective armour and a 40mm gun, with bullets that can rip through concrete. Soldiers were taken to hospital this summer after suffering hearing and other injuries because of loud noise and vibrations coming from the vehicles.

An internal review published in 2021 found that senior soldiers and MoD officials had known for up to two years that earlier faults with the Ajax vehicle had been putting troops at risk of harm. The health and safety report revealed that issues such as potential hearing damage had first been raised in December 2018, but trials were not suspended until November 2020. At that time, more than 300 soldiers were offered hearing tests, with 17 still under specialist care as of December 2021. A total of 589 of the various Ajax models have been ordered by the army, which it expects to receive by 2030. The Ajax could be deployed to Ukraine to support any possible peace deal, the MoD has indicated."

At a Downing Street vigil on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the group said urgent reforms to policing and sentencing are needed \"to address systemic failures\". Yasmin Javed, whose daughter Fawziyah Javed was killed after being pushed by her husband from Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, said authorities had ignored Fawziyah's reports of abuse. \"It fell on deaf ears,\" she told Sky News, explaining that Fawziyah, 31, who was pregnant when she died, had made complaints about her husband but had been murdered days before she was set to leave him. \"We've had our hearts ripped into millions of pieces. It's not getting any easier, it's getting more and more difficult.\" Kashif Anwar was convicted of Fawziyah's murder and was jailed for at least 20 years in 2023. Tuesday's vigil highlighted key legislative amendments the families, led by campaign group Southall Black Sisters, are championing. The amendments include Banaz's Law, named after 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod, who was subjected to an horrific assault, strangled and stuffed in a suitcase by family members on the orders of her father. The amendment seeks to explicitly recognise \"honour-based\" abuse as an aggravating factor in sentencing for relevant offences. The families also want courts to impose sentences equivalent to murder for self-harm and suicides driven by domestic and \"honour\"-based abuse, and say the government must ensure all women have equal access to safety and support, regardless of immigration status. Banaz Mahmod's sister Bekhal, who testified against her relatives to help secure their conviction, said nearly two decades after the murder, efforts to protect women had not progressed. Speaking from an undisclosed location in the witness protection scheme, she said the murder \"happened in 2006, and we're almost in 2026 - that's 20 years later. Not much has changed and it's very, very disappointing. \"What happened to Banaz has happened, but what we could do is prevent it from happening to other people. I don't understand why much more hasn't been done to better the situation for others.\""

Following the collision, which caused the police car's airbags to inflate, PC Cowan said Kastrati \"began to run away\". \n                  Inverness primary school cancels Christmas show after 'racist abuse'\n                 \n                  Sir Alex Ferguson backs 'life-changing' scholarships for disadvantaged Glasgow Caledonian University students\n                 \n                  Scotland to roll out 'simple' genetic test to help prevent deafness in babies\n                 The officer said he approached the accused with the intention of arresting him, but when he was about 10m away, Kastrati returned to his vehicle and retrieved a chainsaw. Kastrati was then said to have pursued PC Cowan while shouting \"f*** the police\". PC Cowan said: \"He was chasing after me with the chainsaw, holding the chainsaw up, running after me.\" He added: \"I thought if I don't create distance, he is going to kill me.\" The officer said he believed Kastrati would \"saw my arms off, chop my head off,\" and that he was \"terrified\".

Kastrati has been remanded in custody for 18 months since the incident. Defence lawyer John Scullion KC told the jury on Tuesday: \"Mr Kastrati accepts he removes a chainsaw from the car, he swore, he injured PC Cowan, he brandished the chainsaw at other officers during this frightening and distressing incident. You must convict him of those parts.\" However, Mr Scullion claimed the police investigation was \"flawed\" and \"lacked neutrality and objectivity\". Following Kastrati's conviction, Judge Gallacher told him: \"You have been convicted of a charge which is subject to a number of deletions but remains a very serious charge. \"The law requires I obtain more information upon you, but you may take it the court will in due course impose a significant penalty in relation to this very dangerous incident. \"I cannot do that until I get more information and will in due course get more information from Mr Scullion.\" Police Scotland Chief Superintendent Rhona Fraser said: \"I want to express my deepest thanks and gratitude to those involved for their bravery and professionalism when faced with such danger and hatred from Kastrati who clearly intended to harm. \"Every officer has the fundamental right to come home from each shift unharmed. No-one should face this deplorable level of criminality and it will not be tolerated.\""

        "Content": "By Mollie Malone, home news correspondent and Mhari Aurora, political correspondent   Ministers have been briefed on major curbs to the jury service which could see juries only used to decide on cases of murder, rape or manslaughter, Sky News understands. The move would see the majority of cases heard by a judge alone, except for the most serious or those in the \"public interest\". The change is expected to be formally announced by the government next week. Sky News previously reported the Ministry of Justice was set to remove the right to trial by jury for thousands of cases, in a controversial measure which would mark a move away from a core pillar of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. A memo sent by David Lammy to fellow ministers, seen by the Times, says there is \"no right\" to jury trials in the UK and that drastic action was needed to cut the backlog of cases in the crown courts, nearing 80,000. A spokesman for the government confirmed changes are coming soon to deal with the backlog.  Speaking to Sky News' Politics Hub programme, work and pensions secretary Pat McFadden did not deny the changes were on the way. \n                  Tasers to be used in prisons to tackle 'unacceptably high' levels of violence \n                 \n                  Foreign prisoners to be deported earlier under new plans \n                 \n                  Sentencing guidelines for ethnic minority suspects delayed after backlash\n                 He said he \"wouldn't be surprised if my colleagues at the [Ministry of Justice] are looking at perhaps some radical ways they could reduce that backlog\". McFadden said that backlogs in the courts system are getting too long and not showing any sign of shortening. He referenced the saying that \"justice delayed is justice denied\" - implying that a non-jury trial is better than no trial at all. In the summer, retired Court of Appeal judge, Sir Brian Leveson, made recommendations to government, including a suggestion to end jury trials for many serious offences, saying they could be dealt with by a judge alone or a judge with two magistrates. This would have been done by creating a new intermediate court, called the Crown Court Bench Division, sitting between magistrates courts and crown courts. The plans in the leaked document go further than that, with suggestions that offences likely to receive a sentence of up to five years would be heard by judges alone. When Mr Lammy took up his position in September, it is understood he saw the courts as his 'crisis' to tackle, with his predecessor, Shabana Mahmood, having been seen to have gripped the immediacy of the prison overcrowding crisis. Sir Brian suggested a judge and two magistrates should hear cases with a maximum sentence of three years. These measures will be highly controversial, with the leader of the Conservatives Kemi Badenoch saying the move \"risks fairness, undermines public trust and erodes the very foundation of our justice system\". The Criminal Bar Association said the plans would \"eviscerate the jury trial as we know it\".

        "Content": " Donald Trump has claimed Russia is \"making concessions\" in talks to end the Ukraine war - and that Kyiv is \"happy\" with how talks are progressing. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew out to his Florida estate for Thanksgiving, Mr Trump said \"we're making progress\" on a deal and said he would be willing to meet with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy once they are close to an agreement. He also said his previously announced deadline of Thursday, which is Thanksgiving, was no longer in place - and that the White House's initial 28-point peace plan, which sparked such concern in Kyiv, \"was just a map\". Asked if Ukraine had been asked to hand over too much territory, Mr Trump suggested that \"over the next couple of months [that] might be gotten by Russia anyway\". Moscow's concessions are a promise to stop fighting, \"and they don't take any more land\", he said. \"The deadline for me is when it's over,\" he added. \"And I think everybody's tired of fighting at this moment.\"  Before boarding the plane, Mr Trump had claimed only a few \"points of disagreement\" remain between the two sides. Mr Trump's negotiator Steve Witkoff will be meeting with Mr Putin in Moscow next week, the president said, while American army secretary Daniel Driscoll is due to travel to Kyiv for talks this week. The chief of Ukraine's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote: \"Ukraine has never been and will never be an obstacle to peace. We are grateful to the US for all its support. \"The meeting between the presidents will be thoroughly and promptly prepared on our part.\" Zelenskyy warns against 'behind our back' deal Yesterday, a virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting that featured Ukraine's allies took place, which was attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. In a speech, Mr Zelenskyy told attendees: \"We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe. \"Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work.\"  A joint statement from coalition leaders Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Friedrich Merz said they had agreed with Mr Rubio \"to accelerate joint work\" with the US on the planning of security guarantees for Ukraine. But a Ukrainian diplomat has warned major sticking points remain in the peace deal being thrashed out - primarily the prospect of territorial concessions. A warning from the Kremlin Meanwhile, Moscow has stressed that it will not allow any agreement to stray too far from its own objectives. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned any amended peace plan must reflect the understanding reached between Mr Trump and Mr Putin over the summer. \"If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation,\" he said, referring to the two leaders' meeting in Alaska.

Meanwhile, three people died and homes were damaged after Ukraine launched an attack on southern Russia. 'A critical juncture' French President Emmanuel Macron has said peace efforts are gathering momentum, but \"are clearly at a critical juncture\". And during the annual White House turkey pardon ahead of Thanksgiving, Mr Trump told reporters: \"I think we're getting close to a deal. We'll find out. \"I thought that would have been an easier one, but I think we're making progress.\""

Two men and two women from the Paris region were detained on Tuesday, prosecutor Laure Beccuau said. Ms Beccuau's statement did not say what role the quartet are suspected of having played in the robbery. The two men are aged 38 and 39, and the two women are aged 31 and 40. They are being interrogated by police, who can hold them for questioning for 96 hours.  The latest arrests come after investigating magistrates filed preliminary charges against three men and one woman who were arrested last month. Some of the French Crown Jewels, worth an estimated £76m, were stolen in the audacious October raid. The haul - which included a diamond and emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Amelie and Hortense, and Empress Eugenie's pearl and diamond tiara - has not been recovered. The heist was pulled off in mere minutes last month - and took place while the Louvre was open to visitors, raising doubts over the credibility of the world's most-visited museum as a guardian for its priceless works. On Sunday 19 October, two men used a stolen furniture lift to access the second floor Galerie d'Apollon. They then cracked open display cases with angle grinders before escaping with their loot and fleeing on the back of two scooters driven by accomplices.

That's the way they will probably disappear forever. \"They [the police] have a week. If they catch the thieves, the stuff might still be there. If it takes longer, the loot is probably gone and dismantled. It's a race against time.\""

        "Content": "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid distribution group, has said it will permanently cease operations. Set up as an alternative to United Nations aid programmes in May, GHF's executive director John Acree said on Monday that it \"succeeded in our mission of showing there's a better way to deliver aid to Gazans\". The foundation had already closed down aid distribution sites after US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan was agreed by Hamas and Israel in October. The GHF which began operations in Gaza after an Israeli blockade of food deliveries, lasting nearly three months, was criticised by Palestinians, aid workers and health officials who said it forced people to risk their lives to reach the sites. According to witnesses and videos posted to social media, Israeli soldiers repeatedly opened fire at the sites, killing hundreds. The IDF denied this, saying it only fired warning shots as a crowd-control measure or if its troops were in danger. In July, analysis from Sky News' Data and Forensics team found that aid distributions by GHF were associated with a significant increase in deaths.

The GHF would hand over its work to the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center in Israel overseeing the Gaza ceasefire. \"We are winding down our operations as we have succeeded in our mission of showing there's a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,\" Mr Acree said. The GHF director added: \"At a critical juncture, we are proud to have been the only aid operation that reliably and safely provided free meals directly to Palestinian people in Gaza, at scale and without diversion. \"From our very first day of operations, our mission was singular: feed civilians in desperate need. We built a new model that worked, saved lives, and restored dignity to civilians in Gaza.\" According to the GHF website, the group distributed more than three million food boxes, totalling 187 million meals, and supplied 1.1 million packs of Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) for malnourished children.

US state department deputy spokesperson Tommy Piggot also said on X that the aid group \"shared valuable lessons learned with us and our partners\". \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire,\" he added."

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, ruled that Bolsonaro will stay at the same federal police headquarters where he has been held since his preemptive arrest on Saturday for being considered a flight risk. The justice considered that Bolsonaro's defence team had exhausted all appeals of his conviction. His lawyers wanted him to be on house arrest due to his poor health. The 70-year-old won't have any contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters. His 12-square-metre room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a TV set and a desk, according to federal police. Brazil's criminal law also could have allowed him to be transferred to a local penitentiary or to a prison room in a military facility in the capital, Brasilia. \n                  Russia 'making concessions' and Ukraine 'happy' with peace deal talks, says Trump\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy is racing to beat Donald Trump's peace plan deadline – but what will Russia do?\n                 \n                  Four more arrests made over Louvre heist as £76m haul remains missing\n                 Bolsonaro had been under house arrest since August, after de Moraes first raised concerns that he might attempt to flee. Bolsonaro claimed that \"hallucinations\" led to an attempt to tamper with his electronic ankle tag while working with a welder on Saturday, but de Moraes rejected this explanation in his preemptive arrest order. The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a Supreme Court panel for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democracy following his defeat in the 2022 election. The plot allegedly included plans to kill president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, vice president Geraldo Alckmin, and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, as well as to incite an insurrection in early 2023.

He has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Bolsonaro, an ally of US President Donald Trump, remains a key figure in Brazilian politics, despite being ineligible to run for office until at least 2030 after a separate ruling by Brazil's top electoral court. Polls indicate he would be a competitive candidate if permitted to contest next year’s election. Bolsonaro is not the first former president to serve time in prison. Both his predecessor, Michel Temer, and his successor, Lula, have also been to prison."

        "Content": "Tokyo has lost its long-held title as the world's most populous megacity and now ranks third, according to a new report. Jakarta, in Indonesia, has taken the top spot and is predicted to keep it until 2050, when the rise of Dhaka is expected to see the Bangladeshi capital top the tables. A new report from the United Nations shows the number of megacities - cities with a population of 10 million or more - quadrupled from eight in 1975 to 33 in 2025, and they're predominantly located in Asia. The report, which uses UN estimates and is an update of the organisation's 2018 data, highlights the dramatic increase in city living, a relatively new phenomenon. As recently as 1950, living in a city was highly unusual - with only 20% of the world's population living in one. Tokyo, which has held the title of the world's most populous city for decades, has seen its population increase gradually over the last 25 years. While 33.4 million people call the Japanese capital their home, it has been passed by Jakarta and Dhaka. The two cities have seen their populations grow at more than five and seven times the rate of Tokyo's since 2000, respectively. Today, Jakarta's population stands at nearly 42 million, followed by Dhaka with almost 37 million. By 2050, Dhaka's population is predicted to reach 52.1 million, beating Jakarta to the top spot by just 300,000. Tokyo will continue to fall down the rankings to seventh position by 2050, being overtaken by cities such as Shanghai and New Delhi. London to remain one of Europe's only megacities  While the number of megacities is expected to increase from 33 to 37 by 2050, none of the new ones will be in Europe. London, Istanbul and Moscow will remain the continent's only megacities. According to the UN data, London will see its population grow by almost a million and a half by 2050 - meaning it will retain its title as the world's 33rd largest city.

What about the UK's other cities? While London receives the most attention in the report, it is an outlier, with most other UK cities - such as Cardiff and Inverness - being the norm. The report emphasises how, despite the number of cities worldwide more than doubling between 1975 and 2025, 96% of cities have fewer than 1 million inhabitants. Most cities are smaller still, with 81% having a population of 250,000 or fewer. Globally, 45% of us now live in cities, with 36% of people living in towns and the remaining 19% living in rural communities."

It comes after the Ethiopian volcano erupted for the first time in recorded history on Sunday morning, leaving the neighbouring village of Afdera covered in dust.

        "Content": "Taiwan's prime minister has warned that a \"return\" to China is not an option. Cho Jung-tai's remarks came hours after President Xi Jinping mentioned the issue on a phone call with his US counterpart Donald Trump. Mr Xi had described Taiwan's return to mainland China as \"an integral part of the post-war international order\". But the island's democratically elected government has rejected this - describing Taiwan as a \"fully sovereign and independent country\". \"For the 23 million people of our nation, 'return' is not an option - this is very clear,\" Mr Cho added.  China has offered Taiwan a \"one country, two systems\" model, but this position is not supported by any mainstream political party. Meanwhile, relations between Beijing and Tokyo recently plunged to fresh lows after Japan's prime minister suggested any attack on Taiwan would spark a military response. Sanae Takaichi's remarks were swiftly denounced by China's foreign ministry, which said Japan had \"crossed a red line that should not have been touched\". Sun Yun from the Stimson Centre thinktank said: \"My best guess is China is worried about the escalation with Japan. \"The reference to Taiwan and the post-World War II order directly points to the spat with Japan over Taiwan.\"  The US has not taken a side when it comes to Taiwan's sovereignty but is opposed to any use of force to seize the territory. Mr Trump's administration has also been ambiguous over whether it would deploy US troops if war broke out in the Taiwan Strait. Yesterday, Taiwan's defence ministry spotted a single balloon from China flying over the strait and claims this is part of a campaign of harassment by Beijing. Chinese officials have previously dismissed these complaints, arguing the balloons are for meteorological purposes. In other developments, Mr Trump has confirmed that he will visit Beijing in April - with Mr Xi set to travel to Washington for a state visit later in 2026.

The warning comes in an open letter signed by Cherie Blair - the barrister and wife of ex-prime minister Sir Tony Blair - and two former Tory cabinet ministers: Sir Robert Buckland, who served as justice secretary and Dominic Grieve, an ex-attorney general. They wrote that the criminal proceedings against Ms Siddiq were \"artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution\". Politics latest: Milkshakes and lattes to be taxed in budget Ms Siddiq resigned as city minister earlier this year following accusations she illegally received a plot of land in a new high-end development on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital, from her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister last year. Bangladesh's anti-corruption commission (ACC) has claimed the Labour MP received a 7,200sq ft plot in the diplomatic zone through \"abuse of power and influence\".

The former minister has not attended the trial and has maintained that the allegations against her are vexatious and part of a smear campaign. Earlier this month, Hasina was sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court after she was found guilty of crimes against humanity. In the letter, which was hand-delivered to the Bangladeshi High Commission on Monday evening, the lawyers wrote that Ms Siddiq \"does not have a proper opportunity of defending herself\". \"She is being tried in her absence without justification and… the proceedings fall far short of standards of fairness recognised internationally,\" they said.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew out to his Florida estate for Thanksgiving, Mr Trump said \"we're making progress\" on a deal and said he would be willing to meet with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy once they are close to an agreement. He also said his previously announced deadline of Thursday, which is Thanksgiving, was no longer in place - and that the White House's initial 28-point peace plan, which sparked such concern in Kyiv, \"was just a map\". Asked if Ukraine had been asked to hand over too much territory, Mr Trump suggested that \"over the next couple of months [that] might be gotten by Russia anyway\".

In a speech, Mr Zelenskyy told attendees: \"We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe. \"Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work.\"  A joint statement from coalition leaders Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Friedrich Merz said they had agreed with Mr Rubio \"to accelerate joint work\" with the US on the planning of security guarantees for Ukraine.

A warning from the Kremlin Meanwhile, Moscow has stressed that it will not allow any agreement to stray too far from its own objectives.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  \"Drill, baby, drill\" was Donald Trump's campaign pledge - and he's following through with a proposal to expand fossil fuel production, which environmentalists say would have devastating consequences. The Trump administration has tabled a plan to open federal waters off the coasts of California, Florida, and Alaska to oil and gas drilling for the first time in decades - including areas that have never been touched. A total of one billion acres of water would be offered for lease under the proposal. That's equivalent to more than half the total land mass of the US. While the rest of the Western world is striving to move away from fossil fuels, the US appears to be gravitating back towards them, with the administration describing climate change as a \"hoax,\" \"a scam,\" and a \"con job\". In Huntington Beach - a coastal community in California that calls itself \"Surf City USA\" - a huge oil spill in 2021 shut down a miles-long stretch of the coastline, killing wildlife and soiling the sand. From the beach, where surfers lay out alongside tourists and dog walkers, you can see Platform Esther, a hulking oil rig built in 1965 that ceased production in August this year. Sea lions hug the metal pillars on the rig and dozens of birds perch on the platform. 'What we have here is irreplaceable' Pete Stauffer, ocean protection manager at the Surfrider Foundation, said: \"Here in California, we depend on a clean and healthy coastal environment - whether it's coastal tourism, whether it's fisheries, or local businesses and jobs. \"All these things are tied to what we have here, which is really an outstanding marine ecosystem. \"No disrespect to Mickey Mouse, but you can build another theme park. What we have here is irreplaceable. Why would you put that at risk?\" As a state, California views itself as a leader on climate action. A massive spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969 sparked the modern environmental movement. 'We need as much oil as possible' But the Trump administration says more oil drilling will help make the country energy independent, bringing new jobs and reducing petrol prices. That messaging has resonated with some here. Johnny Long is a surfer who lives in Huntington Beach. \"Drill, baby, drill,\" he says, when I ask about Trump's plans for more offshore drilling. \"We need as much oil as possible. It's right below us. We need to take it and extract it and bring the gas prices down, it's absolutely fantastic.\" I ask about concerns that it will be detrimental to the local environment and beyond. \"I'd say phoeey on that,\" Johnny responds. \"It's ridiculous. Climate change is a hoax.\" Read more climate news:What did COP30 achieve?How final deal was reached But others vehemently disagree - including Linda from nearby Seal Beach: \"It's so bad for the environment. It's already bad enough, you know, and they're gonna drill, and what happens when they drill? They always have accidents because people are human and accidents happen. \"Trump and his goonies don't care about the environment, all they care about is money.\" The president's push to expand fossil fuel production coincided with the UN climate conference. For the first time in the summit's history, the US didn't send a delegation. Critics say the snub shows a disregard for how future generations will be affected by the decisions the White House is making right now."

        "Content": "The Trump administration is planning its next move after the dismissal of criminal cases against former FBI director James Comey and New York attorney general Letitia James. A US federal judge ruled on Monday that the prosecutor who brought the charges had been illegally appointed. Donald Trump had urged the prosecution of the pair, but the rulings from US district judge Cameron McGowan Currie have, for now, halted proceedings against the pair, who have been publicly attacked by the US president. Mr Comey was appointed FBI director in 2013 by President Barack Obama, and at the time of Trump's 2016 election was overseeing an investigation into whether the Republican's presidential campaign had conspired with Russia. He was fired by Trump in May 2017. Ms James won against Trump and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings. The judge's dismissal of the cases against Mr Comey and Ms James amounts to a rebuke of the Trump administration's legal manoeuvring to install an inexperienced and loyalist prosecutor willing to prosecute the pair. Lindsey Halligan was appointed as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia by the administration. Defence lawyers, however, had argued that it had no legal authority to do so. \n                  Russia 'making concessions' and Ukraine 'happy' with peace deal talks, says Trump\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy is racing to beat Donald Trump's peace plan deadline – but what will Russia do?\n                 \n                  Trump follows through on 'drill, baby, drill' pledge - and it could have huge consequences\n                 \"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" wrote Ms Currie.  A White House spokeswoman said the rulings would \"not be the final word on the matter\", while attorney general Pam Bondi vowed the justice department would pursue an \"immediate appeal\". The rulings do not concern the substance of the allegations against Mr Comey and Ms James, and prosecutors may also try to refile the charges, a possibility left open by the judge's orders. How James Comey and Letitia James reacted \"I am grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the justice department has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking,\" said Mr Comey, who had pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, in a statement. Ms James, a Democrat who had pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations, said: \"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country.\" She added that she remained \"fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day\". At issue in Ms Currie's rulings is the mechanism the Trump administration employed to appoint Ms Halligan, a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience, to lead one of the justice department's most elite and important offices. Ms Halligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, a veteran prosecutor in the office and interim US attorney who resigned in September amid Trump administration pressure to file charges against both Mr Comey and Ms James. He stepped aside after Mr Trump, who has long promised retribution against his political opponents, told reporters he wanted Siebert \"out.\" The following night, Mr Trump said he would be nominating Ms Halligan to the role of interim US attorney. He publicly implored Ms Bondi to take action against Mr Comey and Ms James, saying in a Truth Social post: \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility.\" Mr Trump added: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Mr Comey was indicted three days after Ms Halligan was sworn in by Ms Bondi, and Ms James was charged two weeks after that. Read more:Trump follows through on 'drill, baby, drill' pledgeTrump would 'love to see' Taylor Greene return Attorneys general have the authority to name an interim US attorney who can serve for 120 days. However, lawyers for Mr Comey and Ms James argued that once that period expires, as it did in Mr Siebert's case, the law gives federal judges in the district the exclusive authority to appoint a prosecutor to serve until the vacancy is filled. \"The 120-day clock began running with Mr Siebert's appointment on January 21, 2025,\" Ms Currie wrote. \"When that clock expired on May 21, 2025, so too did the Attorney General's appointment authority.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n A headline tax-raising measure expected in today's budget is an extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. The amount people pay is dependent on how much they earn, with different tax bands kicking in at different income levels. Read more: Chancellor to announce tax rises in budget In the past, these thresholds have been increased in line with inflation. But more recently they have been frozen, leaving people paying more to the exchequer even if actual tax rates stay the same. The Conservative government began the thresholds freeze in 2021. At last year's budget, Rachel Reeves said the Labour government would extend the freeze though not beyond 2028, as to do so would \"hurt working people\". Sky News looks at what the thresholds are, the implications of freezing them, and how that causes \"fiscal drag\". Income tax thresholds England, Northern Ireland and Wales all have the same income tax rates, set by the British government. Scotland's income tax bands are set by the Scottish government, so Westminster budget announcements on income tax do not affect workers in Scotland. For England, Northern Ireland and Wales, there is a \"personal allowance\" of £12,570, under which no income tax is paid. For those earning above £100,000, the personal allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 of income, and can go down to zero, so a person can end up paying income tax on all of their income. What does freezing thresholds do? Thresholds were previously increased annually by consumer price index (CPI) inflation - the estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought by households. But, because income tax thresholds have been frozen while wages continue to rise, more people are being brought into higher bands and having to pay more income tax. A worker whose earnings just keep up with inflation is paying a larger proportion of their salary in tax due to the freeze. This means more money for the government - a lot more.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates a continuing freeze in thresholds would raise about £42.9bn annually by the 2027/28 tax year. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has projected that freezes to the basic and higher rates of income tax alone would raise £39bn a year by 2029-30. That is roughly similar to the amount of revenue that would be raised by increasing all income tax rates by 3.5 percentage points.  Fiscal drag Freezing income tax thresholds without tax rates increasing has been branded a \"stealth tax\", as the government collects more revenue without having to pass a law to raise tax rates. It is also known as fiscal drag, as more people are pulled into paying tax, or into paying tax at a higher rate. The OBR estimates the freeze will bring nearly four million more people into paying income tax, three million more people into the higher rate (40%) and 400,000 more into the additional rate (45%) by 2028-29."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Heathrow's £33bn proposal for a third runway has been chosen as the plan to expand the airport, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced. It means the competing idea for a shorter runway, as proposed by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has been rejected. Heathrow says the project will be 100% privately financed, through higher airline costs, and no taxpayer money will be used to build the runway or the associated infrastructure. Money blog: 'My husband died before getting his state pension' Heathrow plans to spend £33bn on the third runway and £15bn to upgrade the existing airport. But it will require re-routing the M25 motorway and the demolition of nearby villages, Longford and Harmondsworth. The decision means that a cheaper, alternative proposal by the billionaire hotel magnate Surinder Arora, for a shorter runway, was rejected. \n                  Jansen ready for take-off as next chairman of Heathrow Airport\n                 \n                  Heathrow puts Jansen on runway as next chairman\n                 \n                  Man arrested in connection with airports cyber attack\n                 He told Sky News the fact that a decision had been made was good for the UK and its economy but hinted that he still hoped to influence the outcome: \"The door is open for us, and others, to come forward with our planning,\" he added.  Harmondsworth resident and part of campaign group Stop Heathrow Expansion, Justine Bayley, said there was a \"here we go again\" feeling among locals. \"We don't actually believe [the third runway] is going to happen but we're being put through the wringer once more\". Locals wishing to move have faced difficulty finding buyers, as prospective purchasers have difficulty getting mortgages for the homes, she said. But as the runway plans are not new, Ms Bayley said, \"we're no further forward than before\". What next? The proposal is still subject to the planning process, including consultation and parliamentary scrutiny. The full length of the runway is not known, as the layout and associated infrastructure implications will continue to be considered by the Department for Transport.  The department added the selection of Heathrow's scheme does not represent a final decision on a third runway or its design. Why's it being built? The government has said the additional runway could grow the economy and create more than 100,000 jobs, based on research commissioned by Heathrow Airport. With a third runway, Heathrow could receive 150 million passengers a year, up from 83.9 million last year. The airport earlier this year announced plans to increase its capacity by 10 million passengers a year, before a third runway is built, and to raise the charge paid by passengers to fund the investment. Climate consideration Ms Alexander wrote to independent government advisers of the Climate Change Committee (CCC) on Tuesday, formally seeking its views on the expansion of Heathrow and how it would impact state carbon budgets, which designate emissions caps.   Rising emissions from flying are risking the UK's climate targets, the CCC has previously said. The body found flights contribute more greenhouse gases than the entire electricity supply sector. When could it be built? The government hopes a planning decision will be made by 2029, with the third runway being built by 2035. But Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who has consistently refused to use Heathrow on operational and cost grounds, has claimed the chance of it being built is \"slim\", but it could be 2050 even if it does get built. Airlines which do use Heathrow have long complained about punitive charges - sums that are in the power of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \"As a UK flag carrier, Virgin Atlantic has been supportive of growth at Heathrow if, and only if, there is fundamental reform to the flawed regulatory model to ensure an affordable scheme for consumers. \"Therefore, we welcome the CAA's important consultation and broader review to examine Heathrow's current regulatory model and consider alternative approaches. \"Competition is one of the best ways to ensure capital efficiency and deliver value for money from this huge project.\""

Sky News has learnt that Evoke has appointed bankers at Morgan Stanley to assess options for selling its Italian arm in a move that would raise hundreds of millions of pounds for the company. Industry sources said on Tuesday, the eve of Rachel Reeves's budget, that the plans would only be activated if the chancellor hammered the gaming sector in her statement this week. Money latest: Experts sound alarm over budget salary sacrifice rumours  An auction would be likely to generate significant interest from other industry players across Europe. Reports in recent weeks have speculated that gambling taxes will be hiked far enough to generate an additional £1bn-£3bn in revenue for the exchequer. Along with rivals such as Betfred, Paddy Power-owner Flutter Entertainment and Ladbrokes' parent, Entain, Evoke has already responded to the growing tax threat by drawing up plans to close significant numbers of UK betting shops. \n                  Budget 2025: 'Smorgasbord' of tax hikes expected today - as more policies confirmed\n                 \n                  Budget 2025: What is a freeze on income tax thresholds - and will you pay more?\n                 \n                  Millions of people earning minimum wage to get pay rise | Money blog\n                 Evoke's Italian business is one of four core markets within its international division, which is an online-only operation. The other key countries in which it trades are Spain, Denmark and Romania.  In its half-year financial results, Evoke said the international unit now accounted for just under a third of total revenue and roughly half of group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). \"888casino continues to outperform both local and omni-channel competitors, supported by new supplier integrations and the roll-out of our proprietary content,\" the company said in relation to Italy in the statement. At its quarterly market Q3 update in October, Evoke added that it had seen \"continued market share gains in casino in Italy, driven by 888, with a strong brand and continued focus on localised product features\". The company has said publicly that any tax increases in the budget would inevitably result in UK retail shop closures. \"We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market,\" Evoke said last month. \"As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. \"This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.\" A recent EY report for the Betting and Gaming Council, the industry's leading trade body, suggested that tax increases being championed by left-wing think-tanks would put at risk more than 40,000 jobs, channel £8.4bn in stakes to the black market, and wipe £3.1bn off the sector's UK economic contribution, while raising a fraction of the sums forecast. Evoke employs more than 7,600 people in the UK, with nearly 6,500 of those employed in its retail operation. It also has a workforce of nearly 800 people in Leeds, its main UK office. Last year, the company said it paid close to £330m in taxes, which equated to over 60% of its UK profits. An Evoke spokesman declined to comment on the contingency plans for its Italian arm."

        "Content": " A defiant Rachel Reeves has urged Labour MPs to unite behind this week's budget - but appeared to admit they might not like all of her policies. Addressing the Parliamentary Labour Party last night, the chancellor described politics as a \"team sport\" and insisted that tomorrow's announcements will be \"fair\". Backbenchers are said to have become increasingly frustrated at the prospect of further tax hikes, which come against a backdrop of falling opinion poll ratings. Ed Conway: Three things the budget boils down to Ms Reeves argued the budget should be regarded as a package - and not a \"pick 'n' mix\" where MPs \"like the cola bottles but not the fruit salad\". She added that her three top priorities were to cut the cost of living, reduce NHS waiting lists and slash the cost of servicing debt - with £1 in every £10 now spent on interest. Newspaper reports suggest there were cheers in the room when Ms Reeves vowed to stay in Number 11 and withstand criticism about her handling of the economy. She was quoted as saying: \"I'll show the media, I'll show the Tories, I will not let them beat me, I'll be there on Wednesday, I'll be there next year, and I'll be back the year after that.\" The chancellor suggested Labour MPs will be happy with 95% of the budget's contents, but hinted there are difficult political decisions yet to be announced.  Setback for Reeves as growth forecasts cut Yesterday, Sky News revealed that the Office for Budget Responsibility's growth forecasts are going to be downgraded every year until the current parliament ends in 2029. Our deputy political editor Sam Coates reports that the government will argue there are \"a number of reasons\" for the revision. But he added: \"However you cut it, whatever the reasoning, once again, last year, growth will be lower after this budget than before, which is not a great position for a government that had claimed growth as their top priority.\" In some better news for the government, Ms Reeves is expected to announce that she has more headroom than first thought - meaning ministers will be able to claim that the country is no longer in an \"economic doom loop\". \"That might well be one of the positive surprises when we actually get to Wednesday's budget,\" Coates added on the Politics At Sam and Anne's podcast.  'I think she's doing a terrible job' Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of stymying growth and pursuing \"job-killing measures\". She told Sky News that she thinks Ms Reeves is \"doing a terrible job\" as chancellor - and warned Labour should pay close attention to public perception of the budget. \"A lot of people out there in the country, men and women, thinks that she needs to cut tax, and if she raises it, then she should go,\" Ms Badenoch added. At the CBI conference in London yesterday, the Opposition leader urged the government to scrap the Employment Rights Bill - describing it as an \"assault on flexible working\" that would empower trade unions and drag the UK back to the 1970s.  Ms Badenoch said: \"Killing it would be a signal to the world that Britain still understands what makes an economy grow. \"If the chancellor had any sense, and any regard for business, she would use the budget to say 'we got this one wrong' and drop it.\" This Employment Rights Bill includes measures that would ban zero hours contracts, but Ms Badenoch has argued that this would amount to a \"de facto ban\" on seasonal and flexible work. The CBI conference marks a difficult anniversary for the government - with attention turning to the speech Ms Reeves gave there a year ago. Having already delivered her first budget, she had told businesses that she was \"not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\" - a statement that flies in the face of what the chancellor is expected to unveil tomorrow. Read more from Sky News:What tax rises and spending cuts will be announced?Analysis: Chancellor's authority is on shaky ground  Greens call for wealth tax In other developments, the Green Party has called on the government to introduce a 1% tax on wealth over £10m - rising to 2% over £1bn. Its estimates suggest this measure could help potentially raise £15bn a year in revenues. Zack Polanski also wants the rates of capital gains tax, which is currently one of the lowest among G7 nations, to be raised in line with income tax. He will outline his demands on Mornings With Ridge And Frost ahead of a protest in Westminster.  Announcements have been gradually trickling through ahead of the budget tomorrow, with the chancellor widely expected to freeze income tax thresholds once again. Ms Reeves is also set to lift the two-child cap on benefits, with figures suggesting this policy will cost about £3bn a year. Over the weekend, it was confirmed that rail fares in England will be frozen for the first time since the 1990s - meaning some commuters will save hundreds of pounds on season tickets. An above-inflation rise to the state pension is planned too, meaning 13 million people will receive an extra £550 a year from April."

It tracked 175 items from eight major retailers in the year to May and found 83% were cheaper or equal in price at least once outside the four-week Black Friday period (15 November to 12 December). We've outlined the findings below - and some pretty robust responses from the retailers involved. Follow the latest consumer news here John Lewis was one of the worst culprits, with Which? finding 94% of products were cheaper or the same price at another time of year. One example of an apparently dud deal found at John Lewis was a Samsung Jet Bot Robot Vacuum Cleaner, which was £350 on Black Friday, but had been £299 for 29 days in May and June 2024.

Despite promising that sale items would not have been cheaper in the six months before Black Friday, 84% of deals at Currys were available for the same or a lower price in the six months before and after the sales period. Which? also found that Amazon's Black Friday deals were cheaper or the same price in 88% of cases, and cheaper in 63% of cases outside the sales period. In contrast, Richer Sounds had by far the best performance in the analysis, with only 55% of analysed products found to be cheaper or the same price at other times of the year. The investigation also uncovered evidence of retailers seeming to use recommended retail prices to make a deal appear more generous. At Boots, Which? found an Oral B Vitality Pro Electric Toothbrush advertised as \"save £25, RRP £50\", but the product was cheaper or the same price for more than 96% of the year. The £50 RRP was only in place for 13 days in the six months before the sale. Reena Sewraz, Which? retail editor, said: \"Our research exposes the harsh truth: for the majority of shoppers, Black Friday is a false economy. Retailers are relying on hype and urgency to push products that are the same price, or even cheaper, at other times of the year. \"There are good deals to be found but they can be few and far between. Our experts sift through thousands of deals every day during the sales to hand-pick genuine deals on products we think are worth buying. Our advice is simple: take your time, don't be fooled by clever marketing and do your research.\" What did retailers have to say?  Amazon said it offered customers \"great value all year round\". \"While Which? analysed just 24 products, Amazon's Black Friday event offered hundreds of thousands of deals to customers in the UK. Additionally, a report in 2024 by Independent analysts Profitero, reviewed over 9,000 products and found that Amazon's year-round prices are on average 15% lower than other online retailers in the UK. Customers can shop with confidence at Amazon, where they'll find everyday low prices across a wide selection of products, all with the fast and convenient delivery they expect.\" AO said: \"Customers know that Black Friday is now at least a month-long promotion and isn't a single day. It's still a brilliant time to buy and gives customers the opportunity to snap up a deal ahead of Christmas. That shouldn't mean we can't offer strong value year-round too - as these findings show, there's great deals to be had at other times too. We welcome scrutiny that helps customers make informed choices, and our focus remains the same, delivering great value every day of the year, not just on Black Friday.\" Read more from Money:Dyson in the dock over busted £350 fan - will its fob-off hold?'British Airways lost our luggage on dream US road trip'Delivery not arrived? Here's what you can do about it Currys said it was \"raising the bar\" with its 2025 Black Friday sale, with every deal promising to be the lowest price ever offered. \"We acknowledge the observation made by Which? that the price of some Black Friday products can drop even lower at some point in the months that follow. This is normal and happens across retailers, as they compete, as new models are launched, and as clearance cycles run. We are satisfied that we have the right balance, offering a Black Friday deal set that is special without limiting our ability to give customers excellent offers all year round,\" chief commercial officer Ed Connolly said. John Lewis said customers could find brilliant deals all year round, and its Never Knowingly Undersold brand promise matched prices with 25 leading retailers: \"Our Black Friday offer represents a great saving, and previous offers reflect us price-matching a competitor's short-term promotion, to make sure we remain unbeaten on price.\" The Very Group said it was committed to delivering great value across its stores all year round. Richer Sounds said it had a disclaimer on its website from early November until the close of our Black Friday promotion to say that anything marked as \"Fantastic Black Friday Value\" may have been at a lower price previously, but it was happy it still represented fantastic value. \"Where we marked up items as 'our lowest price ever' they meant just that - we'd never sold an item for less. The market may move after Black Friday and if this is the case, we will always look to pass any extra savings on to our customers,\" it added. Boots said it offered discounts on more than 20,000 products across the Black Friday period last year. \"Being part of that promotional programme does not preclude those lines from being on offer at other times throughout the year, as we strive to deliver great value for money for our customers every day,\" it added."

        "Headline": "Chancellors can raise lots more income tax without actually increasing headline rates. The Conservatives began the practice in 2021, Labour have continued it, and are expected to extend it further today. This is how it works.",
        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n A headline tax-raising measure expected in today's budget is an extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. The amount people pay is dependent on how much they earn, with different tax bands kicking in at different income levels. Read more: Chancellor to announce tax rises in budget In the past, these thresholds have been increased in line with inflation. But more recently they have been frozen, leaving people paying more to the exchequer even if actual tax rates stay the same. The Conservative government began the thresholds freeze in 2021. At last year's budget, Rachel Reeves said the Labour government would extend the freeze though not beyond 2028, as to do so would \"hurt working people\". Sky News looks at what the thresholds are, the implications of freezing them, and how that causes \"fiscal drag\". Income tax thresholds England, Northern Ireland and Wales all have the same income tax rates, set by the British government. Scotland's income tax bands are set by the Scottish government, so Westminster budget announcements on income tax do not affect workers in Scotland. For England, Northern Ireland and Wales, there is a \"personal allowance\" of £12,570, under which no income tax is paid. For those earning above £100,000, the personal allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 of income, and can go down to zero, so a person can end up paying income tax on all of their income. What does freezing thresholds do? Thresholds were previously increased annually by consumer price index (CPI) inflation - the estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought by households. But, because income tax thresholds have been frozen while wages continue to rise, more people are being brought into higher bands and having to pay more income tax. A worker whose earnings just keep up with inflation is paying a larger proportion of their salary in tax due to the freeze. This means more money for the government - a lot more.  The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates a continuing freeze in thresholds would raise about £42.9bn annually by the 2027/28 tax year. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has projected that freezes to the basic and higher rates of income tax alone would raise £39bn a year by 2029-30. That is roughly similar to the amount of revenue that would be raised by increasing all income tax rates by 3.5 percentage points.  Fiscal drag Freezing income tax thresholds without tax rates increasing has been branded a \"stealth tax\", as the government collects more revenue without having to pass a law to raise tax rates. It is also known as fiscal drag, as more people are pulled into paying tax, or into paying tax at a higher rate. The OBR estimates the freeze will bring nearly four million more people into paying income tax, three million more people into the higher rate (40%) and 400,000 more into the additional rate (45%) by 2028-29."

        "Content": "By Mollie Malone, home news correspondent and Mhari Aurora, political correspondent   Ministers have been briefed on major curbs to the jury service which could see juries only used to decide on cases of murder, rape or manslaughter, Sky News understands. The move would see the majority of cases heard by a judge alone, except for the most serious or those in the \"public interest\". The change is expected to be formally announced by the government next week. Sky News previously reported the Ministry of Justice was set to remove the right to trial by jury for thousands of cases, in a controversial measure which would mark a move away from a core pillar of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. A memo sent by David Lammy to fellow ministers, seen by the Times, says there is \"no right\" to jury trials in the UK and that drastic action was needed to cut the backlog of cases in the crown courts, nearing 80,000. A spokesman for the government confirmed changes are coming soon to deal with the backlog.  Speaking to Sky News' Politics Hub programme, work and pensions secretary Pat McFadden did not deny the changes were on the way. \n                  Tasers to be used in prisons to tackle 'unacceptably high' levels of violence \n                 \n                  Foreign prisoners to be deported earlier under new plans \n                 \n                  Sentencing guidelines for ethnic minority suspects delayed after backlash\n                 He said he \"wouldn't be surprised if my colleagues at the [Ministry of Justice] are looking at perhaps some radical ways they could reduce that backlog\". McFadden said that backlogs in the courts system are getting too long and not showing any sign of shortening. He referenced the saying that \"justice delayed is justice denied\" - implying that a non-jury trial is better than no trial at all. In the summer, retired Court of Appeal judge, Sir Brian Leveson, made recommendations to government, including a suggestion to end jury trials for many serious offences, saying they could be dealt with by a judge alone or a judge with two magistrates. This would have been done by creating a new intermediate court, called the Crown Court Bench Division, sitting between magistrates courts and crown courts. The plans in the leaked document go further than that, with suggestions that offences likely to receive a sentence of up to five years would be heard by judges alone. When Mr Lammy took up his position in September, it is understood he saw the courts as his 'crisis' to tackle, with his predecessor, Shabana Mahmood, having been seen to have gripped the immediacy of the prison overcrowding crisis. Sir Brian suggested a judge and two magistrates should hear cases with a maximum sentence of three years. These measures will be highly controversial, with the leader of the Conservatives Kemi Badenoch saying the move \"risks fairness, undermines public trust and erodes the very foundation of our justice system\". The Criminal Bar Association said the plans would \"eviscerate the jury trial as we know it\".

Bangladesh's anti-corruption commission (ACC) has claimed the Labour MP received a 7,200sq ft plot in the diplomatic zone through \"abuse of power and influence\".

Earlier this month, Hasina was sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court after she was found guilty of crimes against humanity. In the letter, which was hand-delivered to the Bangladeshi High Commission on Monday evening, the lawyers wrote that Ms Siddiq \"does not have a proper opportunity of defending herself\". \"She is being tried in her absence without justification and… the proceedings fall far short of standards of fairness recognised internationally,\" they said.

The levy will apply to packaged drinks, not those made in cafes and restaurants. Mr Streeting confirmed the measure in the Commons on Tuesday, telling MPs: \"Obesity robs children of the best possible start in life, hits the poorest hardest, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems and costs the NHS billions. \"So, I can announce to the house we're expanding the soft drinks industry levy to include bottles and cartons of milkshakes, flavoured milk and milk substitute drinks.\" Milk-based drinks are currently exempt from the soft drinks levy, also known as a sugar tax. This came into force in 2018 and applies to drinks with at least 5g of sugar per 100ml. Mr Streeting said that as well as extending the levy to milk-based products, the government will lower the threshold at which it can apply - to 4.5g of sugar per 100ml. \n                  One in four GPs using AI at work despite vast majority having no training, survey finds\n                 \n                  Scotland to roll out 'simple' genetic test to help prevent deafness in babies\n                 \n                  'Dead' Thai woman sent to crematorium wakes up in coffin\n                 He said: \"This government will not look away as children get unhealthier and our political opponents urge us to leave them behind.\" There has been a 46% reduction in sugar in fizzy drinks since the original tax came into force, with 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK now not paying the charge due to reformulation. Modelling studies have found that this may have prevented thousands of cases of childhood obesity and reduced tooth decay. Read more:Baby food firms given 18 months to cut sugarUltra-processed foods cause 'chronic disease pandemic'Consumption of sugar from soft drinks falls However, the Labour government said UK sugar intakes remain about double the recommended level and launched a consultation in April to extend the tax. The measure will be formally included in Rachel Reeves's budget on Wednesday, when the chancellor is expected to announce a series of smaller tax rises to fill a £30bn blackhole, after scrapping a plan to raise income tax.  Companies have until 1 January 2028 to remove sugar or face the new charge, which the government argues will add £1bn in health and economic benefits. The tax will apply to milk-based and milk-alternative drinks with added sugar, such as flavoured milk and yoghurt drinks. Plain, unsweetened milk and milk-alternative drinks are not included. Drinks containing between 4.5g and 7.9g of sugar per 100ml will fall into the lower levy band, which is a charge of £1.94 per 10 litres. Drinks above 8g per 100ml will remain in the higher levy band, facing a rate of £2.59 per 10 litres. Some drinks that would come under the new proposal include: Starbucks Caramel Macchiato Iced Coffee (8.2g sugar/100ml), Shaken Udder Vanillalicious milkshake (8.4g sugar/100ml), Yazoo Strawberry Milk Drink (9.6g sugar/100ml), and Alpro Soya Chocolate long life drink (7.6g sugar/100ml). Despite introducing the initial soft drinks levy, the Conservatives previously described the extension as a \"sucker punch\" to families during a cost of living crisis. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said they should focus on educating people who can then make healthy decisions."

The 39-year-old, from the Guildford area, was arrested on Tuesday following co-operation between the Environment Agency (EA) and the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit. Last week, the EA declared the 40ft-high mountain of waste near Kidlington a \"critical incident\". Anna Burns, the Environment Agency's area director for the Thames, said that the \"appalling illegal waste dump... has rightly provoked outrage over the potential consequences for the community and environment\". \"We have been working round the clock with the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit to bring the perpetrators to justice and make them pay for this offence,\" she added. \"Our investigative efforts have secured an arrest today, which will be the first step in delivering justice for residents and punishing those responsible.\" Phil Davies, head of the Joint Unit for Waste Crime, added that the EA \"is working closely with other law enforcement partners to identify and hold those responsible for the horrendous illegal dumping of waste\". \n                  Oxfordshire waste mountain by River Cherwell declared critical incident\n                 \n                  Waste mountain branded 'utterly appalling' by PM grew 40ft-high within months\n                 \n                  Kidlington fly-tipping: Drone footage shows scale of 'revolting' 60m-long mountain of waste next to river\n                 He then said: \"A number of active lines of investigation are being pursued by specialist officers.\" Sky News drone footage captured the sheer scale of the rubbish pile, which is thought to weigh hundreds of tonnes and comprise multiple lorry loads of waste.

The largest year-on-year survey of UK GPs on generative AI has revealed an increase in the number of doctors using tools like ChatGPT in their everyday clinical work. Some 95% of the doctors who said they use generative AI in their work reported no professional training and 85% of them said their employer has not encouraged its use. Last year, researchers from the same study found one in five GPs was using the technology. \"In just 12 months, generative AI has gone from taboo to tool in British medicine,\" said Dr Charlotte Blease, from Uppsala University in Sweden and Harvard Medical School. \"Doctors are using these systems because they help - not because anyone told them to. The real risk isn't that GPs are using AI; it's that they're doing it without training or oversight.\"  Some 35% of the doctors used AI for writing documentation, 27% for differential diagnoses and 24% for treatment or referrals. \n                  TikTok boss insists teens' safety not at risk from AI moderation \n                 \n                  Nvidia beats expectations again in defiance of AI bubble fears\n                 \n                  Half of novelists fear AI will replace them entirely, survey finds\n                 Read more from science and tech:Female stars 'may leave sport because of online abuse'TikTok says teens' safety not at risk from AI moderationTeenagers plead not guilty to London transport cyber attack \"This should be a wake-up call,\" said Dr Blease. \"AI is already being used in everyday medicine. The challenge now is to ensure it's deployed safely, ethically, and openly.\" The study's authors, from Uppsala University, Basel University, the Karolinska Institute, the University of Manchester and Harvard Medical School, surveyed 1,005 GPs around the UK.  The findings were published on Tuesday in the Digital Health science journal. Researchers highlighted the risks of using AI in clinical settings like the technology's tendency to get things wrong, or \"hallucinate\", and the potential for \"algorithmic discrimination\" because of potential biases in the models' training data. The authors also raised concerns about the data privacy of patients. An NHS England spokesperson said AI is \"helping NHS staff spend more time caring for patients - assisting in speeding up diagnosis, reading test results and reducing bureaucracy. \"It's important strong safeguards, clear patient information and proper training for clinicians are in place so that the technology is trusted and delivers real benefits for staff and patients.\" A Scottish government spokesperson said it recognises the role AI can play \"in the delivery and planning of health and social care services. \"However, it is important we work closely with our NHS workforce to do this to ensure the safe, effective and ethical use of AI for public good.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  \"Drill, baby, drill\" was Donald Trump's campaign pledge - and he's following through with a proposal to expand fossil fuel production, which environmentalists say would have devastating consequences. The Trump administration has tabled a plan to open federal waters off the coasts of California, Florida, and Alaska to oil and gas drilling for the first time in decades - including areas that have never been touched. A total of one billion acres of water would be offered for lease under the proposal. That's equivalent to more than half the total land mass of the US. While the rest of the Western world is striving to move away from fossil fuels, the US appears to be gravitating back towards them, with the administration describing climate change as a \"hoax,\" \"a scam,\" and a \"con job\". In Huntington Beach - a coastal community in California that calls itself \"Surf City USA\" - a huge oil spill in 2021 shut down a miles-long stretch of the coastline, killing wildlife and soiling the sand. From the beach, where surfers lay out alongside tourists and dog walkers, you can see Platform Esther, a hulking oil rig built in 1965 that ceased production in August this year. Sea lions hug the metal pillars on the rig and dozens of birds perch on the platform. 'What we have here is irreplaceable' Pete Stauffer, ocean protection manager at the Surfrider Foundation, said: \"Here in California, we depend on a clean and healthy coastal environment - whether it's coastal tourism, whether it's fisheries, or local businesses and jobs. \"All these things are tied to what we have here, which is really an outstanding marine ecosystem. \"No disrespect to Mickey Mouse, but you can build another theme park. What we have here is irreplaceable. Why would you put that at risk?\" As a state, California views itself as a leader on climate action. A massive spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969 sparked the modern environmental movement. 'We need as much oil as possible' But the Trump administration says more oil drilling will help make the country energy independent, bringing new jobs and reducing petrol prices. That messaging has resonated with some here. Johnny Long is a surfer who lives in Huntington Beach. \"Drill, baby, drill,\" he says, when I ask about Trump's plans for more offshore drilling. \"We need as much oil as possible. It's right below us. We need to take it and extract it and bring the gas prices down, it's absolutely fantastic.\" I ask about concerns that it will be detrimental to the local environment and beyond. \"I'd say phoeey on that,\" Johnny responds. \"It's ridiculous. Climate change is a hoax.\" Read more climate news:What did COP30 achieve?How final deal was reached But others vehemently disagree - including Linda from nearby Seal Beach: \"It's so bad for the environment. It's already bad enough, you know, and they're gonna drill, and what happens when they drill? They always have accidents because people are human and accidents happen. \"Trump and his goonies don't care about the environment, all they care about is money.\" The president's push to expand fossil fuel production coincided with the UN climate conference. For the first time in the summit's history, the US didn't send a delegation. Critics say the snub shows a disregard for how future generations will be affected by the decisions the White House is making right now."

        "Content": "A \"simple\" genetic test for newborns that will help to prevent deafness caused by a common antibiotic is to be rolled out across Scotland. Doctors often prescribe Gentamicin to babies showing signs of serious infection including sepsis, and in most cases this is found to be safe and effective. But, for a small number of infants who carry a specific genetic variant, the antibiotic can cause permanent hearing loss. The new procedure set to be rolled out uses a rapid cheek swab which can establish whether a child carries the variant in just 26 minutes, enabling their clinician to prescribe an equally effective alternative drug. Health Secretary Neil Gray said: \"This test will have a life-changing impact on newborn babies in Scotland as we roll it out across the country through our accelerated national innovation adoption pathway, resulting in improved health outcomes and a better quality of life. \"This exceptional programme demonstrates the transformative potential of scientific and technological innovation, and our commitment to delivering the ambitions set out in our Programme for Government and the NHS Scotland operational improvement plan.\" It is hoped the test will help to reduce potential hospital stays, ease pressure on NHS services, and avoid the long-term costs associated with hearing loss. \n                  Sir Alex Ferguson backs 'life-changing' scholarships for disadvantaged Glasgow Caledonian University students\n                 \n                  Comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli appears in court charged with rape\n                 \n                  Three charged over 'missing ashes and fraud' at ex-funeral directors\n                 The test was piloted and implemented in Manchester and has now been successfully introduced by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC).

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n  The boss of the communications regulator fears sport will lose out on female stars because of online abuse - and is urging social media companies to adopt recommendations to clean up their platforms. Ofcom has asked the likes of Elon Musk's X and Meta-owned Instagram to offer greater protections particularly to stop misogynistic abuse and coordinated pile-ons. \"It's really important here that the tech companies step up,\" Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told Sky News. It follows a year when female athletes have spoken out against the hatred messaged to them on social platforms. After winning the Euros, England star Jess Carter revealed she has questioned whether she would have \"the courage to go back on the pitch and play again\" due to the abuse received during the tournament.  Now, Ofcom is recommending a series of measures to tech giants, including: • Prompts telling users to reconsider harmful messages • Stopping payments for posts promoting misogynistic abuse and sexual violence • Ensuring \"for you\" recommended posts have more perspectives to stop being \"toxic echo chambers\" • Allowing multiple accounts to be blocked or muted at the same time \"We're going to lose talent in sport,\" Dame Melanie warned. \"Lots of places where women in particular feel that if they go out there in a public role, they just get abused. \"And sometimes the toll on them and their families is not something that they can manage and they withdraw. \"So this is about actually helping people to do their jobs, to do incredible things for their country.\" These measures are not just designed to help sports stars, but they can be the most high-profile women targeted, with events watched by millions on TV. \"It's not about curtailing anyone's freedom of expression,\" Dame Melanie said. \"It's about nudges and prompts, it is about better reporting, it is about clearer privacy settings. \"All of these ideas have come from experts or victims or survivors themselves, and we will at Ofcom be absolutely clear in our transparency reports which companies are taking it seriously and which are not, so that the public is aware of all of that.\" But what is the boundary between critiquing a performance and a pile-on that is delegitimising someone playing sport? \"It's when it gets really intense,\" Dame Melanie said. \"It's something about volume. It is when everybody joins in. And it's also when it becomes abusive, misogynistic, racist. That's when it crossed the line.\" There is an urgency. Sky News recently revealed suspected online hate crimes referred to police have already quadrupled this season in English football.  Immediate action is demanded, but it won't be for another two years that Ofcom considers asking the government to strengthen online safety laws if moves to reduce the toxicity and trolling fall short. Ofcom says its online safety guidance was developed after speaking to victims, survivors, safety experts and women's advocacy groups. But for Lianne Sanderson, an England star turned broadcaster and pundit, the recommendations are still lacking. \"There needs to be online identification to have an account because someone like myself has had death threats,\" she told Sky News. \"I'm a woman, a woman of colour. You know I'm gay. There's loads of things that people can't handle. And that's where it comes to me. It's not even about my job.\" Read more from Sky News:Everton player sent off after clashing with his own teammateTikTok boss insists teens' safety not at risk from AI moderationParalympics in dispute with UK over Russia's return to event There are the pictures celebrating her marriage to wife Ellis this year attracting hate. \"Someone like myself gets abused every single day,\" Sanderson said. \"I posted my wedding pictures yesterday, and the amount of horrific abuse I received on those are just awful.\" It presents so many with public profiles with a quandary about whether to stay on social media when an online presence can help profile and earnings. \"They need to do more to protect people like myself because I've had enough, quite frankly, and it's too much,\" Sanderson said. \"I think to myself, do I come off social media? Is that them winning? But then who's really winning? Because when I'm on my journey into London today, it's on my mind.\""
