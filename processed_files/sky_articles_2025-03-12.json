After breakthrough talks between Ukrainian and US officials in Saudi Arabia, Kyiv said it was ready to accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire with Russia.

For his part, President Putin has been playing to his domestic audience with a visit to Kursk, where Russian troops finally seem to be gaining the upper hand against Ukrainian forces who seized territory in the Russian region last year. Dressed in camouflage, the Russian president called for his forces to defeat the enemy and completely liberate Kursk, in remarks reported by the Interfax news agency. He also said enemy troops captured in the region will be treated as terrorists, as Russia's chief of the general staff told Mr Putin that Ukrainian forces in the region are surrounded."

        "Headline": "Donald Trump told the Irish premier Micheal Martin the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\" - and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage as well. ",
        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the EU during a meeting with Irish premier Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. The US president said he did not want \"to do anything to hurt Ireland\" but added that the trade relationship between the countries should be focused on \"fairness\". It comes after the president imposed 25% tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports to the US - prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow and the EU to impose counter tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods from 1 April. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"disappointed\" to see the president impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium and promised to \"keep all options on the table\" in how the UK would respond. During Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Martin, the president raised the \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage of the US. He said the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\". Asked by Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy if Ireland was also taking advantage, Mr Trump replied: \"Of course they are.\" He added: \"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue. \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep options on the table'  Mr Trump said he loves Ireland, where he has a golf course - but said he wishes the US had \"not been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody\". Many US pharmaceutical companies have set up their manufacturing facilities in Ireland due to its low 12.5% corporate tax rate. Irish firms then pay a royalty fee to US parent companies so they can use formulas to make products - meaning Ireland could be the hardest hit EU member by Mr Trump's 25% tariffs. 'I would have imposed 200% tariffs' Mr Trump said if he had been president when those companies started to move to Ireland, he would have imposed a 200% tariff on them so they could not sell anything into the US and they would have \"stayed here\". The president said he would like to see American pharmaceutical companies returning to the US, but expected Mr Martin to \"fight on that issue\". He also told Sky News he would \"absolutely\" place tariffs on cars from the EU. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump  Mr Trump accused previous presidents of having \"lost big segments\" of the US economy and said the EU \"treats us very badly\", referencing a recent ruling against Apple. \"They have not been fair. They sue our companies and win massive amounts of money. They sued Apple, won 17 billion US dollars and they use that for other reasons, I guess, to run the European Union,\" he said. \"So I'm not knocking it. They're doing what they should be doing, perhaps for the European Union, but it does create ill will - and as you know, we're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs so whatever they charge us with, we're charging them. Nobody can complain about that.\" Ireland correspondent Well, that went well. An Oval Office meeting that in any other St Patrick's week would have been regarded as almost unimaginably confrontational – this time around the Irish delegation will be floating on air. Micheal Martin was in the lion's den today, the first leader to step into the Oval Office since Volodymyr Zelenskyy's verbal bloodbath, and you could forgive the Irish PM for being apprehensive. This was always going to be the most important visit of a taoiseach to the White House in generations. What is usually a jovial green-tinged occasion was this year imbued with a new sense of gravity and nervousness.  \n The Irish government knew it was in the president's crosshairs – any small country that boasts a huge trade surplus with the US was bound to be a target for this administration. American figures put that surplus in goods at around €80bn (£67bn) last year, although Irish statisticians insist it was a mere €50bn (£41.9bn) - still a record. In the Oval, I managed to ask the president if Ireland was taking advantage of America. \"Of course they are,\" he replied. But Mr Trump is at heart a businessman, and it sounded more like a sneaking admiration.  \"I have great respect for Ireland, and what they did,\" he said. Ireland did exactly what they should have done, he continued, referencing the luring of lucrative US multinationals. But he placed the blame firmly on \"stupid\" American leaders who \"allowed\" it to happen. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing.  The EU was set up to exploit America, Mr Trump said. It was \"abuse\". Again and again, it was the Brussels bogeyman, not the Emerald Isle, that bore the brunt of his attack.\n I asked if he would respond with more tariffs to the new EU tariffs. \"Of course,\" Mr Trump responded. After an anecdote about the lack of Chevrolets in Munich, I asked would he now consider tariffs on the crucial European car industry – he replied in the affirmative. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing. When the taoiseach did speak, it was to hit the Irish talking points – the Ireland-US relationship was a \"two-way street\", with the Irish currently the sixth-largest investor in the US.\n \"Just look how many Boeings Ryanair is purchasing\" was the theme of Mr Martin's argument. The leaders joked about Mr Martin's boxer father. Mr Trump spoke admiringly of Conor McGregor and Rory McIlroy. The minutes ticked away... Ireland unscathed. They finished with a discussion about the president's Irish resort at Doonbeg in County Clare. Mr Trump lauded the Irish efficiency at approving an expansion plan, and decried the subsequent EU approval period of several years. Once again – Ireland good, Brussels bad.\n There was so much nervousness in Irish government circles. Now they must be wondering what the fuss was all about. 'Great honour' to meet Irish Taoiseach Despite his criticism of Ireland, Mr Trump said it was a \"great honour\" to have the taoiseach at the White House. He said the US has \"tremendous\" business relationships in Ireland \"and that will only get stronger\". The US leader said his personal relationship with Mr Martin was \"very, very strong and very, very good\" as he thanked him for coming to Washington DC to celebrate St Patrick's Day. He added that Mr Martin did not \"look nervous\" about the subject of tariffs during their meeting. Taoiseach reminds Trump of Irish investment in US The taoiseach praised Mr Trump's work on \"peace initiatives\" and said the two countries have a \"very good relationship, a historic one\". But, hinting at the tariffs imposed by Mr Trump, Mr Martin said: \"It's a two-way street. We are investing a lot more in America.\" He said he understands where Mr Trump is coming from, but added that Irish companies Ryanair and aircraft leasing firm Aercap \"buy more Boeing\" planes than anybody else outside the US."

        "Content": " Newly obtained video footage reveals the moment container ship Solong crashed into US oil tanker Stena Immaculate off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday morning. The tanker was carrying Jet-A1 fuel for the US Navy as part of a US government programme designed to supply American armed forces with fuel when required, a military spokesman told Reuters. On Monday, maritime security sources said there was no indication of any malicious activity or other actors involved in the incident. UK authorities have also said they have so far found no evidence of foul play. The Solong's captain was arrested and the vessel's owner has said he is a Russian national. Humberside Police arrested the 59-year-old on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter on Tuesday. The rest of the crew were Russian and Filipino nationals, according to German shipping company Ernst Russ. Humberside Police said investigators had started a criminal probe into the cause of the collision and were working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Humberside detectives are working with the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, and it has been reported that authorities from the US and Portugal will lead the investigation into what happened. The Stena Immaculate was stationary and at anchor on the River Humber when it was struck by the smaller Solong, causing huge fires and explosions. It was initially feared that the Solong was carrying sodium cyanide. However, the vessel's owner Ernst Russ said four containers on the vessel had previously held the hazardous chemical, but there was none on board at the time of the crash.  One missing, presumed dead One person, a crew member on the Solong, remains missing and is presumed dead. The coastguard rescued 36 people after the alarm was raised at 9.48am on Monday. The owner of Stena Immaculate, Stena Bulk, said on Wednesday its 23 crew members were American and in \"good health\". The coastguard said the Solong had been \"towed to a safe location\" while the Stena Immaculate was \"remaining at anchor in its original location\". Salvage workers \"will conduct on-board assessments of the vessels as soon as they are safe to board,\" chief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said. Solong failed safety checks It has emerged that the Solong failed steering-related safety checks last year. Inspection documents from July show officials warned the ship's \"emergency steering position communications/compass reading\" was \"not readable\". It was among 10 issues highlighted during an inspection by Irish officials. Other problems included the alarms being \"inadequate\", survival craft not being properly maintained and fire doors being \"not as required\".  Another inspection in Scotland in October 2024 found two issues with the Solong, including that lifebuoys were \"not properly marked\". Ernst Russ said: \"All deficiencies that were detected during routine port state control inspections of the Solong back in 2024 were promptly rectified\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Environmental impact not as severe as feared The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks - at least one of which was \"ruptured\" during the collision, shipping company Crowley said. But it said the jet fuel spill was having a \"limited\" impact.  The potential environmental impact seems to be less severe than initially feared. Most of the spilt jet fuel has evaporated or burned off, Crowley said in a post on X. There also seems to have been no loss of engine fuel from either vessel and both are expected to remain afloat despite a gaping hole in the side of the Stena Immaculate and earlier fears the Solong would sink. There are no visible flames on either ship and the Solong, which was drifting, has now been secured by tugs."

        "Content": " A teenager with severe cerebral palsy who wrote a book using his eyes has urged teachers not to underestimate their pupils. When Jonathan Bryan started school he was given the label PMLD, which stands for profound and multiple learning disabilities. It meant he was placed on a sensory curriculum - essentially early years education - but his mother took him out of school and taught him to read and write using an alphabet board. Mr Bryan told The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee he has become a \"voice of the voiceless\" over 10 years of campaigning to prevent people with complex needs and who are non-verbal from being overlooked. The 19-year-old is now a published author and is studying creative writing at the University of Bath. Asked if the school system was underestimating children with PMLD, he said the mistake was in thinking \"it's something that's diagnosed\" when it is \"just an educational label given to children who look like me - usually in a wheelchair, with little or no means of communication\". \"Our cognition isn't tested before we get the label, but we are treated like we all have a profound intellectual disability,\" he said. \"We're not taught to read or write because it's assumed we'll never learn. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We don't learn because we aren't taught.\" He said \"people look at us and make assumptions about our capacity to learn\". \"When you don't speak out loud, people assume your intellect is the same as a pre-verbal toddler. Because we don't speak, it's easier to ignore us. It's why I speak up about this as a voice for the voiceless.\" After a decade of campaigning, Mr Bryan said there is \"still a long way to go\". \"Until the government expects this cohort to be taught literacy, it's down to individuals and schools to raise their expectations,\" he said.

        "Content": "\n          OSINT editor\n              @adamparkr\n Analysis by Sky News reveals that human error is the most likely cause of the collision between the container ship Solong and US oil tanker Stena Immaculate. The Portuguese-flagged Solong had sailed the same route 19 times in the past five months before the collision, which occurred off the east coast of Yorkshire at 9.47am on Monday 10 March. Authorities from the US and Portugal will reportedly lead the investigation, while Humberside Police is also working with the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch to establish what happened. Ship safety expert Mel Irving told Sky News: \"At the moment, it looks like 100% human error. We can only assume nobody was watching. Nobody was at the controls. Nobody was aware that there was a ship right ahead.\" The arrested captain of the Solong is a Russian national, while the rest of the crew were Russian and Filipino nationals, according to German shipping company Ernst Russ. What tracking data tells us The Solong has taken an almost identical path along the Yorkshire coast 19 times over the past five months. On those occasions, it travelled to or from Grangemouth in Scotland to either Hull or Rotterdam in the Netherlands. So what went wrong this time? Sky News' Data & Forensics unit has analysed the ship's tracking data. Speed variations of the vessel along the same route over the past year are in the same range as Monday's collision. The vessel was travelling at around 16 knots when it hit the oil tanker, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic. Over the past five months, it travelled at speeds between 11 and 17 knots at around the same point. Despite passing along the coast of Yorkshire multiple times recently, the Solong did not travel along the route in 2023 or 2022. Over the past five months, the cargo ship mostly travelled in the area along a relatively straight line, suggesting its autopilot was in use. Mr Irving said: \"Even if a crew has sailed a route repeatedly, every journey is different – traffic, weather, visibility, and anchorage positions change. That's why proper watchkeeping is essential\". Visibility in the area at the time of the crash had been poor with areas of fog, according to the Met Office. The still image below is taken from a nearby ship at the time of the collision. How many ships are usually in the area? On the day of the collision, the Stena Immaculate had been anchored off the Yorkshire coast alongside eight other large tankers and container ships. It did not move for 15 hours, having anchored at 6.30pm the night before. A week before the crash, on 3 March, the Solong took an almost identical path as on the day of the crash. Its path was 500m different and it travelled at a similar speed. It would have missed the tanker that day. The past three times the Solong travelled through the area, while heading in the same direction, there were fewer anchored ships. On 3 March, there were two such vessels. On 24 February, there were four ships, while on 17 February there were three. Mr Irving, who works at South Shields Marine School, said: \"An anchored ship is not just sitting there passively – it has a responsibility to maintain a proper watch. Someone should have been on duty, monitoring nearby traffic and potential risks.\"  Why was the Solong not detained? The Solong container ship which crashed in the North Sea had repeatedly failed safety inspections in recent years, with ongoing issues in steering, navigation, and emergency systems. However, it had never been detained by authorities. Irish officials previously found that Solong's \"emergency steering position communications/compass reading\" was \"not readable\" according to port state control (PSC) inspection documents from July last year. It was among 10 deficiencies highlighted during an inspection of the vessel in Dublin. Other issues included alarms being \"inadequate\", survival craft \"not properly maintained\", and fire doors \"not as required\". The inspection was not an isolated case. Steering and navigation failures had been flagged multiple times, including a steering gear malfunction in 2022, a missing spare magnetic compass in 2020, and a steering gear deficiency in 2016. Mr Irving said \"Ten deficiencies on a ship is not unusual, especially with older vessels. It's like advisories on an MOT test – issues that need to be fixed before the next inspection, but not necessarily enough to stop the ship from sailing.\" Ships are typically detained when deficiencies pose an immediate threat to safety, the environment, or crew welfare. The official investigation will focus on why there was no evasive action to prevent the collision. Mr Irving said that the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) would be key in determining whether the officer on watch was present, paying attention or distracted. The biggest question is why no action was taken in the moments before the crash. The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "Two Olympic gold medallist ski jumpers have been suspended over their alleged involvement in manipulating ski suits to make them more aerodynamic. Three staff members embroiled in the cheating scandal - including the head coach - have also been stood down from their jobs. Athletes Marius Lindvik, 26, and Johann Andre Forfang, 29, will now not compete in a World Cup event that starts in Oslo this Thursday. The pair have denied involvement since the allegations emerged over the weekend. They were suspended on Wednesday pending an investigation by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS). Though both athletes were backed by the Norwegian team - their head coach, Magnus Brevig, and equipment manager Adrian Livelten, confessed. They admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held on Saturday. \"We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened,\" Mr Brevig said. \"I don't really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.\" It has emerged that team officials manipulated pre-approved and microchipped suits to increase their size and improve aerodynamics to help athletes fly further. It was revealed in footage secretly filmed from behind a curtain then sent by a whistleblower to international media. A FIS official said the illegal alterations were only confirmed by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the offending ski suits. The FIS has seized all the suits worn by the Norway teams at the world championships. \"FIS has provisionally suspended three Norwegian team officials and two athletes who are being investigated for their alleged involvement in illegal equipment manipulation,\" the Switzerland-based governing body said in a statement. Head coach Mr Brevig told local media he had \"consented to the suspension\" and said he was \"terribly sorry for what we did\". \"We have manipulated or modified the jumpsuits in a way that violates the regulations - ergo, cheated,\" he said. Mr Livelten apologised to the disqualified athletes as well as \"sponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people\" for an act of cheating he said was \"completely unacceptable\". The athletes had already been disqualified from the large hill event on Saturday - days after Mr Lindvik became world champion, winning silver. Read more on Sky News:Camo-clad Putin visits Russian frontlineWhat's going on with Trump and tariffs?  Stine Korsen, chair of the ski jumping committee, said that Norway would welcome an investigation by the FIS into the cheating.

That, at least, is one of the motivations behind his decision to weaponise tariffs, with a trade war now enveloping the UK as well. From 4am on Wednesday, a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from anywhere outside the US is being imposed. Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep all options on the table' A president protecting the Rustbelt. Or is it? What makes Mr Trump's approach to tariffs so unusual is he is open - more open than any US president I can remember - that it's also about the politics. Tariffs are his negotiating tactic of choice. His most beautiful word. They get lowered if you do deals with him. They get raised if you anger him, like Canada did. Remember that when thinking about the role of the EU over Ukraine days after their retaliation. And it's more politics than economics - because it's not immediately clear that what Mr Trump is doing helps US citizens. The tariff is a form of import tax. They are collected by the US government and the cash goes into the coffers of the US Treasury as goods go through customs. The business doing the importing pays the tax, but the costs will be passed on. Hurting some American firms. What's more, think tanks say his overall tariff plan could damage the economy and knock a percentage point off US GDP in a year. Is this really making America great? Has the UK responded? Not really. A stern message from the business secretary issued this morning, and he'll head to the US next week. In the longer term, striking some form of US-UK trade deal seems the only way out - but that won't be quick. What could we be doing? Well, this is how the EU reacted: £21bn of tit-for-tat sanctions from 1 April. If we were still in the EU, we'd have had to do this. Only because we're not, and outside the customs union, are we able to do something different in the name of diplomacy. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Sir Keir Starmer said at Prime Minister's Questions that all options are on the table - but don't expect an imminent flip of strategy to something resembling the EU approach. But who is right? Well, let's be honest - this isn't about us. Look at the data from the US Department of Commerce - the UK is the 17th biggest exporter of steel to the US - more than 20 times less than the biggest, which is Canada. Could the UK even achieve its aims by retaliating, given the differential in scale? Read more:Starmer 'disappointed' about Trump steel tariffsHow will Trump's tariffs affect the UK? The UK has gone down this path for a reason - because Sir Keir has decided to hug the White House close. They've punished us, but we're not hitting back - hoping that this government remains trusted enough to do business with Team Trump. A big differentiation from Europe - will Sir Keir reap the rewards?"

        "Content": "\n          India reporter and producer\n              @nevilleskynews\n Hostages have been killed after separatist militants hijacked a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Pakistan, authorities have said. The Pakistan military (ISPR) said 21 hostages were killed, as well as four security force soldiers, on the train that was carrying more than 400 people. Earlier on Wednesday, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack and said they had killed 50 people. A Pakistani government spokesman described the attack as \"an act of terrorism,\" and passengers who had been freed described how gunfire was \"coming from everywhere\". ISPR director general Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry added in a statement: \"Today we freed a large number of people, including women and children. The final operation was carried out with great care.\" The train was hijacked on Tuesday as it entered a tunnel in Bolan, a district in the southwestern province of Balochistan. The Jaffar Express was packed with 440 people, including women and children, Mr Chaudhry told local broadcaster Dunya TV. He added that \"militants were in touch with their handlers and masterminds in Afghanistan via satellite phones\" during the incident. The train was on a 1,000-mile journey from Quetta to the city of Peshawar. Militants blew up the railway tracks before firing at the train, killing the driver and trapping it inside a tunnel at Mashkaf. Security forces exchanged gunfire with the militants who were wearing vests loaded with explosives. 'God saved us' Noor Muhammad, who was travelling with his wife, said: \"First, they hit the engine with an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). \"After that, gunfire started and explosions were heard, RPGs were used. God saved us. \"They made us get off (the train) and told us to get down or they would shoot. We got down and then they said 'leave'.\" Read more from Sky News:Arrested captain of crashed ship is Russian nationalChildren under eight 'should avoid drinking slushies' Bashir Yousaf, who was with his family, said: \"Everyone was crying and passengers were shouting, everyone was lying on the floor trying to save their lives. \"The sound of gunfire was coming from everywhere, then they (insurgents) told us to get down. \"After getting off we were told not to look back. I just kept walking without looking back to save my family's lives.\" Mr Chaudhry added to Dunya TV that security forces \"first took out some of the militants and then began clearing compartment by compartment killing the militants\". He said the total number of militants was 33, and added that no passenger was hurt or killed during rescue operations. However, he added that before \"the final clearance,\" 21 people were killed by the militants. Four Frontier Corps soldiers were also killed. \"Perpetrators will be hunted down and will be brought to justice,\" he said. \"This incident of the Jaffar Express changes the rules of the game.\" Earlier in the day, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and said security officials were \"repelling\" the militants, while interior minister Mohsin Naqvi called the attackers \"enemies\" of the country. The BLA - designated a terrorist organisation by the UK - had demanded the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists, and missing persons within 48 hours. It had threatened to start executing the hostages if the government did not fulfil its demands. The group often targets infrastructure and security forces in Balochistan but has also struck in other areas, including the southern port city Karachi and the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea."

        "Content": " Newly obtained video footage reveals the moment container ship Solong crashed into US oil tanker Stena Immaculate off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday morning. The tanker was carrying Jet-A1 fuel for the US Navy as part of a US government programme designed to supply American armed forces with fuel when required, a military spokesman told Reuters. On Monday, maritime security sources said there was no indication of any malicious activity or other actors involved in the incident. UK authorities have also said they have so far found no evidence of foul play. The Solong's captain was arrested and the vessel's owner has said he is a Russian national. Humberside Police arrested the 59-year-old on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter on Tuesday. The rest of the crew were Russian and Filipino nationals, according to German shipping company Ernst Russ. Humberside Police said investigators had started a criminal probe into the cause of the collision and were working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Humberside detectives are working with the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch, and it has been reported that authorities from the US and Portugal will lead the investigation into what happened. The Stena Immaculate was stationary and at anchor on the River Humber when it was struck by the smaller Solong, causing huge fires and explosions. It was initially feared that the Solong was carrying sodium cyanide. However, the vessel's owner Ernst Russ said four containers on the vessel had previously held the hazardous chemical, but there was none on board at the time of the crash.  One missing, presumed dead One person, a crew member on the Solong, remains missing and is presumed dead. The coastguard rescued 36 people after the alarm was raised at 9.48am on Monday. The owner of Stena Immaculate, Stena Bulk, said on Wednesday its 23 crew members were American and in \"good health\". The coastguard said the Solong had been \"towed to a safe location\" while the Stena Immaculate was \"remaining at anchor in its original location\". Salvage workers \"will conduct on-board assessments of the vessels as soon as they are safe to board,\" chief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said. Solong failed safety checks It has emerged that the Solong failed steering-related safety checks last year. Inspection documents from July show officials warned the ship's \"emergency steering position communications/compass reading\" was \"not readable\". It was among 10 issues highlighted during an inspection by Irish officials. Other problems included the alarms being \"inadequate\", survival craft not being properly maintained and fire doors being \"not as required\".  Another inspection in Scotland in October 2024 found two issues with the Solong, including that lifebuoys were \"not properly marked\". Ernst Russ said: \"All deficiencies that were detected during routine port state control inspections of the Solong back in 2024 were promptly rectified\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Environmental impact not as severe as feared The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks - at least one of which was \"ruptured\" during the collision, shipping company Crowley said. But it said the jet fuel spill was having a \"limited\" impact.  The potential environmental impact seems to be less severe than initially feared. Most of the spilt jet fuel has evaporated or burned off, Crowley said in a post on X. There also seems to have been no loss of engine fuel from either vessel and both are expected to remain afloat despite a gaping hole in the side of the Stena Immaculate and earlier fears the Solong would sink. There are no visible flames on either ship and the Solong, which was drifting, has now been secured by tugs."

The move is designed to protect US manufacturing and bolster jobs by making foreign-made products less attractive. It is a threat to UK steel exports - worth more than £350m annually, with the bulk of that coming from stainless steel. The tariffs also risk making the cost of things from cars to soft drink cans, and therefore some drinks, more expensive. Canada is the biggest exporter of both steel and aluminium to America. However, the White House on Tuesday rowed back on a threat to double the levy to 50%, after the provincial government of Ontario halted a plan to charge 25% more for electricity it supplies to over 1.5 million US homes and businesses.  Some countries have already retaliated, with the EU announcing €26bn-worth of counter tariffs on US goods, starting from 1 April. However, Treasury minister James Murray warned earlier today against a \"knee jerk\" response. He told Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast : \"We're in a very different position than the EU, as a result of the prime minister's trip to Washington last month. \"The UK and the US have been negotiating rapidly for an economic agreement, and so we're in a position where that negotiation is ongoing and these global tariffs have landed in the middle of that work.\" Sir Keir was widely praised following a successful trip to Washington in February, during which Mr Trump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal with the UK that would not involve tariffs. Money blog: World retaliates against Trump tariffs  It sparked hopes the UK could be exempt from future levies being planned by the US president. Speaking to journalists after Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir's official spokesperson denied being snubbed, saying \"obviously these are global tariffs, not targeted at the UK\". Asked whether the economic deal planned between the US and UK would cover steel and aluminium, the spokesman said he was \"not going to get ahead of those discussions\". Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds will discuss the deal in Washington DC next week, which the government has previously suggested will be focused mainly on technology co-operation. Making \"progress\" on that deal will be the aim of those discussions, the PM's spokesperson said, adding that the steel industry \"has been clear\" they don't want to engage in an escalating trade war with the US."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs have come into effect. But what are they and what do they mean for the UK? What are tariffs and why does Trump want to impose them? Tariffs are taxes on goods imported into the US. The US president wants to impose wide-ranging tariffs on nearest neighbours Mexico and Canada, which he says will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. However, most of the 25% duties imposed on the pair to date have been suspended until 2 April. But two rounds of tariffs on China have been enacted - reflecting trade imbalances and Mr Trump's battle against fentanyl. So why is he now targeting steel and aluminium? On Wednesday, a separate 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports to the US came into effect, affecting UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The steel and aluminium tariffs are designed to protect US manufacturing and bolster jobs by making foreign-made products less attractive. The world's largest economy relies on imports of steel and aluminium and Mr Trump wants to change that. How have countries - including the UK - reacted? The European Union has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on the US. The European Commission said it will impose \"countermeasures\" affecting €26bn (£21.9bn) of US goods from 1 April after US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into force today. The bloc's tariffs will not only impact US steel and aluminium products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods.  Canada has announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth C$29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow, its country's finance minister has said. The tariffs will include steel products worth C$12.6bn (£6.8bn) and aluminium products worth C$3bn (£1.6bn). Computers, sports equipment and cast iron goods are also among the other products subject to the new retaliatory tariffs. Announcing the tariffs, Canada's foreign minister, Melanie Joly, added that Canada will raise the issues of tariffs with European allies to coordinate a response to put pressure on the US.  While UK industry sees it as a direct attack, the reality is that this country is not a major player any more because energy costs, in particular, mean that UK-produced steel is expensive. Nevertheless, stainless steel and some high-end products from the UK are in high demand and account for the bulk of the £350m in annual exports to the US. Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"disappointed\" to see Mr Trump impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium, saying the UK will take a \"pragmatic approach\" and \"all options are on the table\". The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said on Wednesday morning that while he was disappointed, there would be no immediate retaliation by the UK government as negotiations continue over a wider trade deal with the US. Why will metal products become more expensive? It stands to reason that if you slap additional costs on importers in the US, that cost will be passed on down the supply chain to the end user. If the aluminium to make soft drinks cans costs 25% more, for example, then the hit will have to be felt somewhere. It could mean that any US product involving steel or aluminium goes up in price, but hikes could be limited if companies decide to take some of the burden in their bottom lines. Read more on tariffs:It may be harder for the UK to trump metals tariffs this time round'Canadianos' and cancelled Vegas trips: How Canadians are acting with defiance What are the prospects for higher prices? It depends on the extent to which costs are passed down through the supply chain as new tariff regimes and any reciprocal tariffs are deployed. We do know that Mr Trump plans to fully roll out duties, on all goods, against Mexico and Canada from 2 April. But the White House did row back on a threat to double Canada's tariff on its steel and aluminium - the biggest exporter - to 50%. But Mr Trump is also widely expected to target almost all imports from the European Union from the beginning of April.  Is the UK facing further tariffs? Mr Trump has not explicitly said that the UK is in his sights. Data shows no great trade imbalances - the gap between what you import and export from a certain country - and UK figures show no trade deficit with the United States. UK ministers have previously suggested this could be good news for avoiding new levies.  Why tariffs could cost you - even if Trump spares UK Even if no tariffs are put on all UK exports to the US, consumers globally will still be impacted by the wider trade war, particularly in the US. Economists believe that tariffs will raise costs in the US, sparking a wave of inflation that will keep interest rates higher for longer. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is mandated to act to bring inflation down. More expensive borrowing and costlier goods and services could bring about an economic downturn in the US and have knock-on effects in the UK. Forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predict lower UK economic growth due to higher global interest rates. It has estimated that UK GDP (a measure of everything produced in the economy) could be between 2.5% and 3% lower over five years and 0.7% lower this year. The Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy thinktank said a 20% across-the-board tariff, impacting the UK, could lead to a £22bn reduction in the UK's US exports, with the hardest-hit sectors including fishing and mining."

        "Content": "A thief who tried to steal an Amazon driver's van has been found guilty of his murder. Claudiu Carol-Kondor, 42, tried to stop the theft by holding on to the van but was killed as it was driven away by Mark Ross. Ross deliberately crashed into a stationary Mini to knock him from the vehicle as he sped off, fleeing the scene from where Mr Carol-Kondor had been delivering a parcel. Ross reached speeds of almost 60mph on residential streets in Leeds on 20 August last year and swerved erratically from side to side before hitting two parked cars. Mr Kondor hung on to the vehicle from the open passenger door but died from head and chest injuries as a result of the second crash. Ross pleaded guilty to manslaughter and denied murdering Mr Kondor but on Wednesday a jury at Leeds Crown Court found him guilty of murder. Mr Kondor was delivering parcels in Leeds using his own silver Transit van, which was full of parcels he had collected from an Amazon depot, when Ross, who lived nearby, climbed into the driver's seat and started to drive away, jurors heard. Prosecutor John Harrison KC Mr Kondor \"tried to stop him by opening the front nearside passenger door of the van and attempting to climb in\" but the defendant drove away \"with Mr Kondor hanging on to his van\". CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Kondor hanging on to the moving van through an open door. \"It appears Mr Kondor did not wish to or perhaps could not let go of his van, he did not want the defendant simply to steal it,\" Mr Harrison said. \"After speeding and swerving failed to get rid of Mr Kondor, the defendant deliberately drove into collision with two parked cars.\" Ross \"deliberately\" turned the steering wheel of the van towards a black car parked on the side of the road, he said, and when that did not knock Mr Kondor off he \"tried again\". \"The second collision was with a blue car which caused damage to the van, to the parked car and most significantly, caused fatal head and chest injuries to Mr Kondor,\" Mr Harrison said. Read more from Sky News:Arrested North Sea crash ship captain is Russian nationalChildren's home was run like cult with 'slave labour'Hostages killed after train carrying hundreds hijacked After driving away, Ross met up with some other people and the contents of the van were removed, the court heard. Mr Harrison said Ross showed a \"complete disregard and even contempt\" for Mr Kondor's life. The \"career criminal\" must have realised Mr Kondor was there but made the choice that the driver was \"expendable,\" he added. Ross, of Conference Road, Armley, told the jury he had been a daily cannabis user since he was a child and had been out buying drugs and cigarette papers when he came across the van without a driver. He said he was not aware of anyone clinging on to the side of the van and later found out about Mr Kondor's death through the internet. He admitted stealing vans previously, but said he had \"never been involved in anything like this before\", and added: \"I would have stopped the van and run off if I had known he was there.\" Ross is due to be sentenced on Friday."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The devastated family of a Celtic fan who vanished on holiday in Lanzarote two years ago have said they will \"never give up searching for answers\" amid concerns something \"sinister\" may have happened. Gary Shearer disappeared hours after flying to the Canary Islands on 16 March 2023 to celebrate St Patrick's Day. The dad-of-one, from Renfrewshire in Scotland, was 53 when he went missing and would now be 55. His family, including mum Ann McMurray and niece Darcie Deeney, are heading to the Spanish island this week as part of the continued effort to unravel the mystery of what happened and to encourage the police to reopen the case. Ms Deeney told Sky News she believes something \"sinister\" may have happened, adding: \"We have come to terms that something has definitely happened to Gary.\" \"We're unsure of what, but we know he is not coming back,\" she said. \"We just want answers so that we can begin to grieve properly.\" She said the family \"will never give up searching for answers\". \"We will spend the rest of our lives looking for answers until we finally get some.\" Mr Shearer arrived at the Oasis Apartments in Puerto del Carmen and sent his family a poolside photo. He secured some belongings in his hotel safe, pocketed some cash and then headed out. At around 5.30pm, he messaged his mum to say he was going to Bar 67. At the time, he was wearing a Celtic top, white shorts and white trainers with a green and yellow trim, and carrying a black bag. CCTV later captured Mr Shearer unconscious in a doorway near the bar at around 1.30am. His family raised concerns when he failed to message his mum, with police eventually taking action when he missed his flight home to Scotland a week later. Investigating officers found his passport, bank card, travel money, and diabetes medication in his hotel room, but his phone was never recovered or used again. In August 2023, Spain's Civil Guard released CCTV images of Mr Shearer walking with an unidentified male on 17 March. The man, who was described as being between 60 and 70, with a strong build and grey hair, was never identified. In June 2024, police closed the case due to a lack of information. Ms Deeney said: \"The unknown is so haunting because we're constantly trying to make sense of it and we're constantly thinking of all the things that could have happened. \"At least if we knew what happened we could acknowledge that and begin to work on coping with the truth. It has had such an impact on every single member of the family.\" The situation was said to have taken a \"huge toll\" on Mr Shearer's parents. Read more from Sky News:More than 23,000 dogs stolen in last 10 yearsArrested captain of ship in North Sea crash is Russian national Ms Deeney described her uncle as a \"family orientated man\" who \"loved a joke and making people happy\". She added: \"Gary is so loved by all of us and so many friends.\" While they are in Lanzarote, Ms Deeney said the plan is to \"gain as much publicity as possible\" in the hope police will reopen the case. She said: \"We're also travelling to surrounding islands this time which we haven't done before to try and spread the word further and place posters there also. \"We've got posters and leaflets to hand out and we're going to try and speak to as many people possible and tell them Gary's story. \"One little piece of information that someone has - that they might not think is relevant - could be all that we need to paint a bigger picture and for us to get Gary's case opened up again.\""

The gunman, who is still at large, was wearing a crash helmet, gloves and a distinctive orange Just Eat jacket and was riding a stolen Honda moped, the Old Bailey was told. He was allegedly assisted by Omar Prempeh, 32, who is charged with murder having allegedly driven the gunman from the scene in a Nissan Juke. Prempeh appeared at the Old Bailey on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing in the case.

The Pakistan military (ISPR) said 21 hostages were killed, as well as four security force soldiers, on the train that was carrying more than 400 people. Earlier on Wednesday, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack and said they had killed 50 people. A Pakistani government spokesman described the attack as \"an act of terrorism,\" and passengers who had been freed described how gunfire was \"coming from everywhere\". ISPR director general Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry added in a statement: \"Today we freed a large number of people, including women and children. The final operation was carried out with great care.\" The train was hijacked on Tuesday as it entered a tunnel in Bolan, a district in the southwestern province of Balochistan. The Jaffar Express was packed with 440 people, including women and children, Mr Chaudhry told local broadcaster Dunya TV. He added that \"militants were in touch with their handlers and masterminds in Afghanistan via satellite phones\" during the incident. The train was on a 1,000-mile journey from Quetta to the city of Peshawar. Militants blew up the railway tracks before firing at the train, killing the driver and trapping it inside a tunnel at Mashkaf.

He said the total number of militants was 33, and added that no passenger was hurt or killed during rescue operations. However, he added that before \"the final clearance,\" 21 people were killed by the militants. Four Frontier Corps soldiers were also killed. \"Perpetrators will be hunted down and will be brought to justice,\" he said. \"This incident of the Jaffar Express changes the rules of the game.\" Earlier in the day, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and said security officials were \"repelling\" the militants, while interior minister Mohsin Naqvi called the attackers \"enemies\" of the country. The BLA - designated a terrorist organisation by the UK - had demanded the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists, and missing persons within 48 hours. It had threatened to start executing the hostages if the government did not fulfil its demands. The group often targets infrastructure and security forces in Balochistan but has also struck in other areas, including the southern port city Karachi and the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the EU during a meeting with Irish premier Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. The US president said he did not want \"to do anything to hurt Ireland\" but added that the trade relationship between the countries should be focused on \"fairness\". It comes after the president imposed 25% tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports to the US - prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow and the EU to impose counter tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods from 1 April. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"disappointed\" to see the president impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium and promised to \"keep all options on the table\" in how the UK would respond. During Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Martin, the president raised the \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage of the US. He said the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\". Asked by Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy if Ireland was also taking advantage, Mr Trump replied: \"Of course they are.\" He added: \"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue. \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep options on the table'  Mr Trump said he loves Ireland, where he has a golf course - but said he wishes the US had \"not been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody\". Many US pharmaceutical companies have set up their manufacturing facilities in Ireland due to its low 12.5% corporate tax rate. Irish firms then pay a royalty fee to US parent companies so they can use formulas to make products - meaning Ireland could be the hardest hit EU member by Mr Trump's 25% tariffs. 'I would have imposed 200% tariffs' Mr Trump said if he had been president when those companies started to move to Ireland, he would have imposed a 200% tariff on them so they could not sell anything into the US and they would have \"stayed here\". The president said he would like to see American pharmaceutical companies returning to the US, but expected Mr Martin to \"fight on that issue\". He also told Sky News he would \"absolutely\" place tariffs on cars from the EU. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump  Mr Trump accused previous presidents of having \"lost big segments\" of the US economy and said the EU \"treats us very badly\", referencing a recent ruling against Apple. \"They have not been fair. They sue our companies and win massive amounts of money. They sued Apple, won 17 billion US dollars and they use that for other reasons, I guess, to run the European Union,\" he said. \"So I'm not knocking it. They're doing what they should be doing, perhaps for the European Union, but it does create ill will - and as you know, we're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs so whatever they charge us with, we're charging them. Nobody can complain about that.\" Ireland correspondent Well, that went well. An Oval Office meeting that in any other St Patrick's week would have been regarded as almost unimaginably confrontational – this time around the Irish delegation will be floating on air. Micheal Martin was in the lion's den today, the first leader to step into the Oval Office since Volodymyr Zelenskyy's verbal bloodbath, and you could forgive the Irish PM for being apprehensive. This was always going to be the most important visit of a taoiseach to the White House in generations. What is usually a jovial green-tinged occasion was this year imbued with a new sense of gravity and nervousness.  \n The Irish government knew it was in the president's crosshairs – any small country that boasts a huge trade surplus with the US was bound to be a target for this administration. American figures put that surplus in goods at around €80bn (£67bn) last year, although Irish statisticians insist it was a mere €50bn (£41.9bn) - still a record. In the Oval, I managed to ask the president if Ireland was taking advantage of America. \"Of course they are,\" he replied. But Mr Trump is at heart a businessman, and it sounded more like a sneaking admiration.  \"I have great respect for Ireland, and what they did,\" he said. Ireland did exactly what they should have done, he continued, referencing the luring of lucrative US multinationals. But he placed the blame firmly on \"stupid\" American leaders who \"allowed\" it to happen. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing.  The EU was set up to exploit America, Mr Trump said. It was \"abuse\". Again and again, it was the Brussels bogeyman, not the Emerald Isle, that bore the brunt of his attack.\n I asked if he would respond with more tariffs to the new EU tariffs. \"Of course,\" Mr Trump responded. After an anecdote about the lack of Chevrolets in Munich, I asked would he now consider tariffs on the crucial European car industry – he replied in the affirmative. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing. When the taoiseach did speak, it was to hit the Irish talking points – the Ireland-US relationship was a \"two-way street\", with the Irish currently the sixth-largest investor in the US.\n \"Just look how many Boeings Ryanair is purchasing\" was the theme of Mr Martin's argument. The leaders joked about Mr Martin's boxer father. Mr Trump spoke admiringly of Conor McGregor and Rory McIlroy. The minutes ticked away... Ireland unscathed. They finished with a discussion about the president's Irish resort at Doonbeg in County Clare. Mr Trump lauded the Irish efficiency at approving an expansion plan, and decried the subsequent EU approval period of several years. Once again – Ireland good, Brussels bad.\n There was so much nervousness in Irish government circles. Now they must be wondering what the fuss was all about. 'Great honour' to meet Irish Taoiseach Despite his criticism of Ireland, Mr Trump said it was a \"great honour\" to have the taoiseach at the White House. He said the US has \"tremendous\" business relationships in Ireland \"and that will only get stronger\". The US leader said his personal relationship with Mr Martin was \"very, very strong and very, very good\" as he thanked him for coming to Washington DC to celebrate St Patrick's Day. He added that Mr Martin did not \"look nervous\" about the subject of tariffs during their meeting. Taoiseach reminds Trump of Irish investment in US The taoiseach praised Mr Trump's work on \"peace initiatives\" and said the two countries have a \"very good relationship, a historic one\". But, hinting at the tariffs imposed by Mr Trump, Mr Martin said: \"It's a two-way street. We are investing a lot more in America.\" He said he understands where Mr Trump is coming from, but added that Irish companies Ryanair and aircraft leasing firm Aercap \"buy more Boeing\" planes than anybody else outside the US."

A plane carrying the former leader of the southeast Asian country landed at Rotterdam airport shortly before 4pm UK time on Wednesday. It was due to land at around 6am but was delayed after a long layover in Dubai, where Duterte received medical checks. The 79-year-old was arrested for alleged crimes against humanity on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, early on Tuesday. Read more: Philippines' war on drugs Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said officers detained Duterte when he returned from a trip to Hong Kong, and sent him to the ICC. Mr Marcos Jr - who has not re-joined the ICC after Duterte withdrew the Philippines from its founding treaty in 2019 - noted the arrest was made in compliance with Interpol. The ICC case centres on thousands of killings that took place during the former leader's brutal crackdown on illegal drugs from 2011, when he was a city mayor, to the end of his presidency in 2022. Police say more than 6,200 people were killed in what they describe as shootouts while he was president from 2016 to 2022. Human rights groups and the prosecutor of the ICC say as many as 30,000 people may have been killed.  Police or vigilantes working for them, such as gunmen on motorbikes, were alleged to have killed masses of unarmed suspects while he was in charge. Authorities have denied the claims. In its warrant, ICC judges said there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that [Mr] Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder\". It accuses Duterte of being criminally responsible for the murders of at least 43 people between 2011 and 2019.  Should the case progress, Duterte would be the first Asian former head of state to stand trial at the ICC. The former president's team declared the arrest unlawful and vowed to fight it. During a senate inquiry last year, Duterte admitted to having a \"death squad\" of \"gangsters\" while he served as mayor of the southern city of Davao but denied authorising police to shoot suspects when he became president. The ex-president's administration also tried to suspend the ICC probe in late 2021, arguing it didn't have jurisdiction and saying domestic authorities were already looking at the claims. Judges in The Hague rejected the objections two years ago and said the investigation could continue."

The Demokraatit party won 30% of the vote. It favours a slow move towards independence from Denmark. On the eve of the election, its leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen had told Sky News voters should use the election to warn the US president not to meddle in their future. He said: \"I hope it sends a clear message to him that we are not for sale. \"We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.\" Donald Trump has been actively trying to prise Greenland away from Denmark, urging its people to determine their own future and join the United States. A few days before they went to vote he promised \"billions of dollars\" in investment telling them he will \"make you rich\". \n                  Denmark postal service to stop delivering letters\n                 \n                  Artist abandons plan to starve piglets to death after animals stolen\n                 \n                  Tattoos may be linked to increased risk of cancer, study suggests\n                 The intervention made the election Greenland's most closely watched and highly charged in its history. All its parties advocate independence but differ on how quickly it can happen.  The territory's second opposition party Naleraq made big gains in its share of the vote. It wants a swift move to independence. One candidate, Qupanak Olsen, told Sky News Donald Trump's interference had helped its cause. \"It's making us aware, we are worth more than what the Danish people have been telling us for the last 300 years, maybe we can stand on our own two feet,\" she said. The party's relative success may give Trump and its supporters hope they can do more to encourage independence in the future.  But it's important to stress joining the US is not a popular idea here. Even Ms Olsen rejected any moves towards joining the US, saying Greenland would not swap 300 years of colonialism under Denmark for more of the same under the US. There were bigger issues dominating the election for Greenlanders. Insufficient healthcare, especially for cancer treatment for instance, is a major grievance on this remote but vast island. But for the US president this was all about his neo-imperialist ambitions, openly musing yesterday about erasing borders between the US, Canada and Greenland. Read more on Sky News:Russia firm on ceasefire - latestUK 'disappointed' by tariffsHow Canada is defying Trump His brazen play for Greenland and its vast largely untapped mineral wealth did not go down well among the fiercely independent islanders. President Trump's unashamed meddling has baffled observers. He says Greenland is vital for America's security, and yet the US already has military bases on its territory and has been offered the possibility of building more. Equally, US mining companies have every right to join the effort to extract its huge mineral wealth, as Chinese, European, Canadian and Australian firms have been attempting for decades. It is however not an easy process. Greenland's vast size, lack of roads and Arctic climate are huge challenges. It is as reluctant to yield its mineral riches as it seems its people are to succumb to the advances of a US president. This election shows Donald Trump will have to try harder if he wants to win the affections of Greenland's people and Greenland's elusive natural bounty."

        "Content": "As the world waits for Russia's next move over the US-proposed ceasefire deal with Ukraine, only one man has been trusted to head up Donald Trump's envoy to Moscow - and he's far from the typical diplomat. Initially named as Mr Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine. His surprise trip to Moscow last month to achieve the release of US citizen Marc Fogel seemed to secure the 67-year-old as the US leader's geopolitical dealmaker-in-chief. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates Off the back of his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Witkoff is believed to be seeing him again later this week to discuss diplomatic proposals - though the Kremlin is yet to confirm this. He has been chosen to go to Moscow by Mr Trump over US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who on paper is the country's top diplomat, and Keith Kellogg, who was assigned to be the US envoy for Russia-Ukraine peace talks back in January. So who is Steve Witkoff, and how important a figure will he be as the US tries to navigate peace between Russia and Ukraine?  From New York real estate to the Oval Office Born in the Bronx, New York State, Mr Witkoff trained as a lawyer in real estate before turning his hand to property development. In the 1990s he created his company, the Witkoff Group, which owns a number of properties in New York, most notably the Park Lane Hotel and The Woolworth Building. Similarly to Mr Trump, he brought his close family members into his company, including his wife, Lauren Rappoport, and their sons Zach and Alexander, who is co-chief executive. As of 2019, the Witkoff Group owned almost 50 properties across the US and the rest of the world.  'My dear friend President Trump' The billionaire has known Mr Trump for decades, having first met him through a New York real estate company where the now president was a client. Having remained close, the pair bonded over their mutual love of golf, and weredescribed by US senator Lindsey Graham as \"longtime golf buddies\". Mr Witkoff was one of those on the fifth hole with the president at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September last year, when a second apparent assassination attempt was made on his life. But despite being regular opponents on the course, Mr Witkoff and Mr Trump are very much aligned in politics, with the businessman having donated to the Republican Party during the 2024 election. He even spoke at the Republican National Convention back in July last year, where he said he had the \"privilege\" of calling Mr Trump a \"true and dear friend for many years, in good times and bad times\". Mr Witkoff also firmly backed Mr Trump's foreign policy, saying at the inauguration parade: \"We are done carrying the financial burden of nations that are unwilling to fund their own progress. \"The days of blank checks are over\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 A critical player in Middle East negotiations During Mr Trump's first term in office, Mr Witkoff played a more minor role, serving as one of the president's Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups - which aimed to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was over lunch with Mr Trump after his second election win that Mr Witkoff reportedly broached the idea of working on the Middle East - a region he has extensive business ties with, according to NBC. \"That stunned me because I didn't know he was that interested in the Middle East,\" Senator Graham told NBC back in January, while discussing Mr Witkoff's appointment. \"And Trump looked at me and said: 'Well, a million people have tried. Let's pick a nice guy who's a smart guy'.\" Since the beginning of the year, Mr Witkoff has proven to be a critical player in negotiations between Israel and Hamas - helping to secure January's ceasefire deal which has so far seen the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. One person familiar with the negotiations described Mr Witkoff to NBC as someone who is \"very much engaged\" with \"his heart is in the right place\". A Middle Eastern diplomat, who spoke with NBC on condition of anonymity at the time, added that the businessman was a tough negotiator but was also able to \"empathise\" with parents who have lost their children on both sides of the conflict, as he openly spoke about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 aged 22. Growing criticism  Despite praise for Mr Witkoff's approach to geopolitics, there is also growing criticism against him. Shortly after his visit to Gaza back in January, he backed Mr Trump's surprise announcement that the US wanted to \"develop\" the region and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". Mr Trump suggested that Gaza's two million people would not return to their territory under the plans, which has been widely criticised as amounting to ethnic cleansing. Mr Witkoff also faces questions over his first private meeting with President Putin last month, in which he said he had developed a \"friendship\" with the Russian leader.

However, the details of the conversation and what was discussed have never been released, with only translators present at the time."

        "Content": "Two Olympic gold medallist ski jumpers have been suspended over their alleged involvement in manipulating ski suits to make them more aerodynamic. Three staff members embroiled in the cheating scandal - including the head coach - have also been stood down from their jobs. Athletes Marius Lindvik, 26, and Johann Andre Forfang, 29, will now not compete in a World Cup event that starts in Oslo this Thursday. The pair have denied involvement since the allegations emerged over the weekend. They were suspended on Wednesday pending an investigation by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS). Though both athletes were backed by the Norwegian team - their head coach, Magnus Brevig, and equipment manager Adrian Livelten, confessed. They admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held on Saturday. \"We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened,\" Mr Brevig said. \"I don't really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.\" It has emerged that team officials manipulated pre-approved and microchipped suits to increase their size and improve aerodynamics to help athletes fly further. It was revealed in footage secretly filmed from behind a curtain then sent by a whistleblower to international media. A FIS official said the illegal alterations were only confirmed by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the offending ski suits. The FIS has seized all the suits worn by the Norway teams at the world championships. \"FIS has provisionally suspended three Norwegian team officials and two athletes who are being investigated for their alleged involvement in illegal equipment manipulation,\" the Switzerland-based governing body said in a statement. Head coach Mr Brevig told local media he had \"consented to the suspension\" and said he was \"terribly sorry for what we did\". \"We have manipulated or modified the jumpsuits in a way that violates the regulations - ergo, cheated,\" he said. Mr Livelten apologised to the disqualified athletes as well as \"sponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people\" for an act of cheating he said was \"completely unacceptable\". The athletes had already been disqualified from the large hill event on Saturday - days after Mr Lindvik became world champion, winning silver. Read more on Sky News:Camo-clad Putin visits Russian frontlineWhat's going on with Trump and tariffs?  Stine Korsen, chair of the ski jumping committee, said that Norway would welcome an investigation by the FIS into the cheating. He said: \"We take this matter very seriously and recognise that equipment has been deliberately manipulated in violation of FIS regulations in order to gain an advantage in the competition.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump's senior trade adviser has told a Sky News reporter to \"stop that crap\" while facing questions over the US president's tariffs policy. Peter Navarro insisted Mr Trump was \"negotiating strategically\" after Sky's US correspondent Mark Stone said the president \"seems to be changing his mind by the hour at the moment\". Mr Trump had announced an increased tariff of 50% on Canadian steel and aluminium on Tuesday but then halted the plan just hours later. There are, however, 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US in effect from today, affecting UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Follow latest: World retaliates against Trump tariffs  Mr Navarro said: \"The policy is 'no exemptions, no exclusions' and that will change if the president changes his policy. \"But there's a very good reason why 'no exemptions, no exclusions' exists as a policy because when we were kind enough as a country to make those kind of gestures to our friends, they bit the hand that fed them and that's not going to happen again.\" Read more:How Canadians are acting with defiance to Trump's tariffsTrump buys a Tesla in support of 'Elon's baby' US correspondent It's worth saying upfront that the Trump administration has been significantly more accessible than the Biden administration. It was rare for Biden officials to appear outside the White House for impromptu moments with reporters.  A large cast of Trump officials are frequently in front of the cameras. That's encouraging. That said accessibility isn't the same as transparency. Just because the officials are out there doesn't mean they welcome robust interrogation. Peter Navarro's pushback at my questions was surprising and revealing. I've questioned him a few times over the past few weeks. His engagement has been calm, but not this time. He was irritated certainly, rattled maybe; wholly unwilling to accept that the markets had reacted negatively to what he called 'Trump-omics'. He said the president's flip-flopping was simply a negotiation tactic - so not the revenue generator they have been presented as.  If they are simply a negotiating tactic, then are they temporary? If so, how does the administration raise its revenue? In response, Stone said: \"The president seems to be changing his mind by the hour at the moment. What are your views on the fact that...\" Mr Navarro replied: \"Sir, you don't understand what a negotiation looks like. The president is negotiating strategically. So stop with the rhetoric, okay? Just stop that crap.\" Stone said: \"But he does seem to be changing his mind all the time...\" Mr Navarro responded: \"Stop that crap. That's a bunch of cr...\" When Stone said it was \"causing havoc to the stock markets\", Mr Navarro responded: \"It's not causing havoc.\" US correspondent In 2017, during the last Trump presidency, Politico suggested Navarro was \"the most dangerous man in Trump world\". Navarro is a long-time aide and confidante of Donald Trump and a true loyalist.  His economic views are well beyond mainstream economic thought. He is a long-time advocate of tariffs with upfront plans to upend the post-WW2 economic system of free trade and international institutions.  Establishment economists consider him to be fringe. That's precisely why he appeals to President Trump.  He was jailed in 2024 for defying a congressional subpoena. He was told to appear before the House Select Committee investigating the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol. He refused to comply.  The committee alleged that he developed plans to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.  The subpoena was motivated by a plan Navarro revealed in a book published in 2021.  \"Green Bay Sweep\" was a plot by he and other Trump loyalists to overturn the 2020 election.  He described it as \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" "

Just hours later, that was revised back down to 25%. There is a grinding, on-off, tit-for-tat nature to these economic punishments. The British Columbia premier David Eby retaliated to the Trump tariffs by prohibiting the sale of American-manufactured alcohol in his province. 'Buy Canadian Instead' BC Liquor Store is just steps away from the premier's office in Victoria. On the shelves where Kentucky bourbon would usually be there are signs saying: \"Buy Canadian Instead.\" Dozens of bottles of California and Oregon wine are wrapped tightly with cellophane. But the threats from the Trump administration don't end with tariffs. The president has stated repeatedly that he's keen to make Canada the 51st state. Even referring to then prime minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\". Premier Eby tells Sky News: \"These are deeply unnerving statements for the president to be making, especially in the context of clearly expansionist policies related to Greenland and the Panama Canal. \"What we get continually about the president is to take him seriously, but not literally. \"I would love to have that kind of luxury… the danger, I think, is not taking him literally and seriously.\" 'I'm trying to buy anything but American' On the ferry which connects Vancouver Island with the mainland, tariff fatigue is setting in. Passenger Nancy, a government worker, says she thinks Donald Trump is intent on causing mayhem. \"He's a menace, he's just creating chaos where it doesn't need to be.\" Her colleague Laura says the silver lining is that the tariffs have galvanised Canadians together. \"People feel hurt and angry,\" she says. \"We are trying to buy more Canadian products and travel anywhere other than the United States. I had a trip booked to Las Vegas and we've cancelled that. When I go to the grocery store, I look for the Canadian maple leaf that a lot of grocery stores have put on the shelves. I'm trying to buy anything but American.\" Richard thinks Donald Trump's end game is to weaken the Canadian economy. \"I think Trump had an agenda from the beginning, without a doubt. I think he wanted to cause a collapse of the Canadian economy so it would make it easier for him and his colleagues to buy up whatever they wanted, if not to make us a 51st state - it had nothing to do with Fentanyl, that was just a ruse.\" Trump's 'fiction' Fentanyl claims  He's referencing the Trump administration's repeated claims that Fentanyl, a devastating opioid that has ravaged parts of both America and Canada, is flooding over the Canadian border into the US. It's the reason, they say, for starting this trade war. Dr M-J Milloy, director of research at British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, says that this simply isn't true. \"There is no one who knows anything about drug markets in North America who would agree with the statement that Canada is a substantial part of the problem in the United States. It is a fiction.\" \"No question that Fentanyl has devastated the United States. Fentanyl is devastating Canada. And so I think in that way, it might be a potent way for Mr Trump to whip up enthusiasm and to justify this aggression,\" he adds. Whatever the reason - invented or otherwise - for this trade war, it's making an enemy of this ally.  The question is, what power does Canada really have in the face of its much bigger, far wealthier neighbour?"

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the EU during a meeting with Irish premier Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. The US president said he did not want \"to do anything to hurt Ireland\" but added that the trade relationship between the countries should be focused on \"fairness\". It comes after the president imposed 25% tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports to the US - prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow and the EU to impose counter tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods from 1 April. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"disappointed\" to see the president impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium and promised to \"keep all options on the table\" in how the UK would respond. During Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Martin, the president raised the \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage of the US. He said the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\". Asked by Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy if Ireland was also taking advantage, Mr Trump replied: \"Of course they are.\" He added: \"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue. \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep options on the table'  Mr Trump said he loves Ireland, where he has a golf course - but said he wishes the US had \"not been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody\". Many US pharmaceutical companies have set up their manufacturing facilities in Ireland due to its low 12.5% corporate tax rate. Irish firms then pay a royalty fee to US parent companies so they can use formulas to make products - meaning Ireland could be the hardest hit EU member by Mr Trump's 25% tariffs. 'I would have imposed 200% tariffs' Mr Trump said if he had been president when those companies started to move to Ireland, he would have imposed a 200% tariff on them so they could not sell anything into the US and they would have \"stayed here\". The president said he would like to see American pharmaceutical companies returning to the US, but expected Mr Martin to \"fight on that issue\". He also told Sky News he would \"absolutely\" place tariffs on cars from the EU. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump  Mr Trump accused previous presidents of having \"lost big segments\" of the US economy and said the EU \"treats us very badly\", referencing a recent ruling against Apple. \"They have not been fair. They sue our companies and win massive amounts of money. They sued Apple, won 17 billion US dollars and they use that for other reasons, I guess, to run the European Union,\" he said. \"So I'm not knocking it. They're doing what they should be doing, perhaps for the European Union, but it does create ill will - and as you know, we're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs so whatever they charge us with, we're charging them. Nobody can complain about that.\" Ireland correspondent Well, that went well. An Oval Office meeting that in any other St Patrick's week would have been regarded as almost unimaginably confrontational – this time around the Irish delegation will be floating on air. Micheal Martin was in the lion's den today, the first leader to step into the Oval Office since Volodymyr Zelenskyy's verbal bloodbath, and you could forgive the Irish PM for being apprehensive. This was always going to be the most important visit of a taoiseach to the White House in generations. What is usually a jovial green-tinged occasion was this year imbued with a new sense of gravity and nervousness.  \n The Irish government knew it was in the president's crosshairs – any small country that boasts a huge trade surplus with the US was bound to be a target for this administration. American figures put that surplus in goods at around €80bn (£67bn) last year, although Irish statisticians insist it was a mere €50bn (£41.9bn) - still a record. In the Oval, I managed to ask the president if Ireland was taking advantage of America. \"Of course they are,\" he replied. But Mr Trump is at heart a businessman, and it sounded more like a sneaking admiration.  \"I have great respect for Ireland, and what they did,\" he said. Ireland did exactly what they should have done, he continued, referencing the luring of lucrative US multinationals. But he placed the blame firmly on \"stupid\" American leaders who \"allowed\" it to happen. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing.  The EU was set up to exploit America, Mr Trump said. It was \"abuse\". Again and again, it was the Brussels bogeyman, not the Emerald Isle, that bore the brunt of his attack.\n I asked if he would respond with more tariffs to the new EU tariffs. \"Of course,\" Mr Trump responded. After an anecdote about the lack of Chevrolets in Munich, I asked would he now consider tariffs on the crucial European car industry – he replied in the affirmative. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing. When the taoiseach did speak, it was to hit the Irish talking points – the Ireland-US relationship was a \"two-way street\", with the Irish currently the sixth-largest investor in the US.\n \"Just look how many Boeings Ryanair is purchasing\" was the theme of Mr Martin's argument. The leaders joked about Mr Martin's boxer father. Mr Trump spoke admiringly of Conor McGregor and Rory McIlroy. The minutes ticked away... Ireland unscathed. They finished with a discussion about the president's Irish resort at Doonbeg in County Clare. Mr Trump lauded the Irish efficiency at approving an expansion plan, and decried the subsequent EU approval period of several years. Once again – Ireland good, Brussels bad.\n There was so much nervousness in Irish government circles. Now they must be wondering what the fuss was all about. 'Great honour' to meet Irish Taoiseach Despite his criticism of Ireland, Mr Trump said it was a \"great honour\" to have the taoiseach at the White House. He said the US has \"tremendous\" business relationships in Ireland \"and that will only get stronger\". The US leader said his personal relationship with Mr Martin was \"very, very strong and very, very good\" as he thanked him for coming to Washington DC to celebrate St Patrick's Day. He added that Mr Martin did not \"look nervous\" about the subject of tariffs during their meeting. Taoiseach reminds Trump of Irish investment in US The taoiseach praised Mr Trump's work on \"peace initiatives\" and said the two countries have a \"very good relationship, a historic one\". But, hinting at the tariffs imposed by Mr Trump, Mr Martin said: \"It's a two-way street. We are investing a lot more in America.\" He said he understands where Mr Trump is coming from, but added that Irish companies Ryanair and aircraft leasing firm Aercap \"buy more Boeing\" planes than anybody else outside the US."

        "Content": "As the world waits for Russia's next move over the US-proposed ceasefire deal with Ukraine, only one man has been trusted to head up Donald Trump's envoy to Moscow - and he's far from the typical diplomat. Initially named as Mr Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine. His surprise trip to Moscow last month to achieve the release of US citizen Marc Fogel seemed to secure the 67-year-old as the US leader's geopolitical dealmaker-in-chief. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates Off the back of his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Witkoff is believed to be seeing him again later this week to discuss diplomatic proposals - though the Kremlin is yet to confirm this. He has been chosen to go to Moscow by Mr Trump over US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who on paper is the country's top diplomat, and Keith Kellogg, who was assigned to be the US envoy for Russia-Ukraine peace talks back in January. So who is Steve Witkoff, and how important a figure will he be as the US tries to navigate peace between Russia and Ukraine?  From New York real estate to the Oval Office Born in the Bronx, New York State, Mr Witkoff trained as a lawyer in real estate before turning his hand to property development. In the 1990s he created his company, the Witkoff Group, which owns a number of properties in New York, most notably the Park Lane Hotel and The Woolworth Building. Similarly to Mr Trump, he brought his close family members into his company, including his wife, Lauren Rappoport, and their sons Zach and Alexander, who is co-chief executive. As of 2019, the Witkoff Group owned almost 50 properties across the US and the rest of the world.  'My dear friend President Trump' The billionaire has known Mr Trump for decades, having first met him through a New York real estate company where the now president was a client. Having remained close, the pair bonded over their mutual love of golf, and weredescribed by US senator Lindsey Graham as \"longtime golf buddies\". Mr Witkoff was one of those on the fifth hole with the president at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September last year, when a second apparent assassination attempt was made on his life. But despite being regular opponents on the course, Mr Witkoff and Mr Trump are very much aligned in politics, with the businessman having donated to the Republican Party during the 2024 election. He even spoke at the Republican National Convention back in July last year, where he said he had the \"privilege\" of calling Mr Trump a \"true and dear friend for many years, in good times and bad times\". Mr Witkoff also firmly backed Mr Trump's foreign policy, saying at the inauguration parade: \"We are done carrying the financial burden of nations that are unwilling to fund their own progress. \"The days of blank checks are over\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 A critical player in Middle East negotiations During Mr Trump's first term in office, Mr Witkoff played a more minor role, serving as one of the president's Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups - which aimed to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was over lunch with Mr Trump after his second election win that Mr Witkoff reportedly broached the idea of working on the Middle East - a region he has extensive business ties with, according to NBC. \"That stunned me because I didn't know he was that interested in the Middle East,\" Senator Graham told NBC back in January, while discussing Mr Witkoff's appointment. \"And Trump looked at me and said: 'Well, a million people have tried. Let's pick a nice guy who's a smart guy'.\" Since the beginning of the year, Mr Witkoff has proven to be a critical player in negotiations between Israel and Hamas - helping to secure January's ceasefire deal which has so far seen the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. One person familiar with the negotiations described Mr Witkoff to NBC as someone who is \"very much engaged\" with \"his heart is in the right place\". A Middle Eastern diplomat, who spoke with NBC on condition of anonymity at the time, added that the businessman was a tough negotiator but was also able to \"empathise\" with parents who have lost their children on both sides of the conflict, as he openly spoke about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 aged 22. Growing criticism  Despite praise for Mr Witkoff's approach to geopolitics, there is also growing criticism against him. Shortly after his visit to Gaza back in January, he backed Mr Trump's surprise announcement that the US wanted to \"develop\" the region and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\". Mr Trump suggested that Gaza's two million people would not return to their territory under the plans, which has been widely criticised as amounting to ethnic cleansing. Mr Witkoff also faces questions over his first private meeting with President Putin last month, in which he said he had developed a \"friendship\" with the Russian leader.

However, the details of the conversation and what was discussed have never been released, with only translators present at the time."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs have come into effect. But what are they and what do they mean for the UK? What are tariffs and why does Trump want to impose them? Tariffs are taxes on goods imported into the US. The US president wants to impose wide-ranging tariffs on nearest neighbours Mexico and Canada, which he says will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. However, most of the 25% duties imposed on the pair to date have been suspended until 2 April. But two rounds of tariffs on China have been enacted - reflecting trade imbalances and Mr Trump's battle against fentanyl. So why is he now targeting steel and aluminium? On Wednesday, a separate 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports to the US came into effect, affecting UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The steel and aluminium tariffs are designed to protect US manufacturing and bolster jobs by making foreign-made products less attractive. The world's largest economy relies on imports of steel and aluminium and Mr Trump wants to change that. How have countries - including the UK - reacted? The European Union has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on the US. The European Commission said it will impose \"countermeasures\" affecting €26bn (£21.9bn) of US goods from 1 April after US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into force today. The bloc's tariffs will not only impact US steel and aluminium products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods.  Canada has announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth C$29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow, its country's finance minister has said. The tariffs will include steel products worth C$12.6bn (£6.8bn) and aluminium products worth C$3bn (£1.6bn). Computers, sports equipment and cast iron goods are also among the other products subject to the new retaliatory tariffs. Announcing the tariffs, Canada's foreign minister, Melanie Joly, added that Canada will raise the issues of tariffs with European allies to coordinate a response to put pressure on the US.  While UK industry sees it as a direct attack, the reality is that this country is not a major player any more because energy costs, in particular, mean that UK-produced steel is expensive. Nevertheless, stainless steel and some high-end products from the UK are in high demand and account for the bulk of the £350m in annual exports to the US. Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"disappointed\" to see Mr Trump impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium, saying the UK will take a \"pragmatic approach\" and \"all options are on the table\". The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said on Wednesday morning that while he was disappointed, there would be no immediate retaliation by the UK government as negotiations continue over a wider trade deal with the US. Why will metal products become more expensive? It stands to reason that if you slap additional costs on importers in the US, that cost will be passed on down the supply chain to the end user. If the aluminium to make soft drinks cans costs 25% more, for example, then the hit will have to be felt somewhere. It could mean that any US product involving steel or aluminium goes up in price, but hikes could be limited if companies decide to take some of the burden in their bottom lines.

It depends on the extent to which costs are passed down through the supply chain as new tariff regimes and any reciprocal tariffs are deployed. We do know that Mr Trump plans to fully roll out duties, on all goods, against Mexico and Canada from 2 April. But the White House did row back on a threat to double Canada's tariff on its steel and aluminium - the biggest exporter - to 50%. But Mr Trump is also widely expected to target almost all imports from the European Union from the beginning of April.  Is the UK facing further tariffs? Mr Trump has not explicitly said that the UK is in his sights. Data shows no great trade imbalances - the gap between what you import and export from a certain country - and UK figures show no trade deficit with the United States. UK ministers have previously suggested this could be good news for avoiding new levies.  Why tariffs could cost you - even if Trump spares UK Even if no tariffs are put on all UK exports to the US, consumers globally will still be impacted by the wider trade war, particularly in the US. Economists believe that tariffs will raise costs in the US, sparking a wave of inflation that will keep interest rates higher for longer. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is mandated to act to bring inflation down. More expensive borrowing and costlier goods and services could bring about an economic downturn in the US and have knock-on effects in the UK. Forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predict lower UK economic growth due to higher global interest rates. It has estimated that UK GDP (a measure of everything produced in the economy) could be between 2.5% and 3% lower over five years and 0.7% lower this year. The Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy thinktank said a 20% across-the-board tariff, impacting the UK, could lead to a £22bn reduction in the UK's US exports, with the hardest-hit sectors including fishing and mining."

The Demokraatit party won 30% of the vote. It favours a slow move towards independence from Denmark. On the eve of the election, its leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen had told Sky News voters should use the election to warn the US president not to meddle in their future. He said: \"I hope it sends a clear message to him that we are not for sale. \"We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.\" Donald Trump has been actively trying to prise Greenland away from Denmark, urging its people to determine their own future and join the United States. A few days before they went to vote he promised \"billions of dollars\" in investment telling them he will \"make you rich\". \n                  Denmark postal service to stop delivering letters\n                 \n                  Artist abandons plan to starve piglets to death after animals stolen\n                 \n                  Tattoos may be linked to increased risk of cancer, study suggests\n                 The intervention made the election Greenland's most closely watched and highly charged in its history. All its parties advocate independence but differ on how quickly it can happen.  The territory's second opposition party Naleraq made big gains in its share of the vote. It wants a swift move to independence. One candidate, Qupanak Olsen, told Sky News Donald Trump's interference had helped its cause. \"It's making us aware, we are worth more than what the Danish people have been telling us for the last 300 years, maybe we can stand on our own two feet,\" she said. The party's relative success may give Trump and its supporters hope they can do more to encourage independence in the future.  But it's important to stress joining the US is not a popular idea here. Even Ms Olsen rejected any moves towards joining the US, saying Greenland would not swap 300 years of colonialism under Denmark for more of the same under the US. There were bigger issues dominating the election for Greenlanders. Insufficient healthcare, especially for cancer treatment for instance, is a major grievance on this remote but vast island. But for the US president this was all about his neo-imperialist ambitions, openly musing yesterday about erasing borders between the US, Canada and Greenland. Read more on Sky News:Russia firm on ceasefire - latestUK 'disappointed' by tariffsHow Canada is defying Trump His brazen play for Greenland and its vast largely untapped mineral wealth did not go down well among the fiercely independent islanders. President Trump's unashamed meddling has baffled observers. He says Greenland is vital for America's security, and yet the US already has military bases on its territory and has been offered the possibility of building more. Equally, US mining companies have every right to join the effort to extract its huge mineral wealth, as Chinese, European, Canadian and Australian firms have been attempting for decades. It is however not an easy process. Greenland's vast size, lack of roads and Arctic climate are huge challenges. It is as reluctant to yield its mineral riches as it seems its people are to succumb to the advances of a US president. This election shows Donald Trump will have to try harder if he wants to win the affections of Greenland's people and Greenland's elusive natural bounty."

Just hours later, that was revised back down to 25%. There is a grinding, on-off, tit-for-tat nature to these economic punishments. The British Columbia premier David Eby retaliated to the Trump tariffs by prohibiting the sale of American-manufactured alcohol in his province. 'Buy Canadian Instead' BC Liquor Store is just steps away from the premier's office in Victoria. On the shelves where Kentucky bourbon would usually be there are signs saying: \"Buy Canadian Instead.\" Dozens of bottles of California and Oregon wine are wrapped tightly with cellophane. But the threats from the Trump administration don't end with tariffs. The president has stated repeatedly that he's keen to make Canada the 51st state. Even referring to then prime minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\". Premier Eby tells Sky News: \"These are deeply unnerving statements for the president to be making, especially in the context of clearly expansionist policies related to Greenland and the Panama Canal. \"What we get continually about the president is to take him seriously, but not literally. \"I would love to have that kind of luxury… the danger, I think, is not taking him literally and seriously.\" 'I'm trying to buy anything but American' On the ferry which connects Vancouver Island with the mainland, tariff fatigue is setting in. Passenger Nancy, a government worker, says she thinks Donald Trump is intent on causing mayhem. \"He's a menace, he's just creating chaos where it doesn't need to be.\" Her colleague Laura says the silver lining is that the tariffs have galvanised Canadians together. \"People feel hurt and angry,\" she says. \"We are trying to buy more Canadian products and travel anywhere other than the United States. I had a trip booked to Las Vegas and we've cancelled that. When I go to the grocery store, I look for the Canadian maple leaf that a lot of grocery stores have put on the shelves. I'm trying to buy anything but American.\" Richard thinks Donald Trump's end game is to weaken the Canadian economy. \"I think Trump had an agenda from the beginning, without a doubt. I think he wanted to cause a collapse of the Canadian economy so it would make it easier for him and his colleagues to buy up whatever they wanted, if not to make us a 51st state - it had nothing to do with Fentanyl, that was just a ruse.\" Trump's 'fiction' Fentanyl claims  He's referencing the Trump administration's repeated claims that Fentanyl, a devastating opioid that has ravaged parts of both America and Canada, is flooding over the Canadian border into the US. It's the reason, they say, for starting this trade war. Dr M-J Milloy, director of research at British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, says that this simply isn't true. \"There is no one who knows anything about drug markets in North America who would agree with the statement that Canada is a substantial part of the problem in the United States. It is a fiction.\" \"No question that Fentanyl has devastated the United States. Fentanyl is devastating Canada. And so I think in that way, it might be a potent way for Mr Trump to whip up enthusiasm and to justify this aggression,\" he adds. Whatever the reason - invented or otherwise - for this trade war, it's making an enemy of this ally.  The question is, what power does Canada really have in the face of its much bigger, far wealthier neighbour?"

It was rare for Biden officials to appear outside the White House for impromptu moments with reporters.  A large cast of Trump officials are frequently in front of the cameras. That's encouraging. That said accessibility isn't the same as transparency. Just because the officials are out there doesn't mean they welcome robust interrogation. Peter Navarro's pushback at my questions was surprising and revealing. I've questioned him a few times over the past few weeks. His engagement has been calm, but not this time. He was irritated certainly, rattled maybe; wholly unwilling to accept that the markets had reacted negatively to what he called 'Trump-omics'.

Navarro is a long-time aide and confidante of Donald Trump and a true loyalist.  His economic views are well beyond mainstream economic thought. He is a long-time advocate of tariffs with upfront plans to upend the post-WW2 economic system of free trade and international institutions.  Establishment economists consider him to be fringe. That's precisely why he appeals to President Trump.  He was jailed in 2024 for defying a congressional subpoena. He was told to appear before the House Select Committee investigating the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol. He refused to comply.  The committee alleged that he developed plans to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.  The subpoena was motivated by a plan Navarro revealed in a book published in 2021.  \"Green Bay Sweep\" was a plot by he and other Trump loyalists to overturn the 2020 election.  He described it as \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" "

The US president said he did not want \"to do anything to hurt Ireland\" but added that the trade relationship between the countries should be focused on \"fairness\". It comes after the president imposed 25% tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports to the US - prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow and the EU to impose counter tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods from 1 April. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"disappointed\" to see the president impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium and promised to \"keep all options on the table\" in how the UK would respond. During Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Martin, the president raised the \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage of the US. He said the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\". Asked by Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy if Ireland was also taking advantage, Mr Trump replied: \"Of course they are.\" He added: \"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue. \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep options on the table'  Mr Trump said he loves Ireland, where he has a golf course - but said he wishes the US had \"not been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody\". Many US pharmaceutical companies have set up their manufacturing facilities in Ireland due to its low 12.5% corporate tax rate. Irish firms then pay a royalty fee to US parent companies so they can use formulas to make products - meaning Ireland could be the hardest hit EU member by Mr Trump's 25% tariffs. 'I would have imposed 200% tariffs' Mr Trump said if he had been president when those companies started to move to Ireland, he would have imposed a 200% tariff on them so they could not sell anything into the US and they would have \"stayed here\". The president said he would like to see American pharmaceutical companies returning to the US, but expected Mr Martin to \"fight on that issue\". He also told Sky News he would \"absolutely\" place tariffs on cars from the EU. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump  Mr Trump accused previous presidents of having \"lost big segments\" of the US economy and said the EU \"treats us very badly\", referencing a recent ruling against Apple. \"They have not been fair. They sue our companies and win massive amounts of money. They sued Apple, won 17 billion US dollars and they use that for other reasons, I guess, to run the European Union,\" he said. \"So I'm not knocking it. They're doing what they should be doing, perhaps for the European Union, but it does create ill will - and as you know, we're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs so whatever they charge us with, we're charging them. Nobody can complain about that.\" Ireland correspondent Well, that went well. An Oval Office meeting that in any other St Patrick's week would have been regarded as almost unimaginably confrontational – this time around the Irish delegation will be floating on air. Micheal Martin was in the lion's den today, the first leader to step into the Oval Office since Volodymyr Zelenskyy's verbal bloodbath, and you could forgive the Irish PM for being apprehensive. This was always going to be the most important visit of a taoiseach to the White House in generations. What is usually a jovial green-tinged occasion was this year imbued with a new sense of gravity and nervousness.  \n The Irish government knew it was in the president's crosshairs – any small country that boasts a huge trade surplus with the US was bound to be a target for this administration. American figures put that surplus in goods at around €80bn (£67bn) last year, although Irish statisticians insist it was a mere €50bn (£41.9bn) - still a record. In the Oval, I managed to ask the president if Ireland was taking advantage of America. \"Of course they are,\" he replied. But Mr Trump is at heart a businessman, and it sounded more like a sneaking admiration.  \"I have great respect for Ireland, and what they did,\" he said. Ireland did exactly what they should have done, he continued, referencing the luring of lucrative US multinationals. But he placed the blame firmly on \"stupid\" American leaders who \"allowed\" it to happen. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing.  The EU was set up to exploit America, Mr Trump said. It was \"abuse\". Again and again, it was the Brussels bogeyman, not the Emerald Isle, that bore the brunt of his attack.\n I asked if he would respond with more tariffs to the new EU tariffs. \"Of course,\" Mr Trump responded. After an anecdote about the lack of Chevrolets in Munich, I asked would he now consider tariffs on the crucial European car industry – he replied in the affirmative. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing. When the taoiseach did speak, it was to hit the Irish talking points – the Ireland-US relationship was a \"two-way street\", with the Irish currently the sixth-largest investor in the US.\n \"Just look how many Boeings Ryanair is purchasing\" was the theme of Mr Martin's argument. The leaders joked about Mr Martin's boxer father. Mr Trump spoke admiringly of Conor McGregor and Rory McIlroy. The minutes ticked away... Ireland unscathed. They finished with a discussion about the president's Irish resort at Doonbeg in County Clare. Mr Trump lauded the Irish efficiency at approving an expansion plan, and decried the subsequent EU approval period of several years. Once again – Ireland good, Brussels bad.\n There was so much nervousness in Irish government circles. Now they must be wondering what the fuss was all about. 'Great honour' to meet Irish Taoiseach Despite his criticism of Ireland, Mr Trump said it was a \"great honour\" to have the taoiseach at the White House. He said the US has \"tremendous\" business relationships in Ireland \"and that will only get stronger\". The US leader said his personal relationship with Mr Martin was \"very, very strong and very, very good\" as he thanked him for coming to Washington DC to celebrate St Patrick's Day. He added that Mr Martin did not \"look nervous\" about the subject of tariffs during their meeting. Taoiseach reminds Trump of Irish investment in US The taoiseach praised Mr Trump's work on \"peace initiatives\" and said the two countries have a \"very good relationship, a historic one\". But, hinting at the tariffs imposed by Mr Trump, Mr Martin said: \"It's a two-way street. We are investing a lot more in America.\" He said he understands where Mr Trump is coming from, but added that Irish companies Ryanair and aircraft leasing firm Aercap \"buy more Boeing\" planes than anybody else outside the US."

Sky News has learnt that Modella Capital has drafted in advisers from FRP, the professional services firm, to examine potential options including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). CVAs - a widely used tool in the retail and hospitality sectors in recent years - are frequently utilised to facilitate store closures and rent cuts from landlords. Sources close to the Hobbycraft process said on Wednesday that FRP's work was at a very early stage and that no decisions about restructuring measures had been taken. It remained possible that no substantive action would be implemented, they added.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n There was no last minute reprieve. Despite a last ditch phone call to the White House, Keir Starmer was not able to secure concessions for the UK as Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all aluminium and steel coming into the country. The British government has not given up hope. Today, ministers confirmed they would not retaliate. Instead, they called for \"cool heads\", saying they would be taking a \"pragmatic approach\". In the background, the government is still pinning its hopes on a trade deal and a spate of retaliatory tariffs would undermine that effort. Money latest: World retaliates against Trump tariffs Unlike the EU, the UK does not have a trade surplus with the US. It is therefore not in Donald Trump's direct firing line and ministers are hoping they can manoeuvre along the sidelines to secure concessions for the UK. That was something the president was open to during his first term in office. \n                  Tangible Irish relief as Brussels bears brunt of Donald Trump's anger\n                 \n                  Trump fights trade war on multiple fronts as Canada and EU retaliate\n                 \n                  Will Starmer reap the rewards of not retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs?\n                 After imposing tariffs on aluminium and steel imports, Mr Trump eventually granted exemptions to several trading partners, including Canada and Mexico. In 2022, Joe Biden agreed to partially lift Trump's tariffs on UK aluminium and steel.  It might be harder this time round. The president is taking a stronger stance and has already rejected similar pleas from allies, including the Australians. During Trump's first administration, they were successful, arguing that the US had a trade surplus with the country and it provided key materials for the US defence industry. It means the pleas of organisations like UK Steel, the industry trade body, may fall on deaf ears. \"President Trump must surely recognise that the UK is an ally, not a foe. Our steel sector is not a threat to the US but a partner to key customers, sharing the same values and objectives in addressing global overcapacity and tackling unfair trade,\" said Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel.  Trump has repeatedly criticised China for dumping cheap steel in the global market to beat competitors. This is an issue the UK industry has been railing against too. While Donald Trump's latest bout of tariffs do discriminate, imposing a higher levy on China, no one has escaped scot-free. The US is the UK's second largest steel export market. Tariffs will undoubtedly hurt an industry and a workforce that is already struggling with the transition to green manufacturing. Mr Stace added: \"These tariffs couldn't come at a worse time for the UK steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape.\" Read more:How Canadians are responding to tariffsUK must avoid 'knee-jerk' response to tariffs The industry fears higher US tariffs will lead to a drop in orders, meaning the UK would have to soak up the global surplus in steel, driving prices down even further. It could also hurt consumers. Higher US manufacturing costs could drive up global prices. That's something the British Chambers of Commerce has sounded the alarm over. \"Tariffs mean prices and costs will inevitably go up and this is a lose-lose scenario for consumers, businesses, and economic growth,\" it declared."

        "Content": "\n          Social affairs and health reporter\n              @megbaynes\n Thousands of drivers may have been put on a higher interest rate without realising when buying a car on finance. Some dealers or brokers earned a better rate of commission if car buyers were placed on higher interest rates. The latest news from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would mean banks would be forced to proactively tell customers if they had been mis-sold car finance. In a recent Court of Appeal case, three people claimed they hadn't been aware of this when they purchased their vehicles. Read more from the Sky News Money blog The ensuing scandal could end up costing lenders hundreds of millions of pounds to rectify. Here's everything you need to know about it. \n                  Video shows moment container ship crashes into US oil tanker in North Sea\n                 \n                  Starmer 'disappointed' about Trump steel tariffs and says 'all options on the table'\n                 \n                  Non-verbal teenager who wrote a book with his eyes says he's 'voice of the voiceless'\n                 The car finance scandal - what exactly happened? When you buy a car on finance, you are effectively loaned the money, which you pay off in monthly instalments. These loans carry interest, organised by the brokers (the people who sell you the finance plan). These brokers earn money in the form of a commission (which is a percentage of the interest payments). Before January 2021, some car finance lenders had what was called a \"discretionary commission arrangement\" (DCA) with brokers. Under these arrangements, brokers earned more commission if buyers were put onto a higher interest rate - this incentivised sellers to maximise interest rates, which meant many were unfairly charged too much. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned this practice in 2021, but a high number of consumers have complained they were overcharged before the ban came into place. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) has 20,000 open complaints they are dealing with. What is the investigation? In January 2024, the FCA announced a review into whether motor finance customers had been overcharged because of past use of DCAs. They paused the eight-week deadline for firms to respond to complaints and are now assessing thousands of records spanning 14 years. The FCA is using powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to review historical motor finance commission arrangements across multiple firms - all of whom deny they have acted inappropriately. The FCA is now looking into a \"consumer redress scheme\" to see if this is a better way of compensating people en masse. What is the latest development? In March, the financial conduct authority said it will announce its decision on a redress scheme - which would mean lenders would have to proactively decide if customers had been affected - within six weeks of a decision following a landmark supreme court hearing early next month. This would mean individuals wouldn't need to complain, but they would be paid out an amount dictated by the FCA. What's happening next? The Court of Appeal ruling (which sided with the consumers) has set a precedent for the industry by ruling that any dealers receiving commission from lenders must ensure their customers are fully informed about the arrangement. This ruling is being disputed by multiple lenders, including Santander and Lloyds, but could see big changes in the industry as well as a large influx of complaints. The FCA will publish the findings of its investigation in May 2025, as well as outlining the next steps. That will be published on the FCA website. How to tell if you have been affected Motor finance serves over two million consumers a year, and the FCA says you may have been affected if you: Firms involved include Barclays, Santander, Close Brothers and Lloyds Banking Group (which organises loans through its Black Horse finance arm - and also happens to be the UK's largest motor finance provider). These lenders have been warned to set aside money to deal with claims. Read more from Sky News Money:How to tell if you have 'money dysmorphia''I work 34 hours a week and regularly finish at 1.30pm'Can my boss take a cut of our tips? Lloyds has already set aside £450m to cover compensation payments. If you aren't sure, you can write to the broker and lender - Which? has a handy template letter you can use. Okay, so I am affected - what do I do now? If you find you have been mis-sold, the first step is to contact the firm that sold you the car finance product. Wait for its final response, and if you are not happy with what they say, escalate it to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The FCA has suspended the eight-week deadline for providers to get back to you, so you may find yourself waiting a little while. But they have also extended the deadline for you to refer your complaint to the ombudsman - you now have 15 months rather than six months after getting your final response. Be wary of claim management firms - there are plenty of adverts on social media encouraging drivers to enlist their services. If you use one of these services, you will have to give part of any payout to the firm. But there is no reason you can't manage it yourself, using the steps above. How much compensation could you be due? In one ombudsman case, the driver was found to have been charged interest of 5.5% when it could have been sold at 2.49%. The lender was told to pay the difference between payments, plus 8% interest on each overpayment."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs have come into effect. But what are they and what do they mean for the UK? What are tariffs and why does Trump want to impose them? Tariffs are taxes on goods imported into the US. The US president wants to impose wide-ranging tariffs on nearest neighbours Mexico and Canada, which he says will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. However, most of the 25% duties imposed on the pair to date have been suspended until 2 April. But two rounds of tariffs on China have been enacted - reflecting trade imbalances and Mr Trump's battle against fentanyl. So why is he now targeting steel and aluminium? On Wednesday, a separate 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports to the US came into effect, affecting UK products worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The steel and aluminium tariffs are designed to protect US manufacturing and bolster jobs by making foreign-made products less attractive. The world's largest economy relies on imports of steel and aluminium and Mr Trump wants to change that. How have countries - including the UK - reacted? The European Union has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on the US. The European Commission said it will impose \"countermeasures\" affecting €26bn (£21.9bn) of US goods from 1 April after US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into force today. The bloc's tariffs will not only impact US steel and aluminium products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods.  Canada has announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth C$29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow, its country's finance minister has said. The tariffs will include steel products worth C$12.6bn (£6.8bn) and aluminium products worth C$3bn (£1.6bn). Computers, sports equipment and cast iron goods are also among the other products subject to the new retaliatory tariffs. Announcing the tariffs, Canada's foreign minister, Melanie Joly, added that Canada will raise the issues of tariffs with European allies to coordinate a response to put pressure on the US.  While UK industry sees it as a direct attack, the reality is that this country is not a major player any more because energy costs, in particular, mean that UK-produced steel is expensive. Nevertheless, stainless steel and some high-end products from the UK are in high demand and account for the bulk of the £350m in annual exports to the US. Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"disappointed\" to see Mr Trump impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium, saying the UK will take a \"pragmatic approach\" and \"all options are on the table\". The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said on Wednesday morning that while he was disappointed, there would be no immediate retaliation by the UK government as negotiations continue over a wider trade deal with the US. Why will metal products become more expensive? It stands to reason that if you slap additional costs on importers in the US, that cost will be passed on down the supply chain to the end user. If the aluminium to make soft drinks cans costs 25% more, for example, then the hit will have to be felt somewhere. It could mean that any US product involving steel or aluminium goes up in price, but hikes could be limited if companies decide to take some of the burden in their bottom lines. Read more on tariffs:It may be harder for the UK to trump metals tariffs this time round'Canadianos' and cancelled Vegas trips: How Canadians are acting with defiance What are the prospects for higher prices? It depends on the extent to which costs are passed down through the supply chain as new tariff regimes and any reciprocal tariffs are deployed. We do know that Mr Trump plans to fully roll out duties, on all goods, against Mexico and Canada from 2 April. But the White House did row back on a threat to double Canada's tariff on its steel and aluminium - the biggest exporter - to 50%. But Mr Trump is also widely expected to target almost all imports from the European Union from the beginning of April.  Is the UK facing further tariffs? Mr Trump has not explicitly said that the UK is in his sights. Data shows no great trade imbalances - the gap between what you import and export from a certain country - and UK figures show no trade deficit with the United States. UK ministers have previously suggested this could be good news for avoiding new levies.  Why tariffs could cost you - even if Trump spares UK Even if no tariffs are put on all UK exports to the US, consumers globally will still be impacted by the wider trade war, particularly in the US. Economists believe that tariffs will raise costs in the US, sparking a wave of inflation that will keep interest rates higher for longer. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is mandated to act to bring inflation down. More expensive borrowing and costlier goods and services could bring about an economic downturn in the US and have knock-on effects in the UK. Forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predict lower UK economic growth due to higher global interest rates. It has estimated that UK GDP (a measure of everything produced in the economy) could be between 2.5% and 3% lower over five years and 0.7% lower this year. The Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy thinktank said a 20% across-the-board tariff, impacting the UK, could lead to a £22bn reduction in the UK's US exports, with the hardest-hit sectors including fishing and mining."

They are quiet but considered acts of defiance in the face of a trade war started by the United States. \"It is a small protest in the form of a coffee,\" he says. \"What we can do is hope that they don't follow up with all of this madness.\" Tuesday began with Donald Trump announcing a 50% tariff on aluminium and steel coming from Canada. Just hours later, that was revised back down to 25%. There is a grinding, on-off, tit-for-tat nature to these economic punishments. The British Columbia premier David Eby retaliated to the Trump tariffs by prohibiting the sale of American-manufactured alcohol in his province. 'Buy Canadian Instead' BC Liquor Store is just steps away from the premier's office in Victoria. On the shelves where Kentucky bourbon would usually be there are signs saying: \"Buy Canadian Instead.\" Dozens of bottles of California and Oregon wine are wrapped tightly with cellophane. But the threats from the Trump administration don't end with tariffs. The president has stated repeatedly that he's keen to make Canada the 51st state. Even referring to then prime minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\". Premier Eby tells Sky News: \"These are deeply unnerving statements for the president to be making, especially in the context of clearly expansionist policies related to Greenland and the Panama Canal. \"What we get continually about the president is to take him seriously, but not literally. \"I would love to have that kind of luxury… the danger, I think, is not taking him literally and seriously.\" 'I'm trying to buy anything but American' On the ferry which connects Vancouver Island with the mainland, tariff fatigue is setting in. Passenger Nancy, a government worker, says she thinks Donald Trump is intent on causing mayhem. \"He's a menace, he's just creating chaos where it doesn't need to be.\" Her colleague Laura says the silver lining is that the tariffs have galvanised Canadians together. \"People feel hurt and angry,\" she says. \"We are trying to buy more Canadian products and travel anywhere other than the United States. I had a trip booked to Las Vegas and we've cancelled that. When I go to the grocery store, I look for the Canadian maple leaf that a lot of grocery stores have put on the shelves. I'm trying to buy anything but American.\" Richard thinks Donald Trump's end game is to weaken the Canadian economy. \"I think Trump had an agenda from the beginning, without a doubt. I think he wanted to cause a collapse of the Canadian economy so it would make it easier for him and his colleagues to buy up whatever they wanted, if not to make us a 51st state - it had nothing to do with Fentanyl, that was just a ruse.\" Trump's 'fiction' Fentanyl claims  He's referencing the Trump administration's repeated claims that Fentanyl, a devastating opioid that has ravaged parts of both America and Canada, is flooding over the Canadian border into the US. It's the reason, they say, for starting this trade war. Dr M-J Milloy, director of research at British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, says that this simply isn't true. \"There is no one who knows anything about drug markets in North America who would agree with the statement that Canada is a substantial part of the problem in the United States. It is a fiction.\" \"No question that Fentanyl has devastated the United States. Fentanyl is devastating Canada. And so I think in that way, it might be a potent way for Mr Trump to whip up enthusiasm and to justify this aggression,\" he adds. Whatever the reason - invented or otherwise - for this trade war, it's making an enemy of this ally.  The question is, what power does Canada really have in the face of its much bigger, far wealthier neighbour?"

There is much debate about who is in the driving seat - the US president or CEO of Tesla? But for now at least, the relationship between them seems as invincible as a Cybertruck."

The prime minister said: \"Obviously, like everybody else, I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium. \"But we will take a pragmatic approach. We are, as he knows, negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table.\" Asked if he will fly out to Canada to stand with it \"against Trump's threats\", given it has borne the brunt of Mr Trump's trade war, Sir Keir said the country is \"an important ally\" but did not commit to a visit. \n                  Ousted Reform MP Rupert Lowe consulting lawyers over libel action, Sky News understands \n                 \n                  Politics latest: Cabinet minister apologises in Commons for 'inadvertently' claiming to be a solicitor\n                 \n                  Nicola Sturgeon announces she will not seek re-election to Holyrood next year\n                 The global tariffs came into effect at midnight in the US, around 4am UK time, imposing a flat duty on steel and aluminium entering America of 25%. The move is designed to protect US manufacturing and bolster jobs by making foreign-made products less attractive. It is a threat to UK steel exports - worth more than £350m annually, with the bulk of that coming from stainless steel. The tariffs also risk making the cost of things from cars to soft drink cans, and therefore some drinks, more expensive. Canada is the biggest exporter of both steel and aluminium to America. However, the White House on Tuesday rowed back on a threat to double the levy to 50%, after the provincial government of Ontario halted a plan to charge 25% more for electricity it supplies to over 1.5 million US homes and businesses.  Some countries have already retaliated, with the EU announcing €26bn-worth of counter tariffs on US goods, starting from 1 April. However, Treasury minister James Murray warned earlier today against a \"knee jerk\" response. He told Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast : \"We're in a very different position than the EU, as a result of the prime minister's trip to Washington last month. \"The UK and the US have been negotiating rapidly for an economic agreement, and so we're in a position where that negotiation is ongoing and these global tariffs have landed in the middle of that work.\" Sir Keir was widely praised following a successful trip to Washington in February, during which Mr Trump said there was a \"very good chance\" of a trade deal with the UK that would not involve tariffs. Money blog: World retaliates against Trump tariffs  It sparked hopes the UK could be exempt from future levies being planned by the US president. Speaking to journalists after Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir's official spokesperson denied being snubbed, saying \"obviously these are global tariffs, not targeted at the UK\". Asked whether the economic deal planned between the US and UK would cover steel and aluminium, the spokesman said he was \"not going to get ahead of those discussions\". Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds will discuss the deal in Washington DC next week, which the government has previously suggested will be focused mainly on technology co-operation. Making \"progress\" on that deal will be the aim of those discussions, the PM's spokesperson said, adding that the steel industry \"has been clear\" they don't want to engage in an escalating trade war with the US."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Rupert Lowe is consulting lawyers about taking possible libel action against Reform UK, Sky News understands. The Great Yarmouth MP has accused the party of making \"untrue and false allegations\" about him after he criticised leader Nigel Farage in the media, sparking a bitter public row. Politics Live: Starmer promises to 'keep all options on the table' after UK hit by Trump tariffs on steel A day after the 67-year-old questioned whether Mr Farage could make it as prime minister, Reform UK announced on Friday it had referred him to police and suspended him, alleging he made \"verbal threats\" against chairman Zia Yousaf. The Met has launched an investigation into these claims, which Mr Lowe has vehemently denied. Reform has also claimed it has received complaints from two female employees about serious bullying in Mr Lowe's constituency office. The now independent MP has strenuously denied these claims as well, saying the allegations do not relate to him and were made by staff who themselves faced disciplinary action. Mr Lowe believes he is the victim of a \"witch hunt\" after speaking out against the party's leadership in an interview with the Daily Mail that was published last week, in which he challenged Mr Farage's \"messianic\" tendencies. He has not ruled out joining the Conservatives or another political party, while Mr Farage has said there is \"no way back\" for the suspended MP and accused him of being \"out to cause maximum damage\" to Reform UK.  The feud could deepen still with Mr Lowe now mulling legal action over claims made about him during the ongoing war of words, it is understood. The former Southampton FC chairman has accused Mr Farage of spreading \"outright lies\" after he told GB News that he \"knows for a fact\" Mr Lowe was informed of a parliamentary investigation into bullying allegations on 29 Feb and gave an interview with the Mail \"shortly after that\". According to the Mail, the interview was held on 25 February - days before Mr Lowe received a letter from Reform's chief whip Lee Anderson informing him of concerns over his conduct. The letter, seen by Sky News, was from Reform rather than parliament and says the parliamentary party has determined an independent investigation is the best course of action. Read More:Starmer 'disappointed' about Trump steel tariffsLabour MPs criticise impending benefit cuts Mr Lowe has urged Mr Farage to \"apologise, retract and correct the record,\" posting on X: \"To suggest I used the interview to deflect from any investigation is factually untrue. I have heard absolutely nothing from parliament about any of this.\" Mr Lowe also denies claims made by Mr Anderson that he has not co-operated with the independent inquiry into his behaviour. Last night, seven members of his team put their names on a statement coming to Mr Lowe's defence, saying he is a \"good, decent and honest man\", that they have never witnessed \"violent or vicious\" behaviour and allegations of bullying are \"robustly denied by all of us\". Sky News has contacted Reform UK for comment. The row poses danger for a party that has its sights on entering government at the next election after a meteoric rise in the polls. In his interview with the Mail, Mr Lowe said it was \"too early to know\" if Mr Farage will become prime minister and warned Reform remains a \"protest party led by the Messiah\" under the Clacton MP. He also claimed that he was \"barely six months into being an MP\" himself and \"in the betting to be the next prime minister\". During Mr Farage's online falling out with Elon Musk, in which he said Reform needed a new leader, Mr Lowe drew praise from the Space X billionaire. In a move seen as a hint of a new splinter group, another ousted Reform UK politician, former deputy leader Ben Habib, told The Daily Telegraph that Mr Lowe was a \"good friend\" and he was \"constantly in touch with\" him."

In a post on Instagram, Ms Sturgeon added: \"However, I have known in my heart for a while that the time is right for me to embrace different opportunities in a new chapter of my life. \"I have therefore written this morning to SNP members in my constituency informing them that I will not be seeking selection for next year's Holyrood election.\" Ms Sturgeon thanked past and present constituents for the \"trust\" they had placed in her.

She succeeded the late Alex Salmond as first minister of Scotland after his resignation in 2014 following the results of the Scottish independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon was the first woman to hold both positions of SNP leader and first minister, and was the longest-serving first minister in Scottish history until her shock resignation in 2023. During her time in charge, she led Scotland's response to the COVID pandemic, and was responsible for setting up the nation's devolved benefits agency. When she stepped down, Ms Sturgeon denied controversy surrounding the Scottish government's Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill had played a part in her decision. In the weeks leading up to her departure, there had been a public outcry over transgender double rapist Isla Bryson being housed in an all-female prison before swiftly being moved to the male estate. In April 2023, her husband - and former SNP chief executive - Peter Murrell was arrested in relation to a police probe into the SNP's funding and finances. He was later charged with embezzling party funds. Ms Sturgeon and ex-party treasurer MSP Colin Beattie were also arrested and released without charge as part of Police Scotland's long-running Operation Branchform. The probe, which has been ongoing since July 2021, is linked to the spending of around £600,000 raised by SNP supporters to be earmarked for Scottish independence campaigning. Ms Sturgeon continues to deny any wrongdoing. Earlier this year, Ms Sturgeon announced she and Mr Murrell had \"decided to end\" their marriage. Ms Sturgeon is expected to release a book about her life and political career this summer. First Minister John Swinney paid tribute to his friend and colleague. He said: \"I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Nicola for all of the contributions that she has made to the work of parliament and government, and I'm certain she will continue to do so in the years to come, in different ways to contribute to the public life of Scotland. \"She's got so many different policy achievements to be proud of in changing the lives of people in Scotland for the better. And I wish her well for the future.\" MSP Rachael Hamilton, deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: \"We wish any departing MSP well, regardless of their party or politics. \"But we cannot forget the deep divisions in our country that Nicola Sturgeon created, fostered and encouraged. \"By any objective analysis, her record as first minister is one of failure. Scottish education standards collapsed on her watch and the poverty-related attainment gap, which she promised to eradicate, widened. \"She presided over a drugs-death emergency, a ferries scandal, a crisis in our NHS, crumbling roads - and all while raising taxes on hard-working Scots, which stifled economic growth. \"Her reckless gender self-ID policy betrayed women, her soft-touch approach to justice betrayed victims and her shameful deletion of COVID WhatsApp messages denied bereaved families answers and highlighted the secrecy and cynicism that characterised her government.\""

That, at least, is one of the motivations behind his decision to weaponise tariffs, with a trade war now enveloping the UK as well. From 4am on Wednesday, a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from anywhere outside the US is being imposed. Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep all options on the table' A president protecting the Rustbelt. Or is it? What makes Mr Trump's approach to tariffs so unusual is he is open - more open than any US president I can remember - that it's also about the politics. Tariffs are his negotiating tactic of choice. His most beautiful word. They get lowered if you do deals with him. They get raised if you anger him, like Canada did. Remember that when thinking about the role of the EU over Ukraine days after their retaliation. And it's more politics than economics - because it's not immediately clear that what Mr Trump is doing helps US citizens. The tariff is a form of import tax. They are collected by the US government and the cash goes into the coffers of the US Treasury as goods go through customs. The business doing the importing pays the tax, but the costs will be passed on. Hurting some American firms. What's more, think tanks say his overall tariff plan could damage the economy and knock a percentage point off US GDP in a year. Is this really making America great? Has the UK responded? Not really. A stern message from the business secretary issued this morning, and he'll head to the US next week. In the longer term, striking some form of US-UK trade deal seems the only way out - but that won't be quick. What could we be doing? Well, this is how the EU reacted: £21bn of tit-for-tat sanctions from 1 April. If we were still in the EU, we'd have had to do this. Only because we're not, and outside the customs union, are we able to do something different in the name of diplomacy. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Sir Keir Starmer said at Prime Minister's Questions that all options are on the table - but don't expect an imminent flip of strategy to something resembling the EU approach. But who is right? Well, let's be honest - this isn't about us. Look at the data from the US Department of Commerce - the UK is the 17th biggest exporter of steel to the US - more than 20 times less than the biggest, which is Canada. Could the UK even achieve its aims by retaliating, given the differential in scale? Read more:Starmer 'disappointed' about Trump steel tariffsHow will Trump's tariffs affect the UK?

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the EU during a meeting with Irish premier Micheal Martin in the Oval Office. The US president said he did not want \"to do anything to hurt Ireland\" but added that the trade relationship between the countries should be focused on \"fairness\". It comes after the president imposed 25% tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports to the US - prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $29.8bn (£16bn) from tomorrow and the EU to impose counter tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods from 1 April. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"disappointed\" to see the president impose global tariffs on steel and aluminium and promised to \"keep all options on the table\" in how the UK would respond. During Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Martin, the president raised the \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and said Ireland was \"of course\" taking advantage of the US. He said the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\". Asked by Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy if Ireland was also taking advantage, Mr Trump replied: \"Of course they are.\" He added: \"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue. \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Politics latest: Starmer promises to 'keep options on the table'  Mr Trump said he loves Ireland, where he has a golf course - but said he wishes the US had \"not been so stupid for so many years, not just with Ireland, with everybody\". Many US pharmaceutical companies have set up their manufacturing facilities in Ireland due to its low 12.5% corporate tax rate. Irish firms then pay a royalty fee to US parent companies so they can use formulas to make products - meaning Ireland could be the hardest hit EU member by Mr Trump's 25% tariffs. 'I would have imposed 200% tariffs' Mr Trump said if he had been president when those companies started to move to Ireland, he would have imposed a 200% tariff on them so they could not sell anything into the US and they would have \"stayed here\". The president said he would like to see American pharmaceutical companies returning to the US, but expected Mr Martin to \"fight on that issue\". He also told Sky News he would \"absolutely\" place tariffs on cars from the EU. Read more:What are Trump's tariffs and how will they affect the UK?The man Canada is sending to battle Trump  Mr Trump accused previous presidents of having \"lost big segments\" of the US economy and said the EU \"treats us very badly\", referencing a recent ruling against Apple. \"They have not been fair. They sue our companies and win massive amounts of money. They sued Apple, won 17 billion US dollars and they use that for other reasons, I guess, to run the European Union,\" he said. \"So I'm not knocking it. They're doing what they should be doing, perhaps for the European Union, but it does create ill will - and as you know, we're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs so whatever they charge us with, we're charging them. Nobody can complain about that.\" Ireland correspondent Well, that went well. An Oval Office meeting that in any other St Patrick's week would have been regarded as almost unimaginably confrontational – this time around the Irish delegation will be floating on air. Micheal Martin was in the lion's den today, the first leader to step into the Oval Office since Volodymyr Zelenskyy's verbal bloodbath, and you could forgive the Irish PM for being apprehensive. This was always going to be the most important visit of a taoiseach to the White House in generations. What is usually a jovial green-tinged occasion was this year imbued with a new sense of gravity and nervousness.  \n The Irish government knew it was in the president's crosshairs – any small country that boasts a huge trade surplus with the US was bound to be a target for this administration. American figures put that surplus in goods at around €80bn (£67bn) last year, although Irish statisticians insist it was a mere €50bn (£41.9bn) - still a record. In the Oval, I managed to ask the president if Ireland was taking advantage of America. \"Of course they are,\" he replied. But Mr Trump is at heart a businessman, and it sounded more like a sneaking admiration.  \"I have great respect for Ireland, and what they did,\" he said. Ireland did exactly what they should have done, he continued, referencing the luring of lucrative US multinationals. But he placed the blame firmly on \"stupid\" American leaders who \"allowed\" it to happen. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing.  The EU was set up to exploit America, Mr Trump said. It was \"abuse\". Again and again, it was the Brussels bogeyman, not the Emerald Isle, that bore the brunt of his attack.\n I asked if he would respond with more tariffs to the new EU tariffs. \"Of course,\" Mr Trump responded. After an anecdote about the lack of Chevrolets in Munich, I asked would he now consider tariffs on the crucial European car industry – he replied in the affirmative. Mr Martin sat beside him, saying nothing. When the taoiseach did speak, it was to hit the Irish talking points – the Ireland-US relationship was a \"two-way street\", with the Irish currently the sixth-largest investor in the US.\n \"Just look how many Boeings Ryanair is purchasing\" was the theme of Mr Martin's argument. The leaders joked about Mr Martin's boxer father. Mr Trump spoke admiringly of Conor McGregor and Rory McIlroy. The minutes ticked away... Ireland unscathed. They finished with a discussion about the president's Irish resort at Doonbeg in County Clare. Mr Trump lauded the Irish efficiency at approving an expansion plan, and decried the subsequent EU approval period of several years. Once again – Ireland good, Brussels bad.\n There was so much nervousness in Irish government circles. Now they must be wondering what the fuss was all about. 'Great honour' to meet Irish Taoiseach Despite his criticism of Ireland, Mr Trump said it was a \"great honour\" to have the taoiseach at the White House. He said the US has \"tremendous\" business relationships in Ireland \"and that will only get stronger\". The US leader said his personal relationship with Mr Martin was \"very, very strong and very, very good\" as he thanked him for coming to Washington DC to celebrate St Patrick's Day. He added that Mr Martin did not \"look nervous\" about the subject of tariffs during their meeting. Taoiseach reminds Trump of Irish investment in US The taoiseach praised Mr Trump's work on \"peace initiatives\" and said the two countries have a \"very good relationship, a historic one\". But, hinting at the tariffs imposed by Mr Trump, Mr Martin said: \"It's a two-way street. We are investing a lot more in America.\" He said he understands where Mr Trump is coming from, but added that Irish companies Ryanair and aircraft leasing firm Aercap \"buy more Boeing\" planes than anybody else outside the US."

The prime minister is set to announce major reforms to the way the state works to \"deliver for working people\" and to ensure security in the new global \"era of instability\". His \"intervention\" will come following reports officials are drawing up plans to cut thousands of civil service jobs as part of proposals dubbed \"Project Chainsaw\" - a reference to Elon Musk waving a chainsaw to represent his crusade to cut US government spending. Downing Street on Wednesday rejected claims the government is \"taking a chainsaw to the system\", saying it is focusing on \"making the state more effective, more agile in a way that delivers for working people\". The prime minister will set out proposals to recruit 2,000 tech apprentices to \"turbo charge\" the take-up of AI in Whitehall with the aim of modernising departments and making sure the government has the skills to overhaul public services using technology.

On Monday, Sky News revealed the department for science, innovation and technology had carried out a trial using AI to reduce the number of minutes the public spends on hold to access government services. The trial found waiting times could be cut in half by using AI, with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle saying the technology was a win-win as it will save taxpayers' money and make the experience better.  On Thursday's announcement, Mr Kyle said: \"There is a £45bn jackpot to secure if we use technology properly across our public sector - but we can't hope to come close to securing that if we don't have the right technical talent with us in government. \"Not only will these changes help fix our public services, but it will save taxpayer cash by slashing the need for thousands of expensive contractors and create opportunities across the country across the country as part of our plan for change.\""

        "Content": "Children under the age of eight should not consume slushies due to the ingredient glycerol potentially making them ill, new research has suggested. Researchers at University College Dublin said the brightly coloured icy drinks can cause \"glycerol intoxication syndrome\" in youngsters, which leads to loss of consciousness and low blood sugar. Other potential symptoms of \"glycerol intoxication syndrome\" can include lactic acidosis - which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid - and hypokalaemia, or low potassium. Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slush drinks maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid. While glycerol is found in some other foods, it is added at much lower quantities than in slush ice drinks. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) currently advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol. It also recommends children between five and 10 are limited to no more than one slushie a day. But researchers have urged those under eight years of age to avoid them altogether. \"Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol,\" the review, published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, states. Researchers added that \"there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks\" and \"they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet\". The study looked at the medical notes of 21 children aged between two and seven in the UK and Ireland who fell ill after consuming the drinks between 2009 and 2024. All the youngsters needed treatment in accident and emergency (A&E) departments, with 14 of the children becoming unwell within an hour of drinking a slushie. All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with advice not to drink slushies, according to the study. Read more from Sky News:The children's home run by a 'cult-like' groupThe furious rise of climate whiplash Only one child from the group did not follow the advice and once again developed symptoms an hour after drinking a slushie at the age of seven. Researchers said there is currently \"poor transparency\" around slush ice drink glycerol concentration, so estimating a safe dose is not easy. They said factors including speed of ingestion and whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during high-intensity exercise may be contributing factors."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        You have to have a thick skin to take part in Eurovision which might be why last year's UK entrant, singer Olly Alexander, has already reached out to this year's hopefuls to talk about the pitfalls of putting yourself out there. Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull, and Charlotte Steele - members of the country-pop girl group Remember Monday - say they plan to get a drink date with the Years And Years singer before they perform in the contest in May. Lauren says they had a \"lovely chat\" with Olly, and \"drinks are pending\" after he \"reached out to us and has sent his well-wishes and given us some advice\". Of course, positivity is a must if you are the UK's Eurovision entrant (Olly only managed 18th place) and thankfully Remember Monday have quite a history of setting their critics to music, performing medleys on TikTok of some of their trolls' funniest comments. \"Some people, you just won't be their cup of tea, so, yeah, we started kind of singing those insults,\" Lauren explains. Holly-Anne says the overall reaction to their song What The Hell Just Happened has been \"overwhelmingly positive\", admitting they have been \"taken aback by how kind and positive everyone's been\". So who are this trio? Well, they have a background in musical theatre and have known each other for years. \n                  Remember Monday announced as UK's Eurovision 2025 act\n                 \n                  Malta's Eurovision entry censored over song's 'appropriateness'\n                 \n                  Eurovision: Hamas 7 October attack survivor to represent Israel\n                 As Holly-Anne explains: \"We met at sixth form college, we were all in the same performing arts class. \"We were kind of known as the three girls that constantly sang every genre, everything, and I guess that's kind of still what we're doing. \"Our teachers constantly would knock on the door. I think we had an A level final paper due or something… which was not even slightly a priority. The priority was getting an incredible cover of My Milkshake Brings All The Boys To The Yard down pat,\" she laughs. Like former UK runner-up Sam Ryder, they have already got a huge fanbase of over half a million followers on TikTok, which has to be a help in terms of winning votes. Although the girls are big fans of Bucks Fizz's \"iconic\" 80s performance, they say they've no plans to rip off their skirts on the big night. Charlotte refuses to say much about the staging itself, but adds that \"we are all from theatre backgrounds and I think that you can definitely expect some theatrics\". Holly-Anne says they have \"some incredible people working with us in terms of creative direction and styling. \"We just can't wait for everyone to see it.\" Eurovision being non-political did not stop politics creeping its way into last year's event with several of the finalists referring to ongoing global disputes in the build-up. This year, between the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, it's hard to imagine we will not see similar scenes. But Lauren hopes the peaceful message at the show's heart remains the focus, as Eurovision \"was designed to bring people together and bring countries together and celebrate artists from all around the world. \"So we're just really looking forward to doing that and celebrating, you know, the music and the artistry that we get to kind of witness.\" Around 200 million viewers are expected to watch the competition, which is taking place in the Swiss city of Basel, where Remember Monday take on 36 other hopefuls.

While they look cool, calm and can't stop singing now, Charlotte says to start worrying if they go quiet nearer the time, as the marker of them feeling nervous is \"we go completely silent, like right before we go on stage. \"If we're nervous, you will be able to tell…but hopefully not on stage.\""
