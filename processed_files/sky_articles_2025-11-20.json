        "Content": "\n          Reporter\n              @ClaireGilbodyD\n  All four UK governments failed to appreciate the scale of the threat posed by COVID-19 or the urgency of the response the pandemic required, a damning report published on Thursday has claimed. Baroness Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, described the response to the pandemic as \"too little, too late\". Tens of thousands of lives could have been saved during the first wave of COVID-19 had a mandatory lockdown been introduced a week earlier, the inquiry also found. Noting how a \"lack of urgency\" made a mandatory lockdown \"inevitable\", the report references modelling data to claim there could have been 23,000 fewer deaths during the first wave in England had it been introduced a week earlier. The UK government first introduced advisory restrictions on 16 March 2020, including self-isolation, household quarantine and social distancing. Had these measures been introduced sooner, the report states, the mandatory lockdown which followed from 23 March might not have been necessary at all.  COVID-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and as it developed into a worldwide pandemic, the UK went in and out of unprecedented lockdown measures for two years starting from March 2020. \n                  The realities of the COVID classroom that Boris Johnson will need to explain\n                 \n                  'Many mistakes' were made over COVID school closures, former education secretary Gavin Williamson says\n                 \n                  Duchess of York offered to help secure PPE early in COVID-19 pandemic, inquiry hears\n                 Lady Hallett admitted in her summary that politicians in the government and devolved administrations were forced to make decisions where \"there was often no right answer or good outcome\". \"Nonetheless,\" she said, \"I can summarise my findings of the response as 'too little, too late'\". Health correspondent This scathing report goes a long way to answer the Covid 19 Inquiry's critics who have consistently attacked it as a costly waste of time.  They tried to undermine Lady Hallet's attempt to understand what went wrong and how we might do better as a lame exercise that would achieve very little.  Well, we now know that Boris Johnson’s \"toxic and chaotic\" government could well have prevented at least 23,000 deaths had they acted sooner and with greater urgency. The response was \"too little, too late\".  And that nobody in power truly understood the scale of the emerging threat or the urgency of the response it required.  The grieving families who lost loved ones in the pandemic want answers. They want names. And they want accountability.  But that is beyond the remit of this Inquiry. The publication of the report into Module 2 will bring them no comfort, it may even cause them more distress but it will bring them closer to understanding why the UK's response to this unprecedented health crisis was so poor.  And we can easily identify the \"advisors and ministers whose alleged rule breaking caused huge distress and undermined public confidence\".  Or who was in charge of the Department of Health and Social Care, as it misled the public by giving the impression that the UK was well prepared for the pandemic when it clearly was not.  'Toxic culture' at the heart of UK government The report said there was \"a toxic and chaotic culture\" at the heart of the UK government during the pandemic. The inquiry heard evidence about the \"destabilising behaviour of a number of individuals\" - including former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings. It said that by failing to tackle this chaotic culture - \"and, at times, actively encouraging it\" - former PM Boris Johnson \"reinforced a culture in which the loudest voices prevailed and the views of other colleagues, particularly women, often went ignored, to the detriment of good decision-making\". 'Misleading assurances' The inquiry found all four governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland failed to understand the urgency of response the pandemic demanded in the early part of 2020. The report reads: \"This was compounded, in part, by misleading assurances from the Department of Health and Social Care and the widely held view that the UK was well prepared for a pandemic.\" The report notes how the UK government took a \"high risk\" when it significantly eased restrictions in England in July 2020 - \"despite scientific advisers' concerns about the public health risks of doing so\". Lady Hallett has made 19 key recommendations which, if followed, she believes will better protect the UK in any future pandemic and improve decision-making in a crisis. Repeated failings 'inexcusable' In a statement following the publication of Thursday's report, Lady Hallett said there was a \"serious failure\" by all four governments to appreciate the level of \"risk and calamity\" facing the UK. She said: \"The tempo of the response should have been increased. It was not. February 2020 was a lost month.\" Read more:A timeline of the UK's response to the pandemic Lady Hallett said the inquiry does not advocate for national lockdowns, which she said should have been avoided if at all possible. She said: \"But to avoid them, governments must take timely and decisive action to control a spreading virus. The four governments of the UK did not.\" Lady Hallett said none of the governments were adequately prepared for the challenges and risks that a lockdown presented, and that many of the same failings were repeated later in 2020, which she said was \"inexcusable\". She added: \"Each government had ample warning that the prevalence of the virus was increasing and would continue to do so into the winter months. Yet again, there was a failure to take timely and effective action.\""

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n \"Terrible\", \"weird\", \"peculiar\" and \"baffling\" - some of the adjectives being levelled by observers at the Donald Trump administration's peace plan for Ukraine. The 28-point proposal was cooked up between Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff and Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev without European and Ukrainian involvement. It effectively dresses up Russian demands as a peace proposal. Demands first made by Russia at the high watermark of its invasion in 2022, before defeats forced it to retreat from much of Ukraine. Ukraine war latest: Kyiv receives US peace plan Its proposals are non-starters for Ukrainians. It would hand over the rest of Donbas, territory they have spent almost four years and lost tens of thousands of men defending. Analysts estimate at the current rate of advance, it would take Russia four more years to take the land it is proposing simply to give them instead. It proposes more than halving the size of the Ukrainian military and depriving them of some of their most effective long-range weapons. And it would bar any foreign forces acting as peacekeepers in Ukraine after any peace deal is done.  The plan comes at an excruciating time for the Ukrainians. They are being pounded with devastating drone attacks, killing dozens in the last few nights alone. They are on the verge of losing a key stronghold city, Pokrovsk. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy is embroiled in the gravest political crisis since the war began, with key officials facing damaging corruption allegations. Read more from Sky News:Witkoff's 'secret' plan to end warNavy could react to laser incident  The suspicion is Mr Witkoff and Mr Dmitriev conspired together to choose this moment to put even more pressure on the Ukrainian president. Perversely, though, it may help him. There has been universal condemnation and outrage in Kyiv at the Witkoff-Dmitriev plan. Rivals have little choice but to rally around the wartime Ukrainian leader as he faces such unreasonable demands. The genesis of this plan is unclear. Was it born from Donald Trump's overinflated belief in his peacemaking abilities? His overrated Gaza ceasefire plan attracted lavish praise from world leaders, but now seems mired in deepening difficulty. The fear is Mr Trump's team are finding ways to allow him to walk away from this conflict altogether, blaming Ukrainian intransigence for the failure of his diplomacy. Mr Trump has already ended financial support for Ukraine, acting as an arms dealer instead, selling weapons to Europe to pass on to the invaded democracy. If he were to take away military intelligence support too, Ukraine would be blind to the kind of attacks that in recent days have killed scores of civilians. Europe and Ukraine cannot reject the plan entirely and risk alienating Mr Trump. They will play for time and hope against all the evidence he can still be persuaded to desert the Kremlin and put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war, rather than force Ukraine to surrender instead."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A fierce warning from Britain's defence secretary to Vladimir Putin to turn his spy ship away from UK waters or face the consequences was a very public attempt to deter the threat. But unless John Healey backs his rhetoric up with a far more urgent push to rearm - and to rebuild wider national resilience - he risks his words ringing as hollow as his military. The defence secretary on Wednesday repeated government plans to increase defence spending and work with NATO allies to bolster European security. Instead of focusing purely on the threat, he also stressed how plans to buy weapons and build arms factories will create jobs and economic growth. In a sign of the government's priorities, job creation is typically the top line of any Ministry of Defence press release about its latest investment in missiles, drones and warships rather than why the equipment is vital to defend the nation. I doubt expanding employment opportunities was the motivating factor in the 1930s when the UK converted car factories into Spitfire production lines to prepare for war with Nazi Germany. Yet communicating to the public what war readiness really means must surely be just as important today. Mr Healey also chose this moment of national peril to attempt to score political points by criticising the previous Conservative government for hollowing out the armed forces - when the military was left in a similarly underfunded state during the last Labour government. A report by a group of MPs, released on the same day as Mr Healey rattled his sabre at Russia, underlined the scale of the challenge the UK faces. It accused the government of lacking a national plan to defend itself from attack. The Defence Select Committee also warned that Mr Healey, Sir Keir Starmer and the rest of the cabinet are moving at a \"glacial\" pace to fix the problem and are failing to launch a \"national conversation on defence and security\" - something the prime minister had promised last year. The report backed up the findings of a wargame podcast by Sky News and Tortoise that simulated what might happen if Russia launched waves of missile strikes against the UK. The series showed how successive defence cuts since the end of the Cold War means the army, navy and air force are woefully equipped to defend the home front. Read more:Russia accuses Britain of being 'provocative' as spy ship nears UKBriton who volunteered as spy for Russia jailed But credible national defences also require the wider country to be prepared for war. A set of plans setting out what must happen in the transition from peace to war was quietly shelved at the start of this century, so there no longer exists a rehearsed and resourced system to ensure local authorities, businesses and the wider population know what to do. Mr Healey revealed that the Russian spy ship had directed a laser light presumably to dazzle pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft that was tracking it. \"That Russian action is deeply dangerous,\" he said. \"So, my message to Russia and to Putin, is this: We see you. We know what you are doing. And if Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\" He did not spell out what this might mean but it could include attempts to block the Russian vessel's passage, or even fire warning shots to force it to retreat. However, any direct engagement could trigger a retaliation from Moscow. For now, the Russian ship - fitted with spying equipment to monitor critical national infrastructure such as communications cables on the seabed - has moved away from the UK coast. It was at its closest between 5 and 11 November. The military is still tracking its movements closely in case the ship returns."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  Sir Keir Starmer has insisted the G20 still matters and is a \"really important\" forum to bang the drum for British business, despite the decision of Donald Trump to boycott the international summit in South Africa. Asked what he thought of the US president's decision, the prime minister simply said Mr Trump had \"set out his position\". The PM added he thought it was \"really important to be [at the G20] to talk to other partners and allies so we can get on with the discussions around global issues that have to be addressed, and do have an impact back at home, but also to take the opportunity face to face to further the deals that I want to do for our country\". Politics latest - follow live Sir Keir has faced heavy criticism at home for the amount of time he has spent overseas and focusing on international affairs. His trip to South Africa to attend the G20 summit is the 45th country the prime minister has visited since taking office. Speaking to journalists on the flight over to Johannesburg, Sir Keir defended his decision to fly out days before a difficult budget, saying that the international issues being discussed in South Africa have an impact at home, while the G20 nations are important to Britain's economy.  \"The G20 are the 20 strongest economies in the world, they are very important to the UK,\" he said. \n                  Is Trump using Ukrainian corruption to force a peace deal?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has approved the release of the Epstein files - what happens now?\n                 \n                  Trump signs bill approving release of Epstein files\n                 \"In the last three years, the jobs that have been generated in the UK from countries in the G20 is 200,000 and that focus in the budget will be very much the economy and the cost of living. I will focus on the deals we can do, the business we can do with our partner countries and make sure that the work we do internationally is impacting directly at home in the positive sense, that if you want to deal with the cost of living and make people better off, good, secure jobs with investment from G20 partners and allies is really important.\"As part of these efforts, the government will announce £400m worth of export deals with South Africa during the summit.  This summit is the first one in the G20's 26-year history that a US president has not attended, with one diplomatic source acknowledging this was raising serious concerns. They said: \"Trump also made the argument that the G7 should be the G8 [at the last meeting in Canada in June] and now he's not even going to the G20, so his lack of attendance is, of course an issue.\" Mr Trump has also ordered US officials not to travel to South Africa for the annual meeting, although the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said on Thursday evening that this might change, with discussions now under way with the US. While Mr Trump is not attending, Sir Keir will leave the G20 summit early, coming back to the UK on Sunday to prepare for a tax-raising, and possibly manifesto-breaking budget on Wednesday. The chancellor raised £40bn in taxes in the last budget, insisting that this was a \"once in a parliament\" tax raid. A year on, Rachel Reeves now has to raise billions more as she looks to fill a black hole as much as £30bn in the public finances, driven in part by a downgrade in productivity, which has lowered growth forecasts, and also her reversal on spending cuts - the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits - that has left her with around £7bn to find.  The government has U-turned on its plan to raise income tax but is expected to extend a freeze on tax thresholds by two years from 2028. The measure will raise about £10bn in additional tax as workers find themselves dragged into higher tax bands and has led to accusations that Labour has broken its manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people. The prime minister, asked whether everyone should expect tax rises in the budget on Wednesday, refused to answer directly. Instead, he said it would be \"a Labour budget with Labour values\" and based on \"fairness\". He added: \"It will have absolutely in mind protecting our public services, particularly the NHS, cutting our debt, and dealing with the cost of living, bearing down on the cost of living. So, they'll be the principles that will run through the budget. \"Now, of course, the right decisions have to be taken. And we have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we've had the crash in '08, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed by Ukraine, and that's why we have to take the decision to get this back on track. \"I'm optimistic about the future, I do think if we get this right, our country has a great future. They'll be the principles behind the budget.\"  While the prime minister is focusing on trade at the G20 summit, Ukraine will also be on the agenda amid reports the Trump administration and Russian officials have drawn up a new peace plan to end the war there. It would require major concessions from Kyiv, including giving up territory not currently occupied by Russia to Moscow and halving the size of the Ukrainian army. The deal has reportedly been drawn up by Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met the current secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, in Miami. Asked about the plan, Sir Keir said he wanted a \"just and lasting peace\", adding: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine, and we must never lose sight of that\". I'm told by one diplomatic source that the Europeans have yet to see this plan, while there are questions as to how advanced in the US administration these proposals are and whether they have the support of Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  European diplomats are stressing that any peace talks have to involve both Ukraine and European input if it is to have any hope of working. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on the eve of the G20 summit they are yet to see any concessions on the Russian side. \"We welcome all meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting,\" she said. \"That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.\" European leaders are discussing how to best equip Kyiv for another winter of war. Talks are expected to continue this weekend over the plan to use Russia's frozen assets to generate a €140bn loan for Ukraine. The plan is currently stalled over Belgium's concerns of legal risk in releasing funds from the Brussels-based depository Euroclear, where most of the Russian assets are held. Earlier on Thursday, Sky News revealed Sir Keir is preparing for a likely visit to China in the new year. The trip is likely to be controversial given the UK's fractious relationship with China, made worse by recent allegations of spying in parliament. Sir Keir said any visit was not confirmed \"yet\" and insisted the government would \"always robustly protect our interests\"."

Just as the host nation was desperately trying to corral more than 190 countries towards unity at talks in Belem, delegates ended up having to flee the short-lived blaze. The fire broke out in the pavilion area of COP30, where groups showcase their efforts, prompting an evacuation across the site. It was swiftly put out and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation, officials said, with the cause thought to be an electrical fault. But it will make the hard task of negotiations even harder, and they had already missed a self-imposed deadline to wrap up the first batch of deals on Wednesday evening. Representatives have travelled from all corners of the globe to get together in the same room to try to solve some of the world's biggest challenges. The UN climate body (UNFCCC) has not yet confirmed when the site will reopen. Talks were stuck on how to close the gap between the level of warming the world is on course for, compared to that which governments previously agreed would be a better, safe level. Read more from COP30:Climate protest aims to hold governments' feet to the fireAre climate summits saving the world - or just hot air?COP30 - why is it so controversial? The most controversial solutions being discussed for this first agreement are the future of fossil fuels and the delivery of finance to help developing nations switch to clean energy and cope with the impacts of climate change they did little to cause. About 80 countries have been lobbying for a plan or \"roadmap\" for how to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" - a pledge made at COP28 two years ago but which has subsequently been swept under the carpet. Another dividing line was how rich countries, which generally have done more to cause climate change, should help poorer countries cope with more extreme weather that tends to hit them hardest. Previous funding promises have materialised late or not in the form promised. And for the first time critical minerals - vital for green technology like EVs and solar panels - may make it into one of the COP decisions to come later in the week."

        "Content": "\n          Data journalist\n              @joelysantacruz\n Housing Secretary Steve Reed wants Britain to \"build, baby, build\" towards the government's flagship 1.5 million homes target by the next election. But housebuilding in England has slowed to its lowest level in nine years, with the number of homes built falling by 6% to 208,600 in the year to March 2025. A combination of rising building costs and weakening house prices has left \"half of the country unviable (for development projects) and the other half of the country unaffordable\", Steve Turner, executive director of the Home Builders Federation (HBF), told Sky News. Ambitions for affordability are competing with high safety and design standards, which have been pushing up costs. The government acknowledges housing delivery has not reached required levels - but maintains building will ramp up as their policies come into effect. Since the election, 275,000 homes have been delivered to date, compared to the 400,000 that would have needed to be on track for 1.5 million homes. \"Additional housing is now at around 200,000 homes a year and is at best flatlining. We're still some way away from where the government wants to get to, to meet the nation's housing need,\" Mr Turner said. The rising price of materials and labour have contributed to the increase in the cost of building homes in recent years - for example, the cost of bricks and clay products increased by over 26% in the year to August 2023. \n                  A Danish style asylum system?

As a result, the sales value of homes has not kept pace, eating into profit margins in a trap described as the \"jaws of death\" by housing developers. While the cost of building homes has increased by just under 13% on average since September 2022, house prices have increased by less than 3% on average across Britain, while flat prices in London have decreased by 0.5%. The government is currently consulting on emergency measures to \"get spades in the ground\" in London after the number of new homes starting construction in the capital plummeted to just 4,000 in the latest year to June 2025 - a fraction of the area's 81,000 building target. These include a funding package and temporary reductions in affordable housing targets from 35% to 20%, as well as relief from some levies. Housebuilders have also faced increased costs from updated building design standards introduced from 2022 onwards, including fire safety rules mandating a second fire escape stairwell for tall buildings, and regulations to improve energy efficiency, ventilation, and electric vehicle infrastructure. The greatest impact is in London. High-rise housing is more common, and additional Greater London Authority regulations require more affordable housing and additional requirements such as \"dual aspect\" design. A recent report by Savills estate agency and property developers Ballymore estimates that delivering homes in Greater London now costs 10-15% more than elsewhere, thanks to these requirements. Property developers told Sky News that new building and fire safety regulations add costs of around £21,500 per home for a two-bedroom flat in London, while community infrastructure levies add £12,000 on average and can be as high as £50,000 in some areas. New costs - a 4% residential development tax and a building safety levy costing between £1,500 and £3,500 per home - are expected to be added in the near future. \"The viability of sites is very, very strained and is snuffing out general supply of new homes from the UK's housing pipeline,\" Nick Cuff, managing director of real estate advisory and development business Urban Sketch, told Sky News. \"We're just not funding these things properly, and we're asking the private sector to pick up the bill in almost all cases. We are effectively seeing a cessation in development activity because it cannot support the requirements that government is placing on it now. And that's why the numbers have dropped off a cliff in the last two years,\" he added. Affordable social housing is mostly built by private developers through a cross-subsidy model, which requires private housebuilding to be viable as well. While some are hoping for emergency measures in London to be made permanent, others are wary of a race to the bottom. \"If at the first test, you pull back on the [affordable homes] target, what message are you sending? It must be temporary - we need to see if it does then move the market,\" Rachael Williamson, director of policy, communications and external affairs at the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH), told Sky News. \"We've got to manage the tension [between safety and costs] without saying 'let's cut corners'. History tells us where you get to with that,\" she added. Outside of London Though these issues have been particularly fraught in London, the rest of the country also faces significant challenges. Analysis by online property portal Zoopla finds it is now not viable to build in just under half of England, on the basis that the sales value of homes is less than the total cost of delivering a new home. The analysis excludes figures for London, though research firm Molior separately found that housebuilding in half of London would be unviable even if housing and infrastructure contribution requirements were completely removed. They also found that those areas where building is viable are the areas where people were less likely to be able to afford to buy, creating a mismatch between supply and demand. The viability to develop new homes is better in the south of England, where new build prices are among the most unaffordable for buyers. Although planning reforms have been \"very positive\", Mr Turner said it only addresses one side of the equation, and that the government \"needs to find a way to support buyers, which will then create confidence with house builders that ultimately they can sell the product they deliver\". There is currently no suggestion that the government intends to revive a version of the Help to Buy scheme, which critics have argued contributed to increasing house prices and reducing affordability in the long run. Long-term planning needed Speculation around the upcoming budget has also added to uncertainty, and developers have called on the government to rethink proposed landfill tax changes, which would further add to building costs. \"We've definitely seen an increase in regulation over the last few years. Often very well-meaning regulation, but which can hinder the viability of sites and developments,\" a spokesperson for the homebuilder Barratt Redrow told Sky News. \"We buy land on the basis of the costs of construction, including the regulatory burden, at the time, and obviously, if four years later, when we've got planning permission, it's more expensive to build, then that is going to have an impact on whether it makes financial sense to go ahead with the development, \"As an industry and also as a business, we're not against the right sort of regulation, but it's important we've got long-term certainty because the process of buying land and building houses is so long and involves such risk,\" he added. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Today's statistics show, in the clearest terms yet, the extent of the housing crisis we inherited and are now fixing. \"We took over a planning system that blocked rather than built, and high inflation and soaring construction costs that created a perfect storm holding back housebuilding. \"Our 1.5 million homes target is not just a number - it's a way to give children a secure home, for young people finally to move out and enjoy independence, and for working families to have a place to call their own. \"We have already taken down the barriers that stopped this country from building, overhauled the planning system and pumped record investment into social housing. This will bring about the change we need to end the housing crisis by getting spades in the ground wherever homes are needed most.\" Development 'hit by a perfect storm of costs' A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"Through the London Plan, the mayor has been able to set the highest housing design standards relative to other parts of the country, and these standards have supported the delivery of high-quality homes in London \"However, London needs more sites coming forward to meet the capital's housing needs, and development has been hit by a perfect storm of costs from national policy and wider economic conditions that disproportionately affects London. \"Through our proposed changes to London Plan design guidance, we are hoping to reduce the barriers to housebuilding and introduce flexibility so that planning policies are applied in line with their original intent - helping to bring developments forward. These measures will help to unblock stalled building sites, giving the mayor stronger levers to approve homes and bring forward thousands of homes more quickly.\" The Data x Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": " They've been billed as the \"most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times\" and the \"biggest shake-up of the legal migration system\" in nearly 50 years, but how are the UK's rules actually changing? One of the biggest changes will impact almost two million migrants already living in the UK while other proposals will affect people who come here in the future. Here's how... How is 'settled status' changing?  Until now, migrants who live in the UK have needed to wait five years before they can apply to settle permanently but this qualifying period will double to 10 years - and some people could have to wait even longer. Almost two million migrants will be affected by the changes. Those \"making a strong contribution to British life\" will benefit from a reduced timeframe. \n                  A Danish style asylum system? How the UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare\n                 \n                  More children to face deportation under government's asylum crackdown\n                 \n                  Nadjib, who tipped off police over released prisoner Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, tells Sky News he's 'happy to see him arrested'\n                 That means doctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years, while high earners and entrepreneurs may able to stay after just three years. Migrants who speak English to a high standard and volunteer could also have a faster route to settlement. At the other end of the scale, low-paid workers will be subject to a 15-year wait. With this, the government is explicitly targeting the 616,000 people and their dependents who came to the UK on health and social care visas between 2022 and 2024 - the so-called \"Boriswave\". The government is going further still in targeting migrants who rely on benefits, quadrupling the current wait to 20 years. There are also plans to limit benefits and social housing to British citizens only. And though recognised refugees who came to the UK legally will still be eligible for public funding, they too will be subject to the 20-year timeframe. How will asylum rules change? Inspired by immigration policy in Denmark, refugee status will become temporary, lasting only until it's safe for the person in question to return home. This means that asylum seekers will be granted leave to remain for 30 months, instead of the current five years, with the period only extendable if they still face danger in their homeland.  However, refugees will be eligible to settle sooner if they get a job or enter education \"at an appropriate level\" under a new \"work and study\" visa route, and pay a fee. The government also plans to revoke its legal duty to support asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, a measure it says was introduced to comply with EU laws which Britain is no longer bound by. Instead, support will be discretionary, and some people will be excluded - such as criminals, those who refuse to relocate, those who can work but won't, those who are disruptive in their accommodation, and those who deliberately make themselves destitute. Additionally, asylum seekers who have assets or income will be required to contribute to the cost of supporting themselves. What about illegal migrants? Meanwhile, illegal migrants and those who overstay their visas face a wait of up to 30 years before qualifying for permanent settlement. But plans to bar criminals from settlement are still being figured out, with the government saying \"work will take place to consider the precise threshold\" at which someone is ineligible. \"The reforms will make Britain's settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe,\" according to the government. Alongside the new measures, plans are afoot to boost the number of migrants being removed from the UK. What about illegal migrants who are already here? A \"one in, one out\" agreement is already in place with France, under which those who cross the channel illegally are to be sent back, with Britain accepting instead a \"security-checked migrant... via a safe and legal route\". \"This pilot is under way, and the government is working in partnership with French on expansion,\" according to the government. Furthermore, refugees will not have automatic family reunion rights, and the removal of families of failed asylum seekers is to be stepped up. Read more:Countries facing Trump-style visa ban under asylum reformsWhy Labour MPs are uncomfortable with the new asylum approach Perhaps controversial are plans to offer financial support to those who agree to go voluntary. The government argues this is \"the most cost-effective approach for UK taxpayers and we will encourage people to take up these opportunities\". Sanctions will also be imposed on nations that fail to cooperate on the return of their citizens, including suspending visas for that country. And for those who are refused refugee status, the appeals process is to be streamlined, with one route of appeal, judged by one body, requiring applicants to make all their arguments in one go, instead of making multiple claims.  Human rights legislation will be reformed too, in a bid to reduce legal challenges to deportations. Finally, the number of arrivals accepted through \"safe and legal routes\" will be capped, \"based on local capacity to support refugees\". The reforms will not apply to people with settled status, and there will be a consultation on \"transitional arrangements\" in some cases. The five-year wait for immediate family members of UK citizens remains unchanged, as it does for Hong Kongers with British national (overseas) visas."

        "Content": "A paedophile who had a \"commercial interest in the sexual abuse of young teenage boys\" and sold child abuse images to other sex offenders has been jailed for raping two 12-year-olds. Barthimaus Ehiemere, of Hackney, east London, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court to 18 years' imprisonment for 47 offences against seven known victims. Police discovered the 25-year-old groomed boys aged 12 to 16 online, and committed serious sexual offences against them, including seven counts of rape against two boys between 2019 and 2023. Detectives said Ehiemere would send the boys \"gifts, money and praise to coerce them into providing sexual imagery\", which he would then use to advertise and encourage other boys to do the same. Not only that, he would \"actively brag about his endeavours\" and sell the illegal content to other predators, the Met Police said. He used Snapchat and the now-discontinued app, Spotafriend. Investigators would find more than 1,600 indecent images of children on four phones and devices seized from him. In 2020, he was arrested after police received information that his phone was distributing indecent images of children. In light of this, he was then sentenced in February 2021 at Wood Green Crown Court to eight months in a young offenders' institution, suspended for 24 months and made subject to a sexual harm prevention order. By October 2024, police had identified initial victims and officers discovered footage of him raping a 12-year-old boy after another of his devices was seized. Prosecutor James Brown KC said the paedophile had a \"deep-seated and commercial interest in the sexual abuse of young teenage boys\". He said: \"On Snapchat, there were numerous examples of him advertising broadly and widely for images of a sexual nature from younger teenage boys. \"He frequently offered money for those images. \"He was very much in the business of encouraging young teenage boys to send him images of themselves performing sexual acts.\" Sentencing, judge Timothy Greene told Ehiemere: \"You are a serious danger to young boys with whom you come into contact.\" He also sentenced the predator to a further four-year licence period and an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. In an impact statement read out by Mr Brown, one victim said they were \"waking up with nightmares\" about their tormentor. The victim added: \"It took me a long time to realise I was a child and it wasn't my fault.\" Read more:Former Met Police officer guilty of more sexual offences'Incredibly dangerous' sex offender jailed  Detective Constable Lindsey Luscombe of the Met's Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation team, appealed for other victims to come forward. \"Ehiemere is one of the most prolific and depraved sexual predators we have seen in recent years. He groomed his victims online, demonstrating a dangerous pattern of offending,\" she said. \"This case demonstrates the insidious nature of online child sex abuse and its grave implications in the real world.\" Mitigating for Ehiemere, Barry Kogan said: \"He wishes to express his deep shame and remorse on account of all of his offending. \"He would like to apologise for the distress he has caused.\" He added his client was \"badly influenced\" by an adult who \"encouraged him to make money by selling illegal images of children\". Ehiemere pled guilty to 32 counts before trial, including rape of a child under 13, inciting children to create indecent images, and multiple breaches of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. He was also found guilty by a jury on a further 15 charges relating to sexual assaults and paying for the sexual services of a child."

        "Content": "\n          Reporter\n              @ClaireGilbodyD\n  All four UK governments failed to appreciate the scale of the threat posed by COVID-19 or the urgency of the response the pandemic required, a damning report published on Thursday has claimed. Baroness Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, described the response to the pandemic as \"too little, too late\". Tens of thousands of lives could have been saved during the first wave of COVID-19 had a mandatory lockdown been introduced a week earlier, the inquiry also found. Noting how a \"lack of urgency\" made a mandatory lockdown \"inevitable\", the report references modelling data to claim there could have been 23,000 fewer deaths during the first wave in England had it been introduced a week earlier. The UK government first introduced advisory restrictions on 16 March 2020, including self-isolation, household quarantine and social distancing. Had these measures been introduced sooner, the report states, the mandatory lockdown which followed from 23 March might not have been necessary at all.  COVID-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and as it developed into a worldwide pandemic, the UK went in and out of unprecedented lockdown measures for two years starting from March 2020. \n                  The realities of the COVID classroom that Boris Johnson will need to explain\n                 \n                  'Many mistakes' were made over COVID school closures, former education secretary Gavin Williamson says\n                 \n                  Duchess of York offered to help secure PPE early in COVID-19 pandemic, inquiry hears\n                 Lady Hallett admitted in her summary that politicians in the government and devolved administrations were forced to make decisions where \"there was often no right answer or good outcome\". \"Nonetheless,\" she said, \"I can summarise my findings of the response as 'too little, too late'\". Health correspondent This scathing report goes a long way to answer the Covid 19 Inquiry's critics who have consistently attacked it as a costly waste of time.  They tried to undermine Lady Hallet's attempt to understand what went wrong and how we might do better as a lame exercise that would achieve very little.  Well, we now know that Boris Johnson’s \"toxic and chaotic\" government could well have prevented at least 23,000 deaths had they acted sooner and with greater urgency. The response was \"too little, too late\".  And that nobody in power truly understood the scale of the emerging threat or the urgency of the response it required.  The grieving families who lost loved ones in the pandemic want answers. They want names. And they want accountability.  But that is beyond the remit of this Inquiry. The publication of the report into Module 2 will bring them no comfort, it may even cause them more distress but it will bring them closer to understanding why the UK's response to this unprecedented health crisis was so poor.  And we can easily identify the \"advisors and ministers whose alleged rule breaking caused huge distress and undermined public confidence\".  Or who was in charge of the Department of Health and Social Care, as it misled the public by giving the impression that the UK was well prepared for the pandemic when it clearly was not.  'Toxic culture' at the heart of UK government The report said there was \"a toxic and chaotic culture\" at the heart of the UK government during the pandemic. The inquiry heard evidence about the \"destabilising behaviour of a number of individuals\" - including former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings. It said that by failing to tackle this chaotic culture - \"and, at times, actively encouraging it\" - former PM Boris Johnson \"reinforced a culture in which the loudest voices prevailed and the views of other colleagues, particularly women, often went ignored, to the detriment of good decision-making\". 'Misleading assurances' The inquiry found all four governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland failed to understand the urgency of response the pandemic demanded in the early part of 2020. The report reads: \"This was compounded, in part, by misleading assurances from the Department of Health and Social Care and the widely held view that the UK was well prepared for a pandemic.\" The report notes how the UK government took a \"high risk\" when it significantly eased restrictions in England in July 2020 - \"despite scientific advisers' concerns about the public health risks of doing so\". Lady Hallett has made 19 key recommendations which, if followed, she believes will better protect the UK in any future pandemic and improve decision-making in a crisis. Repeated failings 'inexcusable' In a statement following the publication of Thursday's report, Lady Hallett said there was a \"serious failure\" by all four governments to appreciate the level of \"risk and calamity\" facing the UK. She said: \"The tempo of the response should have been increased. It was not. February 2020 was a lost month.\" Read more:A timeline of the UK's response to the pandemic Lady Hallett said the inquiry does not advocate for national lockdowns, which she said should have been avoided if at all possible. She said: \"But to avoid them, governments must take timely and decisive action to control a spreading virus. The four governments of the UK did not.\" Lady Hallett said none of the governments were adequately prepared for the challenges and risks that a lockdown presented, and that many of the same failings were repeated later in 2020, which she said was \"inexcusable\". She added: \"Each government had ample warning that the prevalence of the virus was increasing and would continue to do so into the winter months. Yet again, there was a failure to take timely and effective action.\""

Baroness Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, chose to highlight one truly damning statistic: 23,000. That's the number of deaths that might have been prevented if Boris Johnson had followed his peers in Italy, Spain and France by locking down the UK on 16 March 2020 rather than delaying for another week. Follow latest: All four UK governments 'failed to appreciate' scale of COVID pandemic threat  But I would choose another - and to my mind, far greater - failure: when, six months later, those in charge failed to learn from that mistake, leading to a far greater loss of lives. Back in March 2020, the government was forced to make it up as they went along. Mr Johnson was, in the words of his advisers, \"trolleying\" - swerving erratically between doomsday thinking and the need to keep shaking hands and act like normal. But the government's scientific advisers, who were given an easy ride by Lady Hallett in her summary, were trolleying too. The same scientists who were to urge the government to lock down had, weeks before, dismissed the idea as unworkable. Suggesting, not without reason (if we'd been dealing with a flu virus perhaps), \"herd immunity\" was the least bad outcome. But by early summer of 2020, as Lady Hallett highlighted, we knew what we were dealing with. We'd been through a lockdown, we knew people understood how to behave, and we knew which vulnerable groups needed the most support. Yet instead of acting to slow the rising spread of the virus, chaos within government led to hurried policies including \"Eat Out to Help Out\" and confused messages about returning to work if you could, even though few of us were able to because our offices were shut. Perhaps the best analysis of the situation then came not from science journalists like me, or political pundits, but comedian Matt Lucas, who mocked Boris Johnson's speech to the nation about coronavirus. Read more:A timeline of the UK's response to the pandemicEverything you need to know about the COVID inquiry  Then, when scientific advice, far clearer and more considered than before, called for a short, sharp lockdown over school half term that autumn, it was rejected. Then, as cases inevitably rose as winter set in, the confusing and disruptive \"tier\" system was introduced. A kind of lockdown light that didn't really work. This led in turn to a precipitous rise in cases, partly driven by the new \"Kent\" or Alpha variant, which the scientists had seen coming, and the need for another draconian lockdown in January 2021. One insider described it to the inquiry as a \"roller-coaster\" response. One of chaotic, half-baked, half-measures that made more severe interventions necessary. Indecision cost the economy - and the mental health and well-being of the most vulnerable - far more than shorter, harder, earlier lockdowns would have done. And ultimately, most damningly, it cost the most lives. The \"second wave\", as it soon became known, between December 2020 and February 2021, killed 65,000 people. One analysis concluded 27,000 of those deaths might have been avoided, or at least delayed, had tougher action been taken. It's why, now that the pandemic is over, an analysis of the data shows how the UK saw some of the highest COVID mortality in the developed world. It's reasonable to question the purpose of a lengthy, £200m inquiry, as many, including my colleagues, have. Especially when you only have to look to lockdown parties and the spectacular falling out between Boris Johnson and key advisors, such as Dominic Cummings, to know there was chaos and bad decision-making at the heart of government. Is it worth an extra £200m to know that as much evidence as possible has been dragged into the light - when you consider the failed \"test and trace\" programme alone cost taxpayers £35bn? Surely it is worth it for the families of the 220,000 who died during the UK's COVID pandemic."

But housebuilding in England has slowed to its lowest level in nine years, with the number of homes built falling by 6% to 208,600 in the year to March 2025. A combination of rising building costs and weakening house prices has left \"half of the country unviable (for development projects) and the other half of the country unaffordable\", Steve Turner, executive director of the Home Builders Federation (HBF), told Sky News. Ambitions for affordability are competing with high safety and design standards, which have been pushing up costs. The government acknowledges housing delivery has not reached required levels - but maintains building will ramp up as their policies come into effect. Since the election, 275,000 homes have been delivered to date, compared to the 400,000 that would have needed to be on track for 1.5 million homes. \"Additional housing is now at around 200,000 homes a year and is at best flatlining. We're still some way away from where the government wants to get to, to meet the nation's housing need,\" Mr Turner said. The rising price of materials and labour have contributed to the increase in the cost of building homes in recent years - for example, the cost of bricks and clay products increased by over 26% in the year to August 2023. \n                  A Danish style asylum system? How the UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare\n                 \n                  The rise of Christian nationalism in Britain and its relationship with the far right\n                 \n                  Thousands targeted in 'killing fields' around Sudanese city in paramilitary group's hands\n                 At the same time, higher interest rates since 2022 have increased the cost of financing development, in addition to weakening buyer demand, as mortgage rates have soared. As a result, the sales value of homes has not kept pace, eating into profit margins in a trap described as the \"jaws of death\" by housing developers. While the cost of building homes has increased by just under 13% on average since September 2022, house prices have increased by less than 3% on average across Britain, while flat prices in London have decreased by 0.5%. The government is currently consulting on emergency measures to \"get spades in the ground\" in London after the number of new homes starting construction in the capital plummeted to just 4,000 in the latest year to June 2025 - a fraction of the area's 81,000 building target. These include a funding package and temporary reductions in affordable housing targets from 35% to 20%, as well as relief from some levies. Housebuilders have also faced increased costs from updated building design standards introduced from 2022 onwards, including fire safety rules mandating a second fire escape stairwell for tall buildings, and regulations to improve energy efficiency, ventilation, and electric vehicle infrastructure. The greatest impact is in London. High-rise housing is more common, and additional Greater London Authority regulations require more affordable housing and additional requirements such as \"dual aspect\" design. A recent report by Savills estate agency and property developers Ballymore estimates that delivering homes in Greater London now costs 10-15% more than elsewhere, thanks to these requirements. Property developers told Sky News that new building and fire safety regulations add costs of around £21,500 per home for a two-bedroom flat in London, while community infrastructure levies add £12,000 on average and can be as high as £50,000 in some areas. New costs - a 4% residential development tax and a building safety levy costing between £1,500 and £3,500 per home - are expected to be added in the near future. \"The viability of sites is very, very strained and is snuffing out general supply of new homes from the UK's housing pipeline,\" Nick Cuff, managing director of real estate advisory and development business Urban Sketch, told Sky News. \"We're just not funding these things properly, and we're asking the private sector to pick up the bill in almost all cases. We are effectively seeing a cessation in development activity because it cannot support the requirements that government is placing on it now. And that's why the numbers have dropped off a cliff in the last two years,\" he added. Affordable social housing is mostly built by private developers through a cross-subsidy model, which requires private housebuilding to be viable as well. While some are hoping for emergency measures in London to be made permanent, others are wary of a race to the bottom. \"If at the first test, you pull back on the [affordable homes] target, what message are you sending? It must be temporary - we need to see if it does then move the market,\" Rachael Williamson, director of policy, communications and external affairs at the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH), told Sky News. \"We've got to manage the tension [between safety and costs] without saying 'let's cut corners'. History tells us where you get to with that,\" she added. Outside of London Though these issues have been particularly fraught in London, the rest of the country also faces significant challenges. Analysis by online property portal Zoopla finds it is now not viable to build in just under half of England, on the basis that the sales value of homes is less than the total cost of delivering a new home. The analysis excludes figures for London, though research firm Molior separately found that housebuilding in half of London would be unviable even if housing and infrastructure contribution requirements were completely removed. They also found that those areas where building is viable are the areas where people were less likely to be able to afford to buy, creating a mismatch between supply and demand. The viability to develop new homes is better in the south of England, where new build prices are among the most unaffordable for buyers. Although planning reforms have been \"very positive\", Mr Turner said it only addresses one side of the equation, and that the government \"needs to find a way to support buyers, which will then create confidence with house builders that ultimately they can sell the product they deliver\". There is currently no suggestion that the government intends to revive a version of the Help to Buy scheme, which critics have argued contributed to increasing house prices and reducing affordability in the long run. Long-term planning needed Speculation around the upcoming budget has also added to uncertainty, and developers have called on the government to rethink proposed landfill tax changes, which would further add to building costs. \"We've definitely seen an increase in regulation over the last few years. Often very well-meaning regulation, but which can hinder the viability of sites and developments,\" a spokesperson for the homebuilder Barratt Redrow told Sky News. \"We buy land on the basis of the costs of construction, including the regulatory burden, at the time, and obviously, if four years later, when we've got planning permission, it's more expensive to build, then that is going to have an impact on whether it makes financial sense to go ahead with the development, \"As an industry and also as a business, we're not against the right sort of regulation, but it's important we've got long-term certainty because the process of buying land and building houses is so long and involves such risk,\" he added. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Today's statistics show, in the clearest terms yet, the extent of the housing crisis we inherited and are now fixing. \"We took over a planning system that blocked rather than built, and high inflation and soaring construction costs that created a perfect storm holding back housebuilding. \"Our 1.5 million homes target is not just a number - it's a way to give children a secure home, for young people finally to move out and enjoy independence, and for working families to have a place to call their own. \"We have already taken down the barriers that stopped this country from building, overhauled the planning system and pumped record investment into social housing. This will bring about the change we need to end the housing crisis by getting spades in the ground wherever homes are needed most.\" Development 'hit by a perfect storm of costs' A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"Through the London Plan, the mayor has been able to set the highest housing design standards relative to other parts of the country, and these standards have supported the delivery of high-quality homes in London \"However, London needs more sites coming forward to meet the capital's housing needs, and development has been hit by a perfect storm of costs from national policy and wider economic conditions that disproportionately affects London. \"Through our proposed changes to London Plan design guidance, we are hoping to reduce the barriers to housebuilding and introduce flexibility so that planning policies are applied in line with their original intent - helping to bring developments forward. These measures will help to unblock stalled building sites, giving the mayor stronger levers to approve homes and bring forward thousands of homes more quickly.\" The Data x Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "Fresh yellow weather warnings for ice have been issued for many areas of the UK, as some areas are threatened with blizzard conditions on Thursday. An amber warning for snow - covering northeast England, including Scarborough, Whitby and parts south of Middlesbrough - is in force until 9pm on Thursday. UK weather latest: Blizzard warning for amber area The Met Office said there could be \"significant snow accumulations\" over the North York Moors and parts of the Yorkshire Wolds with up to 25cm (10ins) on hills above 100m (330ft). \"Gusty winds, giving occasional blizzard conditions, and perhaps a few lightning strikes, may accompany some of the showers, posing as additional hazards,\" the warning added. Some A-roads in North Yorkshire were reported to be \"gridlocked\", according to Shingi Mararike, Sky News' North of England correspondent, but he added gritters are out to deal with the bad weather.

A number of yellow warnings are also in force for snow and/or ice across large parts of Britain. In many of the warnings issued by the Met Office, there are concerns that where \"showers persist and/or snow partially thaws and then refreezes overnight, this will bring a risk of ice\". Jo Wheeler, Sky's weather presenter, said clear skies will allow temperatures to tumble again as Thursday night approaches, \"with an early and severe frost expected, and the associated risk of icy stretches on untreated roads and pavements\". Coldest night so far Overnight Wednesday into Thursday was the coldest of the season so far, according to the Met Office. Temperatures dropped as low as -6.6C (20F) in Benson, Oxfordshire. There were two -6.4C (20F) temperatures recorded in Wales (in Sennybrigde) and in Scotland (Dundreggan). While in Northern Ireland it fell to -2.8C (27F) in Altnahinch Filters. Cold health alerts in force As well as the one amber weather warning covering parts of the UK, there are two amber health alerts in place in three areas of England from the UK's Health Security Agency. An amber health alert is designed to prepare health services, including for the potential for a rise in deaths among the over-65s and people with health conditions. The alerts are in effect in North East and North West England, along with the Yorkshire and the Humber region until 8am on 22 November. Yellow cold-health alerts are in place for the rest of England and also expire at the same point. Walk like a penguin NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) is recommending that people should walk like penguins to avoid dangerous slips and trips on icy surfaces. The technique, which went viral in previous winters, is back for 2025 as part of the health board's winter campaign. Laura Halcrow, falls prevention lead at NHSGGC, said: \"It might look funny, but waddling really works. A slip on ice can cause painful injuries and even hospital stays, especially for older people.\" Turning wet and windy Sky's weather presenter, Jo Wheeler, adds that the forecast is set to change this weekend. \"We'll trade the cold sunshine and wintry showers for wet and windy conditions with rain turning heavy as it crosses the country on Saturday.\" \"The British weather, fickle as always, looks like delivering a brief change to this milder westerly flow followed by an equally quick change back to a chilly northerly flow.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A fierce warning from Britain's defence secretary to Vladimir Putin to turn his spy ship away from UK waters or face the consequences was a very public attempt to deter the threat. But unless John Healey backs his rhetoric up with a far more urgent push to rearm - and to rebuild wider national resilience - he risks his words ringing as hollow as his military. The defence secretary on Wednesday repeated government plans to increase defence spending and work with NATO allies to bolster European security. Instead of focusing purely on the threat, he also stressed how plans to buy weapons and build arms factories will create jobs and economic growth. In a sign of the government's priorities, job creation is typically the top line of any Ministry of Defence press release about its latest investment in missiles, drones and warships rather than why the equipment is vital to defend the nation. I doubt expanding employment opportunities was the motivating factor in the 1930s when the UK converted car factories into Spitfire production lines to prepare for war with Nazi Germany. Yet communicating to the public what war readiness really means must surely be just as important today. Mr Healey also chose this moment of national peril to attempt to score political points by criticising the previous Conservative government for hollowing out the armed forces - when the military was left in a similarly underfunded state during the last Labour government. A report by a group of MPs, released on the same day as Mr Healey rattled his sabre at Russia, underlined the scale of the challenge the UK faces. It accused the government of lacking a national plan to defend itself from attack. The Defence Select Committee also warned that Mr Healey, Sir Keir Starmer and the rest of the cabinet are moving at a \"glacial\" pace to fix the problem and are failing to launch a \"national conversation on defence and security\" - something the prime minister had promised last year. The report backed up the findings of a wargame podcast by Sky News and Tortoise that simulated what might happen if Russia launched waves of missile strikes against the UK. The series showed how successive defence cuts since the end of the Cold War means the army, navy and air force are woefully equipped to defend the home front. Read more:Russia accuses Britain of being 'provocative' as spy ship nears UKBriton who volunteered as spy for Russia jailed But credible national defences also require the wider country to be prepared for war. A set of plans setting out what must happen in the transition from peace to war was quietly shelved at the start of this century, so there no longer exists a rehearsed and resourced system to ensure local authorities, businesses and the wider population know what to do. Mr Healey revealed that the Russian spy ship had directed a laser light presumably to dazzle pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft that was tracking it. \"That Russian action is deeply dangerous,\" he said. \"So, my message to Russia and to Putin, is this: We see you. We know what you are doing. And if Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\" He did not spell out what this might mean but it could include attempts to block the Russian vessel's passage, or even fire warning shots to force it to retreat. However, any direct engagement could trigger a retaliation from Moscow. For now, the Russian ship - fitted with spying equipment to monitor critical national infrastructure such as communications cables on the seabed - has moved away from the UK coast. It was at its closest between 5 and 11 November. The military is still tracking its movements closely in case the ship returns."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  Sir Keir Starmer has insisted the G20 still matters and is a \"really important\" forum to bang the drum for British business, despite the decision of Donald Trump to boycott the international summit in South Africa. Asked what he thought of the US president's decision, the prime minister simply said Mr Trump had \"set out his position\". The PM added he thought it was \"really important to be [at the G20] to talk to other partners and allies so we can get on with the discussions around global issues that have to be addressed, and do have an impact back at home, but also to take the opportunity face to face to further the deals that I want to do for our country\". Politics latest - follow live Sir Keir has faced heavy criticism at home for the amount of time he has spent overseas and focusing on international affairs. His trip to South Africa to attend the G20 summit is the 45th country the prime minister has visited since taking office. Speaking to journalists on the flight over to Johannesburg, Sir Keir defended his decision to fly out days before a difficult budget, saying that the international issues being discussed in South Africa have an impact at home, while the G20 nations are important to Britain's economy.  \"The G20 are the 20 strongest economies in the world, they are very important to the UK,\" he said. \n                  Is Trump using Ukrainian corruption to force a peace deal?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has approved the release of the Epstein files - what happens now?\n                 \n                  Trump signs bill approving release of Epstein files\n                 \"In the last three years, the jobs that have been generated in the UK from countries in the G20 is 200,000 and that focus in the budget will be very much the economy and the cost of living. I will focus on the deals we can do, the business we can do with our partner countries and make sure that the work we do internationally is impacting directly at home in the positive sense, that if you want to deal with the cost of living and make people better off, good, secure jobs with investment from G20 partners and allies is really important.\"As part of these efforts, the government will announce £400m worth of export deals with South Africa during the summit.  This summit is the first one in the G20's 26-year history that a US president has not attended, with one diplomatic source acknowledging this was raising serious concerns. They said: \"Trump also made the argument that the G7 should be the G8 [at the last meeting in Canada in June] and now he's not even going to the G20, so his lack of attendance is, of course an issue.\" Mr Trump has also ordered US officials not to travel to South Africa for the annual meeting, although the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said on Thursday evening that this might change, with discussions now under way with the US. While Mr Trump is not attending, Sir Keir will leave the G20 summit early, coming back to the UK on Sunday to prepare for a tax-raising, and possibly manifesto-breaking budget on Wednesday. The chancellor raised £40bn in taxes in the last budget, insisting that this was a \"once in a parliament\" tax raid. A year on, Rachel Reeves now has to raise billions more as she looks to fill a black hole as much as £30bn in the public finances, driven in part by a downgrade in productivity, which has lowered growth forecasts, and also her reversal on spending cuts - the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits - that has left her with around £7bn to find.  The government has U-turned on its plan to raise income tax but is expected to extend a freeze on tax thresholds by two years from 2028. The measure will raise about £10bn in additional tax as workers find themselves dragged into higher tax bands and has led to accusations that Labour has broken its manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people. The prime minister, asked whether everyone should expect tax rises in the budget on Wednesday, refused to answer directly. Instead, he said it would be \"a Labour budget with Labour values\" and based on \"fairness\". He added: \"It will have absolutely in mind protecting our public services, particularly the NHS, cutting our debt, and dealing with the cost of living, bearing down on the cost of living. So, they'll be the principles that will run through the budget. \"Now, of course, the right decisions have to be taken. And we have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we've had the crash in '08, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed by Ukraine, and that's why we have to take the decision to get this back on track. \"I'm optimistic about the future, I do think if we get this right, our country has a great future. They'll be the principles behind the budget.\"  While the prime minister is focusing on trade at the G20 summit, Ukraine will also be on the agenda amid reports the Trump administration and Russian officials have drawn up a new peace plan to end the war there. It would require major concessions from Kyiv, including giving up territory not currently occupied by Russia to Moscow and halving the size of the Ukrainian army. The deal has reportedly been drawn up by Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met the current secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, in Miami. Asked about the plan, Sir Keir said he wanted a \"just and lasting peace\", adding: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine, and we must never lose sight of that\". I'm told by one diplomatic source that the Europeans have yet to see this plan, while there are questions as to how advanced in the US administration these proposals are and whether they have the support of Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  European diplomats are stressing that any peace talks have to involve both Ukraine and European input if it is to have any hope of working. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on the eve of the G20 summit they are yet to see any concessions on the Russian side. \"We welcome all meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting,\" she said. \"That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.\" European leaders are discussing how to best equip Kyiv for another winter of war. Talks are expected to continue this weekend over the plan to use Russia's frozen assets to generate a €140bn loan for Ukraine. The plan is currently stalled over Belgium's concerns of legal risk in releasing funds from the Brussels-based depository Euroclear, where most of the Russian assets are held. Earlier on Thursday, Sky News revealed Sir Keir is preparing for a likely visit to China in the new year. The trip is likely to be controversial given the UK's fractious relationship with China, made worse by recent allegations of spying in parliament. Sir Keir said any visit was not confirmed \"yet\" and insisted the government would \"always robustly protect our interests\"."

        "Content": " They've been billed as the \"most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times\" and the \"biggest shake-up of the legal migration system\" in nearly 50 years, but how are the UK's rules actually changing? One of the biggest changes will impact almost two million migrants already living in the UK while other proposals will affect people who come here in the future. Here's how... How is 'settled status' changing?  Until now, migrants who live in the UK have needed to wait five years before they can apply to settle permanently but this qualifying period will double to 10 years - and some people could have to wait even longer. Almost two million migrants will be affected by the changes. Those \"making a strong contribution to British life\" will benefit from a reduced timeframe. \n                  A Danish style asylum system? How the UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare\n                 \n                  More children to face deportation under government's asylum crackdown\n                 \n                  Nadjib, who tipped off police over released prisoner Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, tells Sky News he's 'happy to see him arrested'\n                 That means doctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years, while high earners and entrepreneurs may able to stay after just three years. Migrants who speak English to a high standard and volunteer could also have a faster route to settlement. At the other end of the scale, low-paid workers will be subject to a 15-year wait. With this, the government is explicitly targeting the 616,000 people and their dependents who came to the UK on health and social care visas between 2022 and 2024 - the so-called \"Boriswave\". The government is going further still in targeting migrants who rely on benefits, quadrupling the current wait to 20 years. There are also plans to limit benefits and social housing to British citizens only. And though recognised refugees who came to the UK legally will still be eligible for public funding, they too will be subject to the 20-year timeframe. How will asylum rules change? Inspired by immigration policy in Denmark, refugee status will become temporary, lasting only until it's safe for the person in question to return home. This means that asylum seekers will be granted leave to remain for 30 months, instead of the current five years, with the period only extendable if they still face danger in their homeland.  However, refugees will be eligible to settle sooner if they get a job or enter education \"at an appropriate level\" under a new \"work and study\" visa route, and pay a fee. The government also plans to revoke its legal duty to support asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, a measure it says was introduced to comply with EU laws which Britain is no longer bound by. Instead, support will be discretionary, and some people will be excluded - such as criminals, those who refuse to relocate, those who can work but won't, those who are disruptive in their accommodation, and those who deliberately make themselves destitute. Additionally, asylum seekers who have assets or income will be required to contribute to the cost of supporting themselves. What about illegal migrants? Meanwhile, illegal migrants and those who overstay their visas face a wait of up to 30 years before qualifying for permanent settlement. But plans to bar criminals from settlement are still being figured out, with the government saying \"work will take place to consider the precise threshold\" at which someone is ineligible. \"The reforms will make Britain's settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe,\" according to the government. Alongside the new measures, plans are afoot to boost the number of migrants being removed from the UK. What about illegal migrants who are already here? A \"one in, one out\" agreement is already in place with France, under which those who cross the channel illegally are to be sent back, with Britain accepting instead a \"security-checked migrant... via a safe and legal route\". \"This pilot is under way, and the government is working in partnership with French on expansion,\" according to the government. Furthermore, refugees will not have automatic family reunion rights, and the removal of families of failed asylum seekers is to be stepped up. Read more:Countries facing Trump-style visa ban under asylum reformsWhy Labour MPs are uncomfortable with the new asylum approach Perhaps controversial are plans to offer financial support to those who agree to go voluntary. The government argues this is \"the most cost-effective approach for UK taxpayers and we will encourage people to take up these opportunities\". Sanctions will also be imposed on nations that fail to cooperate on the return of their citizens, including suspending visas for that country. And for those who are refused refugee status, the appeals process is to be streamlined, with one route of appeal, judged by one body, requiring applicants to make all their arguments in one go, instead of making multiple claims.  Human rights legislation will be reformed too, in a bid to reduce legal challenges to deportations. Finally, the number of arrivals accepted through \"safe and legal routes\" will be capped, \"based on local capacity to support refugees\". The reforms will not apply to people with settled status, and there will be a consultation on \"transitional arrangements\" in some cases. The five-year wait for immediate family members of UK citizens remains unchanged, as it does for Hong Kongers with British national (overseas) visas."

        "Content": "A paedophile who had a \"commercial interest in the sexual abuse of young teenage boys\" and sold child abuse images to other sex offenders has been jailed for raping two 12-year-olds. Barthimaus Ehiemere, of Hackney, east London, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court to 18 years' imprisonment for 47 offences against seven known victims. Police discovered the 25-year-old groomed boys aged 12 to 16 online, and committed serious sexual offences against them, including seven counts of rape against two boys between 2019 and 2023. Detectives said Ehiemere would send the boys \"gifts, money and praise to coerce them into providing sexual imagery\", which he would then use to advertise and encourage other boys to do the same. Not only that, he would \"actively brag about his endeavours\" and sell the illegal content to other predators, the Met Police said. He used Snapchat and the now-discontinued app, Spotafriend. Investigators would find more than 1,600 indecent images of children on four phones and devices seized from him. In 2020, he was arrested after police received information that his phone was distributing indecent images of children. In light of this, he was then sentenced in February 2021 at Wood Green Crown Court to eight months in a young offenders' institution, suspended for 24 months and made subject to a sexual harm prevention order. By October 2024, police had identified initial victims and officers discovered footage of him raping a 12-year-old boy after another of his devices was seized. Prosecutor James Brown KC said the paedophile had a \"deep-seated and commercial interest in the sexual abuse of young teenage boys\". He said: \"On Snapchat, there were numerous examples of him advertising broadly and widely for images of a sexual nature from younger teenage boys. \"He frequently offered money for those images. \"He was very much in the business of encouraging young teenage boys to send him images of themselves performing sexual acts.\" Sentencing, judge Timothy Greene told Ehiemere: \"You are a serious danger to young boys with whom you come into contact.\" He also sentenced the predator to a further four-year licence period and an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. In an impact statement read out by Mr Brown, one victim said they were \"waking up with nightmares\" about their tormentor. The victim added: \"It took me a long time to realise I was a child and it wasn't my fault.\" Read more:Former Met Police officer guilty of more sexual offences'Incredibly dangerous' sex offender jailed  Detective Constable Lindsey Luscombe of the Met's Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation team, appealed for other victims to come forward. \"Ehiemere is one of the most prolific and depraved sexual predators we have seen in recent years. He groomed his victims online, demonstrating a dangerous pattern of offending,\" she said. \"This case demonstrates the insidious nature of online child sex abuse and its grave implications in the real world.\" Mitigating for Ehiemere, Barry Kogan said: \"He wishes to express his deep shame and remorse on account of all of his offending. \"He would like to apologise for the distress he has caused.\" He added his client was \"badly influenced\" by an adult who \"encouraged him to make money by selling illegal images of children\". Ehiemere pled guilty to 32 counts before trial, including rape of a child under 13, inciting children to create indecent images, and multiple breaches of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. He was also found guilty by a jury on a further 15 charges relating to sexual assaults and paying for the sexual services of a child."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A fierce warning from Britain's defence secretary to Vladimir Putin to turn his spy ship away from UK waters or face the consequences was a very public attempt to deter the threat. But unless John Healey backs his rhetoric up with a far more urgent push to rearm - and to rebuild wider national resilience - he risks his words ringing as hollow as his military. The defence secretary on Wednesday repeated government plans to increase defence spending and work with NATO allies to bolster European security. Instead of focusing purely on the threat, he also stressed how plans to buy weapons and build arms factories will create jobs and economic growth. In a sign of the government's priorities, job creation is typically the top line of any Ministry of Defence press release about its latest investment in missiles, drones and warships rather than why the equipment is vital to defend the nation. I doubt expanding employment opportunities was the motivating factor in the 1930s when the UK converted car factories into Spitfire production lines to prepare for war with Nazi Germany. Yet communicating to the public what war readiness really means must surely be just as important today. Mr Healey also chose this moment of national peril to attempt to score political points by criticising the previous Conservative government for hollowing out the armed forces - when the military was left in a similarly underfunded state during the last Labour government. A report by a group of MPs, released on the same day as Mr Healey rattled his sabre at Russia, underlined the scale of the challenge the UK faces. It accused the government of lacking a national plan to defend itself from attack. The Defence Select Committee also warned that Mr Healey, Sir Keir Starmer and the rest of the cabinet are moving at a \"glacial\" pace to fix the problem and are failing to launch a \"national conversation on defence and security\" - something the prime minister had promised last year. The report backed up the findings of a wargame podcast by Sky News and Tortoise that simulated what might happen if Russia launched waves of missile strikes against the UK. The series showed how successive defence cuts since the end of the Cold War means the army, navy and air force are woefully equipped to defend the home front. Read more:Russia accuses Britain of being 'provocative' as spy ship nears UKBriton who volunteered as spy for Russia jailed But credible national defences also require the wider country to be prepared for war. A set of plans setting out what must happen in the transition from peace to war was quietly shelved at the start of this century, so there no longer exists a rehearsed and resourced system to ensure local authorities, businesses and the wider population know what to do. Mr Healey revealed that the Russian spy ship had directed a laser light presumably to dazzle pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft that was tracking it. \"That Russian action is deeply dangerous,\" he said. \"So, my message to Russia and to Putin, is this: We see you. We know what you are doing. And if Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\" He did not spell out what this might mean but it could include attempts to block the Russian vessel's passage, or even fire warning shots to force it to retreat. However, any direct engagement could trigger a retaliation from Moscow. For now, the Russian ship - fitted with spying equipment to monitor critical national infrastructure such as communications cables on the seabed - has moved away from the UK coast. It was at its closest between 5 and 11 November. The military is still tracking its movements closely in case the ship returns."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n \"Terrible\", \"weird\", \"peculiar\" and \"baffling\" - some of the adjectives being levelled by observers at the Donald Trump administration's peace plan for Ukraine. The 28-point proposal was cooked up between Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff and Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev without European and Ukrainian involvement. It effectively dresses up Russian demands as a peace proposal. Demands first made by Russia at the high watermark of its invasion in 2022, before defeats forced it to retreat from much of Ukraine. Ukraine war latest: Kyiv receives US peace plan Its proposals are non-starters for Ukrainians. It would hand over the rest of Donbas, territory they have spent almost four years and lost tens of thousands of men defending. Analysts estimate at the current rate of advance, it would take Russia four more years to take the land it is proposing simply to give them instead. It proposes more than halving the size of the Ukrainian military and depriving them of some of their most effective long-range weapons. And it would bar any foreign forces acting as peacekeepers in Ukraine after any peace deal is done.  The plan comes at an excruciating time for the Ukrainians. They are being pounded with devastating drone attacks, killing dozens in the last few nights alone. They are on the verge of losing a key stronghold city, Pokrovsk. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy is embroiled in the gravest political crisis since the war began, with key officials facing damaging corruption allegations. Read more from Sky News:Witkoff's 'secret' plan to end warNavy could react to laser incident  The suspicion is Mr Witkoff and Mr Dmitriev conspired together to choose this moment to put even more pressure on the Ukrainian president. Perversely, though, it may help him. There has been universal condemnation and outrage in Kyiv at the Witkoff-Dmitriev plan. Rivals have little choice but to rally around the wartime Ukrainian leader as he faces such unreasonable demands. The genesis of this plan is unclear. Was it born from Donald Trump's overinflated belief in his peacemaking abilities? His overrated Gaza ceasefire plan attracted lavish praise from world leaders, but now seems mired in deepening difficulty. The fear is Mr Trump's team are finding ways to allow him to walk away from this conflict altogether, blaming Ukrainian intransigence for the failure of his diplomacy. Mr Trump has already ended financial support for Ukraine, acting as an arms dealer instead, selling weapons to Europe to pass on to the invaded democracy. If he were to take away military intelligence support too, Ukraine would be blind to the kind of attacks that in recent days have killed scores of civilians. Europe and Ukraine cannot reject the plan entirely and risk alienating Mr Trump. They will play for time and hope against all the evidence he can still be persuaded to desert the Kremlin and put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war, rather than force Ukraine to surrender instead."

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n  If you're not at the table then you're on the menu, as the saying goes. That's why Ukraine and Europe are so concerned about reports of a new peace plan being drawn up without them. Their fears appear to be well-founded. The plan's proposals reportedly include two major concessions for Kyiv - that it must give up territory in the Donbas which Russia has not yet seized, and that it must dramatically reduce its armed forces. Ukraine war latest: Trump 'approves 28-point Ukraine peace plan' Sound familiar? That's because it is. These are two of Vladimir Putin's long-held, key demands for peace. The 'new' peace plan represents the latest about-turn from the Trump administration on how it approaches the conflict. After the failure of the Alaska summit, and last month's fractious phone call between Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and US secretary of state Marco Rubio (which led to the cancellation of a second summit in Budapest and US sanctions on Russian oil), it seemed like Ukraine had finally convinced Donald Trump to change tack. \n                  Buying cocaine on a Friday night may inadvertently fund Russia's war in Ukraine, Britons warned \n                 \n                  Ukraine and Europe cannot reject Trump's plan - they will play for time and hope he can still be persuaded to desert the Kremlin\n                 \n                  Navy could fire warning shot or cut off Russian 'spy ship' after laser incident, says ex-MI6 boss\n                 Instead of showing Moscow patience, he began applying pressure in the hope of forcing Russia to make concessions and to meet Ukraine somewhere in the middle. But now it's all change once again. The key player seems to have been Kirill Dmitriev - the Kremlin's investment envoy and a close ally of Vladimir Putin - who has operated as Steve Witkoff's opposite number in peace negotiations. Whenever the US special envoy has been in Moscow this year, Dmitriev has always been close by. He is Putin's Witkoff whisperer. After the Lavrov-Rubio bust-up, Dmitriev was sent to Miami to supposedly patch things up through Witkoff. He did more than, it seems.  Read more from Sky News:Witkoff's 'secret' plan to end warNavy could react to laser incident What's reportedly emerged from their discussions is a 28-point peace plan that has been signed off by Donald Trump. Will Ukraine go for it? I very much doubt it. If the reports are correct, the US-Russia proposals merely represent the Kremlin's long-held demands, and Ukraine's long-held red lines. For Kyiv, it's a non-starter. But President Zelenskyy will have to tread carefully. Failure to show engagement could rile Donald Trump and trigger an ultimatum - accept this plan or you're on your own."

        "Content": " Nearly 1,000 people from three villages on the Indonesian island of Java have been forced to flee to shelters after the eruption of its highest volcano. More than 170 people, including climbers, porters, guides, tourism officials and tourists, were rescued after Mount Semeru erupted on Wednesday. No casualties have been reported during the evacuation of those most at risk in the district of Lumajang, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency. The eruption sent searing clouds of hot ash and a mixture of rock, lava and gas up to eight miles (13km) down the volcano's slopes, officials said. They had set out to climb the 3,676m (12,060ft) peak on Wednesday and were stranded at the Ranu Kumbolo camping area before being taken to safety, Priatin Hadi Wijaya, head of the Centre for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, told reporters. Hetty Triastuty, from the centre, warned climbers may have been exposed to volcanic ash. A thick column of hot clouds rose 1.2 miles (2km) into the air during the eruptions, from midday to dusk on Wednesday, as scientists raised the volcano's alert to the highest level, Indonesia's geology agency chief Muhammad Wafid said. The eruptions that unfolded throughout the day blanketed several villages with thick volcanic ash and blocked out sunlight. Local media reported that two motorcyclists crashed due to hot ash on a bridge, resulting in severe burns to their bodies. A series of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), defined by the British Geological Survey as \"hot, ground-hugging flows of ash and debris\" capable of moving at hundreds of metres per second, travelled down the mountain's southern slope through the Besuk Kobokan River valley slopes, Mr Wafid said. \"Mount Semeru's seismicity activity indicated that the eruption continued at a high level, with increasing numbers of signals indicating avalanches,\" he added. Mr Wafid warned people to keep away from an area along the Besuk Kobokan River, which is the path of the lava flow, adding that the five-mile (8km) danger zone may be expanded. Seismic activity suggests the eruption will continue, officials said. Mount Semeru, also known as Mahameru, has erupted numerous times in the past 200 years. But as with many of Indonesia's 129 active volcanoes, tens of thousands of people continue to live nearby.

The Indonesian archipelago sits along the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines, and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity."

Just as the host nation was desperately trying to corral more than 190 countries towards unity at talks in Belem, delegates ended up having to flee the short-lived blaze. The fire broke out in the pavilion area of COP30, where groups showcase their efforts, prompting an evacuation across the site. It was swiftly put out and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation, officials said, with the cause thought to be an electrical fault. But it will make the hard task of negotiations even harder, and they had already missed a self-imposed deadline to wrap up the first batch of deals on Wednesday evening. Representatives have travelled from all corners of the globe to get together in the same room to try to solve some of the world's biggest challenges. The UN climate body (UNFCCC) has not yet confirmed when the site will reopen. Talks were stuck on how to close the gap between the level of warming the world is on course for, compared to that which governments previously agreed would be a better, safe level.

The most controversial solutions being discussed for this first agreement are the future of fossil fuels and the delivery of finance to help developing nations switch to clean energy and cope with the impacts of climate change they did little to cause. About 80 countries have been lobbying for a plan or \"roadmap\" for how to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" - a pledge made at COP28 two years ago but which has subsequently been swept under the carpet. Another dividing line was how rich countries, which generally have done more to cause climate change, should help poorer countries cope with more extreme weather that tends to hit them hardest. Previous funding promises have materialised late or not in the form promised. And for the first time critical minerals - vital for green technology like EVs and solar panels - may make it into one of the COP decisions to come later in the week."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has signed a bill approving the release of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein by the US Justice Department. \"I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he said in a Truth Social post, following a lengthy preamble aimed at discrediting the Democrats. \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories,\" he continued. It comes after the Senate finished the formalities and sent the proposed legislation to the president's desk, having comfortably cleared a vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The Justice Department now has 30 days to release the documents it holds on the paedophile financier. How did we get here? Mr Trump promised during last year's election campaign to release the Epstein files in full, but has since spent months decrying them as a Democratic \"hoax\". His links to Epstein have long been subject to scrutiny. Mr Trump has always denied any wrongdoing. His change of heart on releasing the files came as a surprise over the weekend, as he called on Republicans in Congress to vote for the so-called Epstein Files Bill and indicated he'd sign it. \"Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor [sic] of passage,\" Mr Trump wrote in his late-night post announcing the signing of the bill. The House of Representatives was indeed near unanimous in voting for the material to be released, with 427 in favour and one against. Hot on the heels of that vote, which was met with cheers in the chamber, the Senate said it too would pass the bill.  Trump tries to tie Democrats to Epstein Mr Trump's post repeatedly labels Epstein as a Democrat, citing his past associations with the likes of Bill Clinton. Mr Trump has said he wants the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's links to Mr Clinton, former treasury secretary Larry Summers, and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder, who is also a prominent Democratic donor. All three men were mentioned in the 20,000 other Epstein-related documents released by Congress's House Oversight Committee last week. None of them, however, have been accused of wrongdoing in the case. Mr Summers did announce he would be stepping back from public life on Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply ashamed\" by his relationship with Epstein. US correspondent Prosecutors don't usually release documents during a live investigation.\n That's raised questions about whether the Justice Department will redact or withhold certain files.\n There's also going to be a lot of information about people not accused of any wrongdoing.\n So, the question remains: will the files actually be released fully - and unredacted?\n Tap here to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts Emails, photos and other documents released by Congress in recent weeks have included references to Mr Trump, the UK's since sacked US ambassador Lord Mandelson, and former British prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced calls from members of the committee to give evidence. Like Mr Trump, both Britons have denied any wrongdoing and expressed regret about their relationship with Epstein. The deadline for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to respond to an official request from the committee is today.  The family of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre, described the signing of the Epstein Files Bill as \"nothing short of monumental\". \"This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" they said in a statement given to Sky News. \"For Virginia, her sisters, and survivors across the world, this is a momentous step towards a long-overdue justice.\" Unrest in MAGA world The Epstein scandal has proved to be a major source of division within Mr Trump's Make America Great Again movement. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time Trump backer who publicly fell out with the president just days ago, stood with Epstein survivors on the steps of the Capitol ahead of Tuesday's Congress votes. She said: \"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up.\" Read more: Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene?  Epstein died by suicide in his prison cell in August 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was already a registered sex offender after pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state changes of unlawfully paying a teenage girl for sex."

Bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion and the embassy in Nine Elms, southwest London, went into lockdown after a civilian guard raised the alarm about the suspicious items on the morning of 22 November last year. Daniel Parmenter, 44, denied intending to cause alarm. He maintained that the package was \"graffiti art\" and claimed that staff at the embassy would recognise it was not an explosive device. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, the defendant, from Bayswater, west London, was found not guilty of placing an article with intent. Mr Parmenter wasn't there to hear the not guilty verdict though, as he had gone home earlier in the day after the jury retired His barrister told the court that his client, who had been on bail, had completely misunderstood that he was meant to stay and was cycling back to court. He said: \"He is riding back as quickly as he can. I can hear the wind in his earphones. He did sound genuinely shocked on the phone.\" Suspicious package provoked panic  The prosecutor had previously set out how Mr Parmenter had left a suspicious item in an alleyway by the embassy at around 6am. This was then spotted at 8.30am by the guard who was on a routine patrol who \"panicked\" when she noticed what she thought looked like a bomb. She took a photograph of the suspected bomb before going to the embassy to raise the alarm. A police officer on duty at the embassy who went to the alleyway described seeing a drum, some photo frames, and a large metal tray with writing and a skull and crossbones on it. The prosecutor said: \"Next to all of this on the floor next to the wall was what appeared to be an IED [improvised explosive device], it was an old-style iPad with a keypad and firework wires all taped.\" Three bomb disposal officers attended the scene and carried out a controlled explosion. CCTV from the area led to the identification and arrest of Parmenter at the home he shares with his mother two days later. When he answered the door, he was wearing the same hat and jumper seen in the CCTV footage. Parmenter, who has autism spectrum disorder, denied meaning any harm, saying: \"It is basically a form of slightly sophisticated graffiti art of the non-vandal type.\" Read more from Sky News:Mixed news ahead of Budget 2025Keir Starmer preparing for trip to China, Sky News understands In a formal police interview, Mr Parmenter said he placed items outside the US embassy as an \"art installation\". He conceded that the items may, to the untrained eye, look like a suspicious device, but said it was never intended that way. He told police he had left other gifts at places on Halloween, saying on that occasion he gave the US embassy a framed print relating to 9/11."

        "Content": " Tens of thousands of files relating to the late paedophile and financier Jeffrey Epstein are due to be made public within the next month. Donald Trump has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, forcing the disclosure of a wide range of files linked to civil and criminal cases involving Epstein. The material could shed more light on the activities of Epstein, who socialised with high-profile figures including the likes of Donald Trump, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson. Trump latest: Details of Epstein files release Their connections have already been revealed in more than 20,000 files made public last week. The US justice department has turned over more than 33,000 pages to the House Oversight Committee. But a judge who presided over an Epstein-related case this year said there are roughly 100,000 pages in total. Here is what the public should expect to see: \n                  G20 still 'really important' despite Donald Trump's absence, says Sir Keir Starmer\n                 \n                  Is Trump using Ukrainian corruption to force a peace deal?\n                 \n                  Trump signs bill approving release of Epstein files\n                 What must be released? The legislation is far-reaching and specifies exactly what categories of files must be turned over by the justice department within the next 30 days. It demands the release of all files relating to Epstein himself, including investigations, prosecutions and custodial matters, as well as records connected to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate who is serving a 20-year prison term for sex trafficking. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  The legislation requires that files are released about individuals, including government officials, named or connected to Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity agreements, plea bargains or investigatory proceedings. Other files which must be turned over include internal communications, including emails, memos, and meeting notes, concerning decisions to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates. Politicians have said this is critical to uncovering whether powerful figures have received special treatment or protection. It is also a direct response to criticism of a controversial 2008 plea deal in Florida, which allowed Epstein to avoid federal sex trafficking charges and instead plead guilty to lesser state charges. Another closely watched provision involves the release of flight logs and travel records, revealing who may have travelled with Epstein. There has been ongoing public scepticism about Epstein's death in custody in New York in 2019, deemed to be suicide, while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The bill orders the release of documentation about Epstein's detention and death, including incident reports, witness interviews, medical examiner files, autopsy reports, and written records detailing the circumstances and cause of death. Finally, there is even a clause about the paperwork trail relating to any destruction, deletion, or concealment of files or electronic data related to Epstein.  Will we be able to see everything? Some of the files released so far have been partly redacted, with victims' names, passenger names and details of ongoing investigations obscured. The legislation also allows the attorney general to withhold some files, including records that \"would jeopardise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\". It is unclear how that might affect files being released because the legislation doesn't define how long \"temporary\" is or what the penalty for failing to comply would be. But the bill's language makes it clear that the bar to withhold information is high, even \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity\". Read more from Sky News:Trump pledges to release 'everything'MAGA meltdown over EpsteinMaxwell appeals to Trump over sentence Why are the files being released now? Until recently, Donald Trump had urged Republican politicians to oppose the release of Epstein files. But he reversed course this week as it became clear the bill had enough support to pass with or without his backing. Only 20% of Americans - including just 44% of Republicans - approve of how Trump has handled the Epstein case, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Around 70% of poll respondents - including 87% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans - said they believe the government is hiding information about Epstein's clients. The US president accused Democrats of weaponising the Epstein scandal to undermine his accomplishments and divert attention from what he called Republican policy victories. He has ordered the justice department to investigate several Democratic figures who were associated with Epstein. What has the fallout been so far? Wealthy and powerful figures have appeared in Epstein's social circle, although their mention in the Epstein files does not mean they are involved in any wrongdoing. So far, there is no evidence suggesting anyone else, except Ghislaine Maxwell, was involved in sex trafficking with Epstein. However, some high-profile individuals have suffered significant reputational damage after they maintained ties to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Trump, Andrew, Mandelson: Who appears in Epstein files? Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince who was recently stripped of his titles, has faced calls to give evidence to the US Congress about his relationship with Epstein. He has previously denied allegations of sexually assaulting Virginia Giuffre, who says she was trafficked by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.  According to the files, Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK ambassador to the US in September, still had contact with Epstein in 2016. And former US treasury secretary Larry Summers continued to stay in touch with Epstein after his 2008 conviction, asking him at one point for relationship advice. Mr Summers said this week he was \"deeply ashamed\" and would be stepping back from public life. The family of Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year and released a posthumous autobiography about her abuse as a teenager, have released a statement. They said the decision to release the files was \"nothing short of monumental\". \"Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation. For Virginia, her sisters, and survivors across the world, this is a momentous step towards a long-overdue justice. \"We await the full release of the Epstein files from the Department of Justice eagerly, and we will not stop until the full truth is out.\""

Nvidia's announcement of another round of record-breaking sales was \"an extremely important moment in the AI Revolution thesis\", said financial services firm Wedbush. Nvidia's computer chips are powering much of the AI surge and are a key component in generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. Money blog: Market town with 12,000 residents Britain's least affordable Some are taking the results and the company's forecast of strong sales to come as a clear signal that AI and tech stocks have not been overvalued, that there is no bubble waiting to burst. Tech companies have seen their share price and valuations soar as investors hope to benefit from investment in AI. The main beneficiary has been Nvidia itself, which became the first company to be worth $5trn in October this year. \"The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble... Instead, it's year three of a 10-year build out of this 4th industrial revolution in our view,\" the Wedbush industry note read. \n                  Households and business must wait for energy bills to fall - as minister says there is 'no shortcut' to bring down prices\n                 \n                  Nvidia beats expectations again in defiance of AI bubble fears\n                 \n                  Market town with 12,000 residents named Britain's least affordable | Money blog\n                 As investors welcomed Nvidia's \"spotless\" results, in the words of trading platform Capital.com, there was clear enthusiasm for tech and AI adjacent companies on Thursday. Across Asia and Europe, tech companies and Nvidia competitors saw their share prices rise.  Doubts about valuations have, for now, been staved off and bubble worries soothed. The chip maker announced $57bn of revenue in the three months to October and anticipated $65bn in sales in its next results. It was \"as comforting as a warm cup of tea on a cold day, providing investors with the energy to increase their risk appetite and giving a nice glow to the market once again\", Russ Mould, investment director at investor platform AJ Bell, said. Risks still there The sense of calm is unlikely to be permanent. AI confidence has been battered in the past years by the success of China's Deepseek AI model, the US-China trade wars and tariff fears; there's still plenty to dent confidence. And not everyone has been reassured by Nvidia's latest numbers. US trader Michael Burry, made famous for his bet on the pre-financial crash US housing market slump and played by Christian Bale in the Hollywood film The Big Short, has effectively bet that Nvidia's share price will fall. After the results were published, Mr Burry posted an image of major AI companies, saying: \"True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers.\" The statement highlights concern about deals among the big tech entities, that they're self-fulfilling, circular and being funded by borrowed money."

The supermarket had £3.8bn in net debt at the end of 2024, the same as at the end of 2023, its latest full-year accounts show. Asda's ownership had been subject to political scrutiny in recent years. MPs on the Business and Trade Select Committee raised the issue in hearings in July and December 2023. The company's labyrinthine corporate structure was the subject of questions from MPs, as there are 16 different entities between the owners and the supermarket operating company, many of them registered offshore. Supermarket chain Morrisons is also owned by private equity. Just over a year ago, it struck a £370m deal to unlock value from its property portfolio as it sought to shrink its debt pile. What's happening to the Asda stores? Two separate buyers have been found for the shops: four - Small Heath in Birmingham, Colindale in London, Coventry Abbey Park and Killingbeck, Leeds- have been sold to real estate manager DTZ Investors and leased back. Twenty shops and the Lutterworth depot have been sold to private credit group Blue Owl Capital and also leased back. The leases will last 25 years with an option to renew for an extra 10 years. The transactions have raised £568m, an Asda spokesperson said. \"Asda's property strategy is centred on maintaining a strong freehold base while also taking a considered and selective approach to unlocking value from our estate where appropriate. \"These transactions reflect that approach, enabling us to realise value from the sites while retaining full operational control.\""

        "Content": "Consumer confidence has tumbled amid rampant speculation about what the chancellor will announce in the budget, figures show. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) blamed \"strong hints\" from the government of income tax hikes for the public's falling expectations of how much they'll spend over the next three months - even as Christmas beckons. While a planned increase in income tax rates was scrapped last week, Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out freezing income tax thresholds - which the Conservatives argue amounts to a tax rise by stealth because it drags people into paying higher rates even if their wages increase. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said months of uncertainty had \"heightened public concern about their own finances and the wider economy\". Consumer expectations for the state of the economy over the next three months have fallen significantly to minus 44, down from minus 35 in October, according to data from the BRC and Opinium. Ms Dickinson said action was needed from Rachel Reeves to \"bring down the spiralling cost burden facing retailers\", which she said would \"keep price rises in check\". Read more: Inflation eases but food costs rise  Signs of 'fragile' recovery in jobs market In slightly more encouraging news for Ms Reeves ahead of her statement next Wednesday, new research suggests the jobs market may be on the up. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said the number of new job adverts last month was 754,359, up by 2.1% from September, taking the total to more than 1.6 million. Ms Reeves's decision to hike national insurance contributions for employers in last year's budget was blamed for a slowdown in the market, and a rising unemployment rate. The report said there has been an increase in adverts for medical radiographers, delivery drivers and couriers, and further education teaching professionals. But it warned the apparent recovery was \"fragile\".  Reeves set to back DLR extension One man looking forward to the budget is Sir Sadiq Khan, who has welcomed reports that London's DLR is set to be given funding for an extension. According to the Press Association, the chancellor will back an extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Thamesmead at a cost of £1.7bn - unlocking thousands of new homes. Thamesmead has been notoriously short of public transport links ever since it was developed in the 1960s. The plan would see the line extended from Gallions Reach, near London City Airport, and include a new station at Beckton as well as in Thamesmead itself. Sir Sadiq said the DLR extension \"will not only transform travel in a historically under-served part of the capital but also unlock thousands of new jobs and homes, boosting the economy not just locally but nationally\". It is also expected to unlock land for 25,000 new homes and up to 10,000 new jobs, along with almost £18bn of private investment in the area."

Baroness Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, described the response to the pandemic as \"too little, too late\".

Noting how a \"lack of urgency\" made a mandatory lockdown \"inevitable\", the report references modelling data to claim there could have been 23,000 fewer deaths during the first wave in England had it been introduced a week earlier. The UK government first introduced advisory restrictions on 16 March 2020, including self-isolation, household quarantine and social distancing.

They tried to undermine Lady Hallet's attempt to understand what went wrong and how we might do better as a lame exercise that would achieve very little.  Well, we now know that Boris Johnson’s \"toxic and chaotic\" government could well have prevented at least 23,000 deaths had they acted sooner and with greater urgency. The response was \"too little, too late\".  And that nobody in power truly understood the scale of the emerging threat or the urgency of the response it required.  The grieving families who lost loved ones in the pandemic want answers. They want names. And they want accountability.  But that is beyond the remit of this Inquiry. The publication of the report into Module 2 will bring them no comfort, it may even cause them more distress but it will bring them closer to understanding why the UK's response to this unprecedented health crisis was so poor.  And we can easily identify the \"advisors and ministers whose alleged rule breaking caused huge distress and undermined public confidence\".  Or who was in charge of the Department of Health and Social Care, as it misled the public by giving the impression that the UK was well prepared for the pandemic when it clearly was not.  'Toxic culture' at the heart of UK government The report said there was \"a toxic and chaotic culture\" at the heart of the UK government during the pandemic. The inquiry heard evidence about the \"destabilising behaviour of a number of individuals\" - including former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings. It said that by failing to tackle this chaotic culture - \"and, at times, actively encouraging it\" - former PM Boris Johnson \"reinforced a culture in which the loudest voices prevailed and the views of other colleagues, particularly women, often went ignored, to the detriment of good decision-making\". 'Misleading assurances' The inquiry found all four governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland failed to understand the urgency of response the pandemic demanded in the early part of 2020. The report reads: \"This was compounded, in part, by misleading assurances from the Department of Health and Social Care and the widely held view that the UK was well prepared for a pandemic.\" The report notes how the UK government took a \"high risk\" when it significantly eased restrictions in England in July 2020 - \"despite scientific advisers' concerns about the public health risks of doing so\". Lady Hallett has made 19 key recommendations which, if followed, she believes will better protect the UK in any future pandemic and improve decision-making in a crisis. Repeated failings 'inexcusable' In a statement following the publication of Thursday's report, Lady Hallett said there was a \"serious failure\" by all four governments to appreciate the level of \"risk and calamity\" facing the UK. She said: \"The tempo of the response should have been increased. It was not. February 2020 was a lost month.\" Read more:A timeline of the UK's response to the pandemic Lady Hallett said the inquiry does not advocate for national lockdowns, which she said should have been avoided if at all possible. She said: \"But to avoid them, governments must take timely and decisive action to control a spreading virus. The four governments of the UK did not.\" Lady Hallett said none of the governments were adequately prepared for the challenges and risks that a lockdown presented, and that many of the same failings were repeated later in 2020, which she said was \"inexcusable\". She added: \"Each government had ample warning that the prevalence of the virus was increasing and would continue to do so into the winter months. Yet again, there was a failure to take timely and effective action.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  Sir Keir Starmer has insisted the G20 still matters and is a \"really important\" forum to bang the drum for British business, despite the decision of Donald Trump to boycott the international summit in South Africa. Asked what he thought of the US president's decision, the prime minister simply said Mr Trump had \"set out his position\". The PM added he thought it was \"really important to be [at the G20] to talk to other partners and allies so we can get on with the discussions around global issues that have to be addressed, and do have an impact back at home, but also to take the opportunity face to face to further the deals that I want to do for our country\". Politics latest - follow live Sir Keir has faced heavy criticism at home for the amount of time he has spent overseas and focusing on international affairs. His trip to South Africa to attend the G20 summit is the 45th country the prime minister has visited since taking office. Speaking to journalists on the flight over to Johannesburg, Sir Keir defended his decision to fly out days before a difficult budget, saying that the international issues being discussed in South Africa have an impact at home, while the G20 nations are important to Britain's economy.  \"The G20 are the 20 strongest economies in the world, they are very important to the UK,\" he said. \n                  Is Trump using Ukrainian corruption to force a peace deal?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has approved the release of the Epstein files - what happens now?\n                 \n                  Trump signs bill approving release of Epstein files\n                 \"In the last three years, the jobs that have been generated in the UK from countries in the G20 is 200,000 and that focus in the budget will be very much the economy and the cost of living. I will focus on the deals we can do, the business we can do with our partner countries and make sure that the work we do internationally is impacting directly at home in the positive sense, that if you want to deal with the cost of living and make people better off, good, secure jobs with investment from G20 partners and allies is really important.\"As part of these efforts, the government will announce £400m worth of export deals with South Africa during the summit.  This summit is the first one in the G20's 26-year history that a US president has not attended, with one diplomatic source acknowledging this was raising serious concerns. They said: \"Trump also made the argument that the G7 should be the G8 [at the last meeting in Canada in June] and now he's not even going to the G20, so his lack of attendance is, of course an issue.\" Mr Trump has also ordered US officials not to travel to South Africa for the annual meeting, although the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said on Thursday evening that this might change, with discussions now under way with the US. While Mr Trump is not attending, Sir Keir will leave the G20 summit early, coming back to the UK on Sunday to prepare for a tax-raising, and possibly manifesto-breaking budget on Wednesday. The chancellor raised £40bn in taxes in the last budget, insisting that this was a \"once in a parliament\" tax raid. A year on, Rachel Reeves now has to raise billions more as she looks to fill a black hole as much as £30bn in the public finances, driven in part by a downgrade in productivity, which has lowered growth forecasts, and also her reversal on spending cuts - the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits - that has left her with around £7bn to find.  The government has U-turned on its plan to raise income tax but is expected to extend a freeze on tax thresholds by two years from 2028. The measure will raise about £10bn in additional tax as workers find themselves dragged into higher tax bands and has led to accusations that Labour has broken its manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people. The prime minister, asked whether everyone should expect tax rises in the budget on Wednesday, refused to answer directly. Instead, he said it would be \"a Labour budget with Labour values\" and based on \"fairness\". He added: \"It will have absolutely in mind protecting our public services, particularly the NHS, cutting our debt, and dealing with the cost of living, bearing down on the cost of living. So, they'll be the principles that will run through the budget. \"Now, of course, the right decisions have to be taken. And we have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we've had the crash in '08, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed by Ukraine, and that's why we have to take the decision to get this back on track. \"I'm optimistic about the future, I do think if we get this right, our country has a great future. They'll be the principles behind the budget.\"  While the prime minister is focusing on trade at the G20 summit, Ukraine will also be on the agenda amid reports the Trump administration and Russian officials have drawn up a new peace plan to end the war there. It would require major concessions from Kyiv, including giving up territory not currently occupied by Russia to Moscow and halving the size of the Ukrainian army. The deal has reportedly been drawn up by Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met the current secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, in Miami. Asked about the plan, Sir Keir said he wanted a \"just and lasting peace\", adding: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine, and we must never lose sight of that\". I'm told by one diplomatic source that the Europeans have yet to see this plan, while there are questions as to how advanced in the US administration these proposals are and whether they have the support of Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  European diplomats are stressing that any peace talks have to involve both Ukraine and European input if it is to have any hope of working. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on the eve of the G20 summit they are yet to see any concessions on the Russian side. \"We welcome all meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting,\" she said. \"That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.\" European leaders are discussing how to best equip Kyiv for another winter of war. Talks are expected to continue this weekend over the plan to use Russia's frozen assets to generate a €140bn loan for Ukraine. The plan is currently stalled over Belgium's concerns of legal risk in releasing funds from the Brussels-based depository Euroclear, where most of the Russian assets are held. Earlier on Thursday, Sky News revealed Sir Keir is preparing for a likely visit to China in the new year. The trip is likely to be controversial given the UK's fractious relationship with China, made worse by recent allegations of spying in parliament. Sir Keir said any visit was not confirmed \"yet\" and insisted the government would \"always robustly protect our interests\"."

        "Content": "\n          Data journalist\n              @joelysantacruz\n Housing Secretary Steve Reed wants Britain to \"build, baby, build\" towards the government's flagship 1.5 million homes target by the next election. But housebuilding in England has slowed to its lowest level in nine years, with the number of homes built falling by 6% to 208,600 in the year to March 2025. A combination of rising building costs and weakening house prices has left \"half of the country unviable (for development projects) and the other half of the country unaffordable\", Steve Turner, executive director of the Home Builders Federation (HBF), told Sky News. Ambitions for affordability are competing with high safety and design standards, which have been pushing up costs. The government acknowledges housing delivery has not reached required levels - but maintains building will ramp up as their policies come into effect. Since the election, 275,000 homes have been delivered to date, compared to the 400,000 that would have needed to be on track for 1.5 million homes. \"Additional housing is now at around 200,000 homes a year and is at best flatlining. We're still some way away from where the government wants to get to, to meet the nation's housing need,\" Mr Turner said. The rising price of materials and labour have contributed to the increase in the cost of building homes in recent years - for example, the cost of bricks and clay products increased by over 26% in the year to August 2023. \n                  A Danish style asylum system? How the UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare\n                 \n                  The rise of Christian nationalism in Britain and its relationship with the far right\n                 \n                  Thousands targeted in 'killing fields' around Sudanese city in paramilitary group's hands\n                 At the same time, higher interest rates since 2022 have increased the cost of financing development, in addition to weakening buyer demand, as mortgage rates have soared. As a result, the sales value of homes has not kept pace, eating into profit margins in a trap described as the \"jaws of death\" by housing developers. While the cost of building homes has increased by just under 13% on average since September 2022, house prices have increased by less than 3% on average across Britain, while flat prices in London have decreased by 0.5%. The government is currently consulting on emergency measures to \"get spades in the ground\" in London after the number of new homes starting construction in the capital plummeted to just 4,000 in the latest year to June 2025 - a fraction of the area's 81,000 building target. These include a funding package and temporary reductions in affordable housing targets from 35% to 20%, as well as relief from some levies. Housebuilders have also faced increased costs from updated building design standards introduced from 2022 onwards, including fire safety rules mandating a second fire escape stairwell for tall buildings, and regulations to improve energy efficiency, ventilation, and electric vehicle infrastructure. The greatest impact is in London. High-rise housing is more common, and additional Greater London Authority regulations require more affordable housing and additional requirements such as \"dual aspect\" design. A recent report by Savills estate agency and property developers Ballymore estimates that delivering homes in Greater London now costs 10-15% more than elsewhere, thanks to these requirements. Property developers told Sky News that new building and fire safety regulations add costs of around £21,500 per home for a two-bedroom flat in London, while community infrastructure levies add £12,000 on average and can be as high as £50,000 in some areas. New costs - a 4% residential development tax and a building safety levy costing between £1,500 and £3,500 per home - are expected to be added in the near future. \"The viability of sites is very, very strained and is snuffing out general supply of new homes from the UK's housing pipeline,\" Nick Cuff, managing director of real estate advisory and development business Urban Sketch, told Sky News. \"We're just not funding these things properly, and we're asking the private sector to pick up the bill in almost all cases. We are effectively seeing a cessation in development activity because it cannot support the requirements that government is placing on it now. And that's why the numbers have dropped off a cliff in the last two years,\" he added. Affordable social housing is mostly built by private developers through a cross-subsidy model, which requires private housebuilding to be viable as well. While some are hoping for emergency measures in London to be made permanent, others are wary of a race to the bottom. \"If at the first test, you pull back on the [affordable homes] target, what message are you sending? It must be temporary - we need to see if it does then move the market,\" Rachael Williamson, director of policy, communications and external affairs at the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH), told Sky News. \"We've got to manage the tension [between safety and costs] without saying 'let's cut corners'. History tells us where you get to with that,\" she added. Outside of London Though these issues have been particularly fraught in London, the rest of the country also faces significant challenges. Analysis by online property portal Zoopla finds it is now not viable to build in just under half of England, on the basis that the sales value of homes is less than the total cost of delivering a new home. The analysis excludes figures for London, though research firm Molior separately found that housebuilding in half of London would be unviable even if housing and infrastructure contribution requirements were completely removed. They also found that those areas where building is viable are the areas where people were less likely to be able to afford to buy, creating a mismatch between supply and demand. The viability to develop new homes is better in the south of England, where new build prices are among the most unaffordable for buyers. Although planning reforms have been \"very positive\", Mr Turner said it only addresses one side of the equation, and that the government \"needs to find a way to support buyers, which will then create confidence with house builders that ultimately they can sell the product they deliver\". There is currently no suggestion that the government intends to revive a version of the Help to Buy scheme, which critics have argued contributed to increasing house prices and reducing affordability in the long run. Long-term planning needed Speculation around the upcoming budget has also added to uncertainty, and developers have called on the government to rethink proposed landfill tax changes, which would further add to building costs. \"We've definitely seen an increase in regulation over the last few years. Often very well-meaning regulation, but which can hinder the viability of sites and developments,\" a spokesperson for the homebuilder Barratt Redrow told Sky News. \"We buy land on the basis of the costs of construction, including the regulatory burden, at the time, and obviously, if four years later, when we've got planning permission, it's more expensive to build, then that is going to have an impact on whether it makes financial sense to go ahead with the development, \"As an industry and also as a business, we're not against the right sort of regulation, but it's important we've got long-term certainty because the process of buying land and building houses is so long and involves such risk,\" he added. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Today's statistics show, in the clearest terms yet, the extent of the housing crisis we inherited and are now fixing. \"We took over a planning system that blocked rather than built, and high inflation and soaring construction costs that created a perfect storm holding back housebuilding. \"Our 1.5 million homes target is not just a number - it's a way to give children a secure home, for young people finally to move out and enjoy independence, and for working families to have a place to call their own. \"We have already taken down the barriers that stopped this country from building, overhauled the planning system and pumped record investment into social housing. This will bring about the change we need to end the housing crisis by getting spades in the ground wherever homes are needed most.\" Development 'hit by a perfect storm of costs' A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"Through the London Plan, the mayor has been able to set the highest housing design standards relative to other parts of the country, and these standards have supported the delivery of high-quality homes in London \"However, London needs more sites coming forward to meet the capital's housing needs, and development has been hit by a perfect storm of costs from national policy and wider economic conditions that disproportionately affects London. \"Through our proposed changes to London Plan design guidance, we are hoping to reduce the barriers to housebuilding and introduce flexibility so that planning policies are applied in line with their original intent - helping to bring developments forward. These measures will help to unblock stalled building sites, giving the mayor stronger levers to approve homes and bring forward thousands of homes more quickly.\" The Data x Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

It followed the collapse of a prosecution of two people suspected of spying on behalf of China. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said: \"These claims by the UK side are pure fabrication and malicious slander. We strongly condemn such despicable moves of the UK side and have lodged stern representations with them. \"We urge the UK side to immediately stop this self-staged charade of false accusations and self-aggrandisement, and stop going further down the wrong path of undermining China-UK relations.\" Rigby said the trip would be a \"massive moment\", noting that the last prime minister to visit China was Theresa May in 2018. Last month Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The US president described the talks with China's president as \"amazing\" and said \"on the scale of one to 10, the meeting with Xi was 12\".

        "Content": " They've been billed as the \"most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times\" and the \"biggest shake-up of the legal migration system\" in nearly 50 years, but how are the UK's rules actually changing? One of the biggest changes will impact almost two million migrants already living in the UK while other proposals will affect people who come here in the future. Here's how... How is 'settled status' changing?  Until now, migrants who live in the UK have needed to wait five years before they can apply to settle permanently but this qualifying period will double to 10 years - and some people could have to wait even longer. Almost two million migrants will be affected by the changes. Those \"making a strong contribution to British life\" will benefit from a reduced timeframe. \n                  A Danish style asylum system? How the UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare\n                 \n                  More children to face deportation under government's asylum crackdown\n                 \n                  Nadjib, who tipped off police over released prisoner Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, tells Sky News he's 'happy to see him arrested'\n                 That means doctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years, while high earners and entrepreneurs may able to stay after just three years. Migrants who speak English to a high standard and volunteer could also have a faster route to settlement. At the other end of the scale, low-paid workers will be subject to a 15-year wait. With this, the government is explicitly targeting the 616,000 people and their dependents who came to the UK on health and social care visas between 2022 and 2024 - the so-called \"Boriswave\". The government is going further still in targeting migrants who rely on benefits, quadrupling the current wait to 20 years. There are also plans to limit benefits and social housing to British citizens only. And though recognised refugees who came to the UK legally will still be eligible for public funding, they too will be subject to the 20-year timeframe. How will asylum rules change? Inspired by immigration policy in Denmark, refugee status will become temporary, lasting only until it's safe for the person in question to return home. This means that asylum seekers will be granted leave to remain for 30 months, instead of the current five years, with the period only extendable if they still face danger in their homeland.  However, refugees will be eligible to settle sooner if they get a job or enter education \"at an appropriate level\" under a new \"work and study\" visa route, and pay a fee. The government also plans to revoke its legal duty to support asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, a measure it says was introduced to comply with EU laws which Britain is no longer bound by. Instead, support will be discretionary, and some people will be excluded - such as criminals, those who refuse to relocate, those who can work but won't, those who are disruptive in their accommodation, and those who deliberately make themselves destitute. Additionally, asylum seekers who have assets or income will be required to contribute to the cost of supporting themselves. What about illegal migrants? Meanwhile, illegal migrants and those who overstay their visas face a wait of up to 30 years before qualifying for permanent settlement. But plans to bar criminals from settlement are still being figured out, with the government saying \"work will take place to consider the precise threshold\" at which someone is ineligible. \"The reforms will make Britain's settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe,\" according to the government. Alongside the new measures, plans are afoot to boost the number of migrants being removed from the UK. What about illegal migrants who are already here? A \"one in, one out\" agreement is already in place with France, under which those who cross the channel illegally are to be sent back, with Britain accepting instead a \"security-checked migrant... via a safe and legal route\". \"This pilot is under way, and the government is working in partnership with French on expansion,\" according to the government. Furthermore, refugees will not have automatic family reunion rights, and the removal of families of failed asylum seekers is to be stepped up. Read more:Countries facing Trump-style visa ban under asylum reformsWhy Labour MPs are uncomfortable with the new asylum approach Perhaps controversial are plans to offer financial support to those who agree to go voluntary. The government argues this is \"the most cost-effective approach for UK taxpayers and we will encourage people to take up these opportunities\". Sanctions will also be imposed on nations that fail to cooperate on the return of their citizens, including suspending visas for that country. And for those who are refused refugee status, the appeals process is to be streamlined, with one route of appeal, judged by one body, requiring applicants to make all their arguments in one go, instead of making multiple claims.  Human rights legislation will be reformed too, in a bid to reduce legal challenges to deportations. Finally, the number of arrivals accepted through \"safe and legal routes\" will be capped, \"based on local capacity to support refugees\". The reforms will not apply to people with settled status, and there will be a consultation on \"transitional arrangements\" in some cases. The five-year wait for immediate family members of UK citizens remains unchanged, as it does for Hong Kongers with British national (overseas) visas."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A fierce warning from Britain's defence secretary to Vladimir Putin to turn his spy ship away from UK waters or face the consequences was a very public attempt to deter the threat. But unless John Healey backs his rhetoric up with a far more urgent push to rearm - and to rebuild wider national resilience - he risks his words ringing as hollow as his military. The defence secretary on Wednesday repeated government plans to increase defence spending and work with NATO allies to bolster European security. Instead of focusing purely on the threat, he also stressed how plans to buy weapons and build arms factories will create jobs and economic growth. In a sign of the government's priorities, job creation is typically the top line of any Ministry of Defence press release about its latest investment in missiles, drones and warships rather than why the equipment is vital to defend the nation. I doubt expanding employment opportunities was the motivating factor in the 1930s when the UK converted car factories into Spitfire production lines to prepare for war with Nazi Germany. Yet communicating to the public what war readiness really means must surely be just as important today. Mr Healey also chose this moment of national peril to attempt to score political points by criticising the previous Conservative government for hollowing out the armed forces - when the military was left in a similarly underfunded state during the last Labour government. A report by a group of MPs, released on the same day as Mr Healey rattled his sabre at Russia, underlined the scale of the challenge the UK faces. It accused the government of lacking a national plan to defend itself from attack. The Defence Select Committee also warned that Mr Healey, Sir Keir Starmer and the rest of the cabinet are moving at a \"glacial\" pace to fix the problem and are failing to launch a \"national conversation on defence and security\" - something the prime minister had promised last year. The report backed up the findings of a wargame podcast by Sky News and Tortoise that simulated what might happen if Russia launched waves of missile strikes against the UK. The series showed how successive defence cuts since the end of the Cold War means the army, navy and air force are woefully equipped to defend the home front. Read more:Russia accuses Britain of being 'provocative' as spy ship nears UKBriton who volunteered as spy for Russia jailed But credible national defences also require the wider country to be prepared for war. A set of plans setting out what must happen in the transition from peace to war was quietly shelved at the start of this century, so there no longer exists a rehearsed and resourced system to ensure local authorities, businesses and the wider population know what to do. Mr Healey revealed that the Russian spy ship had directed a laser light presumably to dazzle pilots of a Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft that was tracking it. \"That Russian action is deeply dangerous,\" he said. \"So, my message to Russia and to Putin, is this: We see you. We know what you are doing. And if Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\" He did not spell out what this might mean but it could include attempts to block the Russian vessel's passage, or even fire warning shots to force it to retreat. However, any direct engagement could trigger a retaliation from Moscow. For now, the Russian ship - fitted with spying equipment to monitor critical national infrastructure such as communications cables on the seabed - has moved away from the UK coast. It was at its closest between 5 and 11 November. The military is still tracking its movements closely in case the ship returns."

        "Content": " Two million legal migrants who arrived in the UK from 2021 must have stayed in the country for at least 10 years to be considered for settled status, under new proposals put forward by the home secretary. Earlier this year, the government announced it would double the qualifying period for migrants hoping to be granted permanent settlement from five years to 10 years, with reductions available for those who make a \"strong contribution\" to British life. Politics latest: Starmer planning trip to China in the new year, Sky News understands Shabana Mahmood has announced that the two million people who arrived in the UK from 2021 - under what Labour has dubbed the \"Boris wave\" - will now have to wait 10 years for permanent settlement. Setting out her plans in the Commons, Ms Mahmood said settling in the UK was \"not a right, but a privilege, and it must be earned\". But she said that was \"not the case today\", with permanent settlement - also known as indefinite leave to remain - granted \"almost automatically after five years in the country\", granting migrants access to benefits. She explained that 1.6 million are forecast to achieve settled status between 2026 and 2030, and \"that will now change\". \n                  Britain's immigration system changes explained amid 'biggest shake-up' in 50 years\n                 \n                  Number of Britons leaving the UK higher than previously thought\n                 \n                  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood threatens Trump-style visa ban on three countries as part of radical asylum reforms\n                 Other proposals being put forward by Ms Mahmood include: Low-paid workers, such as the 616,000 people and their dependents who came on health and social care visas between 2022 and 2024, will have to wait 15 years before they can be granted permanent settlement. Changing rules so that those reliant on benefits face a 20-year wait for settlement - quadruple the current period and the longest in Europe Giving a statement in the House of Commons, Ms Mahmood expressed fears \"Greater Britain\" was in danger of \"giving way to Littler England\" and current divisions could lead to danger for migrants and their families, including hers. She said while some would \"choose to scorn this analysis\", \"those who look like me do not have that luxury - our lives, and those of our families, are more dangerous in a country that turns inwards\". Ms Mahmood added: \"So we have no choice but to ask, what is the cause of our division, and how might this country be united?\"  The home secretary sought to stress her changes would not apply to those who already had settled status. She said those who were applying for indefinite leave to remain must have no criminal record, speak English to A-level standards and have no debt. And she said the government was also proposing that those who speak English to a degree-level standard could qualify for a nine-year path to settlement. Those paying the higher rate of tax could qualify at five years, and those on the top rate could qualify after three, the same as those on global talent visas. Meanwhile, those who work in a public service, including doctors, teachers, and nurses, would qualify after five years, while those who volunteer could qualify at between five and seven years. Read more:Labour's immigration reforms at a glanceShabana Mahmood is the new hard woman of British politics However, Ms Mahmood did say she would consult on whether asylum seekers who claim benefits should not qualify for settlement until 15 years after their arrival. She told the Commons: \"These are subject to consultation, but the government proposes that those who have received benefits for less than 12 months would not qualify for settlement until 15 years after arrival. \"For those who have claimed benefits for more than 12 months, that would rise to 20 years.\"  Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"She's [Mahmood] had a busy week. I wonder if this burst of hyperactivity has anything to do with her leadership bid.\" He continued: \"Immigration under successive governments has been far, far too high, and points to the fact 10,000 people have crossed the Channel illegally since she took office. \"I am delighted to see that the home secretary...has got out the copy and paste function on her laptop and started copying and pasting Conservative policies.\" The latest proposals come just days after Ms Mahmood, who was previously justice secretary, announced a raft of measures designed to deter illegal immigration and small boat crossings in the Channel. On Monday, she said families with children would be removed - either voluntarily through cash incentives of up to £3,000, or by force and that refugee status would become temporary and subject to review every two and a half years, below the five years currently offered."

        "Content": "Consumer confidence has tumbled amid rampant speculation about what the chancellor will announce in the budget, figures show. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) blamed \"strong hints\" from the government of income tax hikes for the public's falling expectations of how much they'll spend over the next three months - even as Christmas beckons. While a planned increase in income tax rates was scrapped last week, Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out freezing income tax thresholds - which the Conservatives argue amounts to a tax rise by stealth because it drags people into paying higher rates even if their wages increase. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said months of uncertainty had \"heightened public concern about their own finances and the wider economy\". Consumer expectations for the state of the economy over the next three months have fallen significantly to minus 44, down from minus 35 in October, according to data from the BRC and Opinium. Ms Dickinson said action was needed from Rachel Reeves to \"bring down the spiralling cost burden facing retailers\", which she said would \"keep price rises in check\". Read more: Inflation eases but food costs rise  Signs of 'fragile' recovery in jobs market In slightly more encouraging news for Ms Reeves ahead of her statement next Wednesday, new research suggests the jobs market may be on the up. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said the number of new job adverts last month was 754,359, up by 2.1% from September, taking the total to more than 1.6 million. Ms Reeves's decision to hike national insurance contributions for employers in last year's budget was blamed for a slowdown in the market, and a rising unemployment rate. The report said there has been an increase in adverts for medical radiographers, delivery drivers and couriers, and further education teaching professionals. But it warned the apparent recovery was \"fragile\".  Reeves set to back DLR extension One man looking forward to the budget is Sir Sadiq Khan, who has welcomed reports that London's DLR is set to be given funding for an extension. According to the Press Association, the chancellor will back an extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Thamesmead at a cost of £1.7bn - unlocking thousands of new homes. Thamesmead has been notoriously short of public transport links ever since it was developed in the 1960s. The plan would see the line extended from Gallions Reach, near London City Airport, and include a new station at Beckton as well as in Thamesmead itself. Sir Sadiq said the DLR extension \"will not only transform travel in a historically under-served part of the capital but also unlock thousands of new jobs and homes, boosting the economy not just locally but nationally\". It is also expected to unlock land for 25,000 new homes and up to 10,000 new jobs, along with almost £18bn of private investment in the area."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n How best to summarise how badly the government fumbled the UK response to the COVID pandemic? Baroness Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, chose to highlight one truly damning statistic: 23,000. That's the number of deaths that might have been prevented if Boris Johnson had followed his peers in Italy, Spain and France by locking down the UK on 16 March 2020 rather than delaying for another week. Follow latest: All four UK governments 'failed to appreciate' scale of COVID pandemic threat  But I would choose another - and to my mind, far greater - failure: when, six months later, those in charge failed to learn from that mistake, leading to a far greater loss of lives. Back in March 2020, the government was forced to make it up as they went along. Mr Johnson was, in the words of his advisers, \"trolleying\" - swerving erratically between doomsday thinking and the need to keep shaking hands and act like normal. But the government's scientific advisers, who were given an easy ride by Lady Hallett in her summary, were trolleying too. The same scientists who were to urge the government to lock down had, weeks before, dismissed the idea as unworkable. Suggesting, not without reason (if we'd been dealing with a flu virus perhaps), \"herd immunity\" was the least bad outcome. But by early summer of 2020, as Lady Hallett highlighted, we knew what we were dealing with. We'd been through a lockdown, we knew people understood how to behave, and we knew which vulnerable groups needed the most support. Yet instead of acting to slow the rising spread of the virus, chaos within government led to hurried policies including \"Eat Out to Help Out\" and confused messages about returning to work if you could, even though few of us were able to because our offices were shut. Perhaps the best analysis of the situation then came not from science journalists like me, or political pundits, but comedian Matt Lucas, who mocked Boris Johnson's speech to the nation about coronavirus. Read more:A timeline of the UK's response to the pandemicEverything you need to know about the COVID inquiry  Then, when scientific advice, far clearer and more considered than before, called for a short, sharp lockdown over school half term that autumn, it was rejected. Then, as cases inevitably rose as winter set in, the confusing and disruptive \"tier\" system was introduced. A kind of lockdown light that didn't really work. This led in turn to a precipitous rise in cases, partly driven by the new \"Kent\" or Alpha variant, which the scientists had seen coming, and the need for another draconian lockdown in January 2021. One insider described it to the inquiry as a \"roller-coaster\" response. One of chaotic, half-baked, half-measures that made more severe interventions necessary. Indecision cost the economy - and the mental health and well-being of the most vulnerable - far more than shorter, harder, earlier lockdowns would have done. And ultimately, most damningly, it cost the most lives. The \"second wave\", as it soon became known, between December 2020 and February 2021, killed 65,000 people. One analysis concluded 27,000 of those deaths might have been avoided, or at least delayed, had tougher action been taken. It's why, now that the pandemic is over, an analysis of the data shows how the UK saw some of the highest COVID mortality in the developed world. It's reasonable to question the purpose of a lengthy, £200m inquiry, as many, including my colleagues, have. Especially when you only have to look to lockdown parties and the spectacular falling out between Boris Johnson and key advisors, such as Dominic Cummings, to know there was chaos and bad decision-making at the heart of government. Is it worth an extra £200m to know that as much evidence as possible has been dragged into the light - when you consider the failed \"test and trace\" programme alone cost taxpayers £35bn? Surely it is worth it for the families of the 220,000 who died during the UK's COVID pandemic."

Just as the host nation was desperately trying to corral more than 190 countries towards unity at talks in Belem, delegates ended up having to flee the short-lived blaze. The fire broke out in the pavilion area of COP30, where groups showcase their efforts, prompting an evacuation across the site. It was swiftly put out and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation, officials said, with the cause thought to be an electrical fault. But it will make the hard task of negotiations even harder, and they had already missed a self-imposed deadline to wrap up the first batch of deals on Wednesday evening. Representatives have travelled from all corners of the globe to get together in the same room to try to solve some of the world's biggest challenges. The UN climate body (UNFCCC) has not yet confirmed when the site will reopen. Talks were stuck on how to close the gap between the level of warming the world is on course for, compared to that which governments previously agreed would be a better, safe level.

The most controversial solutions being discussed for this first agreement are the future of fossil fuels and the delivery of finance to help developing nations switch to clean energy and cope with the impacts of climate change they did little to cause. About 80 countries have been lobbying for a plan or \"roadmap\" for how to \"transition away from fossil fuels\" - a pledge made at COP28 two years ago but which has subsequently been swept under the carpet. Another dividing line was how rich countries, which generally have done more to cause climate change, should help poorer countries cope with more extreme weather that tends to hit them hardest. Previous funding promises have materialised late or not in the form promised. And for the first time critical minerals - vital for green technology like EVs and solar panels - may make it into one of the COP decisions to come later in the week."

Asked what he thought of the US president's decision, the prime minister simply said Mr Trump had \"set out his position\".

Politics latest - follow live Sir Keir has faced heavy criticism at home for the amount of time he has spent overseas and focusing on international affairs. His trip to South Africa to attend the G20 summit is the 45th country the prime minister has visited since taking office. Speaking to journalists on the flight over to Johannesburg, Sir Keir defended his decision to fly out days before a difficult budget, saying that the international issues being discussed in South Africa have an impact at home, while the G20 nations are important to Britain's economy.  \"The G20 are the 20 strongest economies in the world, they are very important to the UK,\" he said. \n                  Is Trump using Ukrainian corruption to force a peace deal?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has approved the release of the Epstein files - what happens now?\n                 \n                  Trump signs bill approving release of Epstein files\n                 \"In the last three years, the jobs that have been generated in the UK from countries in the G20 is 200,000 and that focus in the budget will be very much the economy and the cost of living.

This summit is the first one in the G20's 26-year history that a US president has not attended, with one diplomatic source acknowledging this was raising serious concerns. They said: \"Trump also made the argument that the G7 should be the G8 [at the last meeting in Canada in June] and now he's not even going to the G20, so his lack of attendance is, of course an issue.\" Mr Trump has also ordered US officials not to travel to South Africa for the annual meeting, although the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said on Thursday evening that this might change, with discussions now under way with the US. While Mr Trump is not attending, Sir Keir will leave the G20 summit early, coming back to the UK on Sunday to prepare for a tax-raising, and possibly manifesto-breaking budget on Wednesday. The chancellor raised £40bn in taxes in the last budget, insisting that this was a \"once in a parliament\" tax raid. A year on, Rachel Reeves now has to raise billions more as she looks to fill a black hole as much as £30bn in the public finances, driven in part by a downgrade in productivity, which has lowered growth forecasts, and also her reversal on spending cuts - the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits - that has left her with around £7bn to find.  The government has U-turned on its plan to raise income tax but is expected to extend a freeze on tax thresholds by two years from 2028. The measure will raise about £10bn in additional tax as workers find themselves dragged into higher tax bands and has led to accusations that Labour has broken its manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people. The prime minister, asked whether everyone should expect tax rises in the budget on Wednesday, refused to answer directly. Instead, he said it would be \"a Labour budget with Labour values\" and based on \"fairness\". He added: \"It will have absolutely in mind protecting our public services, particularly the NHS, cutting our debt, and dealing with the cost of living, bearing down on the cost of living. So, they'll be the principles that will run through the budget. \"Now, of course, the right decisions have to be taken. And we have to see this in the context of 16, 17 years now where we've had the crash in '08, followed by austerity, followed by a not very good Brexit deal, followed by Covid, followed by Ukraine, and that's why we have to take the decision to get this back on track. \"I'm optimistic about the future, I do think if we get this right, our country has a great future. They'll be the principles behind the budget.\"  While the prime minister is focusing on trade at the G20 summit, Ukraine will also be on the agenda amid reports the Trump administration and Russian officials have drawn up a new peace plan to end the war there. It would require major concessions from Kyiv, including giving up territory not currently occupied by Russia to Moscow and halving the size of the Ukrainian army. The deal has reportedly been drawn up by Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met the current secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, in Miami. Asked about the plan, Sir Keir said he wanted a \"just and lasting peace\", adding: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine, and we must never lose sight of that\". I'm told by one diplomatic source that the Europeans have yet to see this plan, while there are questions as to how advanced in the US administration these proposals are and whether they have the support of Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  European diplomats are stressing that any peace talks have to involve both Ukraine and European input if it is to have any hope of working. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on the eve of the G20 summit they are yet to see any concessions on the Russian side. \"We welcome all meaningful efforts to end this war, but like we have said before, it has to be just and lasting,\" she said. \"That also means that the Ukrainians, but also the Europeans, agree to this.\" European leaders are discussing how to best equip Kyiv for another winter of war. Talks are expected to continue this weekend over the plan to use Russia's frozen assets to generate a €140bn loan for Ukraine. The plan is currently stalled over Belgium's concerns of legal risk in releasing funds from the Brussels-based depository Euroclear, where most of the Russian assets are held. Earlier on Thursday, Sky News revealed Sir Keir is preparing for a likely visit to China in the new year. The trip is likely to be controversial given the UK's fractious relationship with China, made worse by recent allegations of spying in parliament. Sir Keir said any visit was not confirmed \"yet\" and insisted the government would \"always robustly protect our interests\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Global stock markets have rallied as the world's most valuable company reassured investors of the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and the returns companies can make.  Nvidia's announcement of another round of record-breaking sales was \"an extremely important moment in the AI Revolution thesis\", said financial services firm Wedbush. Nvidia's computer chips are powering much of the AI surge and are a key component in generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. Money blog: Market town with 12,000 residents Britain's least affordable Some are taking the results and the company's forecast of strong sales to come as a clear signal that AI and tech stocks have not been overvalued, that there is no bubble waiting to burst. Tech companies have seen their share price and valuations soar as investors hope to benefit from investment in AI. The main beneficiary has been Nvidia itself, which became the first company to be worth $5trn in October this year. \"The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble... Instead, it's year three of a 10-year build out of this 4th industrial revolution in our view,\" the Wedbush industry note read. \n                  Households and business must wait for energy bills to fall - as minister says there is 'no shortcut' to bring down prices\n                 \n                  Nvidia beats expectations again in defiance of AI bubble fears\n                 \n                  Market town with 12,000 residents named Britain's least affordable | Money blog\n                 As investors welcomed Nvidia's \"spotless\" results, in the words of trading platform Capital.com, there was clear enthusiasm for tech and AI adjacent companies on Thursday. Across Asia and Europe, tech companies and Nvidia competitors saw their share prices rise.  Doubts about valuations have, for now, been staved off and bubble worries soothed. The chip maker announced $57bn of revenue in the three months to October and anticipated $65bn in sales in its next results. It was \"as comforting as a warm cup of tea on a cold day, providing investors with the energy to increase their risk appetite and giving a nice glow to the market once again\", Russ Mould, investment director at investor platform AJ Bell, said. Risks still there The sense of calm is unlikely to be permanent. AI confidence has been battered in the past years by the success of China's Deepseek AI model, the US-China trade wars and tariff fears; there's still plenty to dent confidence. And not everyone has been reassured by Nvidia's latest numbers. US trader Michael Burry, made famous for his bet on the pre-financial crash US housing market slump and played by Christian Bale in the Hollywood film The Big Short, has effectively bet that Nvidia's share price will fall. After the results were published, Mr Burry posted an image of major AI companies, saying: \"True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers.\" The statement highlights concern about deals among the big tech entities, that they're self-fulfilling, circular and being funded by borrowed money."

        "Content": "The Stone Roses bassist Gary \"Mani\" Mounfield has died at the age of 63, his family has said.  Mani's brother, Greg, wrote in a post on Facebook: \"It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to announce the sad passing of my brother.\" \"RIP RKID,\" he added. Formed in 1983, The Stone Roses were a mainstay of the \"Madchester\" scene. The bassist joined the band in 1987 and formed part of its classic line-up alongside singer Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire and drummer Alan \"Reni\" Wren. He remained with the group until their split in 1996. Mani's death comes two years after that of his wife, Imelda Mounfield, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in November 2020. The couple welcomed twin boys in 2012. The Stone Roses frontman Brown shared a tribute online, writing: \"REST IN PEACE MANi X.\" \n                  Half of novelists fear AI will replace them entirely, survey finds\n                 \n                  Princess of Wales says her children were 'very sad' to miss Paddington at Royal Variety Performance\n                 \n                  Gustav Klimt's Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sells for £180m at auction, a record for modern art\n                 Oasis singer Liam Gallagher said he was \"in total shock and absolutely devastated\", describing the bassist as \"my hero\" in a post on X. \"RIP Mani - my heartfelt condolences to his twin boys and all of his family,\" wrote the Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder, whose bandmate Rowetta added: \"Back with your Imelda, Mani. Going to miss you so much. All my love to the boys, the family & all those who knew & loved him.\" The Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess shared a photo of himself with Mani, writing alongside it: \"I shared this photo a week or so ago on Mani's birthday. \"It never failed to bring a smile to my face - and that was exactly the same for the man himself. \"One of the absolute best in every way - such a beautiful friend.\" Echo & the Bunnymen vocalist Ian McCulloch said Mani was someone \"who I have always loved and always will love, deeply and forever. Like a brother\". He continued: \"I am in shock to be honest. Please tell me I'm just having a bad, bad dream. My thoughts and feelings and Mani. Love to all of his family from me.\" The \"Madchester\" bands were known for blending indie with acid house, psychedelia, and pop. Mani played on both The Stone Roses' eponymous debut album, released in 1989, and their 1995 follow-up, Second Coming. The first record, featuring tracks such as I Wanna Be Adored and I am the Resurrection was a huge success and later named the second greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll - losing out only to The Beatles' Sgt Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band. When The Stone Roses split in 1996, he joined Primal Scream and played with the Scottish outfit until 2011, when he left to rejoin the reuniting Roses."
