        "Content": " Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been named Canadian prime minister after winning the Liberal Party leadership in a landslide victory. Mr Carney, who also used to head up Canada's central bank, had emerged as the frontrunner as his country was hit with tariffs imposed by President Trump. He ended up winning 85.9% of the vote. During his victory speech, he told the crowd: \"Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. \"He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.\" Mr Carney said Canada would keep retaliatory tariffs until \"the Americans show us respect\". Mr Trump's tariffs against Canada and his talk of making the country America's 51st state have infuriated Canadians. \n                  Who are the candidates to become Canada's next prime minister?\n                 \n                  Police hunting for three suspects after 12 injured in Toronto shooting\n                 \n                  Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding added to FBI's 10 most wanted list\n                 The American national anthem has been repeatedly booed at NHL and NBA games. \"Think about it. If they succeeded, they would destroy our way of life... America is a melting pot. Canada is a mosaic,\" Mr Carney added. \"America is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form.\" International correspondent Mark Carney had no problem convincing the Liberal Party he was the best man for the job. 85.9% of the vote speaks for itself. Now he must convince the country.  After unparalleled experience as central bank governor, both of Canada and of the UK, albeit at different times, he has the economic wherewithal to fortify the economy against the battering Donald Trump seems intent on dealing it.  He has made it very clear he is ready for the fight to come. \"In trade, as in hockey, we will win!\" he told his fellow liberals to wild applause. \"We're strongest when we are united,\" he told the country on X.  His conservative rivals had what seemed like an unbeatable lead in the polls until just a few short weeks ago, but Trump's trade tariffs have rallied Canadians behind the flag and their government.  That gives Mr Carney momentum ahead of a general election that will likely come sooner rather than later. Now he must exercise the political genius to capitalise on that. The 59-year-old will replace Justin Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015. Mr Trudeau announced he was stepping down in January after facing calls to quit from a chorus of his own MPs. The 53-year-old's popularity had declined as food and house prices rose. He will stay in post until Mr Carney is sworn in. Mr Carney will soon have to decide when to call a general election - a vote must take place on or before 20 October. In 2013, he became the first non-UK citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment came after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.

        "Content": " Russian special forces crept through a disused gas pipeline for several miles to launch a surprise attack on Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region, Ukraine's military and pro-Moscow war bloggers have said. Footage circulating on the Telegram app claims to show the elite soldiers crouching as they make their way through the darkness of the pipe to the town of Sudzha. Some can be heard cursing in Russian and complaining about the commanders who sent them on the mission. One of the soldiers is heard saying: \"F*****g hell, where the f*** are we, boys?\" Another says: \"Where does the pipe go? To Sudzha, for f**** sake, that's f***ing crazy.\" Later in the clip a soldier is heard saying: \"We'll get there of course, but indignantly, because we're f*****g sick of the f*****g command.\" He later adds: \"They took our f*****g assault rifles too.\" Two of the soldiers are seen smoking cigarettes while a separate image shared on Telegram shows an operative wearing a gas mask. Ukraine war live updates The special forces soldiers walked around nine miles (15km) through the pipeline which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe, according to Telegram posts by Ukrainian-born pro-Kremlin blogger Yuri Podolyaka. In the footage, the soldiers suggest the mission requires them to walk seven miles through the pipe. Mr Podolyaka says some of them spent several days in the pipeline before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near Sudzha. The operation formed part of efforts by Russia to recapture areas of Kursk which were seized by thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in a shock offensive in August last year. Another pro-Russian war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said a major battle is under way in Sudzha after Moscow's special forces crept through the pipe. Meanwhile, Ukraine's general staff confirmed on Saturday that Russian soldiers had used the pipeline in an attempt to gain a foothold, but airborne assault forces promptly detected them, and they responded with rocket, artillery and drone attacks that destroyed Moscow's units. \"The enemy's losses in Sudzha are very high,\" the general staff reported.

Sky News has not independently verified the footage. Months after Kyiv's forces seized parts of Kursk, Ukrainian soldiers are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 Russian troops, including some from Moscow's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open-source maps of the battlefield showed on Friday. Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said this morning that it had captured a settlement in Kursk and another in Ukraine's Sumy region. Russia also launched heavy aerial attacks overnight on Ukraine into Saturday - with at least 22 people killed, including 11 in the frontline town of Dobropilla in Ukraine's embattled eastern Donetsk region. Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskyy described the attacks as a \"vile and inhumane intimidation tactic\" by Russia. The attacks come after the US paused military aid and the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine this month after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Mr Zelenskyy descended into a confrontation in front of the world's media. The Trump administration's stance on Ukraine and apparent favouring of Moscow has sparked concern among European leaders. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics told Sky News on Sunday that European countries should \"absolutely\" introduce conscription as he conceded the continent was \"quite weak\" militarily in the face of the Russia threat. Meanwhile, Russian officials have been criticised after presenting mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine with gifts of meat grinders on International Women's Day. Russia is often accused of throwing its troops into a \"meat grinder\" with little regard for their lives. The local branch of government in the northwestern Russian town of Polyarniye Zori defended itself against the backlash, saying critics were making \"callous and provocative interpretations\" of the gifts."

        "Content": " Syria's new government has formed a committee to investigate reported mass revenge killings of a minority group - after the United Nations human rights chief called for \"swift actions\". Violent clashes, which a war monitoring group said had already killed 1,311 people, have continued for a fourth day in deposed president Bashar al Assad's coastal heartland. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement: \"The caretaker authorities' announcements of their intention to respect the law must be followed by swift actions to protect Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent any violations and abuses and achieve accountability when these occur.\"  US secretary of state Marco Rubio also weighed in, calling on Syrian authorities to hold the \"radical Islamist terrorists\" responsible for the killings accountable. He also said the US stood with the country's religious and ethnic minorities, while the UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the violence was \"horrific\". The violence spiralled into revenge killings against Assad's Alawite sect when thousands of armed supporters of Syria's new leaders from across the country descended to coastal areas to support the new administration's forces. Syria's state media said the violence - some of the deadliest in 13 years of civil war - has now moved to the countryside. \n                  'They left nobody': More than 1,000 people killed in some of Syria's deadliest violence\n                 \n                  Syria: 'Nearly 200 killed' in country's worst violence since Assad toppled\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 A Syrian security source said the pace of fighting had slowed around the cities of Latakia, Jabla and Baniyas, while forces searched surrounding mountainous areas where an estimated 5,000 pro-Assad insurgents were hiding. Some of these areas were attacked with artillery shells and drones, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The British-based observatory said 830 of those killed were civilians, while another 231 members of the Syrian security forces and 250 fighters loyal to Assad also died. Rami Abdulrahman, the head of SOHR, said the civilians included Alawite women and children. Syrian security sources said more than 300 of their members had been killed in clashes with former pro-Assad army personnel in coordinated attacks and ambushes on their forces that began on Thursday Mr Abdulrahman said the death toll was one of the highest since a chemical weapons attack by Assad's forces in 2013 which killed some 1,400 people in a Damascus suburb. Syrian state news said on Sunday a mass grave had been discovered near Qardaha, Assad's hometown, containing the bodies of recently killed security forces. Syria's leader Ahmed Sharaa, who faces the challenge of ruling a country fraught with factional tensions, urged Syrians not to let these strains further destabilise the country. The Alawites are a religious minority in Syria, originating from Shia Islam. The overthrown president Bashar al Assad belonged to the sect. They make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni, and mainly live in the country's coastal regions. During Assad's reign, the Alawites made up a large part of his support base and held top posts in the army and security agencies. Since his fall from power, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed. Civilians have now been targeted in revenge killings by Sunni Muslim militants loyal to the new government, who have blamed Assad's loyalists for attacks against the country's new security forces in recent weeks. The Alawites, along with Syria's other minority communities including Kurds, Christians and Druze, have said they are concerned about revenge attacks and are not convinced by the new government's promise of an inclusive country. \"We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace, we can live together,\" Mr Sharaa said at a mosque in Damascus. \"Rest assured about Syria, this country has the characteristics for survival… What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges.\" Syria's top diplomat, along with the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation. Europe and the US have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria until there is a clear, democratic political transition that is inclusive of Syria's minorities and civil society. The country desperately needs money to rebuild, however, after years of war. Rebels led by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group toppled Assad's government in December. Assad fled to Russia, leaving behind some of his closest advisers and supporters, while Sharaa's group led the appointment of an interim government and took over Syria's armed forces. Assad's toppling ended decades of dynastic rule by his family marked by severe repression and a devastating civil war that began as a peaceful uprising in 2011."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  The UK is not considering introducing conscription to ready the country for a potential war - but decisions may be needed in the future to respond to the \"new reality\" we are now living in, a minister has told Sky News. In an interview with Trevor Phillips, Latvian President Edgars Rinkeviks has urged European countries to follow his country's lead and \"absolutely\" introduce conscription, conceding the continent is \"quite weak\" militarily. Politics latest: Calls for European nations to reintroduce conscription  Asked if the UK government is considering introducing the measure to boost the armed forces, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said it is important the UK does not find itself operating under \"old assumptions\" - and that it may be \"decisions are needed in the future that respond to a new reality\". He told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"We are not considering conscription, but of course we have announced a major increase in defence expenditure. \"We do have to recognise that the world has changed. The phrase 'step up' is used a lot. Europe does have to step up in terms of its own defence. \"President Trump isn't actually the first president to say that, but he said it more loudly and with more force than his predecessors - so, I think we have got to recognise that moment.\" 'UK cannot cling to old assumptions'  He added: \"When the world is changing as fast as it is, it's important that we don't cling on to old assumptions. \"I think the prime minister has played a tremendous role in recent weeks in responding to that situation and explaining it to the public. \"That is why the decision on increasing defence expenditure was needed. \"It may be why other decisions are needed in the future that respond to a new reality, and that we don't find ourselves caught operating under the same assumption as we used to in the past when the situation has changed.\" 'Battlefield is changing' Sir Keir Starmer has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP but has not set out when this will be achieved. Ministers say a defence review to be published this spring will set out a \"roadmap\" to it.  The number is much lower than the US president has demanded NATO members spend on defence, with Mr Trump saying they should all be spending 5% - an amount last seen during the Cold War. Asked if the \"new reality\" involved a bigger army, Mr McFadden said ministers were waiting for the conclusion of the review. But he added: \"One thing is for sure, you would not spend money today on the same things as you would 10 years ago. \"The experience of the three years of the war in Ukraine has shown just how fast the battlefield is changing in terms of cyber, drones, the use of intelligence.\" In the UK, military conscription has existed for two periods in modern times. The first was from 1916 to 1920 following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, due to the dwindling number of volunteers for military service. Lord Kitchener's campaign - promoted by his famous \"Your Country Needs You\" poster - had encouraged more than one million men to enlist by January 1915. But this was not enough. In January 1916, after much debate, the Military Service Act was passed. This imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, but exempted the medically unfit, clergymen, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker. Conscientious objectors – men who objected to fighting on moral grounds – were also exempt, and were given civilian jobs or non-fighting roles at the front. Conscription was not applied to Ireland because of the 1916 Easter Rising, although many Irishmen volunteered to fight. A second Act passed in May 1916 extended conscription to married men, and in 1918, during the last months of the war, the age limit was raised to 51. Conscription was extended until 1920 to allow the army to deal with continuing trouble spots in the Empire and parts of Europe. In the run-up to the Second World War, plans for limited conscription applying to single men aged between 20 and 22 were given parliamentary approval in the Military Training Act in May 1939. This required men to undertake six months' military training. When Britain declared war against Germany on 3 September 1939, the National Service (Armed Forces) Act imposed conscription on all males aged between 18 and 41. Those medically unfit were exempt, as were others in key industries and jobs such as baking, farming, medicine, and engineering, while conscientious objectors had to appear before a tribunal to argue their reasons for refusing to join up. In December 1941, a second National Service Act was approved, making all unmarried women and all childless widows between the ages of 20 and 30 liable to call-up. The last conscription term ended in 1960, although many soldiers chose to continue in the service beyond 1963. The Conservatives' first policy announcement of last year's general election campaign was that the party would introduce a new form of mandatory National Service for 18-year-olds. Asked if the Tories still stood by the plan which was in their manifesto, shadow home secretary Chris Philp told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"We are obviously not going to write our manifesto now, so I am not going to recommit to things in the previous manifesto. \"We'll need to do the thinking properly. I am not going to speculate four years ahead of the election. \"I don't think it was really exactly conscription that was being proposed, it was a National Citizen Service which is a bit different. \"The idea of getting younger people to do voluntary work and perform useful tasks is not a bad idea.\"  Last year, Britain's former top NATO commander told Sky News it was time to \"think the unthinkable\" and consider introducing conscription. General Sir Richard Sherriff, ex-deputy supreme allied commander of the military organisation, said: \"I think we need to get over many of the cultural hang-ups and assumptions, and frankly think the unthinkable. \"I think we need to go further and look carefully at conscription.\""

The incident happened shortly after midnight on Sunday following an \"armed confrontation\" with law enforcement, according to the agency. The incident happened near the intersection of 17th Street and F Street NW - less than a five-minute walk from the White House. Local police had reported a \"suicidal individual\" possibly travelling to Washington DC from Indiana, the agency said. Secret Service officers then found the man's vehicle and spotted a person on foot who matched local police's description. \"As officers approached, the individual brandished a firearm, and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,\" the Secret Service said in a statement on X posted by spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. The suspect was transported to hospital and his condition is unknown. The Secret Service's statement said that no injuries were reported among its personnel, and that the incident was under investigation. Donald Trump was not in the White House at the time of the incident, as he was visiting his Florida home Mar-a-Lago this weekend. There have been a series of incidents involving armed men being shot by security officers on or near the White House grounds in recent years, including the 2016 shooting of a man who brandished a handgun at a White House security gate. In 2023, a 20-year-old Indian immigrant unsuccessfully tried to break through the White House's protective barriers in a rented truck. Mr Trump himself narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July, when a gunman fired at him during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding his ear. A Secret Service review found that communication gaps and a lack of diligence contributed to the near-miss."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @SunnyNadal\n  The UK is not considering introducing conscription to ready the country for a potential war - but decisions may be needed in the future to respond to the \"new reality\" we are now living in, a minister has told Sky News. In an interview with Trevor Phillips, Latvian President Edgars Rinkeviks has urged European countries to follow his country's lead and \"absolutely\" introduce conscription, conceding the continent is \"quite weak\" militarily. Politics latest: Calls for European nations to reintroduce conscription  Asked if the UK government is considering introducing the measure to boost the armed forces, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said it is important the UK does not find itself operating under \"old assumptions\" - and that it may be \"decisions are needed in the future that respond to a new reality\". He told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"We are not considering conscription, but of course we have announced a major increase in defence expenditure. \"We do have to recognise that the world has changed. The phrase 'step up' is used a lot. Europe does have to step up in terms of its own defence. \"President Trump isn't actually the first president to say that, but he said it more loudly and with more force than his predecessors - so, I think we have got to recognise that moment.\" 'UK cannot cling to old assumptions'  He added: \"When the world is changing as fast as it is, it's important that we don't cling on to old assumptions. \"I think the prime minister has played a tremendous role in recent weeks in responding to that situation and explaining it to the public. \"That is why the decision on increasing defence expenditure was needed. \"It may be why other decisions are needed in the future that respond to a new reality, and that we don't find ourselves caught operating under the same assumption as we used to in the past when the situation has changed.\" 'Battlefield is changing' Sir Keir Starmer has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP but has not set out when this will be achieved. Ministers say a defence review to be published this spring will set out a \"roadmap\" to it.  The number is much lower than the US president has demanded NATO members spend on defence, with Mr Trump saying they should all be spending 5% - an amount last seen during the Cold War. Asked if the \"new reality\" involved a bigger army, Mr McFadden said ministers were waiting for the conclusion of the review. But he added: \"One thing is for sure, you would not spend money today on the same things as you would 10 years ago. \"The experience of the three years of the war in Ukraine has shown just how fast the battlefield is changing in terms of cyber, drones, the use of intelligence.\" In the UK, military conscription has existed for two periods in modern times. The first was from 1916 to 1920 following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, due to the dwindling number of volunteers for military service. Lord Kitchener's campaign - promoted by his famous \"Your Country Needs You\" poster - had encouraged more than one million men to enlist by January 1915. But this was not enough. In January 1916, after much debate, the Military Service Act was passed. This imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, but exempted the medically unfit, clergymen, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker. Conscientious objectors – men who objected to fighting on moral grounds – were also exempt, and were given civilian jobs or non-fighting roles at the front. Conscription was not applied to Ireland because of the 1916 Easter Rising, although many Irishmen volunteered to fight. A second Act passed in May 1916 extended conscription to married men, and in 1918, during the last months of the war, the age limit was raised to 51. Conscription was extended until 1920 to allow the army to deal with continuing trouble spots in the Empire and parts of Europe. In the run-up to the Second World War, plans for limited conscription applying to single men aged between 20 and 22 were given parliamentary approval in the Military Training Act in May 1939. This required men to undertake six months' military training. When Britain declared war against Germany on 3 September 1939, the National Service (Armed Forces) Act imposed conscription on all males aged between 18 and 41. Those medically unfit were exempt, as were others in key industries and jobs such as baking, farming, medicine, and engineering, while conscientious objectors had to appear before a tribunal to argue their reasons for refusing to join up. In December 1941, a second National Service Act was approved, making all unmarried women and all childless widows between the ages of 20 and 30 liable to call-up. The last conscription term ended in 1960, although many soldiers chose to continue in the service beyond 1963. The Conservatives' first policy announcement of last year's general election campaign was that the party would introduce a new form of mandatory National Service for 18-year-olds. Asked if the Tories still stood by the plan which was in their manifesto, shadow home secretary Chris Philp told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"We are obviously not going to write our manifesto now, so I am not going to recommit to things in the previous manifesto. \"We'll need to do the thinking properly. I am not going to speculate four years ahead of the election. \"I don't think it was really exactly conscription that was being proposed, it was a National Citizen Service which is a bit different. \"The idea of getting younger people to do voluntary work and perform useful tasks is not a bad idea.\"  Last year, Britain's former top NATO commander told Sky News it was time to \"think the unthinkable\" and consider introducing conscription. General Sir Richard Sherriff, ex-deputy supreme allied commander of the military organisation, said: \"I think we need to get over many of the cultural hang-ups and assumptions, and frankly think the unthinkable. \"I think we need to go further and look carefully at conscription.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       Parts of the planning system could be stripped away by the government in its attempts to speed up house building. Consulting bodies like Sports England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society will no longer be required for those looking to build under the new plans being considered by ministers. It is hoped a reduction in statutory consultees will reduce the waiting times for projects. Angela Rayner, who is both deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said: \"We've put growth at the heart of our plans as a government, with our Plan for Change milestone to secure 1.5 million homes and unleash Britain's potential to build. \"We need to reform the system to ensure it is sensible and balanced, and does not create unintended delays - putting a hold on people's lives and harming our efforts to build the homes people desperately need. \"New developments must still meet our high expectations to create the homes, facilities and infrastructure that communities need.\" Consultees will not be completely excised from the planning process under the changes. \n                  Angela Rayner 'won't speculate' over possible changes to two-child benefit cap\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner insists 1.5m housing target can be met as extra £350m pledged for affordable homes\n                 \n                  British steel 'absolutely has a future' despite US tariffs, says deputy PM Angela Rayner\n                 However, instead of it being mandatory to get the opinion of such bodies, their scope will be \"narrowed to focus on heritage, safety and environmental protection\", according to the government. The government says it has identified issues like consultees failing to engage \"proactively\", taking too long to provide advice, re-opening issues that have already been dealt with, submitting automatic objections which they later withdraw, and submitting advice for \"gold-plated\" outcomes that are unrealistic and difficult to achieve. More than 300 planning applications have been sent up to the secretary of state's desk in the past three years because of disagreements. Read more:PM vows to take on NIMBYsDevelopers could bypass planning committeesReeves announces backing for new Heathrow runway  The government has highlighted examples like a project to construct 140 homes in Bradford that was delayed because the application had \"not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls\". As well as reducing the number of consultees that have to be brought in, local authorities will also be told they only need to speak to the bodies if necessary, and decisions should not be held up by more than 21 days. The government states that \"existing open spaces, sports, recreational buildings and land, including playing fields, should not be built on unless an assessment has shown the space to be surplus to requirements or it will be replaced by equivalent or better provision\". Sport England said its remit in the planning system is to protect playing fields and other spaces for physical activity. \"Britain's childhood obesity crisis is rising and low physical activity levels cost our economy £7.4bn a year, making it vital we protect the places that local communities can be active,\" a spokesperson said. They added they \"look forward\" to taking part in the consultation exercise and \"arguing the importance of protecting playing fields and places where local people can keep active\". 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Sam Richards, CEO of pro-growth campaign group Britain Remade and former Conservative adviser said: \"I'm glad the deputy prime minister has taken on board many of the recommendations I made in my review of statutory consultees for the last government. \"It's a step in the right direction - but there's still more they can do. For example, they've not introduced a 'use it or lose it' approach to objections. This would remove the chance of statutory consults to intervene after they miss their deadline. \"There is also some irony in the fact that their decision to remove consultees from the process…has been put out to consultation.\""

        "Content": " Bereaved families and communities nationwide have come together to reflect on and mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Events have been taking place across the UK to remember those who died - and to pay tribute to frontline health staff, social care workers, volunteers and researchers who played crucial roles. There were emotional scenes in towns and cities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as the pain, grief, compassion and sacrifice of those difficult times were remembered. The deadly virus shut down the world after it began to spread from Wuhan in China at the beginning of 2020. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said for many \"there is deep grief and loss that may never be relieved\". \"Today, we come together to remember, reflect and pay tribute to the sacrifices made by people across our country,\" he wrote in a post on social media. Families walked along the National Covid Memorial Wall in central London, led by a Highland piper. People could be heard crying as they passed around 3,000 photos of the faces of some of those who died - representing just over 1% of the total death toll in the UK, organisers said. A minute's silence was held after the chimes of Big Ben and long-stemmed red carnations were cast into the River Thames. The event was brought to an end with a song from a choir and a salute on the river from a London Fire Brigade fireboat. Lynn Jones fought back tears as she remembered her \"fit and healthy\" 66-year-old husband Gareth, \"a loved principal\" in their hometown of Stoke on Trent, who died after \"spending seven weeks in hospital battling the virus on his own\". She told those gathered at the event: \"For me, this wall is an expression of so many emotions - rage, love, grief, pain and unbearable sadness. It is also important as an expression of democracy, because this is what the people affected most by the pandemic feel. \"It is a message to those across the water that this is what happens when you get it wrong. It should stay as a constant reminder of the impact of government decisions.\" Tributes were also paid to the critical role played by the NHS, its workforce and charities during the pandemic, at an event at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. It commemorates the thousands of people who died. Singer Lesley Garrett was among the performers and the difficult days during the pandemic were recalled in testimonials from NHS staff, patients, volunteers and senior healthcare figures including chief nursing officer Duncan Burton. Author Michael Rosen - who contracted the coronavirus just months after the COVID-19 outbreak and was in hospital for 48 days in intensive care, including around 40 in an induced coma - spoke at the event.  The children's writer, poet and broadcaster, who is still having to live with the consequences and suffers from long COVID, told Sky News: \"All ages have been affected by COVID, so plenty for many people to be thinking about today.\" Reflecting on his own experience, he added: \"The care was amazing. The last thing I remember was a doctor standing by my bed and saying would I sign a piece of paper that would allow them to put me to sleep. \"I said, 'Will I wake up?', and they said, 'You've got a 50/50 chance'. I said, 'What if I don't sign?', and they said, 'Zero'. So I signed.\" Asked if people needed to be reminded of the work of those who put their own lives on the line to help those affected, he replied: \"Yes, we must remember every day they are saving lives. \"We forget health workers died during the pandemic... and they were in a situation where the viral load was huge.\" Read more:COVID survivor reflects on fight for his lifeCOVID scars remain in the tight-knit communities Liverpool's St George's Hall was the city's focal point for the day's activities, while a commemoration, speeches and a screening of the Stories From The Pandemic documentary were part of events planned in Sheffield.

Doves were released at the event, which also included a wreath being laid, a plaque unveiling and individual yellow roses being left in memory of loved ones. Across the UK, just under 227,000 people died who had the virus listed as a cause of death - with more than 16,000 in Scotland. Speaking ahead of Sunday's memorial service, Mr Swinney said: \"Children stopped going to school, many shops and businesses were closed, and we were no longer able to spend time with friends and family as normal. \"Tragically, thousands of people lost their lives, and I offer my deepest condolences to those who lost loved ones in such difficult circumstances.\" In Treorchy, South Wales, families remembered their loved ones by placing named flags in a yellow heart made from local stones.  A group set up by bereaved families during the pandemic, called Memory Stones of Love, planned a remembrance concert in Belfast, including music, poetry and readings.

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  From the top of Bwlch Mountain, the sun is shining, there's not a cloud in the sky and we can see for miles down the Welsh Valleys. I am sat with Bev Johnson, who, back in 2021 along with other locals bereaved by COVID-19, built a huge heart out of stone on the side of this hill overlooking Treorchy and Pentre. \"It was just somewhere for people to go - for them to grieve and to remember - because no one had anywhere to go,\" she tells me. She and a team of volunteers have just refurbished the heart - repainted it bright yellow so it stands out amongst the green - to mark the five-year anniversary of the pandemic. Bev lost her mum Sheila to COVID. Like so many others, she was unable to visit her in hospital in her final hours, not able to give her a proper funeral. She remembers having to call the ambulance shortly after Christmas Day. \n                  COVID anniversary: Day of reflection across UK to mark five years since start of pandemic\n                 \n                  Five years on from COVID, one survivor reflects on having to fight for his life\n                 \n                  Police Scotland officers may have been COVID pandemic 'super-spreaders', inquiry hears\n                 \"She made me promise then that I would make sure she came out - she said, 'I'm only taking two changes of clothes, nighties', she said 'I'm not staying in there long'…and, that was the last I seen of her.\" Bev is one of many in Rhondda Cynon Taff who, at the height of the pandemic, were living in some of the most infected parts of the UK. For many of them, the impact, cruelty, fear of that time feels like a different world. But for others - they still have not recovered. Seven miles up the valley is the Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls Centre. Manager Alison remembers when they had to hand it over to become a testing site, then a vaccination hub. \"It was quite sad really. It was quite upsetting because one, we were all a bit anxious about what was happening to the world, and then two, it was like are we ever going to get through this and what's going to happen to the centre?\" Many of the workers in the club restaurant were furloughed but worked at the testing site. Alison is proud of their community - but the closure of the club and the age demographic of its members meant the pandemic hit them hard. Before, there were 180 members - now there are just 60, and they only started playing again in December 2024. \"Sadly one or two did lose through COVID, some lost partners through COVID, and some obviously their health declined and not only mentally but physically. \"The decline in the sport has been vast, to be honest with you and it's going to take a long time to get back up and running to as we were before.\" Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil had some of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the UK, with 326.6 and 295.1 deaths per 100,000 people respectively. At one point, Merthyr had the highest infection rate in the whole country. \"What we experienced then was such a stark contrast to life that was previously normal, and we struggled to imagine how it'd ever be normal again,\" says Paul Edwards, pastor at the Hope Church in the centre of the town. Read more from Sky News:Five years on, one COVID survivor reflects on fighting for his lifeWould the world be more peaceful if more women were in charge?'Common error' could leave thousands of women out of pocket He tells me how overnight services, groups and prayer meetings had to go online. \"Obviously we understood the reason why were unable to meet but at the same time we wanted to keep the community together.\" He's keen to tell me about the church's successful pantry, allowing those in need to pay a small amount for their shopping. It was an idea that was born out of COVID, but it continues to thrive and feeds more than 500 locals. \"I think for us to be able to look back over that whole five-year period and to see some things that began in a situation that was horrendous and negative, and actually out of those things we've seen real community.\" On the high street, it's difficult to remember how empty it was when lockdown was announced back in March 2020. But there are reminders of COVID. Just behind the library, a memorial board lists the names of those who died from the disease. It hits you when you see their dates of death so near to each other. Back on Bwlch Mountain, Bev tells me plans for Sunday's Day of Reflection. There will be a male voice choir and a chance for people to come together. \"It's a day of reflection, reflecting back, what we all went through - and hopefully we never have to go through that again.\""

        "Content": " Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been named Canadian prime minister after winning the Liberal Party leadership in a landslide victory. Mr Carney, who also used to head up Canada's central bank, had emerged as the frontrunner as his country was hit with tariffs imposed by President Trump. He ended up winning 85.9% of the vote. During his victory speech, he told the crowd: \"Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. \"He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.\" Mr Carney said Canada would keep retaliatory tariffs until \"the Americans show us respect\". Mr Trump's tariffs against Canada and his talk of making the country America's 51st state have infuriated Canadians. \n                  Who are the candidates to become Canada's next prime minister?\n                 \n                  Police hunting for three suspects after 12 injured in Toronto shooting\n                 \n                  Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding added to FBI's 10 most wanted list\n                 The American national anthem has been repeatedly booed at NHL and NBA games. \"Think about it. If they succeeded, they would destroy our way of life... America is a melting pot. Canada is a mosaic,\" Mr Carney added. \"America is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form.\" International correspondent Mark Carney had no problem convincing the Liberal Party he was the best man for the job. 85.9% of the vote speaks for itself. Now he must convince the country.  After unparalleled experience as central bank governor, both of Canada and of the UK, albeit at different times, he has the economic wherewithal to fortify the economy against the battering Donald Trump seems intent on dealing it.  He has made it very clear he is ready for the fight to come. \"In trade, as in hockey, we will win!\" he told his fellow liberals to wild applause. \"We're strongest when we are united,\" he told the country on X.  His conservative rivals had what seemed like an unbeatable lead in the polls until just a few short weeks ago, but Trump's trade tariffs have rallied Canadians behind the flag and their government.  That gives Mr Carney momentum ahead of a general election that will likely come sooner rather than later. Now he must exercise the political genius to capitalise on that. The 59-year-old will replace Justin Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015. Mr Trudeau announced he was stepping down in January after facing calls to quit from a chorus of his own MPs. The 53-year-old's popularity had declined as food and house prices rose. He will stay in post until Mr Carney is sworn in. Mr Carney will soon have to decide when to call a general election - a vote must take place on or before 20 October. In 2013, he became the first non-UK citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment came after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.

Footage circulating on the Telegram app claims to show the elite soldiers crouching as they make their way through the darkness of the pipe to the town of Sudzha. Some can be heard cursing in Russian and complaining about the commanders who sent them on the mission. One of the soldiers is heard saying: \"F*****g hell, where the f*** are we, boys?\" Another says: \"Where does the pipe go? To Sudzha, for f**** sake, that's f***ing crazy.\" Later in the clip a soldier is heard saying: \"We'll get there of course, but indignantly, because we're f*****g sick of the f*****g command.\" He later adds: \"They took our f*****g assault rifles too.\" Two of the soldiers are seen smoking cigarettes while a separate image shared on Telegram shows an operative wearing a gas mask. Ukraine war live updates The special forces soldiers walked around nine miles (15km) through the pipeline which Moscow had until recently used to send gas to Europe, according to Telegram posts by Ukrainian-born pro-Kremlin blogger Yuri Podolyaka. In the footage, the soldiers suggest the mission requires them to walk seven miles through the pipe. Mr Podolyaka says some of them spent several days in the pipeline before striking Ukrainian units from the rear near Sudzha. The operation formed part of efforts by Russia to recapture areas of Kursk which were seized by thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in a shock offensive in August last year. Another pro-Russian war blogger, who uses the alias Two Majors, said a major battle is under way in Sudzha after Moscow's special forces crept through the pipe. Meanwhile, Ukraine's general staff confirmed on Saturday that Russian soldiers had used the pipeline in an attempt to gain a foothold, but airborne assault forces promptly detected them, and they responded with rocket, artillery and drone attacks that destroyed Moscow's units. \"The enemy's losses in Sudzha are very high,\" the general staff reported. Read more:US pausing military aid is 'betrayal', Ukrainian soldier tells Sky NewsRussia 'appears to have ignored Trump warning' after deadly strike It comes as Ukraine's Air Assault Forces shared a video on Telegram on Saturday which it claims shows Kyiv's forces repelling Russian forces in Kursk with airstrikes. Sky News has not independently verified the footage. Months after Kyiv's forces seized parts of Kursk, Ukrainian soldiers are weary and bloodied by relentless assaults of more than 50,000 Russian troops, including some from Moscow's ally North Korea. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers run the risk of being encircled, open-source maps of the battlefield showed on Friday. Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said this morning that it had captured a settlement in Kursk and another in Ukraine's Sumy region. Russia also launched heavy aerial attacks overnight on Ukraine into Saturday - with at least 22 people killed, including 11 in the frontline town of Dobropilla in Ukraine's embattled eastern Donetsk region. Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskyy described the attacks as a \"vile and inhumane intimidation tactic\" by Russia. The attacks come after the US paused military aid and the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine this month after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Mr Zelenskyy descended into a confrontation in front of the world's media. The Trump administration's stance on Ukraine and apparent favouring of Moscow has sparked concern among European leaders. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics told Sky News on Sunday that European countries should \"absolutely\" introduce conscription as he conceded the continent was \"quite weak\" militarily in the face of the Russia threat. Meanwhile, Russian officials have been criticised after presenting mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine with gifts of meat grinders on International Women's Day. Russia is often accused of throwing its troops into a \"meat grinder\" with little regard for their lives. The local branch of government in the northwestern Russian town of Polyarniye Zori defended itself against the backlash, saying critics were making \"callous and provocative interpretations\" of the gifts."

The president added: \"It was one of the most brutal strikes, a combined one. The strike was deliberately calculated to cause maximum damage.

The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it was one of 2025's deadliest attacks for Ukrainian civilians. Some 24 hours earlier, Russia struck Ukrainian energy facilities using dozens of missiles and drones. The attacks hampered Ukraine's ability to supply power to its citizens and run weapons factories vital to its defences. When asked on Friday if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the US pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, Mr Trump responded: \"I think he's doing what anybody else would.\" Mr Zelenskyy did not mention intelligence-sharing on Saturday, but said he welcomed Mr Trump's proposal to bring in banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final peace settlement is reached.

        "Content": " Syria's new government has formed a committee to investigate reported mass revenge killings of a minority group - after the United Nations human rights chief called for \"swift actions\". Violent clashes, which a war monitoring group said had already killed 1,311 people, have continued for a fourth day in deposed president Bashar al Assad's coastal heartland. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement: \"The caretaker authorities' announcements of their intention to respect the law must be followed by swift actions to protect Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent any violations and abuses and achieve accountability when these occur.\"  US secretary of state Marco Rubio also weighed in, calling on Syrian authorities to hold the \"radical Islamist terrorists\" responsible for the killings accountable. He also said the US stood with the country's religious and ethnic minorities, while the UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the violence was \"horrific\". The violence spiralled into revenge killings against Assad's Alawite sect when thousands of armed supporters of Syria's new leaders from across the country descended to coastal areas to support the new administration's forces. Syria's state media said the violence - some of the deadliest in 13 years of civil war - has now moved to the countryside. \n                  'They left nobody': More than 1,000 people killed in some of Syria's deadliest violence\n                 \n                  Syria: 'Nearly 200 killed' in country's worst violence since Assad toppled\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 A Syrian security source said the pace of fighting had slowed around the cities of Latakia, Jabla and Baniyas, while forces searched surrounding mountainous areas where an estimated 5,000 pro-Assad insurgents were hiding. Some of these areas were attacked with artillery shells and drones, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The British-based observatory said 830 of those killed were civilians, while another 231 members of the Syrian security forces and 250 fighters loyal to Assad also died. Rami Abdulrahman, the head of SOHR, said the civilians included Alawite women and children. Syrian security sources said more than 300 of their members had been killed in clashes with former pro-Assad army personnel in coordinated attacks and ambushes on their forces that began on Thursday Mr Abdulrahman said the death toll was one of the highest since a chemical weapons attack by Assad's forces in 2013 which killed some 1,400 people in a Damascus suburb. Syrian state news said on Sunday a mass grave had been discovered near Qardaha, Assad's hometown, containing the bodies of recently killed security forces. Syria's leader Ahmed Sharaa, who faces the challenge of ruling a country fraught with factional tensions, urged Syrians not to let these strains further destabilise the country. The Alawites are a religious minority in Syria, originating from Shia Islam. The overthrown president Bashar al Assad belonged to the sect. They make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni, and mainly live in the country's coastal regions. During Assad's reign, the Alawites made up a large part of his support base and held top posts in the army and security agencies. Since his fall from power, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed. Civilians have now been targeted in revenge killings by Sunni Muslim militants loyal to the new government, who have blamed Assad's loyalists for attacks against the country's new security forces in recent weeks. The Alawites, along with Syria's other minority communities including Kurds, Christians and Druze, have said they are concerned about revenge attacks and are not convinced by the new government's promise of an inclusive country. \"We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace, we can live together,\" Mr Sharaa said at a mosque in Damascus. \"Rest assured about Syria, this country has the characteristics for survival… What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges.\" Syria's top diplomat, along with the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation. Europe and the US have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria until there is a clear, democratic political transition that is inclusive of Syria's minorities and civil society. The country desperately needs money to rebuild, however, after years of war. Rebels led by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group toppled Assad's government in December. Assad fled to Russia, leaving behind some of his closest advisers and supporters, while Sharaa's group led the appointment of an interim government and took over Syria's armed forces. Assad's toppling ended decades of dynastic rule by his family marked by severe repression and a devastating civil war that began as a peaceful uprising in 2011."

        "Content": " The Latvian president has urged European countries to \"absolutely\" introduce conscription, as he conceded the continent was \"quite weak\" militarily.  Edgars Rinkevics told Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that European countries should increase defence spending amid the \"ups and downs\" in relations with the US. Latvia introduced conscription for men in 2023 and has pushed defence spending to 4% of the country's GDP. \"Seeing what is happening in the world, the decision that we took - many other European countries need to follow that,\" Mr Rinkevics said. \"A lot of people are a little bit nervous. People are following the news. Of course strong reassurances [are] one thing, but another thing is other European governments [have] to make sure that we all get stronger.\" UK Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the government is not considering introducing conscription, but decisions may be needed in the future to respond to the \"new reality\" we are now living in.

If there is a failure to fulfil article five, then I think everybody really understands this is the end of NATO.\" While calling Latvia and fellow Baltic states Estonia and Lithuania the \"litmus test of NATO\", Mr Rinkevics also called for an increase in \"the overall presence\" on the countries' borders with Russia amid \"increasing risks\". \"What is now important is not only declarations, but also how those declarations are being implemented. I'm fine with the wordings, but we also need some deeds,\" he said. After the US's change in long-standing policy towards Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks, Mr Rinkevics insisted that Latvia's cooperation with the US is \"good\" but insisted that \"we do see the need also to apply equal pressure vis-a-vis Russia when it comes to the peace talks in Ukraine\". He said: \"I do see that the United States are right when it comes to requesting more defence spending for NATO European allies. But what I also believe is needed is the kind of diplomatic approach that we tried to explain our point of view to the United States. \"We are concentrating very much on the United States. Unfortunately, what we are not talking so much [about is] what we as Europe should do, and we see that Europe currently is quite weak. \"We all understand that we do not have military capacity, but we also understand that we need to build it up. So my current suggestion would be - while I do see some differences with the United States when it comes to how to approach Ukraine - to concentrate on our own task to raise defence expenditure.\"  The three Baltic countries - located on NATO's eastern flank with Russia - are among the highest defence spenders in NATO as a percentage of GDP. They are also, relative to their size, among the biggest supporters of Ukraine and have been the strongest voices in Europe raising the alarm about the threat posed by President Vladimir Putin for years."

        "Content": "Israel is cutting off its electricity supply to Gaza following Hamas' refusal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire deal. While the full extent of the effects of the power cut is not yet known, Gaza's desalination plants use it to produce drinking water for the besieged enclave's population of more than two million. It comes after Israel cut off all supplies of goods to Gaza last week.  Israel is seeking to get Hamas to agree to an extended first phase of a fragile ceasefire agreement which would see half of the remaining hostages being held in Gaza released in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. The first phase of the ceasefire deal, which in January brought to a halt the otherwise relentless bombing of Gaza since October 2023, ended last weekend. Hamas, the militant group responsible for the 7 October 2023 attacks which saw 1,200 people killed in southern Israel and 250 taken hostage, wants to start discussions for a second and more complicated phase of the ceasefire.

Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas said Sunday it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position, calling for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday \"in an effort to advance the negotiations\" around the ceasefire.  Its decision to cut off supplies to Gaza, where according to local authorities more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its offensive, has come under fire. \"Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,\" the United Nations human rights office said Friday. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations' inability to distribute it. Meanwhile, unprecedented and direct talks between Hamas leaders and Washington in recent days focused on the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, 21 and from New Jersey."

        "Content": "By Claire Gilbody Dickerson, news reporter  The quest to free thousands of enslaved scammers from facilities in Myanmar has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.  Last month, a highly publicised operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people who had been forced to scam Americans and others out of their life savings while enslaved in locked compounds. But what has been described as one of the largest potential rescues of forced labourers in modern history appears to have taken them from one nightmarish situation to another as the former scammers now face scarcity of food and no medical care in overcrowded centres at the border between Myanmar and Thailand They also have no idea when they may be able to go home.

The freed survivors are thought to be a small fraction of what the United States Institute of Peace believes are an estimated total of more than 300,000 scammers in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos that account for at least £34bn in stolen funds worldwide. Sky News' Asia correspondent Cordelia Lynch went undercover in October inside one of these scam centres in Cambodia, exposing the reality of life inside for thousands of workers who find themselves caught in a criminal web they can't escape from.

His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release. Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, previously said: \"China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos are working together to crack down on cyber scam activities in the Thai-Myanmar border area. \"Our mission is to cut off the black hands that reach out to the people and remove the cancer of online fraud.\" After the release of the Chinese actor, senior Chinese government officials then visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. Thailand responded by cutting electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.

As the number of people released has grown into the thousands, most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February. At one point, the Border Guard Force said more than 7,000 people were crammed in such facilities. \"It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\" said another Indian man, 24, from inside a makeshift detention centre. Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies."

        "Content": "\n          Sky News commentator\n              @adamboultonTABB\n By tradition, Irish politicians, north and south, are given privileged access to the White House for St Patrick's Day celebrations. There are a lot of Irish American voters so, in spite of DOGE and cost-cutting and Boston and New York voting Democrat, the great disrupter President Donald J Trump is still holding his own Paddy's party next Wednesday, five days ahead of the actual day. Trump also being Trump, the invitations are causing headaches for the potential guests. Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein and Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill, turned down their invitations before they even got one this year, taking \"a principled stance against the mass expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza\". The Democratic Unionist Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Emma Little-Pengelly, is flying over. It is an invitation Irish leaders can't refuse. No less than eight ministers from Dublin's coalition government will be fanning out across the United States to join in the fun and promote trade.  Prime Minister Micheal Martin faces an on-camera visit to the Oval Office. Will he be greeted by nice Donald, like Macron and Starmer, or berated by nasty Donald, like Zelenskyy? At least Trump has a golf course in Ireland, even though he seemed to lump it together with his property in the UK during the British prime minister's audience. Taoiseach Martin's scheduled breakfast with JD Vance may prove even more daunting. Vance claimed he didn't mean the UK or France, but as a potential \"security guarantee\" to Ukraine, Ireland would fall right into the category scorned by the vice president of \"some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". Ireland is a proudly neutral country which has never fought a foreign war. Nor could it field the \"20,000 troops\" Vance considered less effective than giving \"Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine\". Ireland has the lowest defence spending in the European Union, around 0.2% of GDP. The current minimum spending level stipulated for NATO members is 2%, Trump demanded 5%. But Ireland is not a NATO member. Ireland is trying to adapt to the Trump administration's inclination to turn its back on the defence of Europe, but Defence Minister Simon Harris admits it has \"a lot of catching up to do\". Irish rearmament is complicated by the conflicting demands of its constitutional neutrality, banning participation in military alliances, its membership of the European Union and even Northern Ireland's membership of the UK. Harris is also the leader of Fine Gael and deputy prime minister, or Tanaiste. He proposes to act \"aggressively\" to develop a defensive NATO-standard national war fighting capability. As well as increasing force numbers, plans would also reportedly see the size of the navy increased to 12 ships. There have been incursions by Russian naval and civilian vessels into Ireland's Exclusive Economic Zone. Trans-Atlantic data cables vulnerable to sabotage are vital to the UK and Ireland as a high-tech hub. The Irish Air Corps will be renamed the Irish Air Force and the government wants to acquire fighter jets. This plan will require additional funding. Fortunately, the Irish economy is one of the few in Europe which is currently not struggling. Even with a stronger defence force it is far from certain whether Ireland would be able to make a significant contribution. Until now Irish military commitments abroad have been strictly limited to peace keeping; for its size, Ireland has made a major contribution to UN blue beret forces such as UNIFIL in Lebanon. This has depended on permission from the UN Security Council. In recent years Russia, one of the P5 permanent members on the council, has vetoed the establishment of such forces in areas where it had an interest - such as in Georgia in 2009. The Irish government now proposes changing a so-called \"triple lock\" which prevents it from deploying more than 12 troops abroad without a vote by the UN Security Council, the Dail Eireann parliament and the government. The deployment number is to be lifted to 50 and the role of the UN will be removed. This is hardly surprising given that Trump's America is now voting the same as Russia and against its European allies. \"We don't believe that Putin or other leaders should have a veto on whether our troops should be deployed,\" Harris argues. \"This is a new era in Europe in which Ireland also faces significant new security and defence challenges.\" Sinn Fein and other left-wing parties oppose these plans, which they say are steps towards abandoning neutrality - something Irish government ministers reject. With the Fianna Fail-Fine Gael government behind them, they are likely to happen, bringing Ireland closer to both its EU allies and the United Kingdom. Led by France and Germany, the latest European Union summit pledged to dramatically increase their defence spending, with proposals for a procurement fund and possibly a European army. Both Finland and Sweden have abandoned their neutrality and joined NATO. Ireland has the option of doing likewise or not. Austria, Malta, and Cyprus are militarily neutral, although the latter two host bases. Hungary is closer to Russia and Slovenia has also come under pressure from Moscow. Ireland neutrality during the Second World War caused lasting bitterness with the UK, only dispelled by their mutual co-operation in the Northern Irish peace process. At the moment Ireland relies on the UK - for its air cover, the implicit protection of the nuclear deterrent and on Royal Navy maritime patrols in the increasingly contested Greenland-Iceland-UK gap through which hostile vessels venture. The UK is upping its presence at navy and RAF bases, so far without controversy. British ground troop numbers, which were such a point of contention during The Troubles, have severely reduced since then. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is host to several major defence manufacturers. At prime minister's questions this week, Starmer hailed the jobs and economic boost resulting from artillery shells made in Belfast being sent to Ukraine. Leo Varadkar was the last Irish prime minister to meet Trump for St Patrick's Day in the Oval Office during his first presidential term. Irish leaders usually avoid controversy - mindful of the large number of Irish illegal immigrants working in the US. Talking points with the prickly Americans have got even more sensitive since then. Ireland belongs to the EU which Trump claims is \"ripping us off\". Worse, Ireland by itself has a trade surplus with the US. Read more from Sky News:'Trump bump' turns to a Trump slumpFormer adviser on key principles behind US president's decision This has already led to a spat in preliminary talks ahead of the visit. The official minutes produced by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio states that their phone call discussed how to \"address the US-Ireland trade imbalance\". Harris contradicts this version, insisting the imbalance \"wasn't specifically referenced\". You can bet it will be on Wednesday. The return of Trump to the White House is tearing up relationships between old allies. Ireland faces some big questions about how to be safe in a more dangerous world. The Irish visitors have little option but to grin and bear whatever happens in Washington DC next week, but this year the \"craic\" will not be enough to paper over widening cracks between the US and Europe."

Local police had reported a \"suicidal individual\" possibly travelling to Washington DC from Indiana, the agency said.

His former aide Steve Bannon said the first few weeks would be 'days of thunder'.  It's been all of that and more. Domestically and globally Donald Trump has proudly upturned norms. One key question for me these past few weeks has been: if much of the world (and liberal America) has been buffeted and bewildered by Donald Trump, what do those who chose him back in November think, nearly 50 days in? I've been back to Pennsylvania, a place I have spent plenty of time over the past few years. It's crucial in every election and was particularly so last November. The state is sort of a microcosm for the country. To the east and west are the urban Democratic strongholds of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In between are the rural Republican heartlands. And dotted throughout are the hinterlands - smaller towns where there is more of a mix of voters but still with a general lean towards the Republicans or, more specifically, to Trump. \n                  Donald Trump says Ukraine 'may not survive' war against Russia even if US support continues\n                 \n                  US Secret Service shoots armed man near White House, agency says\n                 \n                  Trump100 Day 49: Q&A: A Europe-wide war, Trump vs Vance, and Toto\n                 Gettysburg and Waynesboro both voted broadly two-thirds for Trump and one-third for Kamala Harris back in November. On the edge of Gettysburg, a bleak rocky outcrop marks the location of the battle which changed the course of the civil war. The threads which stitch America run through this place. A few hundred metres away is the spot where Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg address. It was 1863 and America's 16th president marked the end of the battle with a reminder to a country divided by a civil war that it was a nation founded years earlier on the principles of liberty and equality. Lincoln was America's most consequential president, until now, maybe. In the town's Lincoln Square, a statue of the 16th president stands tall. My focus was the new White House occupant. \"10!\" It was the first of many 'tens' on my Trump scorecard. \"Oh he's doing great...Yeah he's doing real great,\" one man said. I asked what, in particular, he was happy with. \"The money he's making me.\" The theme was the same with the next person. \"Trying to pass no tax on social security for one, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime - help out the workers, help out the retirees, that's very important to me,\" Mike said. My third conversation was with a couple. I suggested to them that the federal firings had felt quite chaotic; a sledgehammer approach. \"No. I think they're using a scalpel. They're finding so much. It looks bad,\" the man said. \"We had too many people that were in those jobs, they weren't doing anything,\" his wife added. \"He's upsetting Europe as well...\" I said in my next conversation. \"That's not good, is it? We're supposed to be friends.\" I suggested with a smile. \"Yeah, well we need Europe to step up too,\" the man replied. \"Zelenskyy was here for a pay cheque and got a reality check,\" another said, referring to the Oval Office showdown. \"I believe he wants to keep this war going, because as soon as this war is over, he's going to be voted out,\" he said. \"We're an ocean apart. We're doing him a big favour by supporting him.\" So much of what I heard was parroting President Trump almost word for word. \"You know, we gave him, what, $300bn? Where did that money go?\" There was no point in telling him that the true American contribution was about half that, and that it is all fully and publicly accounted for. Lunch was at Chubby's, a local pizza joint where I met Tom Jaskulski, a retired federal worker, now a handyman. \"He campaigned on all these policies, and he's fulfilling them,\" Tom told me. \"It seems like the world's waking up when Donald Trump came in office. \"A lot of things are happening worldwide, not just in this country.\" Tom's score? \"10! Not because I'm wearing his hat, but a 10 because he's doing what he says he's going to do. \"You know, he's rattling the hornet's nest.\" Down the road, at the Yankee Doodle Pet Spa, Tina and her 22-year-old apprentice Molly had no regrets and were baffled that anyone could think they would. \"He's doing what he said he was going to do and I am quite happy with him right now,\" Tina said. Our conversation turned to Ukraine. I wanted to know her thoughts on President Trump's abruptly shifting position and near-abandonment of Kyiv. \"It's not our war. We have enough people in this country suffering, that's how I feel about it. I don't think they deserve our money,\" Tina said, quoting the president's exaggerated figures for how much America had spent in Ukraine. But then our conversation cut to the core of where America is right now: siloed worlds. Read more:Russia 'appears to have ignored Trump warning''Trump bump' turns to a Trump slump We were discussing Elon Musk and his efforts to cut government bureaucracy. \"The social security, blowing that open with all of the people that are over 124 still getting social security,\" Molly said of Musk's claim that he had discovered social security was being paid to dead people. \"160 years old, I heard...\" said Tina. \"Yeah, that's insane,\" Molly said. I interrupted: \"You know that's been debunked? That wasn't true. I'm worried that people are believing things that actually aren't true. That the Trump administration is telling you stuff that is not true. What do you think?\" \"I think it's both ways,\" Molly said, \"I think both sides put out fake news and fake propaganda for each other.\" It was clear she didn't know who to believe. She'd lost all trust in the legacy media. She and Tina had been drawn to social media and they'd concluded President Trump was trustworthy. Back in Lincoln Square, a chance meeting exposed the other side of all this - deep anxiety. \"I'm a trans person so a lot of his policies have been impacting transgender people and that is just, it's a scary time to live in,\" 22-year-old Em told me. \"There's a lot of hatred in the world right now, especially at so many groups of people. I mean, it's really... yeah...\" Em said before trailing off, face filled with anxiety and emotion. By nightfall my journey of conversations had taken me to the quiz night at a bar and brewery in Waynesboro. \"I've never been more embarrassed to be American...\" one woman called Jacqueline said. Her quiz night partner, Andrew, chipped in. \"I think it's the access to information. I think we don't go out and talk to each other. \"I think we're on the internet all day. A lot of people are just on the internet and they're getting news sources from their own echo chambers.\" \"Things have been going downhill for a long time,\" another man called Marco, at the next door table, said. \"I'm not saying Trump's right about everything, but you know what? At least he's trying, he's doing something different. And I agree with what he's doing.\" This wave of change has been profound. But to assume that those who chose this change - who chose Donald Trump - would have any regrets would be to fundamentally misunderstand America today. The profound sentiment among everyone we spoke to who voted for him is that he is putting America first with a tangibility that they have never felt before. It may turn out to be an illusion. But they feel no sense of that at the moment. He is rattling the cage and so many here couldn't be happier."

        "Content": " Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been named Canadian prime minister after winning the Liberal Party leadership in a landslide victory. Mr Carney, who also used to head up Canada's central bank, had emerged as the frontrunner as his country was hit with tariffs imposed by President Trump. He ended up winning 85.9% of the vote. During his victory speech, he told the crowd: \"Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. \"He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.\" Mr Carney said Canada would keep retaliatory tariffs until \"the Americans show us respect\". Mr Trump's tariffs against Canada and his talk of making the country America's 51st state have infuriated Canadians. \n                  Who are the candidates to become Canada's next prime minister?\n                 \n                  Police hunting for three suspects after 12 injured in Toronto shooting\n                 \n                  Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding added to FBI's 10 most wanted list\n                 The American national anthem has been repeatedly booed at NHL and NBA games. \"Think about it. If they succeeded, they would destroy our way of life... America is a melting pot. Canada is a mosaic,\" Mr Carney added. \"America is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form.\" International correspondent Mark Carney had no problem convincing the Liberal Party he was the best man for the job. 85.9% of the vote speaks for itself. Now he must convince the country.  After unparalleled experience as central bank governor, both of Canada and of the UK, albeit at different times, he has the economic wherewithal to fortify the economy against the battering Donald Trump seems intent on dealing it.  He has made it very clear he is ready for the fight to come. \"In trade, as in hockey, we will win!\" he told his fellow liberals to wild applause. \"We're strongest when we are united,\" he told the country on X.  His conservative rivals had what seemed like an unbeatable lead in the polls until just a few short weeks ago, but Trump's trade tariffs have rallied Canadians behind the flag and their government.  That gives Mr Carney momentum ahead of a general election that will likely come sooner rather than later. Now he must exercise the political genius to capitalise on that. The 59-year-old will replace Justin Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015. Mr Trudeau announced he was stepping down in January after facing calls to quit from a chorus of his own MPs. The 53-year-old's popularity had declined as food and house prices rose. He will stay in post until Mr Carney is sworn in. Mr Carney will soon have to decide when to call a general election - a vote must take place on or before 20 October. In 2013, he became the first non-UK citizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment came after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.  Read more:Trudeau steps down with his popularity in shredsCanadian PM criticises Trump over tariffs During leadership debates, Mr Carney argued he was the only person prepared to handle Trump. \"I know how to manage crises,\" he said. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party's chances in a parliamentary election."

        "Content": "\n          Sky News commentator\n              @adamboultonTABB\n By tradition, Irish politicians, north and south, are given privileged access to the White House for St Patrick's Day celebrations. There are a lot of Irish American voters so, in spite of DOGE and cost-cutting and Boston and New York voting Democrat, the great disrupter President Donald J Trump is still holding his own Paddy's party next Wednesday, five days ahead of the actual day. Trump also being Trump, the invitations are causing headaches for the potential guests. Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein and Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill, turned down their invitations before they even got one this year, taking \"a principled stance against the mass expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza\". The Democratic Unionist Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Emma Little-Pengelly, is flying over. It is an invitation Irish leaders can't refuse. No less than eight ministers from Dublin's coalition government will be fanning out across the United States to join in the fun and promote trade.  Prime Minister Micheal Martin faces an on-camera visit to the Oval Office. Will he be greeted by nice Donald, like Macron and Starmer, or berated by nasty Donald, like Zelenskyy? At least Trump has a golf course in Ireland, even though he seemed to lump it together with his property in the UK during the British prime minister's audience. Taoiseach Martin's scheduled breakfast with JD Vance may prove even more daunting. Vance claimed he didn't mean the UK or France, but as a potential \"security guarantee\" to Ukraine, Ireland would fall right into the category scorned by the vice president of \"some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". Ireland is a proudly neutral country which has never fought a foreign war. Nor could it field the \"20,000 troops\" Vance considered less effective than giving \"Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine\". Ireland has the lowest defence spending in the European Union, around 0.2% of GDP. The current minimum spending level stipulated for NATO members is 2%, Trump demanded 5%. But Ireland is not a NATO member. Ireland is trying to adapt to the Trump administration's inclination to turn its back on the defence of Europe, but Defence Minister Simon Harris admits it has \"a lot of catching up to do\". Irish rearmament is complicated by the conflicting demands of its constitutional neutrality, banning participation in military alliances, its membership of the European Union and even Northern Ireland's membership of the UK. Harris is also the leader of Fine Gael and deputy prime minister, or Tanaiste. He proposes to act \"aggressively\" to develop a defensive NATO-standard national war fighting capability. As well as increasing force numbers, plans would also reportedly see the size of the navy increased to 12 ships. There have been incursions by Russian naval and civilian vessels into Ireland's Exclusive Economic Zone. Trans-Atlantic data cables vulnerable to sabotage are vital to the UK and Ireland as a high-tech hub. The Irish Air Corps will be renamed the Irish Air Force and the government wants to acquire fighter jets. This plan will require additional funding. Fortunately, the Irish economy is one of the few in Europe which is currently not struggling. Even with a stronger defence force it is far from certain whether Ireland would be able to make a significant contribution. Until now Irish military commitments abroad have been strictly limited to peace keeping; for its size, Ireland has made a major contribution to UN blue beret forces such as UNIFIL in Lebanon. This has depended on permission from the UN Security Council. In recent years Russia, one of the P5 permanent members on the council, has vetoed the establishment of such forces in areas where it had an interest - such as in Georgia in 2009. The Irish government now proposes changing a so-called \"triple lock\" which prevents it from deploying more than 12 troops abroad without a vote by the UN Security Council, the Dail Eireann parliament and the government. The deployment number is to be lifted to 50 and the role of the UN will be removed. This is hardly surprising given that Trump's America is now voting the same as Russia and against its European allies. \"We don't believe that Putin or other leaders should have a veto on whether our troops should be deployed,\" Harris argues. \"This is a new era in Europe in which Ireland also faces significant new security and defence challenges.\" Sinn Fein and other left-wing parties oppose these plans, which they say are steps towards abandoning neutrality - something Irish government ministers reject. With the Fianna Fail-Fine Gael government behind them, they are likely to happen, bringing Ireland closer to both its EU allies and the United Kingdom. Led by France and Germany, the latest European Union summit pledged to dramatically increase their defence spending, with proposals for a procurement fund and possibly a European army. Both Finland and Sweden have abandoned their neutrality and joined NATO. Ireland has the option of doing likewise or not. Austria, Malta, and Cyprus are militarily neutral, although the latter two host bases. Hungary is closer to Russia and Slovenia has also come under pressure from Moscow. Ireland neutrality during the Second World War caused lasting bitterness with the UK, only dispelled by their mutual co-operation in the Northern Irish peace process. At the moment Ireland relies on the UK - for its air cover, the implicit protection of the nuclear deterrent and on Royal Navy maritime patrols in the increasingly contested Greenland-Iceland-UK gap through which hostile vessels venture. The UK is upping its presence at navy and RAF bases, so far without controversy. British ground troop numbers, which were such a point of contention during The Troubles, have severely reduced since then. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is host to several major defence manufacturers. At prime minister's questions this week, Starmer hailed the jobs and economic boost resulting from artillery shells made in Belfast being sent to Ukraine. Leo Varadkar was the last Irish prime minister to meet Trump for St Patrick's Day in the Oval Office during his first presidential term. Irish leaders usually avoid controversy - mindful of the large number of Irish illegal immigrants working in the US. Talking points with the prickly Americans have got even more sensitive since then. Ireland belongs to the EU which Trump claims is \"ripping us off\". Worse, Ireland by itself has a trade surplus with the US. Read more from Sky News:'Trump bump' turns to a Trump slumpFormer adviser on key principles behind US president's decision This has already led to a spat in preliminary talks ahead of the visit. The official minutes produced by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio states that their phone call discussed how to \"address the US-Ireland trade imbalance\". Harris contradicts this version, insisting the imbalance \"wasn't specifically referenced\". You can bet it will be on Wednesday. The return of Trump to the White House is tearing up relationships between old allies. Ireland faces some big questions about how to be safe in a more dangerous world. The Irish visitors have little option but to grin and bear whatever happens in Washington DC next week, but this year the \"craic\" will not be enough to paper over widening cracks between the US and Europe."

Sky News has learnt that Alteri and Modella Capital, both of which specialise in buying troubled retailers, are now the only two remaining parties in talks with WH Smith and its advisers about a potential deal. Doug Putman, the owner of HMV and widely tipped as a logical bidder for the chain, is no longer in talks with bankers at Greenhill, although he could yet try to pitch a new offer before the auction concludes, according to insiders. Alteri, which owns Bensons for Beds and had a disastrous spell in control of Missguided, the fashion brand, and Modella, which recently bought The Original Factory Shop and also owns Hobbycraft, would be expected to conduct major surgery on WH Smith's high street business if they took control. A definitive deal could be announced at the time of WH Smith's interim results in April. Sky News revealed in January that WH Smith's London-listed holding company was looking to offload the high street business, which comprises more than 500 shops. If completed, the deal would leave WH Smith as a company focused on its more lucrative travel retail operation in airports, railway stations and hospitals, which comprises about 1,200 stores globally.A sale of its high street arm would mark a watershed moment for the UK high street, which first saw the appearance of the name in 1792."

Europe does have to step up in terms of its own defence. \"President Trump isn't actually the first president to say that, but he said it more loudly and with more force than his predecessors - so, I think we have got to recognise that moment.\" 'UK cannot cling to old assumptions'  He added: \"When the world is changing as fast as it is, it's important that we don't cling on to old assumptions. \"I think the prime minister has played a tremendous role in recent weeks in responding to that situation and explaining it to the public. \"That is why the decision on increasing defence expenditure was needed. \"It may be why other decisions are needed in the future that respond to a new reality, and that we don't find ourselves caught operating under the same assumption as we used to in the past when the situation has changed.\" 'Battlefield is changing' Sir Keir Starmer has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP but has not set out when this will be achieved. Ministers say a defence review to be published this spring will set out a \"roadmap\" to it.  The number is much lower than the US president has demanded NATO members spend on defence, with Mr Trump saying they should all be spending 5% - an amount last seen during the Cold War. Asked if the \"new reality\" involved a bigger army, Mr McFadden said ministers were waiting for the conclusion of the review. But he added: \"One thing is for sure, you would not spend money today on the same things as you would 10 years ago. \"The experience of the three years of the war in Ukraine has shown just how fast the battlefield is changing in terms of cyber, drones, the use of intelligence.\" In the UK, military conscription has existed for two periods in modern times. The first was from 1916 to 1920 following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, due to the dwindling number of volunteers for military service. Lord Kitchener's campaign - promoted by his famous \"Your Country Needs You\" poster - had encouraged more than one million men to enlist by January 1915. But this was not enough. In January 1916, after much debate, the Military Service Act was passed. This imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, but exempted the medically unfit, clergymen, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker. Conscientious objectors – men who objected to fighting on moral grounds – were also exempt, and were given civilian jobs or non-fighting roles at the front. Conscription was not applied to Ireland because of the 1916 Easter Rising, although many Irishmen volunteered to fight. A second Act passed in May 1916 extended conscription to married men, and in 1918, during the last months of the war, the age limit was raised to 51. Conscription was extended until 1920 to allow the army to deal with continuing trouble spots in the Empire and parts of Europe. In the run-up to the Second World War, plans for limited conscription applying to single men aged between 20 and 22 were given parliamentary approval in the Military Training Act in May 1939. This required men to undertake six months' military training. When Britain declared war against Germany on 3 September 1939, the National Service (Armed Forces) Act imposed conscription on all males aged between 18 and 41. Those medically unfit were exempt, as were others in key industries and jobs such as baking, farming, medicine, and engineering, while conscientious objectors had to appear before a tribunal to argue their reasons for refusing to join up. In December 1941, a second National Service Act was approved, making all unmarried women and all childless widows between the ages of 20 and 30 liable to call-up. The last conscription term ended in 1960, although many soldiers chose to continue in the service beyond 1963. The Conservatives' first policy announcement of last year's general election campaign was that the party would introduce a new form of mandatory National Service for 18-year-olds. Asked if the Tories still stood by the plan which was in their manifesto, shadow home secretary Chris Philp told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"We are obviously not going to write our manifesto now, so I am not going to recommit to things in the previous manifesto. \"We'll need to do the thinking properly. I am not going to speculate four years ahead of the election. \"I don't think it was really exactly conscription that was being proposed, it was a National Citizen Service which is a bit different. \"The idea of getting younger people to do voluntary work and perform useful tasks is not a bad idea.\"  Last year, Britain's former top NATO commander told Sky News it was time to \"think the unthinkable\" and consider introducing conscription. General Sir Richard Sherriff, ex-deputy supreme allied commander of the military organisation, said: \"I think we need to get over many of the cultural hang-ups and assumptions, and frankly think the unthinkable. \"I think we need to go further and look carefully at conscription.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n The government is doing its best to lay the groundwork for cuts to welfare spending - ahead of what is surely set to be a major internal row in the Labour Party. The total bill for working-age health benefits has surged since the pandemic, rising from £36bn just before COVID to £48bn last year, and is forecast to grow to nearly £65bn in the next five years. The number of people claiming long-term sickness benefits - around 2.8 million - makes up nearly a third of the total number of working age individuals out of work, and is expected to increase to four million by the end of the decade. That huge and rising bill is under real pressure given the strain on government finances ahead of the spring statement due later this month. With the chancellor's room to manoeuvre constrained by her promises not to raise taxes or break her fiscal rules and borrow to fund day-to-day spending - it looks like billions of pounds in spending cuts are on the cards and the Department of Work and Pensions is clearly a key target. On Friday, Downing Street described welfare spending as \"unsustainable\". The government's strategy is to make a two-fold argument, making both an economic and a social case for change. \n                  Minister Pat McFadden says welfare cuts are 'coming soon'\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner 'won't speculate' over possible changes to two-child benefit cap\n                 \n                  Bank account snooping and driving bans planned in government crackdown on benefit fraudsters\n                 As Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden put it to Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, \"we cannot sit back and let this bill grow and write people off in the way that's happened for many years\", promising that reforms are coming \"soon\". \"It's not fair on the people involved, and it's not fair on the taxpayer,\" he said. \"We do have to act on this to make sure that we give everyone in the country the opportunity to work. We are the Labour Party. The clue is in the name. \"We cannot be relaxed about every year, hundreds of thousands more people going on these benefits.\" He argues that surveys show 200,000 of the 2.8 million would like to be able to work with the right support, which is set to be provided. Chancellor Rachel Reeves - a former shadow work and pensions secretary who once said Labour needed to be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" - has been making the case too.  In January, the chancellor promised to deliver \"fundamental reform\" of the welfare system which \"includes looking at areas that have been ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\". In an interview with Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby last week on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast the chancellor argued: \"We've got to reform our welfare system, because at the moment it's letting down taxpayers because it's costing too much, letting down our economy because there's too many people trapped on out of work benefits. \"And it's letting down the people who are recipients of benefits because they are trapped on benefits rather than actively supported back into work.\" Read more:PM coy on further tax risesSpending cuts expected this springWelfare cuts are 'coming soon' For Labour backbenchers concerned about the impact on some of the most vulnerable members of society, the arguments sound suspiciously like those made by the previous Conservative governments during their regular attempts to crack down on welfare spending. Most recently, Rishi Sunak promised to reform the system to encourage people out of work with long-term sickness to return to employment. His attack on the UK's \"sick note culture\" and controversial claim that benefits had become a \"lifestyle choice\" for some are unlikely to be echoed by the new Labour administration. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Interestingly, Mr Sunak's plans to cut benefits to disabled people and require them to prepare for work faced legal challenges in the high courts - with a judge ruling ministers failed to admit that cost savings were a key driver of the changes. This time ministers are making the financial imperative clearer. But many Labour MPs - already scarred by the backlash to cuts to pensioners' winter fuel allowance - will be deeply nervous."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       Parts of the planning system could be stripped away by the government in its attempts to speed up house building. Consulting bodies like Sports England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society will no longer be required for those looking to build under the new plans being considered by ministers. It is hoped a reduction in statutory consultees will reduce the waiting times for projects. Angela Rayner, who is both deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said: \"We've put growth at the heart of our plans as a government, with our Plan for Change milestone to secure 1.5 million homes and unleash Britain's potential to build. \"We need to reform the system to ensure it is sensible and balanced, and does not create unintended delays - putting a hold on people's lives and harming our efforts to build the homes people desperately need. \"New developments must still meet our high expectations to create the homes, facilities and infrastructure that communities need.\" Consultees will not be completely excised from the planning process under the changes. \n                  Angela Rayner 'won't speculate' over possible changes to two-child benefit cap\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner insists 1.5m housing target can be met as extra £350m pledged for affordable homes\n                 \n                  British steel 'absolutely has a future' despite US tariffs, says deputy PM Angela Rayner\n                 However, instead of it being mandatory to get the opinion of such bodies, their scope will be \"narrowed to focus on heritage, safety and environmental protection\", according to the government. The government says it has identified issues like consultees failing to engage \"proactively\", taking too long to provide advice, re-opening issues that have already been dealt with, submitting automatic objections which they later withdraw, and submitting advice for \"gold-plated\" outcomes that are unrealistic and difficult to achieve. More than 300 planning applications have been sent up to the secretary of state's desk in the past three years because of disagreements. Read more:PM vows to take on NIMBYsDevelopers could bypass planning committeesReeves announces backing for new Heathrow runway  The government has highlighted examples like a project to construct 140 homes in Bradford that was delayed because the application had \"not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls\". As well as reducing the number of consultees that have to be brought in, local authorities will also be told they only need to speak to the bodies if necessary, and decisions should not be held up by more than 21 days. The government states that \"existing open spaces, sports, recreational buildings and land, including playing fields, should not be built on unless an assessment has shown the space to be surplus to requirements or it will be replaced by equivalent or better provision\". Sport England said its remit in the planning system is to protect playing fields and other spaces for physical activity. \"Britain's childhood obesity crisis is rising and low physical activity levels cost our economy £7.4bn a year, making it vital we protect the places that local communities can be active,\" a spokesperson said. They added they \"look forward\" to taking part in the consultation exercise and \"arguing the importance of protecting playing fields and places where local people can keep active\". 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Sam Richards, CEO of pro-growth campaign group Britain Remade and former Conservative adviser said: \"I'm glad the deputy prime minister has taken on board many of the recommendations I made in my review of statutory consultees for the last government. \"It's a step in the right direction - but there's still more they can do. For example, they've not introduced a 'use it or lose it' approach to objections. This would remove the chance of statutory consults to intervene after they miss their deadline. \"There is also some irony in the fact that their decision to remove consultees from the process…has been put out to consultation.\""
