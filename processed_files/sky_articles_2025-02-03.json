        "Content": "By Andy Hayes, news reporter  Both Canada and Mexico have agreed to strengthen border security with the United States in return for a 30-day pause in tariffs. President Trump announced on Sunday he was imposing 25% taxes on goods from his country's northern and southern neighbours. Mexico was first to reach a deal with the White House. Its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said she was sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the US border immediately in return for a tariff delay. Mr Trump said the Mexican soldiers would be \"specifically designated\" to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the US, as well as illegal migrants. Further negotiations will now be carried out, he added. Ms Sheinbaum said she had a \"good conversation\" with him lasting at least 30 minutes just hours before the tariffs were due to begin. She also extracted a concession from Mr Trump - after explaining the \"seriousness\" of high-powered weapons coming over the border from the US and getting into the hands of criminal groups. \"It gives them firepower,\" she said. \"We asked that the US also help our country by helping stop this arms trafficking... he agreed.\" Canada made similar moves. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said almost 10,000 frontline personnel \"are and will be working on protecting the border\". He added on X that his country was appointing a \"fentanyl czar\", drugs cartels would be listed as terrorists, and there would be \"24/7 eyes on the border\". There will also be a Canada-US joint strike force to \"combat organised crime, fentanyl and money laundering\", Mr Trudeau announced. Both Trudeau and Trump will view the deal as a win - Trump for seemingly forcing the US's northern neighbour to act, and Trudeau for heading off sanctions with measures that for the most part (with the exception of the fentanyl czar) had already been announced in December. Donald Trump said he was \"very pleased with this initial outcome\" and work will begin see how a \"Final Economic Deal\" with Canada can be structured. US correspondent First Mexico, now Canada. In another whirlwind day, both of America's closest neighbours appear to have capitulated to President Trump.\nThe 25% tariffs on all goods from both countries were due to come into effect at midnight US Eastern time. But after calls between all three leaders, suddenly the tariffs were paused. So what's going on? Is this a clear signal of the power Trump wields? His blunt tool of using the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool has paid off? Bullying tactics work? Well, maybe. At least that's how Mr Trump wants everyone to think. Dance to my tune, or else. And it's absolutely the case that Mexico and Canada were in panic mode this weekend. But surely Donald Trump was panicking a little too when he saw the stock markets on Monday. He claimed this afternoon not to be taking any notice of their sharp falls. But we know he cares deeply about market reactions. Here's what's interesting: the statement from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded at first glance like it was announcing something new.\n\"Canada is implementing our $1.3bn border plan... nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border...\" But it's not a new announcement. Look at the language - \"are and will be\". In other words, \"we're doing this already Mr President, but if you want me to reiterate it to placate you, then I will...\" All that Justin Trudeau has done today is reiterate a border plan he announced last December. Mexico too has been doing an increasing amount in the fight against fentanyl though it could and probably now will do more. So has it all been theatre this past 24 hours? A show of brinkmanship from Donald Trump, which could have had a cliff-edge ending, but instead ended with him looking strong (and freaking out much of the developed world in the process) and his closest neighbours forced to reiterate their existing plans. Regarding China, a 10% tariff - in addition to those already in place - is still set to go ahead, though the White House said Mr Trump is due to talk to President Xi Jinping. The US president has, however, said 10% could be just the start. \"China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,\" he said. China has described fentanyl as America's problem, and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation, as well as taking other countermeasures. But it also left the door open for talks.  What is the UK situation on tariffs? President Trump hates trade deficits, and does not want to import more goods from another country than are sent there in return, says Sky's economics and data editor, Ed Conway. But Britain has bigger trade deficits than the US, Conway adds, and is one of the few countries in the world to import more goods from America than America imports from it. Read more:Trump threatens to cut off South Africa fundingBreaking economies could be just first step In addition, because the UK is no longer part of the European Union, any tariffs imposed on Brussels will not affect London. When asked about the UK, Mr Trump said: \"I think that one can be worked out.\" Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"early days\"."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n As the geographical spread of US President Donald Trump's pronouncements increases, so do the furrowed worry lines of leaders worldwide.Â   Day 14 of the Trump presidency brought threats of a global trade war and news of the likely demise of USAID - the US international aid and development agency. But the 78-year-old also spent his time complaining that \"South Africa is confiscating land\" and \"certain classes of People\" were being treated \"VERY BADLY\" in a post on his Truth Social website. He threatened to cut off all future funding to the country until a full investigation is carried out - so, what is actually going on? Well, Mr Trump has decided to re-energise a far-right cause celebre which rests on the allegation that white people in South Africa are being marginalised - and subjected to \"genocide\" at the hands of the country's black majority. Examples of this alleged behaviour take various forms - including a bill recently signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa, which gives the government the power to expropriate land without financial compensation. The law is designed to help redress the impact of decades of white minority rule in South Africa under the apartheid regime. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer thinks he can manage relations with the US, EU and China  - but that could be easier said than done\n                 \n                  Trump tariffs: How the UK finds itself in a strong position on US trade\n                 Three decades after Nelson Mandela led the country into the democratic era, white farmers still own the vast majority of farmland nationwide. White landowners possess three-quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, compared with 4% for black landowners. Black people make up about 80% of South Africa's total population while about 8% are white. The new legislation limits land expropriation to circumstances where it is \"just and equitable and in the public interest\" to do so - for example, situations where the property is not being used - or attempts to reach a financial settlement with the owner have failed. Read more:USAID 'shut down' will erode influence in increasingly dangerous worldBreaking economies could be just the first step for expansionist Trump In response to the president's missive, Mr Ramaphosa mounted the following response: \"The South African government has not confiscated any land. \"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner.\" The second part of the genocide claim is fuelled by the number of violent attacks on landowners in rural areas. Right-wing groups in South Africa say white farmers are targeted because of their race while the authorities do little - or nothing - to protect them. However, analysts say farm attacks reflect the country's desperately high rates of violent crime. One thing is certain - Mr Trump's comments on South Africa land ownership reflect the influence that South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk has on the US president. Responding on X to Ramaphosa's statement, Mr Musk said South Africa had \"openly racist ownership laws,\" suggesting white people are the victims."

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n Reform have topped a Sky News/YouGov poll for the first time as the party continues to shake up British politics. Nigel Farage's Reform UK has edged in front on 25%, with Labour pushed into second on 24% and the Tories on 21%. The YouGov poll, taken on Sunday and Monday, also puts the Lib Dems on 14% and Greens on 9%. Watch and follow reaction and analysis live in the Politics Hub  All the polling moves that push Reform UK to the top for the first time this week are within the margin of error and the overall picture remains unchanged - with Britain in a new period of three party politics in the polls. However, the symbolism of Reform UK topping the poll is likely to be seized on by MPs from all parties. \n                  Nigel Farage compares Reform polling with Donald Trump election victory\n                 \n                  Ex-minister involved in Liz Truss's mini-budget criticised for 'work ethic' comments\n                 \n                  Shadow home secretary Chris Philp joins Kemi Badenoch in criticising Tory immigration record\n                 One in five Tory voters at the last election would now vote for Reform.  The Tories are likely to be the hardest hit by the poll, having been in third place since YouGov restarted polling after the general election. The Sky News/YouGov poll also found Kemi Badenoch has slipped behind Nigel Farage when voters are asked whether they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of the leaders. Last month, Badenoch has a net favourability rating of -25, but that has now dropped to -29 this month. This puts her below Farage, who had a net favourability rating of -32 last month, which has now risen to -27 this month. Keir Starmer is less popular than both Farage and Badenoch, with his net favourability rating now at -36. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey is much more popular, with his net favourability rating now at -9 - although this is not directly translated across into voting intention. These figures are likely to restart the debate in the Tory party about whether they should consider merging with Reform UK, something which Badenoch has repeatedly rejected. A total of 43% of those polled who voted Tory in the last general election support a merger, compared with 31% against. Reform UK voters are more likely to oppose, with 40% against and 31% for."

        "Content": " A 15-year-old boy who died after being stabbed at a school in Sheffield has been named locally as Harvey Willgoose. Police were called to All Saints Catholic High School on Granville Road at 12.17pm on Monday after reports of a stabbing. South Yorkshire Police said the boy \"suffered serious injuries and despite the best efforts of the ambulance service, he sadly died a short time later\". The victim's family has been informed. A 15-year-old boy has been detained on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Speaking outside the force's headquarters, Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: \"It is with great sadness that I share with you today, a teenager has died following the stabbing at a Sheffield school earlier today. \"Our thoughts are with the family of the boy, his friends and the whole school community.\" ACC Butterfield said the force's officers are \"working at pace to build a full picture of how this tragedy has unfolded\". \"We know that what has happened will cause significant distress and concern,\" she said. \"I would like to reassure you that our officers will remain on scene and in the local area to offer reassurance to parents, staff and local residents as our investigation continues.\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts are with the family of the 15-year-old boy, adding the \"whole country\" will \"mourn with them\". \"Obviously there will be an investigation, but I think at this point I simply speak for the country, to the individuals affected, to the family in particular, but everybody impacted by this awful situation - a young boy has gone to school and hasn't returned home,\" he said. 'Second school lockdown in a week' Police have taped off a section inside one of the school buildings as members of the public laid tributes with balloons, flowers and messages at the school gates. It is the second time All Saints Catholic High School has gone into lockdown in a week, the PA news agency reported. Headteacher Sean Pender sent a message to parents on 29 January, saying: \"The reason for the lockdown was due to threatening behaviour between a small number of students where threats were made of physical violence.\" A 2023 Ofsted report rated the school, which had 1,398 pupils at the time, as \"good\". Inspectors found that most pupils behaved well and \"a strong ethos of warmth and respect pervades this school\". 'Avoid speculation' - police Meanwhile, ACC Butterfield warned the public to avoid sharing distressing content related to the stabbing on social media. She said: \"We urge you to be mindful that there are loved ones at the centre of this, and they are grieving the profound loss of a teenage boy in the most devastating of circumstances. \"We would therefore ask you to avoid speculation and the sharing of online content, which could be distressing to them and detrimental to our investigation. \"We urge anyone with any information that they believe can assist us to get in touch.\" Granville Road was closed from the tram stop to Fitzwalter Road, and police asked the public to avoid the area while emergency services carried out their work. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was \"devastated\" to hear about the stabbing. \"My heart goes out to his family, friends and the entire school community at this distressing time,\" she said. \"We are in contact with the school and council to offer support. Investigations are now under way.\" 'Serious questions need answering' Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh has said \"serious questions will have to be answered\" after the \"horrific news\" of the fatal stabbing. \"A criminal investigation will now obviously take place, but serious questions will have to be answered about how this could have happened and I will be working with the school, the police and the council to make sure they are.\" South Yorkshire's mayor, Oliver Coppard, said: \"This morning a teenage boy went to school like thousands of others across South Yorkshire but won't come home; a young man who was a member of our community, with his whole life ahead of him. \"The vast majority of our young people don't carry knives, but one incidence of knife crime is one too many, because when we do see knife crime happen all too often the consequences are utterly devastating, as they have been today.\""

        "Content": "A judge has warned Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawyers to stop publicly discussing their competing lawsuits. Both actors - who co-starred in 2024's It Ends With Us - have filed lawsuits against each other following an initial legal complaint from Lively. The 37-year-old accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the film - and an alleged subsequent plan to damage her reputation.   Baldoni then sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of hijacking both the production and marketing of the film, as well as allegedly attempting to smear him and others who worked on the production through false allegations. New York district court judge Lewis J Liman has scheduled a trial date combining the two claims for March 2026 - but warned both parties on Monday that their comments to the media could impact their cases.  Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb complained that Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman violated professional ethics rules for lawyers by accusing the actress of \"bullying\" in People magazine. He told a hearing at Manhattan federal court that \"it's very hard to un-ring the bell\" and argued such statements could taint a jury pool. But Mr Freedman complained \"this has not been a one-way street\", and claimed his comments to the magazine and on a podcast were a response to a New York Times article from 21 December that \"completely devastated\" Baldoni. Judge Liman has now adopted a state rule barring most out-of-court statements that could affect a case's outcome - with an exception to protect clients from prejudicial adverse publicity. Neither lawyer objected. Lively's legal team have previously accused Mr Freedman in a court filing of trying to influence potential jurors by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between her and Baldoni. Read more from Sky News:Grammys: Beyonce wins album of the yearReform tops landmark poll for first time In late December, Lively sued Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios and others in New York for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation, asking for unspecified damages. Baldoni then filed his lawsuit in January, accusing Lively and her husband, Deadpool star and Wrexham FC co-owner Reynolds, of defamation and extortion. He is seeking at least $400m (Â£321m) in damages. The actor also sued The New York Times newspaper for libel after it published allegations about him. Lively starred in the 2005 film The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants before rising to fame in the TV series Gossip Girl from 2007 to 2012. She is also known for films including The Town and The Shallows. Baldoni is known for the TV comedy series Jane The Virgin and for directing the 2019 film Five Feet Apart.

        "Content": " A 15-year-old boy who died after being stabbed at a school in Sheffield has been named locally as Harvey Willgoose. Police were called to All Saints Catholic High School on Granville Road at 12.17pm on Monday after reports of a stabbing. South Yorkshire Police said the boy \"suffered serious injuries and despite the best efforts of the ambulance service, he sadly died a short time later\". The victim's family has been informed. A 15-year-old boy has been detained on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Speaking outside the force's headquarters, Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: \"It is with great sadness that I share with you today, a teenager has died following the stabbing at a Sheffield school earlier today. \"Our thoughts are with the family of the boy, his friends and the whole school community.\" ACC Butterfield said the force's officers are \"working at pace to build a full picture of how this tragedy has unfolded\". \"We know that what has happened will cause significant distress and concern,\" she said. \"I would like to reassure you that our officers will remain on scene and in the local area to offer reassurance to parents, staff and local residents as our investigation continues.\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts are with the family of the 15-year-old boy, adding the \"whole country\" will \"mourn with them\". \"Obviously there will be an investigation, but I think at this point I simply speak for the country, to the individuals affected, to the family in particular, but everybody impacted by this awful situation - a young boy has gone to school and hasn't returned home,\" he said. 'Second school lockdown in a week' Police have taped off a section inside one of the school buildings as members of the public laid tributes with balloons, flowers and messages at the school gates. It is the second time All Saints Catholic High School has gone into lockdown in a week, the PA news agency reported. Headteacher Sean Pender sent a message to parents on 29 January, saying: \"The reason for the lockdown was due to threatening behaviour between a small number of students where threats were made of physical violence.\" A 2023 Ofsted report rated the school, which had 1,398 pupils at the time, as \"good\". Inspectors found that most pupils behaved well and \"a strong ethos of warmth and respect pervades this school\". 'Avoid speculation' - police Meanwhile, ACC Butterfield warned the public to avoid sharing distressing content related to the stabbing on social media. She said: \"We urge you to be mindful that there are loved ones at the centre of this, and they are grieving the profound loss of a teenage boy in the most devastating of circumstances. \"We would therefore ask you to avoid speculation and the sharing of online content, which could be distressing to them and detrimental to our investigation. \"We urge anyone with any information that they believe can assist us to get in touch.\" Granville Road was closed from the tram stop to Fitzwalter Road, and police asked the public to avoid the area while emergency services carried out their work. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was \"devastated\" to hear about the stabbing. \"My heart goes out to his family, friends and the entire school community at this distressing time,\" she said. \"We are in contact with the school and council to offer support. Investigations are now under way.\" 'Serious questions need answering' Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh has said \"serious questions will have to be answered\" after the \"horrific news\" of the fatal stabbing. \"A criminal investigation will now obviously take place, but serious questions will have to be answered about how this could have happened and I will be working with the school, the police and the council to make sure they are.\" South Yorkshire's mayor, Oliver Coppard, said: \"This morning a teenage boy went to school like thousands of others across South Yorkshire but won't come home; a young man who was a member of our community, with his whole life ahead of him. \"The vast majority of our young people don't carry knives, but one incidence of knife crime is one too many, because when we do see knife crime happen all too often the consequences are utterly devastating, as they have been today.\""

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n Reform have topped a Sky News/YouGov poll for the first time as the party continues to shake up British politics. Nigel Farage's Reform UK has edged in front on 25%, with Labour pushed into second on 24% and the Tories on 21%. The YouGov poll, taken on Sunday and Monday, also puts the Lib Dems on 14% and Greens on 9%. Watch and follow reaction and analysis live in the Politics Hub  All the polling moves that push Reform UK to the top for the first time this week are within the margin of error and the overall picture remains unchanged - with Britain in a new period of three party politics in the polls. However, the symbolism of Reform UK topping the poll is likely to be seized on by MPs from all parties. \n                  Nigel Farage compares Reform polling with Donald Trump election victory\n                 \n                  Ex-minister involved in Liz Truss's mini-budget criticised for 'work ethic' comments\n                 \n                  Shadow home secretary Chris Philp joins Kemi Badenoch in criticising Tory immigration record\n                 One in five Tory voters at the last election would now vote for Reform.  The Tories are likely to be the hardest hit by the poll, having been in third place since YouGov restarted polling after the general election. The Sky News/YouGov poll also found Kemi Badenoch has slipped behind Nigel Farage when voters are asked whether they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of the leaders. Last month, Badenoch has a net favourability rating of -25, but that has now dropped to -29 this month. This puts her below Farage, who had a net favourability rating of -32 last month, which has now risen to -27 this month. Keir Starmer is less popular than both Farage and Badenoch, with his net favourability rating now at -36. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey is much more popular, with his net favourability rating now at -9 - although this is not directly translated across into voting intention. These figures are likely to restart the debate in the Tory party about whether they should consider merging with Reform UK, something which Badenoch has repeatedly rejected. A total of 43% of those polled who voted Tory in the last general election support a merger, compared with 31% against. Reform UK voters are more likely to oppose, with 40% against and 31% for."

Daniel Khalife, 23, sparked a nationwide manhunt after clinging to the underside of a food delivery lorry to break out of the Category B jail on 6 September last year. He evaded capture for three days before he was spotted riding a stolen mountain bike along the canal towpath in Northolt, west London - about 14 miles away. Khalife, who was a lance corporal in the Royal Signals, was being held on remand accused of using his role in the military to pass secret information to Iranian spies. He was arrested after telling the British security services he wanted to be a \"double agent\" and claimed he had cultivated the relationship over more than two years in the national interest. But he was found guilty of a charge under the Official Secrets Act and another under the Terrorism Act at the end of last year at Woolwich Crown Court, having admitted escaping from lawful custody part-way through his trial. Sentencing as it happened Sentencing Khalife, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told him: \"When you joined the Army as a young man, you had the makings of an exemplary soldier. However, through the repeated violation of your oath of service, you showed yourself to be, instead, a dangerous fool.\" She added: \"You embarked on the course of conduct I have described because of a selfish desire to show off, to achieve by unregulated means what you were told will be difficult for you to achieve by conventional promotion.  \"The mere fact that you started on this dangerous and fantastical plan demonstrates your immaturity and lack of wisdom, that you thought it was appropriate to insert yourself - an unauthorised, unqualified and uninformed junior soldier - into communication with an enemy state is perhaps the clearest indication of the degree of folly in your failure to understand at the most obvious level the risk you posed.\" She said he would have been a blackmail risk for his whole career had he not been caught. The judge said Khalife contacted MI5 and MI6 in his attempts to become a double agent but was ignored. She added: \"The greater mischief in your offending is that, having failed to engage any response from the intelligence services of the United Kingdom, you continued betraying your country and exposed others to the possibility of harm.\" There was no reaction from Khalife, who looked down as the judge read out his sentence. The court heard Khalife, from Kingston, in southwest London, joined the Army aged 16, before contacting an Iranian middle-man through Facebook. Giving evidence, he said he wanted to prove himself after a senior officer told him he would not be able to work in intelligence because his mother was born in Iran. Khalife left material in public locations in exchange for cash in an old-fashioned spy tactic known as the \"dead drop\" or \"dead letter box\". He told his handlers he would stay in the military for 25-plus years for them and twice travelled from his barracks, in Staffordshire, to the Iranian embassy in South Kensington, in London. The court heard he flew to Istanbul, where he stayed in the Hilton hotel between 4 and 10 August 2020, and \"delivered a package\" for Iranian agents. The contact continued while he was deployed to Fort Hood, Texas, where he received training in Falcon, a military communications system and even after he was arrested and released on bail. Khalife told the jury he was an English \"patriot\" and \"not a terrorist or a traitor,\" claiming he \"thought he could be James Bond\" but had only passed on fake or useless information. But prosecutors said he \"exposed military personnel to serious harm\" when he shared sensitive information including a handwritten list of serving soldiers, including some in the SAS and SBS special services. Khalife's spying activities will not go down in the \"annals of history,\" his barrister told the court at his sentencing. Gul Nawaz Hussain KC reminded the judge how they described his actions as more Scooby Doo than James Bond, adding: \"What Daniel Khalife clearly chose to do was not born of malice, was not born of greed, religious fervour or ideological conviction. \"His intentions were neither sinister nor cynical.\" Mr Hussain told the court some of the documents Khalife had forged to pass to the Iranians were \"laughably fake\". Police said he had been planning his \"pretty audacious\" escape for \"quite some time\" and the court heard he wrote in his prison diary of a \"failed\" attempt on 21 August last year. Khalife, who got a job in the prison kitchen, said he used the trousers inmates wore as uniform, to make a rope, which he attached to the Bidfood lorry on 1 September to test prison security as it made its daily deliveries. \"When I had made the decision to actually leave the prison I was going to do it properly,\" he said, describing how he concealed himself, resting his back on the sling as the vehicle was searched. The driver Balazs Werner said two guards told him someone was missing as they checked the truck with a torch and mirror and he was surprised he was allowed to drive off and that the prison was not in lockdown. Khalife said he waited for the lorry to stop, dropped to the ground and lay in the prone position until it moved off. MI5, the Ministry of Defence and counter-terrorism police launched a nationwide manhunt, fearing Khalife would try to flee to Tehran or get to the Iranian embassy in London. He used the phone at the Rose of York pub in Richmond before a contact withdrew Â£400 from a nearby cashpoint, which he used to buy a sleeping bag, a mobile phone and a change of clothes.  CCTV footage captured his movements as he bought clothes from Marks & Spencer, stole a hat from Mountain Warehouse, drank coffee at McDonald's and even read about his escape in the newspaper. The court heard that while he was on the run, Khalife was in contact with his Iranian handlers, who used the code name \"David Smith\", and he sent the message: \"I wait.\" When he was arrested on the footpath of the Grand Union Canal on 9 September Khalife told police: \"My body aches. I f****d myself up under the lorry\" and \"I don't know how immigrants do it\". He told jurors his time on the run showed \"what a foolish idea it was to have someone of my skillset in prison\"."

James Wilton, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had just finished college when he decided he wanted to go to Ukraine as a volunteer fighter to help fend off Russia's land, air and sea invasion of its smaller neighbour. He was killed by a drone in July as he crossed open ground while carrying a heavy pack on his back. His friend, an American volunteer named Jason, tried to save him but was unable to. Follow all the latest on the Ukraine war  James's father, Graham Wilton, said his son had \"only just turned 18\" when he decided he wanted to go to Ukraine, where the war with Russia has been raging on for almost three years. As he paid tribute to the \"polite, likeable young man\", Mr Wilton said the teenager was resolved to go despite his mother and sisters being \"dead set against him going\". 'Some of the best days of his life' Mr Wilton said his son \"made it clear\" that joining the fight in Ukraine was what he wanted, so he \"did everything I possibly could to make sure he knew exactly what was involved and that he could be fully prepared for what may lay ahead\". Mr Wilton said James, who \"never really had a bad word to say about anyone or anything\", spent three months in Ukraine where he received combat training, and he described them as \"some of the best days of his life\". He said: \"Unfortunately it was not to be and I guess you can never fully prepare for what happens on the battlefield. \"I thank Jason for his bravery in trying to save James in a bad moment and for getting him off the battlefield, even if it was in vain.\"  Read more from Sky News: Pro-Russian paramilitary leader killed in Moscow bomb blastWhy Trump has threatened to cut off future funding to S Africa Jason told The Sun newspaper how they were crossing open ground, 20m apart, when James froze after seeing a Russian drone above them.

When Jason then went back to help the teenager, one of the drones hovered above him and he thought he was about to die as well, but it flew off without attacking him. Jason was subsequently badly injured by a mine. Speaking of his son's funeral in Ukraine, Mr Wilton said: \"This was the most difficult thing I have ever done. \"I spent two weeks in Kyiv and [with] James' comrades and friends and it was a very emotional trip. \"I made some friends for life in James' fellow soldiers and wish them all well.\""

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  What if Britain has, almost entirely by accident, navigated itself into about the best possible position it could be in, as Donald Trump embarks on a trade war with nearly all his economic partners? I realise this might, at first, sound a little odd. After all, when the world is facing economically-destructive measures (blanket tariffs are invariably value-destructive, in the short run at least) it's hard to see much in the way of victories. Moreover, when it comes to Donald Trump, no one, including his own cabinet and staff, can quite predict what will happen next. Consider the roller-coaster over tariffs in the past few days alone. Even so, the fact remains that of all the countries and regions in the world, Britain seems much less likely than most to face the kind of peremptory tariffs the president is so keen on. Trade war latest: Trump pauses Mexico tariffs for a month To see why, it helps to remember that the one thing Mr Trump hates above all else is trade deficits - when you import more goods (and it seems to be goods he mostly cares about) from another country than you send there in return. America has an enormous trade deficit with China and with Mexico too, not to mention a smaller but not insubstantial deficit with Canada. When the president talks about the reasons for his tariffs he sometimes mentions illegal fentanyl imports, but, even more often, he references the size of the trade deficits. He wants America to make more stuff domestically and suck in less stuff from overseas. We could have a long conversation (and I suspect we probably will have a long conversation in the coming months) about the extent to which deficits are, per se, a bad thing. But in the short run let's focus on the UK and its strengths in this game. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer thinks he can manage relations with the US, EU and China  - but that could be easier said than done\n                 \n                  Why Trump has threatened to cut off all future funding to South Africa\n                 First, since the UK is no longer part of the European Union, it will not automatically face the same trade terms as its neighbours on the continent. If the US imposes tariffs on the EU, Britain will not necessarily face them. Second, if there is one country in the world with even bigger trade deficits than the US, it's Britain. This country has deindustrialised even quicker than America, with the upshot that unlike the EU or Canada or Mexico, Britain is one of the few countries in the world to import more goods from America than America imports from it.  Footnote: that last point actually depends on whose numbers you're looking at. Look at America's figures and it has a trade surplus with the UK. Look at Britain's figures and America has a trade deficit with us. But either way, both are very small. The numbers are essentially balanced. Third, in recent months, the new Labour government has begun to improve its relationship with China. Chancellor Rachel Reeves went on a financial diplomacy mission to Beijing last month. And unlike nearly every other industrialised country in the developed world, Britain has not imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Many diplomats have raised their eyebrows about this, but in the event that America wanted to do a deal with Britain, this is precisely the kind of thing the government could quickly reverse: \"Oh alright then - in return for this trade deal, we're willing to impose those tariffs on China - the ones everyone else has already introduced.\" Read more:Trump says Canada should be 'cherished 51st state'Why has Trump targeted Mexico and Canada?How Trump's tariffs could impact consumers The funny thing about these three strengths is that, first off, up until recently many would have seen each of them - Brexit, our deindustrialisation and our cosying up to China - as weaknesses rather than strengths. They certainly weren't part of any grand strategic plan. Even so, the UK nonetheless finds itself in an unexpectedly propitious position when it comes to negotiating with the US. It has a better chance than most nations to act as a diplomatic bridge between America and Europe. Its chances of sealing that much-vaunted trade deal with the US have improved rather than deteriorated. Indeed, I'm told that leading members of the administration believe a trade deal with the UK could be sealed in a matter of months. Whether that actually eventuates remains to be seen. After all, if there's one thing you can't predict when it comes to Donald Trump it's, well, anything."

        "Content": "By Andy Hayes, news reporter  Both Canada and Mexico have agreed to strengthen border security with the United States in return for a 30-day pause in tariffs. President Trump announced on Sunday he was imposing 25% taxes on goods from his country's northern and southern neighbours. Mexico was first to reach a deal with the White House. Its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said she was sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the US border immediately in return for a tariff delay. Mr Trump said the Mexican soldiers would be \"specifically designated\" to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the US, as well as illegal migrants. Further negotiations will now be carried out, he added. Ms Sheinbaum said she had a \"good conversation\" with him lasting at least 30 minutes just hours before the tariffs were due to begin. She also extracted a concession from Mr Trump - after explaining the \"seriousness\" of high-powered weapons coming over the border from the US and getting into the hands of criminal groups. \"It gives them firepower,\" she said. \"We asked that the US also help our country by helping stop this arms trafficking... he agreed.\" Canada made similar moves. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said almost 10,000 frontline personnel \"are and will be working on protecting the border\". He added on X that his country was appointing a \"fentanyl czar\", drugs cartels would be listed as terrorists, and there would be \"24/7 eyes on the border\". There will also be a Canada-US joint strike force to \"combat organised crime, fentanyl and money laundering\", Mr Trudeau announced. Both Trudeau and Trump will view the deal as a win - Trump for seemingly forcing the US's northern neighbour to act, and Trudeau for heading off sanctions with measures that for the most part (with the exception of the fentanyl czar) had already been announced in December. Donald Trump said he was \"very pleased with this initial outcome\" and work will begin see how a \"Final Economic Deal\" with Canada can be structured. US correspondent First Mexico, now Canada. In another whirlwind day, both of America's closest neighbours appear to have capitulated to President Trump.\nThe 25% tariffs on all goods from both countries were due to come into effect at midnight US Eastern time. But after calls between all three leaders, suddenly the tariffs were paused. So what's going on? Is this a clear signal of the power Trump wields? His blunt tool of using the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool has paid off? Bullying tactics work? Well, maybe. At least that's how Mr Trump wants everyone to think. Dance to my tune, or else. And it's absolutely the case that Mexico and Canada were in panic mode this weekend. But surely Donald Trump was panicking a little too when he saw the stock markets on Monday. He claimed this afternoon not to be taking any notice of their sharp falls. But we know he cares deeply about market reactions. Here's what's interesting: the statement from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded at first glance like it was announcing something new.\n\"Canada is implementing our $1.3bn border plan... nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border...\" But it's not a new announcement. Look at the language - \"are and will be\". In other words, \"we're doing this already Mr President, but if you want me to reiterate it to placate you, then I will...\" All that Justin Trudeau has done today is reiterate a border plan he announced last December. Mexico too has been doing an increasing amount in the fight against fentanyl though it could and probably now will do more. So has it all been theatre this past 24 hours? A show of brinkmanship from Donald Trump, which could have had a cliff-edge ending, but instead ended with him looking strong (and freaking out much of the developed world in the process) and his closest neighbours forced to reiterate their existing plans. Regarding China, a 10% tariff - in addition to those already in place - is still set to go ahead, though the White House said Mr Trump is due to talk to President Xi Jinping. The US president has, however, said 10% could be just the start. \"China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,\" he said. China has described fentanyl as America's problem, and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation, as well as taking other countermeasures. But it also left the door open for talks.  What is the UK situation on tariffs? President Trump hates trade deficits, and does not want to import more goods from another country than are sent there in return, says Sky's economics and data editor, Ed Conway. But Britain has bigger trade deficits than the US, Conway adds, and is one of the few countries in the world to import more goods from America than America imports from it. Read more:Trump threatens to cut off South Africa fundingBreaking economies could be just first step In addition, because the UK is no longer part of the European Union, any tariffs imposed on Brussels will not affect London.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, kicking off a trade war that will affect the globe. Here we look at the tariffs and what they all mean for the world: What did Trump announce? The US president said on Sunday that goods from Mexico and Canada will face 25% tariffs, while 10% taxes will be implemented on imports from China. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate. Trade war latest: Follow live updates The levies were expected to all take effect on Tuesday, with Mexico and Canada both announcing counter-tariffs of their own in response. However, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a news conference on Monday that implementation of the tariffs would be paused for a month, after she and Mr Trump had a conversation and came to an agreement. But Mr Trump has also threatened to go further, saying tariffs on the European Union would be implemented \"pretty soon\".  When questioned about the UK, the president said Britain was \"out of line\" when it came to trade but he thought the situation could be \"worked out\" without the use of tariffs. What are tariffs, and how do they work? Put simply, tariffs are taxes on goods that are brought in from other countries. By raising the price of imports, tariffs aim to protect domestic manufacturers by making locally made goods cheaper. Contrary to what Mr Trump has said, it is not foreign countries that pay tariffs, but the importing companies that buy the goods. For example, American businesses like Walmart or Target pay tariffs directly to the US treasury. In the US, these tariffs are collected by customs and border protection agents, who are stationed at 328 ports of entry across the country. To compensate for tariffs, companies then put up their prices, so customers end up paying more for goods. Tariffs can also damage foreign countries as it makes their products pricier and harder to sell. This can lead to them cutting prices (and sacrificing profits) to offset levies and maintain their market share in the US. Why is Trump doing this? Mr Trump has argued that imposing higher levies will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. On Mexico, the US leader claimed drug traffickers and the country's government \"have an intolerable alliance\" that in turn impacts national security. He further claimed that Mexican drug cartels are operating in Canada. On China, he said the country's government provides a \"safe haven\" for criminal organisations. He has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. \"We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he said. His aim appears to be to force governments in those countries to work much harder to prevent what he calls illegal migration and the smuggling of the deadly drug fentanyl - as appears to have been agreed by Mexico. But, even if the countries do not do what America wants, it will still potentially benefit firms that produce goods in the US. What could the consequences be? Mexico and Canada are two of America's largest trading partners, with the tariffs upending decades-old trade relationships. Goods that could be affected most by the incoming tariffs include fruit and veg, petrol and oil, cars and vehicle parts and electronic goods. New analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University found that the average US household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 US dollars (Â£944) in income from the tariffs. Read more: This is how US consumers will be affected  The research also found that economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, as the tariffs forced up prices. Immediate consequences were felt on Monday morning, as shares on Asian markets took a tumble. Japan's Nikkei opened down 2.9% while Australia's benchmark - often a proxy trade for Chinese markets - fell 1.8%. Stocks in Hong Kong, which include listings of Chinese companies, fell 1.1%. UK stocks were also significantly down, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index - containing the most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange - dropped more than 1.3% on the open. In Europe, stock markets opened sharply lower while the euro slid 1.3%. The Europe-wide index of companies, the Stoxx 600 dropped as much as 1.5%. While Mexico's peso hit its lowest in nearly three years. 'Very scary path' Sky News' data and economics editor Ed Conway said the long term consequences of a trade war is that \"everyone gets poorer\", which is what happened to the world before World War Two. \"As countries get poorer, they get frustrated and you get more nationalism,\" Conway said, speaking on Friday's Sky News Daily podcast. \"This is exactly what happened in the 1930s, and the world ended up at war with each other. It is a very, very scary path, and yes, we are basically on a potential of that path.\" However, Conway added that one positive of Mr Trump's tariffs could be highlighting \"massive imbalances\" within the global economy. He said Mr Trump may be able to shift the conversation to problems that \"economists don't want to talk about\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð \"At the moment, we have a dysfunctional global economy,\" he explained. \"You have got massive imbalances like trade deficits [when a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports] and trade surpluses [when a country's exports exceeds the cost of its imports]. \"There might well be a better way of everyone getting together and having a conversation and working out how to align their affairs, so we don't have these imbalances in the future. \"And tariffs help to get you to this point.\" How has the world reacted? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted strongly against Mr Trump's tariffs, saying his country would impose 25% tariffs on $155bn Canadian dollars (Â£85.9bn) of US goods in response. He added that the move would split the two countries apart, and urged Canadians to choose domestic products rather than American ones.  Mexican President Ms Sheinbaum posted on X on Sunday to say she had ordered her economy minister to implement tariff and non-tariff measures to defend Mexico's interests. She said her government \"categorically rejects\" the claim that it has \"alliances with criminal organisations\" and called on the White House to \"fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities\". A day later, she posted saying she and Mr Trump had a \"good conversation\" and \"reached a series of agreements\". These agreements include Mexico sending 10,000 troops to the border to \"prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl\". Mr Trump responded to the agreement with Ms Sheinbaum, saying negotiations between the two will be ongoing to try and achieve a \"deal\". Meanwhile, China has claimed the US action violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and vowed to bring a case before the body that governs global commerce. It also threatened to take \"necessary counter-measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests\".  A spokesperson for the UK government reiterated that the US is an \"indispensable ally\" and one of the country's \"closest trading partners\". They added that the trading relationship was \"fair and balanced\", after Mr Trump criticised the UK, saying it was \"out of line\". European Union (EU) leaders have also taken a strong stance against looming US tariffs. Kaja Kallas, the chief of foreign policy for the bloc, said there were no winners in a trade war, and if the US and Europe started one \"then the one laughing on the side is China\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz added that the EU is strong enough to \"respond to tariffs with our own tariffs\", while French President Emmanuel Macron said declarations by the US were pushing Europe to be \"stronger and more united\".  What's the history of trade wars? Imposing tariffs is not new to Mr Trump, or the US for that matter. During his first term in the White House, he imposed higher levies on China and Vietnam. In 2018, he imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium from most countries, a response to what he said was the unfair impact of Chinese steel driving down prices and negatively affecting the US steel industry. China then hit back with retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including 15% on 120 American products such as fruits, nuts, wine and steel pipes and a 25% tariff on US pork and recycled aluminium. Before that, democrat Jimmy Carter went so far as to completely ban the sale of wheat to Russia, which remained in effect until Ronald Reagan ended it in 1981.

A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Mr Trump's tariffs the first time around failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \"neither raised nor lowered US employment'' when they were supposed to protect jobs, according to Sky News' US partner network NBC News."

Salwan Najem, a 50-year-old Swedish citizen, was given a suspended sentence and fined 4,000 crowns (Â£289) over the Koran burnings and derogatory comments he made about Muslims in the 2023 incidents.

The Stockholm district court said Sweden had extensive free speech rights and that followers of a religion must accept that they would sometimes feel offended, but that Najem and Momika had \"by a wide margin\" overstepped the mark for reasonable and factual religious criticism. The court said the Koran did not have any special protection just because it was a holy scripture for Muslims and that there could be cases where burning was not considered a hate crime. Najem was found guilty of hate crimes for \"having expressed contempt for the Muslim ethnic group because of their religious beliefs on four occasions\", the court said. Najem's lawyer has said he would be appealing against the verdict."

James Wilton, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had just finished college when he decided he wanted to go to Ukraine as a volunteer fighter to help fend off Russia's land, air and sea invasion of its smaller neighbour. He was killed by a drone in July as he crossed open ground while carrying a heavy pack on his back. His friend, an American volunteer named Jason, tried to save him but was unable to. Follow all the latest on the Ukraine war  James's father, Graham Wilton, said his son had \"only just turned 18\" when he decided he wanted to go to Ukraine, where the war with Russia has been raging on for almost three years. As he paid tribute to the \"polite, likeable young man\", Mr Wilton said the teenager was resolved to go despite his mother and sisters being \"dead set against him going\". 'Some of the best days of his life' Mr Wilton said his son \"made it clear\" that joining the fight in Ukraine was what he wanted, so he \"did everything I possibly could to make sure he knew exactly what was involved and that he could be fully prepared for what may lay ahead\". Mr Wilton said James, who \"never really had a bad word to say about anyone or anything\", spent three months in Ukraine where he received combat training, and he described them as \"some of the best days of his life\". He said: \"Unfortunately it was not to be and I guess you can never fully prepare for what happens on the battlefield. \"I thank Jason for his bravery in trying to save James in a bad moment and for getting him off the battlefield, even if it was in vain.\"  Read more from Sky News: Pro-Russian paramilitary leader killed in Moscow bomb blastWhy Trump has threatened to cut off future funding to S Africa Jason told The Sun newspaper how they were crossing open ground, 20m apart, when James froze after seeing a Russian drone above them. While they tried to run for cover, weighed down with backpacks, two more drones appeared and James was fatally wounded by one of them. When Jason then went back to help the teenager, one of the drones hovered above him and he thought he was about to die as well, but it flew off without attacking him. Jason was subsequently badly injured by a mine. Speaking of his son's funeral in Ukraine, Mr Wilton said: \"This was the most difficult thing I have ever done. \"I spent two weeks in Kyiv and [with] James' comrades and friends and it was a very emotional trip. \"I made some friends for life in James' fellow soldiers and wish them all well.\""

What the Madrid court heard in depth was the alleged attempt by Rubiales and his Spanish football federation associates to undermine the star player and dismiss her claims. And why was Hermoso seen laughing - still celebratory on the outside after Spain's victory over England in Sydney?  \"My laughing and yelling was nothing to do with how I was actually feeling as a result of the kiss,\" she recalled. Inside she felt like crying. There was also a determination not to be denied the chance to celebrate and somehow take away from her teammates' success. And just shock. \"I couldn't react because we were euphoric,\" Hermoso testified. The court was taken back to the statement the team's press officers pressured Hermoso into endorsing as they prepared to fly home, backing the FA chief. \n                  Jenni Hermoso 'never' agreed to kiss from former Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales\n                 \n                  Ex-Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales to stand trial for kissing player Jenni Hermoso\n                 \n                  Luis Rubiales arrested at Madrid airport in corruption investigation\n                 \"Do whatever you want,\" she recalled responding in frustration. A \"mutual, totally spontaneous gesture\" is how it described the kiss. It was a statement later disowned by her when she denounced the aggressive act. An attempt by Rubiales to film a video together was rejected by Hermoso, the court heard. Back in Madrid, Rubiales complained he was a victim of a \"witch hunt\", further undermining Hermoso. Calls to stand down were defied until he was forced out of the Spanish FA and banned from football for three years. It created a moment of reckoning for Spanish football and the country as a whole over its response to sexism. Next week, Rubiales and three co-defendants from the Spanish FA are due to testify in Madrid as they deny wrongdoing. Jenni Hermoso is seeking justice, hoping to get her life back and reclaim the World Cup win as a moment of joy."

        "Content": "By Ali Fortescue, political correspondent, and Josh Gafson, politics producer   More people are crossing the English Channel in small boats on the weekend. Our data analysis shows last year 40% of the total number of arrivals happened on a Saturday or Sunday. We have been looking into possible reasons why many more people are arriving in small boats on the weekend, and the explanation might not be quite what you expect. Here are a few theories. French staffing and resources One suggestion is that French border force, police and coastguard are not working to a consistent level seven days a week. \"Gangs have realised there are lower or less engaged staffing on weekends on the French side,\" a former senior Home Office official who worked closely on deals with the French told Sky News. A former immigration minister said they found it \"frustrating\" that \"we were paying the French but weren't able to specify operational deployments\". \n                  Day 13: How Trump's migration raids are impacting one Chicago community\n                 \n                  Shadow home secretary Chris Philp joins Kemi Badenoch in criticising Tory immigration record\n                 \n                  GPS-tagged asylum seeker trial ended with no benefit, Home Office says\n                 They said it would \"not surprise me if the French had fewer people at the weekend and the people smugglers have come to realise that\". Hundreds of millions have been given by the UK to France to police the Calais coast, most recently almost Â£500m in 2023. Another former senior government official with responsibility for borders said the French would be able to demonstrate that \"hundreds or thousands of officers are working there\" but \"strategically it suits France to have the gust with us\". But when we put this to the French side there was a pushback. Marc de Fleurian, the Calais MP from Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, says \"blaming the other side of the Channel\" is the \"easy answer\". He said it's \"cowardly to say it's the other side's fault\". Read more:UK to introduce 'world first' sanctions regime to target smugglersCan government make bold plan bite?Starmer's year to prove he can deliver on small boats Pierre Henri Dumont, who was the Calais MP from 2017-2024, said: \"The reality is you can have as many police officers as you want, but people will cross the Channel. If you have eight rather than 100 police officers that won't change anything at all.\" A French coastguard source told Sky News there are the same staffing levels at the weekend, he says \"any suggestion there is less staffing on the weekends is laughable and an easy thing to say\". Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said the government's work with the French saw \"more than 28,000 dangerous unnecessary crossing attempts prevented last year\". He added French law enforcing officers \"routinely patrol beaches on weekends as well as during the week\". Smuggler planning Smuggler supply chains might be linked to a specific day for a range of reasons, for example, as one former senior Home Office official suggests, the fact \"boat engines, or parts, might arrive on a Friday\". Mr Dumont says smuggling networks rely on people to do small jobs, like transporting boats, who may also have day jobs in the week. He says the reasons behind the weekend uptick \"are not necessarily predictable ones\". Another factor may be that because French police tend not to intervene once a boat is in the water, many small boats set off from inland waterways. The canal-type waterways which come inland before the Channel are often full of fishing boats on weekdays, making it easier to launch from the waterways on weekends. Another suggestion from a Home Office source is that while many migrants who cross the channel are based in the camps around Calais, many use public transport to arrive for a timed departure and are therefore reliant on transport timetables which may be more limited at different times of the week. Weather coincidence Leaked Home Office analysis shows that of the number of weekend days where small boat crossings were more likely because of good weather conditions was disproportionately high last year. The figures show that 61 out of 197 days where the weather meant there was a realistic possibility, likely or highly likely there would be a channel crossing were weekend days. However, we only have figures for 2024, and it seems unlikely the weather alone could account for three years of higher crossings on weekend days."

The bomb detonated as Mr Sarkisyan and his bodyguards entered the Scarlet Sails complex in the Russian capital. One bodyguard was killed and three more injured, Kommersant reported.

Like at other gated communities in the Russian capital, visitors are required to show ID to gain entry and must have a valid reason. So how did someone smuggle in an explosive? One suggestion here is that the perpetrator could have posed as a courier or contractor.

And inside the compound, there were dozens of law enforcement officers on patrol - an elite neighbourhood now on high alert. 'Crime boss' Ukraine's SBU intelligence service previously described Mr Sarkisyan, who was born in Armenia, as a \"crime boss\" in the Donetsk region, which Russia has largely controlled since 2014. It also said he was officially suspected of participating in and aiding \"illegal armed groups\". The SBU said Mr Sarkisyan had formed a pro-Russian military unit made up of local convict fighters and organised purchases of supplies for frontline units.

Torrential rains have hammered the state of Queensland over the past three days - with residents warned the floodwaters may \"pose a threat to life and property\". The rainfall has also left around 10,000 homes without power, according to reports in Australia. The flooding in Queensland was triggered by heavy rain from a low pressure system rich in tropical moisture, Australia's weather forecaster, the Bureau of Meteorology, said. More than 47 inches of rain has been dumped on the town of Ingham and the city of Townsville over the past three days, Nine News reports. Matt Collopy, from the Bureau of Meteorology, told Australian media there has been \"record-breaking rainfall in many locations\", without specifying where. Emergency alerts have been issued for several areas in and around Townsville, while the Bureau of Meteorology said major flood warnings were in place around multiple rivers near the coast of Queensland on Monday morning. It came after a woman died in Ingham on Sunday after a State Emergency Service boat she was travelling in flipped over, according to Australian media. Emergency responders carried out 11 water rescues overnight and hundreds of people were taken to evacuation centres. On Sunday, regional emergency management authorities told people in affected low-lying areas to \"collect their evacuation kit and move to a safe place on higher ground\". Hinchinbrook Shire, a coastal area home to around 11,000 people in the north of the state, is one of the areas experiencing major flooding, Queensland authorities said.

That rainfall is expected to ease over the next 24 hours and as you move into Tuesday, Wednesday, that easing trend continues. \"But there is a lot of water in those catchments. There's already an incredible amount of water on the ground. There is more significant rain to come, so it will take days for that water to come out of those systems.\" North Queensland is home to large zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore, with Townsville a major processing centre for the region's base metals. In 2019, severe floods in the area disrupted lead and zinc concentrate rail shipments and damaged thousands of properties. Frequent flooding has hit Australia's east in recent years including \"once in a century\" floods that inundated Queensland's neighbouring Northern Territory in January 2023 during a multi-year La Nina weather event."

        "Content": "By Andy Hayes, news reporter  Both Canada and Mexico have agreed to strengthen border security with the United States in return for a 30-day pause in tariffs. President Trump announced on Sunday he was imposing 25% taxes on goods from his country's northern and southern neighbours. Mexico was first to reach a deal with the White House. Its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said she was sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the US border immediately in return for a tariff delay. Mr Trump said the Mexican soldiers would be \"specifically designated\" to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the US, as well as illegal migrants. Further negotiations will now be carried out, he added. Ms Sheinbaum said she had a \"good conversation\" with him lasting at least 30 minutes just hours before the tariffs were due to begin. She also extracted a concession from Mr Trump - after explaining the \"seriousness\" of high-powered weapons coming over the border from the US and getting into the hands of criminal groups. \"It gives them firepower,\" she said. \"We asked that the US also help our country by helping stop this arms trafficking... he agreed.\" Canada made similar moves. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said almost 10,000 frontline personnel \"are and will be working on protecting the border\". He added on X that his country was appointing a \"fentanyl czar\", drugs cartels would be listed as terrorists, and there would be \"24/7 eyes on the border\". There will also be a Canada-US joint strike force to \"combat organised crime, fentanyl and money laundering\", Mr Trudeau announced. Both Trudeau and Trump will view the deal as a win - Trump for seemingly forcing the US's northern neighbour to act, and Trudeau for heading off sanctions with measures that for the most part (with the exception of the fentanyl czar) had already been announced in December. Donald Trump said he was \"very pleased with this initial outcome\" and work will begin see how a \"Final Economic Deal\" with Canada can be structured. US correspondent First Mexico, now Canada. In another whirlwind day, both of America's closest neighbours appear to have capitulated to President Trump.\nThe 25% tariffs on all goods from both countries were due to come into effect at midnight US Eastern time. But after calls between all three leaders, suddenly the tariffs were paused. So what's going on? Is this a clear signal of the power Trump wields? His blunt tool of using the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool has paid off? Bullying tactics work? Well, maybe. At least that's how Mr Trump wants everyone to think. Dance to my tune, or else. And it's absolutely the case that Mexico and Canada were in panic mode this weekend. But surely Donald Trump was panicking a little too when he saw the stock markets on Monday. He claimed this afternoon not to be taking any notice of their sharp falls. But we know he cares deeply about market reactions. Here's what's interesting: the statement from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded at first glance like it was announcing something new.\n\"Canada is implementing our $1.3bn border plan... nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border...\" But it's not a new announcement. Look at the language - \"are and will be\". In other words, \"we're doing this already Mr President, but if you want me to reiterate it to placate you, then I will...\" All that Justin Trudeau has done today is reiterate a border plan he announced last December. Mexico too has been doing an increasing amount in the fight against fentanyl though it could and probably now will do more. So has it all been theatre this past 24 hours? A show of brinkmanship from Donald Trump, which could have had a cliff-edge ending, but instead ended with him looking strong (and freaking out much of the developed world in the process) and his closest neighbours forced to reiterate their existing plans. Regarding China, a 10% tariff - in addition to those already in place - is still set to go ahead, though the White House said Mr Trump is due to talk to President Xi Jinping. The US president has, however, said 10% could be just the start. \"China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,\" he said. China has described fentanyl as America's problem, and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation, as well as taking other countermeasures. But it also left the door open for talks.  What is the UK situation on tariffs? President Trump hates trade deficits, and does not want to import more goods from another country than are sent there in return, says Sky's economics and data editor, Ed Conway. But Britain has bigger trade deficits than the US, Conway adds, and is one of the few countries in the world to import more goods from America than America imports from it.

When asked about the UK, Mr Trump said: \"I think that one can be worked out.\" Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"early days\"."

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n As the geographical spread of US President Donald Trump's pronouncements increases, so do the furrowed worry lines of leaders worldwide.Â   Day 14 of the Trump presidency brought threats of a global trade war and news of the likely demise of USAID - the US international aid and development agency. But the 78-year-old also spent his time complaining that \"South Africa is confiscating land\" and \"certain classes of People\" were being treated \"VERY BADLY\" in a post on his Truth Social website. He threatened to cut off all future funding to the country until a full investigation is carried out - so, what is actually going on? Well, Mr Trump has decided to re-energise a far-right cause celebre which rests on the allegation that white people in South Africa are being marginalised - and subjected to \"genocide\" at the hands of the country's black majority. Examples of this alleged behaviour take various forms - including a bill recently signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa, which gives the government the power to expropriate land without financial compensation. The law is designed to help redress the impact of decades of white minority rule in South Africa under the apartheid regime. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer thinks he can manage relations with the US, EU and China  - but that could be easier said than done\n                 \n                  Trump tariffs: How the UK finds itself in a strong position on US trade\n                 Three decades after Nelson Mandela led the country into the democratic era, white farmers still own the vast majority of farmland nationwide. White landowners possess three-quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, compared with 4% for black landowners. Black people make up about 80% of South Africa's total population while about 8% are white. The new legislation limits land expropriation to circumstances where it is \"just and equitable and in the public interest\" to do so - for example, situations where the property is not being used - or attempts to reach a financial settlement with the owner have failed. Read more:USAID 'shut down' will erode influence in increasingly dangerous worldBreaking economies could be just the first step for expansionist Trump In response to the president's missive, Mr Ramaphosa mounted the following response: \"The South African government has not confiscated any land. \"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner.\" The second part of the genocide claim is fuelled by the number of violent attacks on landowners in rural areas. Right-wing groups in South Africa say white farmers are targeted because of their race while the authorities do little - or nothing - to protect them. However, analysts say farm attacks reflect the country's desperately high rates of violent crime. One thing is certain - Mr Trump's comments on South Africa land ownership reflect the influence that South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk has on the US president. Responding on X to Ramaphosa's statement, Mr Musk said South Africa had \"openly racist ownership laws,\" suggesting white people are the victims."

        "Content": "A judge has warned Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawyers to stop publicly discussing their competing lawsuits. Both actors - who co-starred in 2024's It Ends With Us - have filed lawsuits against each other following an initial legal complaint from Lively. The 37-year-old accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the film - and an alleged subsequent plan to damage her reputation.   Baldoni then sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of hijacking both the production and marketing of the film, as well as allegedly attempting to smear him and others who worked on the production through false allegations. New York district court judge Lewis J Liman has scheduled a trial date combining the two claims for March 2026 - but warned both parties on Monday that their comments to the media could impact their cases.  Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb complained that Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman violated professional ethics rules for lawyers by accusing the actress of \"bullying\" in People magazine. He told a hearing at Manhattan federal court that \"it's very hard to un-ring the bell\" and argued such statements could taint a jury pool. But Mr Freedman complained \"this has not been a one-way street\", and claimed his comments to the magazine and on a podcast were a response to a New York Times article from 21 December that \"completely devastated\" Baldoni. Judge Liman has now adopted a state rule barring most out-of-court statements that could affect a case's outcome - with an exception to protect clients from prejudicial adverse publicity. Neither lawyer objected. Lively's legal team have previously accused Mr Freedman in a court filing of trying to influence potential jurors by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between her and Baldoni.

He is seeking at least $400m (Â£321m) in damages. The actor also sued The New York Times newspaper for libel after it published allegations about him. Lively starred in the 2005 film The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants before rising to fame in the TV series Gossip Girl from 2007 to 2012. She is also known for films including The Town and The Shallows. Baldoni is known for the TV comedy series Jane The Virgin and for directing the 2019 film Five Feet Apart.

The Microsoft co-founder, who is one of the world's richest people, makes the observation in his memoir: Source Code: My Beginnings - which will be released on Tuesday. In an excerpt shared by The Wall Street Journal, the 69-year-old billionaire wrote: \"If I were growing up today, I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. \"My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues, and could be rude or inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.\" He said that \"the fact that some people's brains process information differently from others\" wasn't widely understood during his childhood, with the term \"neurodivergent\" only becoming popularised in the 1990s. The philanthropist, who has given away billions of dollars-worth of his wealth through his Gates Foundation, said his social side and \"awareness of the impact I can have on other people\" was slow to develop, but has \"come with age, with experience, with children, and I'm better for it\".

Mr Gates expanded on this point in an interview with The Times, saying: \"If they ever invent a pill where they could say, 'OK, your social skills will be normal but your ability to concentrate would also be normal', I wouldn't take the pill. \"Maybe I am forgetting how painful it was but I needed my neurodiversity to write that software.\" He said it was the way his brain is wired which helped him write his first code as a young teenager - a code he would later use for Microsoft. Neurodivergent describes the minority group that diverts neurologically from what is considered normal - or neurotypical. It relates to a host of conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Roughly one in seven people are estimated to be neurodivergent, according to the NHS.

Some came to the Tesla founder's defence, claiming he was expressing the phrase \"my heart goes out to you\" and suggesting it perhaps came across awkwardly due to his condition.

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @sparkomat\n  These are major American policy announcements with massive implications for the rest of the world, delivered in an off-the-cuff style by President Donald Trump and his billionaire strategist, Elon Musk. Speaking after visiting his home in Florida, Mr Trump said the US government's international aid and development arm, USAID, was \"run by lunatics\". The president, who was sworn in on 20 January for a second stint in the White House, added: \"We're getting them out, and then we'll make a decision.\"  Speaking on X, Mr Musk was more definitive, telling former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in an audio chat that USAID was finished. \"We're in the process of shutting down USAID, the reason for that as opposed to simply trying to do some minor house cleaning is that as we dug into USAID it became apparent what we have here is not an apple with a worm in it, but we have actually just a bowl of wormsâ¦\"  Mr Musk said he and the US president were in complete agreement as members of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) now circle the agency's $40bn budget. USAID represents just 1% of total US government spending and has largely been free of controversy, enjoying bi-partisan support from members of Congress. The idea here is a straightforward one - that aid and development plays an important role in keeping Americans safe in the world - along with defence and diplomacy. However, it seems members of Mr Trump's team - and the president himself - share a visceral dislike for the department and its mission in the world. ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð On X, Mr Musk fired off the following missives as members of his DOGE task force tried to gain access to the department's digital and physical infrastructure over the weekend. \"USAID was a viper's nest of radical-left Marxists who hate America.\" He also said: \"USAID is a criminal organisation. Time for it to die.\" Read more:What is USAID and why did Musk call it a 'ball of worms'?Sir Ed Davey shrugs off being called a 'snivelling cretin' by Musk Clearly, the department is now viewed as an easy target for an administration promising to drastically reduce government spending. Conservative voters are unlikely to complain, even if these cuts result in chaos overseas. Musk called it \"simply common sense\". Yet that is not how it will be viewed internationally. The US funded more than 40% of the world's international aid spending in 2024. No other single donor comes close. Some programmes are funded directly through USAID - like frontline care for infectious disease, treatments and preventive measures that help avert millions of deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases. Then, there are the international agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, that receive the largest portion of their funding from the Americans. Countless life-saving initiatives have already been frozen. President Trump signed an executive order after the inauguration, halting new foreign aid spending for 90 days. Soon after, secretary of state Marco Rubio ordered stop-work orders for virtually all existing programmes. In Uganda, 600 employees at an NGO (non-governmental organisation) receiving funding under the US president's PEPFAR plan for AIDS Relief - the world's leading HIV initiative - have been suspended. US aid officials involved in programmes designed to provide services to refugees - and support the local health system in Uganda - have also been sent home. These examples are now being replicated worldwide. Mr Rubio has issued a number of waivers, authorising the distribution of life-saving aid, but the terms of these waivers have not been defined - and the direction of travel is clear. A sense of crisis is now building worldwide as President Trump and his team ready themselves to shut USAID. The measure, say critics, will endanger people's lives. It will also erode American influence in an increasingly dangerous world."

In an audio message on X he said: \"We're shutting it down\" adding that he had the \"full support of the president\".

Its budget for the 2023 fiscal year was about $40bn, according to a report last month from the Congressional Research Service. It works primarily to support foreign aid and overseas charities. Mr Musk said he and the US president had discussed the move at length. \"With regard to the USAID stuff, I went over [it] with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,\" he said. \"I checked with him a few times [and] said, 'Are you sure?'\" he said. He said Mr Trump responded, \"Yes\". The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments came after two senior officials at USAID were suspended after they tried to stop members of Elon Musk's efficiency team from accessing secure systems, according to reports. Sky News' US partner NBC News spoke to three sources who said the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team wanted to access some files that were beyond their security level. These included personnel files and security systems as well as security clearance information for agency employees.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, kicking off a trade war that will affect the globe. Here we look at the tariffs and what they all mean for the world: What did Trump announce? The US president said on Sunday that goods from Mexico and Canada will face 25% tariffs, while 10% taxes will be implemented on imports from China. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate. Trade war latest: Follow live updates The levies were expected to all take effect on Tuesday, with Mexico and Canada both announcing counter-tariffs of their own in response. However, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a news conference on Monday that implementation of the tariffs would be paused for a month, after she and Mr Trump had a conversation and came to an agreement. But Mr Trump has also threatened to go further, saying tariffs on the European Union would be implemented \"pretty soon\".  When questioned about the UK, the president said Britain was \"out of line\" when it came to trade but he thought the situation could be \"worked out\" without the use of tariffs. What are tariffs, and how do they work? Put simply, tariffs are taxes on goods that are brought in from other countries. By raising the price of imports, tariffs aim to protect domestic manufacturers by making locally made goods cheaper. Contrary to what Mr Trump has said, it is not foreign countries that pay tariffs, but the importing companies that buy the goods. For example, American businesses like Walmart or Target pay tariffs directly to the US treasury. In the US, these tariffs are collected by customs and border protection agents, who are stationed at 328 ports of entry across the country. To compensate for tariffs, companies then put up their prices, so customers end up paying more for goods. Tariffs can also damage foreign countries as it makes their products pricier and harder to sell. This can lead to them cutting prices (and sacrificing profits) to offset levies and maintain their market share in the US. Why is Trump doing this? Mr Trump has argued that imposing higher levies will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. On Mexico, the US leader claimed drug traffickers and the country's government \"have an intolerable alliance\" that in turn impacts national security. He further claimed that Mexican drug cartels are operating in Canada. On China, he said the country's government provides a \"safe haven\" for criminal organisations. He has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. \"We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he said. His aim appears to be to force governments in those countries to work much harder to prevent what he calls illegal migration and the smuggling of the deadly drug fentanyl - as appears to have been agreed by Mexico. But, even if the countries do not do what America wants, it will still potentially benefit firms that produce goods in the US. What could the consequences be? Mexico and Canada are two of America's largest trading partners, with the tariffs upending decades-old trade relationships. Goods that could be affected most by the incoming tariffs include fruit and veg, petrol and oil, cars and vehicle parts and electronic goods. New analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University found that the average US household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 US dollars (Â£944) in income from the tariffs. Read more: This is how US consumers will be affected  The research also found that economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, as the tariffs forced up prices. Immediate consequences were felt on Monday morning, as shares on Asian markets took a tumble. Japan's Nikkei opened down 2.9% while Australia's benchmark - often a proxy trade for Chinese markets - fell 1.8%. Stocks in Hong Kong, which include listings of Chinese companies, fell 1.1%. UK stocks were also significantly down, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index - containing the most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange - dropped more than 1.3% on the open. In Europe, stock markets opened sharply lower while the euro slid 1.3%. The Europe-wide index of companies, the Stoxx 600 dropped as much as 1.5%. While Mexico's peso hit its lowest in nearly three years. 'Very scary path' Sky News' data and economics editor Ed Conway said the long term consequences of a trade war is that \"everyone gets poorer\", which is what happened to the world before World War Two. \"As countries get poorer, they get frustrated and you get more nationalism,\" Conway said, speaking on Friday's Sky News Daily podcast. \"This is exactly what happened in the 1930s, and the world ended up at war with each other. It is a very, very scary path, and yes, we are basically on a potential of that path.\" However, Conway added that one positive of Mr Trump's tariffs could be highlighting \"massive imbalances\" within the global economy. He said Mr Trump may be able to shift the conversation to problems that \"economists don't want to talk about\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð \"At the moment, we have a dysfunctional global economy,\" he explained. \"You have got massive imbalances like trade deficits [when a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports] and trade surpluses [when a country's exports exceeds the cost of its imports]. \"There might well be a better way of everyone getting together and having a conversation and working out how to align their affairs, so we don't have these imbalances in the future. \"And tariffs help to get you to this point.\" How has the world reacted? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted strongly against Mr Trump's tariffs, saying his country would impose 25% tariffs on $155bn Canadian dollars (Â£85.9bn) of US goods in response. He added that the move would split the two countries apart, and urged Canadians to choose domestic products rather than American ones.  Mexican President Ms Sheinbaum posted on X on Sunday to say she had ordered her economy minister to implement tariff and non-tariff measures to defend Mexico's interests. She said her government \"categorically rejects\" the claim that it has \"alliances with criminal organisations\" and called on the White House to \"fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities\". A day later, she posted saying she and Mr Trump had a \"good conversation\" and \"reached a series of agreements\". These agreements include Mexico sending 10,000 troops to the border to \"prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl\". Mr Trump responded to the agreement with Ms Sheinbaum, saying negotiations between the two will be ongoing to try and achieve a \"deal\". Meanwhile, China has claimed the US action violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and vowed to bring a case before the body that governs global commerce. It also threatened to take \"necessary counter-measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests\".  A spokesperson for the UK government reiterated that the US is an \"indispensable ally\" and one of the country's \"closest trading partners\". They added that the trading relationship was \"fair and balanced\", after Mr Trump criticised the UK, saying it was \"out of line\". European Union (EU) leaders have also taken a strong stance against looming US tariffs. Kaja Kallas, the chief of foreign policy for the bloc, said there were no winners in a trade war, and if the US and Europe started one \"then the one laughing on the side is China\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz added that the EU is strong enough to \"respond to tariffs with our own tariffs\", while French President Emmanuel Macron said declarations by the US were pushing Europe to be \"stronger and more united\".  What's the history of trade wars? Imposing tariffs is not new to Mr Trump, or the US for that matter. During his first term in the White House, he imposed higher levies on China and Vietnam. In 2018, he imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium from most countries, a response to what he said was the unfair impact of Chinese steel driving down prices and negatively affecting the US steel industry. China then hit back with retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including 15% on 120 American products such as fruits, nuts, wine and steel pipes and a 25% tariff on US pork and recycled aluminium. Before that, democrat Jimmy Carter went so far as to completely ban the sale of wheat to Russia, which remained in effect until Ronald Reagan ended it in 1981.

A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Mr Trump's tariffs the first time around failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \"neither raised nor lowered US employment'' when they were supposed to protect jobs, according to Sky News' US partner network NBC News."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  Beyonce has won the coveted album of the year prize at this year's Grammy Awards. Despite being the most nominated artist in Grammy history, Beyonce has never before won in the top category, with the gong evading her four times previously. Just three women of colour have won album of the year before her, the last being Lauryn Hill 26 years ago. Read more: The full list of Grammy 2025 winners Presented by members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Beyonce was joined by her 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter to accept the top prize for her chart-topping album Cowboy Carter. She said she felt \"honoured,\" adding: \"It's been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\" She went on to dedicate her win to Linda Martell, the first commercially successful black female artist in Country music. There was tough competition, with female stars including Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift in the mix. Andre 3000 and Jacob Collier made it into the category. Earlier in the night, a stunned Beyonce told the audience she was \"still in shock\" after winning best Country album - becoming the first black female artist to take the prize. Handed the award by Taylor Swift, the Texas-born star said: \"Wow, I really was not expecting this. I want to thank God that I'm able to do what I love after so many years.\" She went on: \"Genre is a code word to keep us in place as artists, and I just want to encourage us to do what we're passionate about.\" Read more:All the best Grammy red carpet looksRaining underwear, a giant pony and more key moments Beyonce has previously been vocal about the lack of wins in the big Grammy categories for artists of colour, who she said were largely relegated to the genre categories. Last year her husband, rap star Jay-Z, addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So, even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Beyonce went on to be snubbed at the Country Music Awards later in the year, despite becoming the first black woman to top Billboard's country music chart with the album's lead single Texas Hold Em'. Beyonce had already made history earlier in the night, winning best country duo/group performance for II Most Wanted featuring Miley Cyrus, but was pipped at the post by Kacey Musgraves, who took best Country song for The Architect. Ahead of the ceremony, Beyonce announced on social media she would be taking Cowboy Carter on tour.  Bianca bares all on the red carpet Before the main ceremony, the stars walked the red carpet with a largely sombre pallet due to the recent wildfires which have left the city reeling. Those who opted for bursts of colour included Swift in red, Roan in bright yellow and pale blue and Bianca Censori who started the carpet in a floor-length fur coat but ended it in decidedly less. Her minimalist approach to fashion garnered her plenty of attention.  Diss track triumph for Lamar Meanwhile, Kendrick Lamar dominated the night, taking both song and record of the year for his much-talked-about diss track, Not Like Us. The Compton-born artist dedicated his record of the year win \"to the city,\" and later said he was \"star-struck\" to be handed his best song award by Diana Ross. Disproving the adage, 'if you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything,' the track won all five awards it was up for. The first award of the main ceremony, best rap album, went to rising star Doechii for Alligator Bites Never Heal. Presented with her award by Cardi B, she became tearful on stage as she became only the third woman ever to take the prize. Thanks mum! Best pop vocal album went to Sabrina Carpenter for Short N' Sweet. She said she \"might cry\" for her first Grammy win, thanking her mum for \"driving me to every voice lesson,\" before going on to apologise for saying \"Hell\" three times during her acceptance speech. Carpenter's gong was presented by Red Hot Chilli Peppers band members Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith, who sang a burst of their 1991 hit Under The Bridge, in tribute to the City Of Angles - LA. The evening had a very different tone to previous shows following the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Black was a common theme on the red carpet and the evening kicked off by highlighting the city's resilience.  Host Trevor Noah's opening speech spoke of the \"entire communities burned to the ground\", going on, \"it's often said in the darkest time the best of humanity shines through...tonight we're not only celebrating our favourite music but celebrating the city that brought us our favourite music\". Raising money for those affected by the disaster, Noah said advertising space had also been given to local LA businesses affected by fire. Chappell Roan calls out the labels Best newcomer went to Chappell Roan, who wore a giant cone hat with a veil spouting from the top, and which threatened to fall as she accepted her gong. The 26-year-old singer gave an impassioned speech as she accepted her first Grammy saying: \"I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a liveable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\" She went on to describe the strain of being signed young, and then dropped by her label, and struggling to afford health insurance, resulting in her feeling \"betrayed by the system and so dehumanised\". In the US, unlike the NHS in the UK, health care is not free at the point of delivery. Roan finished with the rhetorical question: \"So record labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a liveable wage and health insurance and protection. Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\" Earlier, her Pink Pony Club performance had featured a giant pony and host of cowboy clowns. During the three-and-a-half-hour show, Billie Eilish also performed on an LA hillside set, Sabrina Carpenter gave it some old-school Hollywood glamour, and British star Raye gave a soulful performance of Oscar Winning Tears. Charli XCX scored her first Grammys for best dance/electronic album and best dance/pop recording, following her culture-shaping Brat album, which was the talk of the summer. Remembering those who are gone Stars including Will Smith, Cynthia Erivo, Stevie Wonder and Janelle MonÃ¡e headlined a lengthy tribute to the late, legendary producer Quincy Jones, featuring jazz musician Herbie Hancock on the piano, and renditions of We Are The World and Thriller. Led by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, the In Memoriam section began by remembering Liam Payne who died in October aged 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. It also included actress and singer Marianne Faithful, who passed away over the weekend."

        "Content": " Stock markets tumbled on Monday as Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China sparked fears of a global trade war. It's the first trading day since the US president made good on his promise to slap high taxes on imports to the US. He announced higher-than-expected 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods - only for a temporary ceasefire to later be agreed with his Mexican counterpart that will delay any US penalties for at least a month. Before that development, Asian markets were the first to react to confirmation of tariffs with Japan's Nikkei falling nearly 3% while South Korea's Kospi was also down more than 2.5%. Both countries are export-heavy nations through car manufacturing, which is vulnerable to further US import tax hikes. Money blog: Â£200bn wiped off crypto in 24 hours The stock market plummet continued as markets opened across Europe, with major indices in the EU seeing sharper declines than in the UK earlier in the day after Mr Trump pledged that the trading bloc would \"definitely\" see tariffs in future.  He was less certain about penalising the UK but the FTSE 100 still closed 1% down, recovering some poise in the afternoon on news of Mexico's temporary Trump truce. He held off after his southern neighbour agreed to send 10,000 soldiers to the border to stem the flow of illegal drugs. The DAX in recession-hit Germany and French CAC also pared losses on the news - as did US stock markets on Wall Street. The S&P 500 was just 0.4% down heading towards the close though Trump cheerleader Elon Musk's Tesla was more than 5% down. Manufacturers such as carmakers and beer producers were among the biggest losers globally. The dollar strengthened widely earlier with the peso in Mexico and Canadian dollar worst hit - the latter by almost one-and-a half cents. The euro was another big casualty, dropping almost a cent at â¬1.0270 at one stage versus the dollar while the pound was largely flat. Euro weakening saw sterling hit â¬1.2051 - up almost a cent on the day. 'The trade war has started' \"Trump's trade war has started,\" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore as the market reaction took hold. Tariffs against Canada and China are still due to take effect on Tuesday. The US president has also threatened to impose steeper tariffs elsewhere, telling reporters import taxes will \"definitely happen\" with the EU. He said the UK \"is out of line\" on trade with the US and told reporters \"we'll see what happens\". But he said he was confident the situation \"can be worked out\" without tariffs. Mr Trump is still set to speak to the leader of Canada, Justin Trudeau, later on Monday and has warned against retaliating to his tariffs, saying: \"We can play the game all they want.\" Read more: How Trump's tariffs could impact consumers Over the weekend. he announced he was imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and hit China with a 10% levy.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  What if Britain has, almost entirely by accident, navigated itself into about the best possible position it could be in, as Donald Trump embarks on a trade war with nearly all his economic partners? I realise this might, at first, sound a little odd. After all, when the world is facing economically-destructive measures (blanket tariffs are invariably value-destructive, in the short run at least) it's hard to see much in the way of victories. Moreover, when it comes to Donald Trump, no one, including his own cabinet and staff, can quite predict what will happen next. Consider the roller-coaster over tariffs in the past few days alone. Even so, the fact remains that of all the countries and regions in the world, Britain seems much less likely than most to face the kind of peremptory tariffs the president is so keen on. Trade war latest: Trump pauses Mexico tariffs for a month To see why, it helps to remember that the one thing Mr Trump hates above all else is trade deficits - when you import more goods (and it seems to be goods he mostly cares about) from another country than you send there in return. America has an enormous trade deficit with China and with Mexico too, not to mention a smaller but not insubstantial deficit with Canada. When the president talks about the reasons for his tariffs he sometimes mentions illegal fentanyl imports, but, even more often, he references the size of the trade deficits. He wants America to make more stuff domestically and suck in less stuff from overseas. We could have a long conversation (and I suspect we probably will have a long conversation in the coming months) about the extent to which deficits are, per se, a bad thing. But in the short run let's focus on the UK and its strengths in this game. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer thinks he can manage relations with the US, EU and China  - but that could be easier said than done\n                 \n                  Why Trump has threatened to cut off all future funding to South Africa\n                 First, since the UK is no longer part of the European Union, it will not automatically face the same trade terms as its neighbours on the continent. If the US imposes tariffs on the EU, Britain will not necessarily face them. Second, if there is one country in the world with even bigger trade deficits than the US, it's Britain. This country has deindustrialised even quicker than America, with the upshot that unlike the EU or Canada or Mexico, Britain is one of the few countries in the world to import more goods from America than America imports from it.  Footnote: that last point actually depends on whose numbers you're looking at. Look at America's figures and it has a trade surplus with the UK. Look at Britain's figures and America has a trade deficit with us. But either way, both are very small. The numbers are essentially balanced. Third, in recent months, the new Labour government has begun to improve its relationship with China. Chancellor Rachel Reeves went on a financial diplomacy mission to Beijing last month. And unlike nearly every other industrialised country in the developed world, Britain has not imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Many diplomats have raised their eyebrows about this, but in the event that America wanted to do a deal with Britain, this is precisely the kind of thing the government could quickly reverse: \"Oh alright then - in return for this trade deal, we're willing to impose those tariffs on China - the ones everyone else has already introduced.\" Read more:Trump says Canada should be 'cherished 51st state'Why has Trump targeted Mexico and Canada?How Trump's tariffs could impact consumers The funny thing about these three strengths is that, first off, up until recently many would have seen each of them - Brexit, our deindustrialisation and our cosying up to China - as weaknesses rather than strengths. They certainly weren't part of any grand strategic plan. Even so, the UK nonetheless finds itself in an unexpectedly propitious position when it comes to negotiating with the US. It has a better chance than most nations to act as a diplomatic bridge between America and Europe. Its chances of sealing that much-vaunted trade deal with the US have improved rather than deteriorated. Indeed, I'm told that leading members of the administration believe a trade deal with the UK could be sealed in a matter of months. Whether that actually eventuates remains to be seen. After all, if there's one thing you can't predict when it comes to Donald Trump it's, well, anything."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, kicking off a trade war that will affect the globe. Here we look at the tariffs and what they all mean for the world: What did Trump announce? The US president said on Sunday that goods from Mexico and Canada will face 25% tariffs, while 10% taxes will be implemented on imports from China. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate. Trade war latest: Follow live updates The levies were expected to all take effect on Tuesday, with Mexico and Canada both announcing counter-tariffs of their own in response. However, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a news conference on Monday that implementation of the tariffs would be paused for a month, after she and Mr Trump had a conversation and came to an agreement. But Mr Trump has also threatened to go further, saying tariffs on the European Union would be implemented \"pretty soon\".  When questioned about the UK, the president said Britain was \"out of line\" when it came to trade but he thought the situation could be \"worked out\" without the use of tariffs. What are tariffs, and how do they work? Put simply, tariffs are taxes on goods that are brought in from other countries. By raising the price of imports, tariffs aim to protect domestic manufacturers by making locally made goods cheaper. Contrary to what Mr Trump has said, it is not foreign countries that pay tariffs, but the importing companies that buy the goods. For example, American businesses like Walmart or Target pay tariffs directly to the US treasury. In the US, these tariffs are collected by customs and border protection agents, who are stationed at 328 ports of entry across the country. To compensate for tariffs, companies then put up their prices, so customers end up paying more for goods. Tariffs can also damage foreign countries as it makes their products pricier and harder to sell. This can lead to them cutting prices (and sacrificing profits) to offset levies and maintain their market share in the US. Why is Trump doing this? Mr Trump has argued that imposing higher levies will help reduce illegal migration and the smuggling of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to the US. On Mexico, the US leader claimed drug traffickers and the country's government \"have an intolerable alliance\" that in turn impacts national security. He further claimed that Mexican drug cartels are operating in Canada. On China, he said the country's government provides a \"safe haven\" for criminal organisations. He has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. \"We may have short term some little pain, and people understand that. But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he said. His aim appears to be to force governments in those countries to work much harder to prevent what he calls illegal migration and the smuggling of the deadly drug fentanyl - as appears to have been agreed by Mexico. But, even if the countries do not do what America wants, it will still potentially benefit firms that produce goods in the US. What could the consequences be? Mexico and Canada are two of America's largest trading partners, with the tariffs upending decades-old trade relationships. Goods that could be affected most by the incoming tariffs include fruit and veg, petrol and oil, cars and vehicle parts and electronic goods. New analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University found that the average US household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 US dollars (Â£944) in income from the tariffs. Read more: This is how US consumers will be affected  The research also found that economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, as the tariffs forced up prices. Immediate consequences were felt on Monday morning, as shares on Asian markets took a tumble. Japan's Nikkei opened down 2.9% while Australia's benchmark - often a proxy trade for Chinese markets - fell 1.8%. Stocks in Hong Kong, which include listings of Chinese companies, fell 1.1%. UK stocks were also significantly down, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index - containing the most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange - dropped more than 1.3% on the open. In Europe, stock markets opened sharply lower while the euro slid 1.3%. The Europe-wide index of companies, the Stoxx 600 dropped as much as 1.5%. While Mexico's peso hit its lowest in nearly three years. 'Very scary path' Sky News' data and economics editor Ed Conway said the long term consequences of a trade war is that \"everyone gets poorer\", which is what happened to the world before World War Two. \"As countries get poorer, they get frustrated and you get more nationalism,\" Conway said, speaking on Friday's Sky News Daily podcast. \"This is exactly what happened in the 1930s, and the world ended up at war with each other. It is a very, very scary path, and yes, we are basically on a potential of that path.\" However, Conway added that one positive of Mr Trump's tariffs could be highlighting \"massive imbalances\" within the global economy. He said Mr Trump may be able to shift the conversation to problems that \"economists don't want to talk about\". ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð \"At the moment, we have a dysfunctional global economy,\" he explained. \"You have got massive imbalances like trade deficits [when a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports] and trade surpluses [when a country's exports exceeds the cost of its imports]. \"There might well be a better way of everyone getting together and having a conversation and working out how to align their affairs, so we don't have these imbalances in the future. \"And tariffs help to get you to this point.\" How has the world reacted? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted strongly against Mr Trump's tariffs, saying his country would impose 25% tariffs on $155bn Canadian dollars (Â£85.9bn) of US goods in response. He added that the move would split the two countries apart, and urged Canadians to choose domestic products rather than American ones.  Mexican President Ms Sheinbaum posted on X on Sunday to say she had ordered her economy minister to implement tariff and non-tariff measures to defend Mexico's interests. She said her government \"categorically rejects\" the claim that it has \"alliances with criminal organisations\" and called on the White House to \"fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities\". A day later, she posted saying she and Mr Trump had a \"good conversation\" and \"reached a series of agreements\". These agreements include Mexico sending 10,000 troops to the border to \"prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl\". Mr Trump responded to the agreement with Ms Sheinbaum, saying negotiations between the two will be ongoing to try and achieve a \"deal\". Meanwhile, China has claimed the US action violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, and vowed to bring a case before the body that governs global commerce. It also threatened to take \"necessary counter-measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests\".  A spokesperson for the UK government reiterated that the US is an \"indispensable ally\" and one of the country's \"closest trading partners\". They added that the trading relationship was \"fair and balanced\", after Mr Trump criticised the UK, saying it was \"out of line\". European Union (EU) leaders have also taken a strong stance against looming US tariffs. Kaja Kallas, the chief of foreign policy for the bloc, said there were no winners in a trade war, and if the US and Europe started one \"then the one laughing on the side is China\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz added that the EU is strong enough to \"respond to tariffs with our own tariffs\", while French President Emmanuel Macron said declarations by the US were pushing Europe to be \"stronger and more united\".  What's the history of trade wars? Imposing tariffs is not new to Mr Trump, or the US for that matter. During his first term in the White House, he imposed higher levies on China and Vietnam. In 2018, he imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium from most countries, a response to what he said was the unfair impact of Chinese steel driving down prices and negatively affecting the US steel industry. China then hit back with retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including 15% on 120 American products such as fruits, nuts, wine and steel pipes and a 25% tariff on US pork and recycled aluminium. Before that, democrat Jimmy Carter went so far as to completely ban the sale of wheat to Russia, which remained in effect until Ronald Reagan ended it in 1981.

A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Mr Trump's tariffs the first time around failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \"neither raised nor lowered US employment'' when they were supposed to protect jobs, according to Sky News' US partner network NBC News."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  The boss of GB Energy has told Sky News it could take 20 years to deliver a Labour government pledge of 1,000 jobs for Aberdeen. Sir Keir Starmer promised voters his flagship green initiative, which will be headquartered in the northeast of Scotland, would cut consumer energy bills by as much as Â£300. It is one of Labour's five key missions for this parliament after a manifesto commitment to \"save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good\". In his first broadcast interview, Juergen Maier, appointed by Downing Street as GB Energy's start-up chairman, suggested this was a \"very long-term project\" spanning decades and repeatedly refused to say when household prices would be slashed. \"I know that you are asking me for a date as to when I can bring that, but GB Energy has only just been brought into creation and we will bring energy bills down,\" Mr Maier said. The state-owned company will not supply power to homes but it will invest in new renewable projects while attempting to attract private investors.

Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce told Sky News the estimated 50,000 local people currently employed in the industry are \"nervous\". Chief executive Russell Borthwick said: \"I think the [GB Energy] ambition is good. It needs some quick wins. \"Right now, this city is nervous. We need to give the industry more confidence that things are going to start moving more quickly. \"What we do have is not a great deal of progress. We've had a lot of positive meetings with GB Energy. I think we are really looking over the next six months for that to be delivered on.\" 1,000 jobs in 20 years? 'Absolutely'  It comes after Energy Minister Michael Shanks MP recently said the UK government had \"not moved away\" from an ambition of creating \"over 1,000 jobs\". Sky News pushed Mr Maier for clarity on this pledge given the looming crisis in the North Sea industry. He said: \"Great British Energy itself is going to create over the next five years, 200 or 300 jobs in Aberdeen. That will be the size of our team. I have said in the very long term when we become a major energy champion it may be many more than that.\" Pressed to define \"long term\", he replied: \"Look, we grow these companies. Energy companies grow over 10 or 20 years, and we are going to be around in 20 years.\" He said \"absolutely\" when asked directly if it could take two decades to fulfil the commitment of 1,000 jobs. 'Huge risk of not delivering' Unions told Sky News there is a risk of GB Energy over-promising and under-delivering. Unite's Scottish Secretary Derek Thomson said: \"If you look at how many jobs are going to go in the northeast, if GB energy does not pick up the pace and start to move workers in there and start to create proper green jobs, then I'm afraid we could be looking at a desolation of the northeast.\" Read more:The question facing ministers on UK-owned clean powerCut taxes to get people buying electric cars - motor industryDetails on plan for Great British Energy Prospect, which represents more than 22,000 workers across the energy industry, said the current vision seems risky. Richard Hardy, Scotland secretary, said: \"I don't want to be accused of cynicism, but I do want to see a plan. \"If what happens is that it only creates 200 or 300 jobs, then I think most people would see that as being a failure. There is a huge risk for them in not actually delivering. \"They must understand the political risk they are taking in doing this. It has to be a success for them because otherwise it is going to be a stick to beat them with.\" 'Nothing more than a gimmick' The Conservatives criticised Mr Maier's admission. West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie said: \"This revelation underlines that GB Energy is nothing more than a gimmick in an attempt to distract from the danger Labour's policies pose to northeast jobs and our energy security. \"Suspicions that GB Energy would bring nothing more to Aberdeen than a small office with a plaque are proving to be absolutely correct.\" 'Building good energy' In response to criticism, a Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister's comments referred to the \"potential GB Energy can have in change in Scotland's economy\". The spokesperson added: \"In the long term, our ambition is to build good energy up to the scale and size of the world's leading publicly owned energy companies. \"Not overnight, we are seeing the benefits already in Aberdeen, and the exact number and timescale for jobs will be driven by GB Energy.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n KKR, one of the world's biggest private equity investors, is advancing plans to play a crucial role in a rescue of Britain's biggest water supplier. Sky News has learnt that KKR, which manages assets of more than $600bn, has hired investment bankers and lawyers to help formulate a plan to inject billions of pounds of equity into the company, which has more than 15m customers. PJT Partners has been engaged to act for KKR on its interest in Thames Water ahead of a deadline for proposals for an equity raise later this month, according to insiders. The appointment of PJT implies that KKR is seriously interested in aiding a rescue of Thames Water, which is drowning under Â£19bn of debt and faces the prospect of temporary nationalisation amid a bitter legal fight among rival creditor groups. Money blog: Â£200bn wiped off crypto in 24 hours A hearing at the High Court beginning on Monday pits one syndicate of lenders - which want to extend up to Â£3bn of financing to the company - against another group, which has submitted an alternative plan that it insists is cheaper. Without the new financing, Thames Water could be forced into an insolvency process known as special administration, which has been used in the UK before in the case of the domestic energy supplier Bulb. \n                  Thames Water seeks High Court approval for rescue plan\n                 \n                  Thames Water fined Â£18m by Ofwat for breaking shareholder payment rules\n                 \n                  Whether Ofwat action works will be measured by the health of waterways and balance sheets of companies\n                 Special administration would probably cost the government billions of pounds while a break-up of Thames Water is finalised or a buyer is found, and Sir Keir Starmer's administration has said it wants to avoid such an outcome. However, political pressure is mounting from critics of the company who argue that it should not be allowed to add to its debt burden. Charlie Maynard, the Liberal Democrat MP for Witney and a long-standing campaigner for an overhaul of water company regulation has submitted a witness statement to the court, urging it to reject a restructuring plan which has secured the endorsement of Thames Water's board. \"Successive governments have watched on as Thames Water has plunged themselves into billions of pounds of debt,\" Mr Maynard said. \"Thames Water is running out of money, it is operating in breach of its licence, it is unable to pay its debts and its customers are suffering for it. \"The deal the creditors are pushing for serves their interests only; it is a short-term fix at the expense of the company, Thames Water customers and UK taxpayers.\" Approval of the Â£3bn debt financing would buy the company time to raise new equity. In addition to KKR, the Hong Kong-based investor CK Infrastructure Holdings, Covalis and Castle Water have all been linked with potential offers. Industry sources believe that KKR and CK Infrastructure offer the most credible paths to an equity raise, although there is no certainty that any of the interest will result in firm proposals. The emergence of KKR's work with advisers also comes in the same month that Thames Water is required to decide whether it wants to appeal against an Ofwat ruling on its spending plans for the next five years. Thames Water requested permission to increase prices for customers by 53% over five years but was told by the industry regulator it would be restricted to a 35% increase. A number of other water companies are also considering appeals. Last autumn, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, established an independent review of the industry that will look at far-reaching reforms. It remains unclear which of KKR's funds is participating in the Thames Water equity-raise process, which is being run by bankers at Rothschild. The firm owns John Laing, an infrastructure investor, which it took private in 2021. It also previously owned South Staffordshire, another water company, selling its 75% interest in 2018. KKR declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       Bill Gates says he believes he would have been diagnosed with a form of autism if he had grown up in this era. The Microsoft co-founder, who is one of the world's richest people, makes the observation in his memoir: Source Code: My Beginnings - which will be released on Tuesday. In an excerpt shared by The Wall Street Journal, the 69-year-old billionaire wrote: \"If I were growing up today, I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. \"My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues, and could be rude or inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.\" He said that \"the fact that some people's brains process information differently from others\" wasn't widely understood during his childhood, with the term \"neurodivergent\" only becoming popularised in the 1990s. The philanthropist, who has given away billions of dollars-worth of his wealth through his Gates Foundation, said his social side and \"awareness of the impact I can have on other people\" was slow to develop, but has \"come with age, with experience, with children, and I'm better for it\". He socialises in high circles, now; in an interview with CBS News on Sunday, he revealed he had been gifted a new all-electric Fiat RED for his birthday by U2 singer Bono, who he works with on global health projects. \n                  Bill Gates says AI will make it easier to combat climate change but must be 'used by people with good intent'\n                 \n                  Bill Gates visit to China signals Beijing is open to a thaw in relations with US\n                 \n                  Bill Gates jokes Internet Explorer died because Microsoft 'ran out of microchips'\n                 Mr Gates wrote he wouldn't trade his brain \"for anything\" despite some of the challenges his way of thinking posed during his younger years. Mr Gates expanded on this point in an interview with The Times, saying: \"If they ever invent a pill where they could say, 'OK, your social skills will be normal but your ability to concentrate would also be normal', I wouldn't take the pill. \"Maybe I am forgetting how painful it was but I needed my neurodiversity to write that software.\" He said it was the way his brain is wired which helped him write his first code as a young teenager - a code he would later use for Microsoft. Neurodivergent describes the minority group that diverts neurologically from what is considered normal - or neurotypical. It relates to a host of conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Roughly one in seven people are estimated to be neurodivergent, according to the NHS.

The indebted utility is seeking a judge's approval for a restructuring plan centred on an emergency loan it says it needs to avoid running out of cash by the end of March. The loan is being offered by existing \"A class\" creditors who hold around Â£11bn of the more than Â£16bn of debt racked up by Thames Water Utility Holdings, the regulated operating company that serves more than 15 million customers in London and the South East. The company will argue that without court approval for the deal, it will be forced to enter a Special Administration Regime (SAR), overseen by the government at taxpayers' expense. Money blog: What it's like being a bouncer - including pay Water campaigners have criticised the terms of the loan, which is being offered at an interest rate of 9.75% over two and a half years with up to a further Â£100m payable in fees, and called on Environment Secretary Steve Reed to block it and force the company into special administration. The loan will also be provided on \"super-senior\" terms, meaning it will be repaid first in the event of administration, and existing creditors will have repayment dates set back by two years. It will be opposed by a group of B class creditors, who hold around Â£750,000 of more junior debt and face being wiped out completely in a restructuring. Read more from Sky News:Markets tumble in reaction to Trump's tariffsBeyonce makes history at GrammysPM to urge EU to 'shoulder more of the burden' on defence  The court hearing comes as Thames Water decides whether to appeal against the terms of a final determination from water regulator Ofwat, which allowed the company to increase bills by more than 30% from April. Thames had asked for bill increases of more than 50% to fund its operations and planned investments in new and improved infrastructure over the next five years. It is not yet clear whether Thames believes the Ofwat determination makes it an investable proposition. Sources close to the process have told Sky News there remains \"lots of uncertainty\" over the Ofwat final determination and whether it can support the turnaround of the company. The Â£3bn loan, delivered in two tranches, is required to get the company to the other side of an appeal, which will be overseen by the Competitions and Markets Authority. Mr Reed, the environment secretary, has previously said he opposes the nationalisation of Thames Water and wants a \"market solution\", but it has been reported the government has approached potential administrators to oversee an SAR should the company fail. If the loan is approved Thames intends to pursue a full restructuring, involving new equity investment and a debt-for-equity swap with existing creditors. Without that process, chief executive Chris Weston has described the company as \"uninvestable\". In order for the judge to approve a rescue plan it must have the agreement of 75% of creditors. Thames says it has more than 90% approval. Failing that it would have to consider the impact of a \"relevant alternative\", a plan that leaves creditors no worse off."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n  The symbolism was plain to see. Five years on from Brexit, the British prime minister on Monday was brought back into the club for one night only, invited to an informal dinner with the EU's 27 leaders to talk about resetting relations after a bumpy Brexit. The invite was sent out weeks ago, with the intention on both sides to forge closer defence, security and trade ties. Trade war latest: Tariffs on Canada paused for at least 30 days  Britain is under new leadership with a Labour government that wanted no part of Brexit, while the European Union is perhaps now a bit more pragmatic as it seeks to renew a lapsed friendship with an old ally in a more hostile world. The stage was set then for a rapprochement - instead the EU leaders spent the informal summit locked up in a room war gaming the threat of a US-EU trade war. President Trump's hostility to the EU was laid bare as he sounded off about the \"atrocity\" of the EU on trade and said tariffs were on their way, while with the UK, the US could probably sort it out. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Why Trump has threatened to cut off all future funding to South Africa\n                 \n                  Trump tariffs: How the UK finds itself in a strong position on US trade\n                 The substance behind these positions is that the EU has a whopping trade deficit with the US - Trump hates that - while the UK does not. But there is something else emerging here too: a Labour prime minister and Republican president that seem to have hit it off. There was the dinner they had in September at Trump Towers in New York and the 45-minute phone call a week ago on Sunday which I'm told was light on policy and instead a very personal call between the two of them. One insider told me they were \"surprised\" at how amenable Trump is towards Starmer. They may not be an obvious pairing for a bromance, but no matter - it all adds to the favourable backdrop of a president with links to Scotland, his fondness for the UK and love of the Royal Family. But the big unknown is whether Starmer can remain close to both the EU and the US should relations between Washington and Brussels deteriorate. The prime minister was very clear on Monday that he's unwilling to pick between the two sides. Read More:PM must delicately balance risky EU reset as UK braces for Trump's next moveExclusive: Reform UK tops landmark poll for first time Some of it depends on how the EU handles this unpredictable president. For now, the bloc is treading carefully, with intense talks going on between the US and EU over trade - could the EU for example take more oil and gas from the US market to close that trade imbalance? - as individual European leaders hold the line.  In Brussels and London, operatives are watching how the threat of tariffs plays out in Mexico and Canada, where it seems like making concessions garners results. As for London, there is quiet confidence that Trump won't slap tariffs on the UK. \"That's not where he's looking\", says one government insider. But what Starmer can't be sure of is whether the US president will also look the other way as the UK forges a closer trading relationship with China, while standing firm with Europe should relations between Washington and Brussels deteriorate. Starmer and his team think it can manage relations with China, the US and the EU so that the UK comes out on top. But that could prove much easier said than done."

The YouGov poll, taken on Sunday and Monday, also puts the Lib Dems on 14% and Greens on 9%. Watch and follow reaction and analysis live in the Politics Hub  All the polling moves that push Reform UK to the top for the first time this week are within the margin of error and the overall picture remains unchanged - with Britain in a new period of three party politics in the polls.

The Tories are likely to be the hardest hit by the poll, having been in third place since YouGov restarted polling after the general election. The Sky News/YouGov poll also found Kemi Badenoch has slipped behind Nigel Farage when voters are asked whether they have a favourable or unfavourable opinion of the leaders. Last month, Badenoch has a net favourability rating of -25, but that has now dropped to -29 this month. This puts her below Farage, who had a net favourability rating of -32 last month, which has now risen to -27 this month. Keir Starmer is less popular than both Farage and Badenoch, with his net favourability rating now at -36. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey is much more popular, with his net favourability rating now at -9 - although this is not directly translated across into voting intention. These figures are likely to restart the debate in the Tory party about whether they should consider merging with Reform UK, something which Badenoch has repeatedly rejected. A total of 43% of those polled who voted Tory in the last general election support a merger, compared with 31% against. Reform UK voters are more likely to oppose, with 40% against and 31% for."

        "Content": "By Alix Culbertson and Faye Brown, political reporters   Sir Keir Starmer has said it is \"early days\" when it comes to the possibility of Donald Trump imposing tariffs on the UK. Speaking at a joint news conference with NATO's secretary general Mark Rutte, the prime minister said the need for \"open and strong\" trading relations formed the basis of his discussions with the new US president so far. It comes after Mr Trump suggested he is poised to expand his tariff regime to both the UK and the EU, but added that he thinks a deal can be done with Britain. Asked by Sky News's political editor Beth Rigby if he is worried, Sir Keir said: \"On the question of tariffs it's early days, and I think what's really important is open and strong trading relations and that has been the basis of my discussions with President Trump.\" The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares fell sharply on Monday after Mr Trump's comments. Asked by the BBC if he will target the UK with tariffs, the US leader had said: \"UK is out of line but I'm sure that one... I think that one can be worked out.\" Mr Trump was referring to trade deficits - when you import more goods from another country than you send there in return. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer thinks he can manage relations with the US, EU and China  - but that could be easier said than done\n                 \n                  Why Trump has threatened to cut off all future funding to South Africa\n                 Politics latest: Starmer meeting EU leaders in post-Brexit milestone UK ministers have previously suggested the UK could avoid tariffs as the US does not have a trade deficit with Britain. Reacting to Mr Trump's comments, a Downing Street spokesman said earlier that the UK and US \"have a fair and balanced trading relationship which benefits both sides of the Atlantic\".  \"We look forward to working closely with President Trump to continue to build on UK-US trading relations for our economy, businesses and the British people,\" the spokesman added. The US represents 18% (Â£300bn) of the UK's trade and the countries are each other's single largest investors with Â£1.2trn invested in each other's economies. Read more:How Trump's tariffs could impact US consumers and UKBreaking economies could be first step for expansionist TrumpCanada and Mexico hit back with retaliatory tariffs  According to US figures, America ran an overall trade surplus with the UK in 2023, amounting to $14.5bn - which would put the UK in a favourable position if Mr Trump targets harsher tariffs where there is a significant deficit. However, the UK's Office for National Statistics reports that the UK ran a trade surplus with the US of Â£71.4bn (around $89bn) in 2023. As our economics and data editor Ed Conway explains, either way both figures are very small and the numbers are essentially balanced. Despite his threat, Mr Trump also had positive words for the UK when he said discussions with the prime minister have \"been very nice\". \"We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well,\" he said. He struck a different tone when talking about the EU, saying tariffs will \"definitely\" be placed on goods from the bloc as America's trade deficit with it is \"an atrocity\" and \"they take almost nothing and we take everything from them\". The comments and the subsequent market fallout, also seen in Europe, have somewhat overshadowed Sir Keir Starmer becoming the first UK leader to meet all 27 EU chiefs since Brexit. During a Q&A session after his news conference with Mr Rutte, Sir Keir said the UK will \"stay resolute\" in its commitment to working with both the US and the EU as he insisted that Britain is \"not choosing between\" them. Elsewhere, Mr Trump has announced he will impose 25% trade taxes on goods coming from America's nearest neighbours and largest trade partners - Canada and Mexico - as well as a 10% levy on Chinese goods. The Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum later said she will send 10,000 soldiers to the US border in a deal with Mr Trump to \"pause\" the 25% tariff. Canada, Mexico and China have all vowed to slap tariffs on US goods, sparking fears of a global trade war."

        "Content": "By Anjum Peerbacos, education reporter  Ofsted has revealed what new report cards for schools could look like - as the sister of aÂ headteacher who took her own life says theÂ proposals are a \"rehash\" of a \"dangerous\" system. One-word grades were scrapped by the government after Ruth Perry's death in 2023 following the downgrading of her Caversham Primary School in Reading from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\". Schools in England could instead be judged across a variety of different areas - including attendance and inclusion - using a colour-coded five-point scale. But Mrs Perry's sister Professor Julia Waters said: \"I am worried that this proposal is a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace.\" She said while the new model has some improvements, it \"retains many of the dangerous features of the previous system, while introducing a series of changes with potential new risks to the wellbeing of teachers and headteachers\". \"My sister Ruth Perry died as the result of a rude and intimidating Ofsted inspection, and its disproportionate consequences on her and her school,\" she said. \"Ofsted says it has listened, but it still does not appear to have adequately learned.\" \n                  Delay in start of sign language GCSE is a 'disgrace'\n                 \n                  Government accused of U-turn over decision to revive Tory free speech laws\n                 \n                  England's special educational needs system is a postcode lottery in urgent need of funding and reform, say MPs\n                 Analysis: Will school report cards help inform parents? Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she recognises the \"tragedy of Ruth Perry's death and the impetus for change her sister has brought to the system\", adding she has spoken to Prof Waters about the need for Ofsted reform. \"On the report cards in particular, I think parents are more than able to understand and take on greater information about what's happening within their children's school, both in terms of strengths but in terms of weakness and where there's further work required on improvements,\" she said. The minister said she \"fundamentally rejects\" the idea that parents do not want to know more about areas in need of improvement, as well as \"where there is excellence\". A 12-week consultation on the inspection process for schools teaching pupils of all ages, including further education institutions, was launched on Monday. The proposals include a new report card format to replace the single-word grade system, where schools were given an \"Outstanding\", \"Good\", \"Requires Improvement\", or \"Inadequate\" rating. Instead, judgements will be made using a 1-5 grading system using the terms: \"Exemplary\", \"Strong\", \"Secure\", \"Attention Needed\", and \"Causing Concern\".  The previous judgements will remain valid until schools undergo another inspection under the new model. Safeguarding will be assessed as a standalone category and will be classified as either met or not met. The number of inspection areas in schools will expand from four to nine, or ten for those with a sixth form. Under the new proposal, the areas of inspection will be Achievement, Attendance, Behaviour and Attitudes, Curriculum, Developing Teaching, Inclusion, Leadership and Governance, Personal Development and Well-Being, Sixth Form, and Safeguarding. Ofsted has already started training inspectors to facilitate the changes for the new style inspections. Chief inspector of Ofsted Sir Martyn Oliver said: \"The new report card will give parents a clearer picture, while helping schools focus on meaningful improvements. \"We will make sure that we deliver for parents regardless of what we do. \"Our mission is to improve education for all children, particularly the most disadvantaged.\" Read more:Children experiencing 'unorthodox' schoolingSchool hygiene poverty on the riseParents want tougher mobile measures But Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said Sir Martyn \"has failed to deliver\". \"The proposals outlined in today's consultation will make matters worse, not better,\" he said. \"The secretary of state was right to remove one-word judgements because she recognised the damage that they cause. \"Instead, the 1 to 5 grading scale proposed for the report card maintains the current blunt, reductive approach that cannot capture the complexity of school life nor provide more meaningful information to parents.\""

The one or two-word judgments on which schools were assessed in England for years - \"good\", \"outstanding\" down to \"requires improvement\" or \"inadequate\" - are out. The new system, outlined by Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, will see schools assessed in nine separate areas - such as leadership, behaviour, achievement, attendance and safeguarding.

One education leader told the Financial Times the colour codes were like the spice chart at Nando's. \"It's still lemon and herbs, extra hot\", they said, claiming evaluating more areas would make school leaders more anxious. The education secretary used a speech in Westminster to hit back at her critics, saying: \"I fundamentally reject this idea that somehow providing more information and shining a light on areas where there's need for improvement, but also where there's excellence, is somehow not something that parents want\".

Her sister, Professor Julia Waters, called the new proposals a \"dangerous rehash\" of the old system.  The education secretary said England's schools - of which 90% are now rated good or outstanding in one of the key achievements of the last Conservative government - may now be victims of their own success. Few parents, she said, feel that the \"good\" rating - which has been applied to schools in both the top and bottom 1% of attainment - gives a full picture. Inspectors will now have to make more complex and more regular judgments. A trial over the next three months will help determine if parents find it easier to make choices for their children, or find they have good options to choose from."

Our data analysis shows last year 40% of the total number of arrivals happened on a Saturday or Sunday. We have been looking into possible reasons why many more people are arriving in small boats on the weekend, and the explanation might not be quite what you expect. Here are a few theories. French staffing and resources One suggestion is that French border force, police and coastguard are not working to a consistent level seven days a week. \"Gangs have realised there are lower or less engaged staffing on weekends on the French side,\" a former senior Home Office official who worked closely on deals with the French told Sky News.

Hundreds of millions have been given by the UK to France to police the Calais coast, most recently almost Â£500m in 2023. Another former senior government official with responsibility for borders said the French would be able to demonstrate that \"hundreds or thousands of officers are working there\" but \"strategically it suits France to have the gust with us\". But when we put this to the French side there was a pushback. Marc de Fleurian, the Calais MP from Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, says \"blaming the other side of the Channel\" is the \"easy answer\".

If you have eight rather than 100 police officers that won't change anything at all.\" A French coastguard source told Sky News there are the same staffing levels at the weekend, he says \"any suggestion there is less staffing on the weekends is laughable and an easy thing to say\". Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said the government's work with the French saw \"more than 28,000 dangerous unnecessary crossing attempts prevented last year\". He added French law enforcing officers \"routinely patrol beaches on weekends as well as during the week\". Smuggler planning Smuggler supply chains might be linked to a specific day for a range of reasons, for example, as one former senior Home Office official suggests, the fact \"boat engines, or parts, might arrive on a Friday\". Mr Dumont says smuggling networks rely on people to do small jobs, like transporting boats, who may also have day jobs in the week. He says the reasons behind the weekend uptick \"are not necessarily predictable ones\". Another factor may be that because French police tend not to intervene once a boat is in the water, many small boats set off from inland waterways. The canal-type waterways which come inland before the Channel are often full of fishing boats on weekdays, making it easier to launch from the waterways on weekends. Another suggestion from a Home Office source is that while many migrants who cross the channel are based in the camps around Calais, many use public transport to arrive for a timed departure and are therefore reliant on transport timetables which may be more limited at different times of the week. Weather coincidence Leaked Home Office analysis shows that of the number of weekend days where small boat crossings were more likely because of good weather conditions was disproportionately high last year. The figures show that 61 out of 197 days where the weather meant there was a realistic possibility, likely or highly likely there would be a channel crossing were weekend days. However, we only have figures for 2024, and it seems unlikely the weather alone could account for three years of higher crossings on weekend days."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The Scottish government has said it will \"under no circumstances\" be banning cats after being urged to order a report to explore measures for protecting at-risk wildlife. The Scottish Animal Welfare Commission (SAWC) made the recommendation in a report to Holyrood in response to evidence that cats have a \"significant impact on wildlife populations\". SAWC is calling for the Scottish government to ask NatureScot to commission a report into the advantages and disadvantages for wildlife of introducing cat containment areas in \"vulnerable areas\". If implemented, residents in those zones could be forced to keep their pets indoors - or banned from getting them in the first place. SAWC suggested that new housing developments in rural regions \"could have a stipulation that cats may not be kept in conservation-sensitive areas\", or in the vicinity of endangered birds and wildlife. The SAWC made several other recommendations, including requiring the compulsory microchipping and registration of pet cats. It also called for a further report into the pros and cons of the compulsory neutering of owned cats in \"vulnerable areas\". The Scottish government initially said it would \"fully consider the recommendations\" made by SAWC, as it urged all cat owners to consider microchipping their pets. In a statement later on Monday, a spokesperson said: \"Banning cats is not a recommendation of the report and we will, under no circumstances, be banning cats.\" SAWC's report - titled Responsible Ownership and Care of Domestic Cats in Scotland - noted that hunting in cats \"is not driven by hunger\", and domestic pets \"have a tendency to play with their prey and bring back live often injured prey to their owners\". Number of animals killed each year could reach 700 million It has been estimated that cats across the UK bring home tens of millions of animals each year - including birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. SAWC said given only a proportion of prey is brought home, \"the actual number of wild prey killed could reach at least 700 million vertebrates per year in the UK\". The commission said domestic and feral cats are also a threat to the nation's rare wildcat population by competing with them for food and habitats, as well as passing on diseases. Read more from Sky News:Endangered froglets born after dramatic rescue missionHighly dangerous new species of spider foundBill Gates says he would be diagnosed autistic if young today Cats 'should have choice of access to outside' Cats Protection said it works with organisations such as Saving Wildcats to reduce the impact of domestic and feral cats on native wildlife. The charity also supports the call for mandatory microchipping but believes all cats \"should have the choice to access the outside world\". Alice Palombo, the charity's advocacy and government relations officer for Scotland, added: \"Cats need to be able to perform natural cat-like behaviours if they're to live happy, healthy lives. \"These needs, like scratching and climbing, are more easily met in the outside world. \"Outdoor access also gives cats more opportunity to exercise and enjoy the stimulation that comes with new smells, sights and sounds. \"While some cats tolerate living indoors, missing out on these vital experiences can lead to stress-related problems like spraying, excessive grooming or physical illness.\" Australia has containment areas and curfews SAWC's report noted that containment areas have been set up in several states in Australia, with a round-the-clock cat curfew in some places and restrictions after dark in others. The only exceptions are for enclosed outdoor runs or if owners take their pets for walks on a lead. A spokesperson from NatureScot said: \"We note the report from the Scottish Animal Welfare Commission. \"Any decisions on the report's recommendations are a matter for Scottish ministers.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Sir Keir Starmer has denied breaking lockdown rules when a voice coach came to Labour headquarters during COVID. At the end of a news conference during his visit to Brussels on Monday, the prime minister was asked whether he broke pandemic restrictions. \"Of course not,\" he replied before leaving the podium. \"All rules were followed as you'd expect,\" he said. The Labour Party earlier also denied the prime minister breached COVID rules in December 2020 for employing actress and voice coach Leonie Mellinger to help him prepare a response to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Two Sunday Times journalists, Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, said in their book Get In that Ms Mellinger advised Sir Keir on his speaking style. Politics latest: Starmer heads to Brussels for talks Excerpts of the book said she qualified for \"key worker\" status and visited the Labour Party's headquarters on 24 December 2020 wearing a face mask. At the time, London and the South East were under Tier 4 restrictions, which meant no households were allowed to mix and people had to work from home unless they were unable to do so. Conservative former minister Richard Holden has written to Sir Keir asking whether he thinks he was breaching the law. A Labour spokesman said: \"The rules were followed at all times.\" It is understood Sir Keir was working at the time with a small team that was preparing him for a response to Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, with a TV camera filming it all. No investigation into whether Starmer was working A recommendation on Ms Mellinger's website from Sir Keir says: \"Thanks for all your help and support along the way which made all this possible.\" Mr Holden has asked the prime minister if he will now appoint an independent investigator to clear up the claims. The Tory MP wrote in his letter: \"Do you think it would be right for other members of the public to get acting lessons during tier 4 restrictions?\" Sky News understands there will not be an investigation into whether Sir Keir was working. 'A strong public interest into your conduct' Signing off the letter, Mr Holden added: \"There is a strong public interest into your conduct during the pandemic and it is clear from these revelations that not only have you misled the public but you had a casual disregard for the law at a time when so many people were making such difficult sacrifices all in the service of advancing your own political career. \"You have said 'honesty and decency matters' - I hope you will treat these questions to you with the same standards you asked of others.\" Read more:Starmer must balance his EU reset with Trump's tariffsStarmer's 1,000 jobs pledge could take 20 yearsUK growth outlook downgraded by forecasters ðListen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appð Previous questions over 'beergate' This is not the first time Mr Holden has questioned Sir Keir's lockdown conduct. He queried the Labour leader's conduct around \"Beergate\", when Sir Keir and deputy leader Angela Rayner were pictured drinking beer and eating a takeaway at a Labour Party meeting during a local election campaign in Durham in April 2021. A police investigation found they had not breached COVID rules as the event complied with the regulations for work gatherings, with a pause for food."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       Bill Gates says he believes he would have been diagnosed with a form of autism if he had grown up in this era. The Microsoft co-founder, who is one of the world's richest people, makes the observation in his memoir: Source Code: My Beginnings - which will be released on Tuesday. In an excerpt shared by The Wall Street Journal, the 69-year-old billionaire wrote: \"If I were growing up today, I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. \"My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues, and could be rude or inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.\" He said that \"the fact that some people's brains process information differently from others\" wasn't widely understood during his childhood, with the term \"neurodivergent\" only becoming popularised in the 1990s. The philanthropist, who has given away billions of dollars-worth of his wealth through his Gates Foundation, said his social side and \"awareness of the impact I can have on other people\" was slow to develop, but has \"come with age, with experience, with children, and I'm better for it\". He socialises in high circles, now; in an interview with CBS News on Sunday, he revealed he had been gifted a new all-electric Fiat RED for his birthday by U2 singer Bono, who he works with on global health projects. \n                  Bill Gates says AI will make it easier to combat climate change but must be 'used by people with good intent'\n                 \n                  Bill Gates visit to China signals Beijing is open to a thaw in relations with US\n                 \n                  Bill Gates jokes Internet Explorer died because Microsoft 'ran out of microchips'\n                 Mr Gates wrote he wouldn't trade his brain \"for anything\" despite some of the challenges his way of thinking posed during his younger years. Mr Gates expanded on this point in an interview with The Times, saying: \"If they ever invent a pill where they could say, 'OK, your social skills will be normal but your ability to concentrate would also be normal', I wouldn't take the pill. \"Maybe I am forgetting how painful it was but I needed my neurodiversity to write that software.\" He said it was the way his brain is wired which helped him write his first code as a young teenager - a code he would later use for Microsoft. Neurodivergent describes the minority group that diverts neurologically from what is considered normal - or neurotypical. It relates to a host of conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Roughly one in seven people are estimated to be neurodivergent, according to the NHS.

Some came to the Tesla founder's defence, claiming he was expressing the phrase \"my heart goes out to you\" and suggesting it perhaps came across awkwardly due to his condition. The world's richest man dismissed any controversy, writing on X: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\""

Despite being the most nominated artist in Grammy history, Beyonce has never before won in the top category, with the gong evading her four times previously. Just three women of colour have won album of the year before her, the last being Lauryn Hill 26 years ago. Read more: The full list of Grammy 2025 winners Presented by members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Beyonce was joined by her 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter to accept the top prize for her chart-topping album Cowboy Carter. She said she felt \"honoured,\" adding: \"It's been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\" She went on to dedicate her win to Linda Martell, the first commercially successful black female artist in Country music. There was tough competition, with female stars including Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift in the mix. Andre 3000 and Jacob Collier made it into the category. Earlier in the night, a stunned Beyonce told the audience she was \"still in shock\" after winning best Country album - becoming the first black female artist to take the prize. Handed the award by Taylor Swift, the Texas-born star said: \"Wow, I really was not expecting this. I want to thank God that I'm able to do what I love after so many years.\" She went on: \"Genre is a code word to keep us in place as artists, and I just want to encourage us to do what we're passionate about.\" Read more:All the best Grammy red carpet looksRaining underwear, a giant pony and more key moments Beyonce has previously been vocal about the lack of wins in the big Grammy categories for artists of colour, who she said were largely relegated to the genre categories. Last year her husband, rap star Jay-Z, addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So, even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Beyonce went on to be snubbed at the Country Music Awards later in the year, despite becoming the first black woman to top Billboard's country music chart with the album's lead single Texas Hold Em'. Beyonce had already made history earlier in the night, winning best country duo/group performance for II Most Wanted featuring Miley Cyrus, but was pipped at the post by Kacey Musgraves, who took best Country song for The Architect. Ahead of the ceremony, Beyonce announced on social media she would be taking Cowboy Carter on tour.  Bianca bares all on the red carpet Before the main ceremony, the stars walked the red carpet with a largely sombre pallet due to the recent wildfires which have left the city reeling. Those who opted for bursts of colour included Swift in red, Roan in bright yellow and pale blue and Bianca Censori who started the carpet in a floor-length fur coat but ended it in decidedly less. Her minimalist approach to fashion garnered her plenty of attention.  Diss track triumph for Lamar Meanwhile, Kendrick Lamar dominated the night, taking both song and record of the year for his much-talked-about diss track, Not Like Us. The Compton-born artist dedicated his record of the year win \"to the city,\" and later said he was \"star-struck\" to be handed his best song award by Diana Ross. Disproving the adage, 'if you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything,' the track won all five awards it was up for. The first award of the main ceremony, best rap album, went to rising star Doechii for Alligator Bites Never Heal. Presented with her award by Cardi B, she became tearful on stage as she became only the third woman ever to take the prize. Thanks mum! Best pop vocal album went to Sabrina Carpenter for Short N' Sweet. She said she \"might cry\" for her first Grammy win, thanking her mum for \"driving me to every voice lesson,\" before going on to apologise for saying \"Hell\" three times during her acceptance speech. Carpenter's gong was presented by Red Hot Chilli Peppers band members Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith, who sang a burst of their 1991 hit Under The Bridge, in tribute to the City Of Angles - LA. The evening had a very different tone to previous shows following the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Black was a common theme on the red carpet and the evening kicked off by highlighting the city's resilience.  Host Trevor Noah's opening speech spoke of the \"entire communities burned to the ground\", going on, \"it's often said in the darkest time the best of humanity shines through...tonight we're not only celebrating our favourite music but celebrating the city that brought us our favourite music\". Raising money for those affected by the disaster, Noah said advertising space had also been given to local LA businesses affected by fire. Chappell Roan calls out the labels Best newcomer went to Chappell Roan, who wore a giant cone hat with a veil spouting from the top, and which threatened to fall as she accepted her gong. The 26-year-old singer gave an impassioned speech as she accepted her first Grammy saying: \"I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a liveable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\" She went on to describe the strain of being signed young, and then dropped by her label, and struggling to afford health insurance, resulting in her feeling \"betrayed by the system and so dehumanised\". In the US, unlike the NHS in the UK, health care is not free at the point of delivery. Roan finished with the rhetorical question: \"So record labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a liveable wage and health insurance and protection. Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\" Earlier, her Pink Pony Club performance had featured a giant pony and host of cowboy clowns. During the three-and-a-half-hour show, Billie Eilish also performed on an LA hillside set, Sabrina Carpenter gave it some old-school Hollywood glamour, and British star Raye gave a soulful performance of Oscar Winning Tears. Charli XCX scored her first Grammys for best dance/electronic album and best dance/pop recording, following her culture-shaping Brat album, which was the talk of the summer. Remembering those who are gone Stars including Will Smith, Cynthia Erivo, Stevie Wonder and Janelle MonÃ¡e headlined a lengthy tribute to the late, legendary producer Quincy Jones, featuring jazz musician Herbie Hancock on the piano, and renditions of We Are The World and Thriller. Led by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, the In Memoriam section began by remembering Liam Payne who died in October aged 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. It also included actress and singer Marianne Faithful, who passed away over the weekend."

One of the most successful music stars of the last three decades, despite her years at the top - and previous nods for I Am... Sasha Fierce, the self-titled Beyonce, Lemonade, and Renaissance - Grammys recognition for her albums had previously eluded her.  This year, she finally takes home the gong for the chart-topping country record Cowboy Carter, taking her tally to 35 in total. It was a long time coming. But on a very busy Grammys evening, which raised funds for wildfire relief efforts in Los Angeles, there were plenty of other highlights and surprises, too. Here are the other key moments and bits that got everyone talking.  Interesting... outfits First up, the red carpet. The Grammys (and music awards in general) are always more fun, more out-there than the film and TV ceremonies, and this year was no exception. Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, Cardi B, Sabrina Carpenter, Miley Cyrus, Raye, Chappell Roan and Gracie Abrams all stepped up. Among the show-stopping dresses, there were some more unusual looks - Will Smith's son Jaden wearing a black castle on his head, for instance. And then there was Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori, who arrived in a fur coat and took it off to reveal, well, pretty much nothing at all. If you're aware of the couple, you'll know this isn't particularly unusual. But when you're not winning any awards - West lost out on the best rap song prize, which went to Kendrick Lamar - you've got to make headlines somehow, right? Read more: All the best red carpet looks Taylor Swift holds space for Cynthia Erivo As her Eras tour dominated everything, Taylor Swift was the big winner of last year's Grammys. This year, she went home empty-handed - but was more than happy to cheer on her fellow artists, and even share her seat. In a video clip shared on social media, the star could be seen calling to Wicked star Cynthia Erivo when the actress and singer seemingly had trouble finding her table. Swift scooched over to give Erivo space. Speaking of which, the pair even briefly recreated the \"holding space\" finger-holding from Erivo's viral Wicked interview alongside her co-star Ariana Grande last year.  Kendrick Lamar and LA fires dedication One of the night's other big winners was rapper Kendrick Lamar, who picked up two of the top awards - record of the year and song of the year - for his \"diss\" track Not Like Us, reportedly directed at Canadian rapper Drake. The song also won other prizes for best music video, best rap performance and best rap song. On stage, Lamar dedicated the record of the year award to his hometown Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires. \"This is my neck of the woods that held me down since a young pup, since I was in the studio scrapping to write the best raps and all that,\" he said. \"I can't give enough thanks to these places that I rolled around since high school. Most importantly the people and the families out in the Palisades and Altadena. This is a true testament that we can continue to restore the city.\" Chappell Roan's pink pony Finishing off the winners of the big four prizes was Chappell Roan, who was named best new artist - her first Grammy award. The star performed her disco anthem Pink Pony Club earlier on in the night, sitting on a giant pink pony before joining a group of dancers dressed as rodeo clowns. Accepting her award, she called for the music industry to provide a \"liveable wage and healthcare for artists\", revealing to the crowd she had always told herself she would demand that labels and the industry protect artists more if she ever won a Grammy. She recalled feeling \"betrayed\" and \"dehumanised\" when she struggled to find work and afford healthcare during the pandemic, after getting dropped by her first label as a young artist when she had given \"everything\" to them. Read more: All the big winners The Weeknd returns In 2020, The Weeknd accused the Grammys of being \"corrupt\" after being snubbed for awards despite a stellar year. Five years later, he made a comeback and took to the stage for an unexpected performance. Harvey Mason Jr, the chief executive of the Recording Academy, which organises the awards, acknowledged the star's previous criticism in a speech as host Trevor Noah teased a big surprise. Mason said the Academy had modernised and diversified in recent years. \"With that in mind, on a truly special night, what better way to bring us together than this next artist - someone who has seen the work the Academy has put in.\" The Weeknd arrived on an elevated black stage with red lighting, and was joined by rapper Playboy Carti for a performance of Cry For Me from his new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow. Step back in time There were Grammy wins for both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones following their respective music comebacks. The Beatles picked up the award for best rock performance for the song Now And Then, which was written and sung by John Lennon and later finished by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr using overdubs and guitar tracks by George Harrison. They were up against The Black Keys, Green Day, Idles, Pearl Jam and St Vincent. Meanwhile, the Rolling Stones landed the prize for best rock album for Hackney Diamonds, their first album of original music in 18 years, seeing off competition from The Black Crowes, Fontaines DC, Green Day, Idles, Pearl Jam and Jack White. Will Smith leads Quincy Jones tribute Best known for his work with artists including Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, legendary music producer Quincy Jones was also the executive producer of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, the show on which Will Smith rose to fame. Following his death last year aged 91, Smith led a Grammys tribute which also included performances by Stevie Wonder, Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock and Erivo. Smith - appearing at a televised awards ceremony for the first time since he infamously slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022 - told the audience how Jones \"gave me a shot\" with the comedy series and joked how \"y'all saw the early episode, so y'all know I couldn't really act\". He said Jones had taught him \"to take care\" of the people working around him, \"and I've done everything I can through my career to try to live up to Quincy's demand\". Jones won 28 Grammys throughout his career. Smith is making a musical comeback and last week announced his first album in 20 years. Charli XCX is so Julia Of course, the Grammys had to acknowledge the phenomenon of Brat, and British star Charli XCX was among the early winners - picking up best dance/electronic album and best recording package for her viral sixth record, and best dance pop recording for the single Von Dutch. These were her first ever Grammy wins. The star also performed at the show and was joined by actress Julia Fox and collaborator The Dare on stage. Emerging from a blacked-out 4x4 in a long black fur coat and blue underwear, she performed Von Dutch before moving on to Guess - cheered on by Billie Eilish, who collaborated on a remix of the song. Emulating the music video for Guess, underwear rained down on the stage in a performance so racy \"it might not make the edit\", Charli joked. \"All unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence,\" the crowd was told in a message that flashed on screen. At the end of her performance, Charli pulled Fox to the front after wishing her a happy birthday. Fox, an actress and model who turned 35 on Saturday, is referenced in 360, another hit song from Brat.  'You are exactly who you need to be' Rising star Doechii became only the third woman in Grammys history to take home the award for best rap album, following in the footsteps of Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. The star, who picked up the award for her third mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal, gave an impassioned speech as she collected her prize. \"I know there's some black girl, so many black women, watching me right now,\" she told the audience. \"And I wanna tell you, you can do it. Anything is possible. \"Don't allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, tell you that you can't be here, that you're too dark or that you're not smart enough or that you're too dramatic or you're too loud. You are exactly who you need to be.\" Pop and politics As well as the LA fires, artists also used the stage to highlight several other political and social issues. Jennifer Lopez presented the prize for best Latin pop album to Shakira, for Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. Shakira hugged her two sons as she went to collect her award, dedicating it to \"all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country - you're loved, you're worth it, and I will always fight with you\". Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won best pop duo/group performance for Die With A Smile, paying their respects to one another's career achievements in their acceptance speech. Gaga also spoke out for trans rights, saying: \"Trans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\" They earlier performed 1960s classic California Dreamin' in tribute to LA. Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr Dre Global Impact Award by rapper and singer Queen Latifah. Taking one of her children on stage to accept her award, she paid tribute to a host of female artists who she said had \"opened the doors\" before her. In a nod to politics, she went on to say DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) was \"not a threat, but a gift\", and added: \"When destructive forces try to burn us down, we burn like a phoenix.\" In the US, the Trump administration is currently calling for the rollback of DEI programs."

        "Content": "Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu has died at the age of 48, after contracting pneumonia that developed following the flu. The star, known by her fans as Da S (Big S), rose to fame in the TV drama Meteor Garden, which became hugely popular across Asia in the early 2000s. Her death has shocked people across Taiwan and also in China, where news of her death was trending on the social media platform Weibo. Hsu caught the flu while visiting Japan with her family during the Lunar New Year, according to her younger sister, Dee Hsu, who is a TV host. \"My dearest and most kindhearted sister Barbie Hsu died of influenza-induced pneumonia and unfortunately left us,\" she said in a statement. \"I am grateful that in this lifetime I was able to be her sister, taking care of each other and being companions. I will forever be thankful for her and miss her!\" She did not give details about where and when her sister died. Who is Barbie Hsu? Hsu broke into the entertainment industry first through music, forming the pop group SOS with her sister as a teenager. The pair later switched to hosting TV shows. In 2001, Meteor Garden made Hsu a household name across Asia. She played the female lead in the romance drama, which also starred the boyband F4. She also starred in other series including Mars, Corner With Love, and Reign Of Assassins, and films such as The Ghost Inside and Connected. Hsu was married to Korean musician Koo Jun-yup, also known as DJ Koo. She was previously married to Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei for more than 10 years, but the pair went through an acrimonious divorce which made headlines in 2021.

        "Content": "A judge has warned Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawyers to stop publicly discussing their competing lawsuits. Both actors - who co-starred in 2024's It Ends With Us - have filed lawsuits against each other following an initial legal complaint from Lively. The 37-year-old accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the film - and an alleged subsequent plan to damage her reputation.   Baldoni then sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of hijacking both the production and marketing of the film, as well as allegedly attempting to smear him and others who worked on the production through false allegations. New York district court judge Lewis J Liman has scheduled a trial date combining the two claims for March 2026 - but warned both parties on Monday that their comments to the media could impact their cases.  Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb complained that Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman violated professional ethics rules for lawyers by accusing the actress of \"bullying\" in People magazine. He told a hearing at Manhattan federal court that \"it's very hard to un-ring the bell\" and argued such statements could taint a jury pool. But Mr Freedman complained \"this has not been a one-way street\", and claimed his comments to the magazine and on a podcast were a response to a New York Times article from 21 December that \"completely devastated\" Baldoni. Judge Liman has now adopted a state rule barring most out-of-court statements that could affect a case's outcome - with an exception to protect clients from prejudicial adverse publicity. Neither lawyer objected. Lively's legal team have previously accused Mr Freedman in a court filing of trying to influence potential jurors by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between her and Baldoni. Read more from Sky News:Grammys: Beyonce wins album of the yearReform tops landmark poll for first time In late December, Lively sued Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios and others in New York for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation, asking for unspecified damages. Baldoni then filed his lawsuit in January, accusing Lively and her husband, Deadpool star and Wrexham FC co-owner Reynolds, of defamation and extortion. He is seeking at least $400m (Â£321m) in damages. The actor also sued The New York Times newspaper for libel after it published allegations about him. Lively starred in the 2005 film The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants before rising to fame in the TV series Gossip Girl from 2007 to 2012. She is also known for films including The Town and The Shallows. Baldoni is known for the TV comedy series Jane The Virgin and for directing the 2019 film Five Feet Apart. He also wrote Man Enough - a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity."

        "Content": "Chilean tennis player Cristian Garin lost his Davis Cup qualifier in bizarre fashion after refusing to continue following an accidental collision with his opponent. Belgium's Zizou Bergs was celebrating winning a game in the third set when he sprinted over towards his bench. Garin was passing through the narrow space between the net and the umpire's chair at the same time and the two collided, with Bergs catching the Chilean player in the eye with his shoulder. The 25-year-old Belgian immediately started apologising and Garin had to receive medical treatment. Bergs was given a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct but his Chilean opponent refused to continue and called for him to be disqualified. Instead, Garin, 28, received three consecutive time violations, which led to a game penalty and him losing the set and match without moving from the bench. Bergs won 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, meaning Belgium advanced to the second round of qualifying. \n                  Mexico and Canada agree to bolster US border security in return for tariff pause\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's tariffs: What's going on and what does it all mean?\n                 \n                  Swedish anti-Islam campaigner sentenced over Koran burnings days after co-defendant shot dead\n                 The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said in a statement: \"This was a rare, unfortunate and very delicate situation and everyone involved, including the independent doctor, conducted due diligence based on rules and procedures. \"We understand the emotions attached to this unusual incident, but the final decision was made after consideration of all the facts and unique circumstances around it.\" Read more:Cat ban could be tabled in ScotlandFormer Spanish football chief goes on trial over kissHere's what everyone is talking about after the Grammy's Chile's Olympic committee said on X that it was \"upset and incredulous\" with the situation and that it would support the Chilean tennis federation \"so that this shameful international incident does not go unpunished\".
