        "Content": "Donald Trump has said Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" as peace talks between the US and Russia continue â€“ without Ukraine at the table. Officials from the White House and the Kremlin have this week begun holding discussions in Saudi Arabia. The decision for the talks to take place without representatives from Kyiv or Europe has caused concern, and sparked an emergency meeting of European leaders in France earlier this week. Mr Trump's latest comments - in which he also calls Mr Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\" - come after the Ukrainian president accused him of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\" as a result of his administration's discussions with Kremlin officials.  Ukraine latest: Follow updates as Putin makes peace talks claim In a post on his social media platform TruthSocial, the US president said Mr Zelenskyy had \"talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn't be won, that never had to start\". \"The only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle',\" he added. Mr Trump continued: \"Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left. \"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. \"Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going.\" \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues,\" he wrote. Mr Trump later repeated his comments in a rambling speech to a Saudi-run investment forum in Miami. Top end estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have died in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Millions of Ukrainians have fled their country as refugees. Mr Trump also repeated his claim that the Ukrainian president has low approval ratings - which has already been dismissed by Mr Zelenskyy as Russian disinformation - and claimed American aid money had been misused. The latest poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in early February, found 57% of Ukrainians trust their leader. Ukraine's general election, scheduled for April 2024, were delayed because of Russia's invasion in February 2022.  Speaking after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Zelenskyy called for pragmatism from the US. He said in his nightly address: \"We are standing strong on our own two feet. I am counting on Ukrainian unity, our courageâ€¦ on the unity of Europe and the pragmatism of America.\" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the US president labelling Mr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" is \"false and dangerous\", German newspaper Spiegel reported. \"It is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy his democratic legitimacy,\" Mr Scholz said. Putin: 'No one is excluding Ukraine from talks'  Mr Trump's latest post comes after Vladimir Putin insisted Kyiv could have a seat at the negotiating table. The Russian president said earlier on Wednesday: \"No one is excluding Ukraine from peace talks.\" \"We are ready, I have already said this a hundred times - if they want, please let these negotiations take place and we will be ready to return to the table,\" he said. More from Sky News:Analysis: Ukraine is fighting war on two frontsTrump 'disappointed' by Ukraine  Referencing Mr Zelenskyy's 2022 decree that rejected talks with Moscow, he added: \"The Europeans have stopped contacts with Russia. The Ukrainian side has forbidden itself to negotiate.\" According to the Russian leader, the \"goal and subject\" of Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia \"was the restoration of Russia-US relations\". Mr Zelenskyy is expected to meet later with Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Russia launches assault on Odesa Overnight, Russian forces launched a drone attack on Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring four people including a child, Mr Zelenskyy said. At least 160,000 people were left without heating in sub-zero temperatures, he added. \"Rescue operations are under way in Odesa after another Russian attack on the energy infrastructure,\" Mr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram app. \"It is civilian energy facilities against which the Russian army has not spared neither missiles nor attack drones for almost three years.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give the Ukrainian president his backing after Donald Trump called him a \"dictator\". A Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir called Mr Zelenskyy this evening and shared his support for him \"as Ukraine's democratically elected leader\". The prime minister \"said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II\", the statement continued. He also \"reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression\".  Politics Live: Johnson responds to Trump's 'shock' Ukraine claims In a post on X about the call, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"The United Kingdom's role in fortifying Europe's defense and security is important for us.\" \n                  Why all roads lead through Riyadh - as Saudi Arabia emerges as key global power broker\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer meets Trump - but how does he prepare?\n                 The \"UK's support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens\", he added. The call was held after Mr Trump took aim at the Ukrainian president in a post on his Truth Social platform. It is likely the war of words will come up again when Sir Keir meets Mr Trump in Washington next week, to discuss security and Ukraine. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had been under pressure to condemn Mr Trump's attacks, earlier said Mr Zelenskyy \"is not a dictator. He is the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin's illegal invasion\". However, she said that Mr Trump \"is right that Europe needs to pull its weight - and that includes the UK\". She added: \"We need to get serious. The PM will have my support to increase defence spending - there is a fully funded plan to get to 2.5% sitting on his desk. \"That should be the bare minimum. Starmer should get on with it, get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\" Labour has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, from about 2.3% now, but there is no timeline as to when. This week Ms Badenoch admitted the Tories tried to increase the funding to 3% while they were in office but there \"wasn't enough money to do so\". It comes against the backdrop of a war of words between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, after officials from the US and Russia met in Saudi Arabia for talks to end the war - without representatives from Kyiv or Europe present.

In response, Mr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday the American leader is living in a \"disinformation space\" created by Russia, which has repeatedly sought to blame Ukraine for the war.  Mr Trump has since hit back, saying Mr Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" and branding him a \"dictator\". Mr Zelenskyy was elected as president of Ukraine in May 2019. Elections were previously scheduled to go ahead in 2024, but they were not held as a result of martial law being in place. Ex-PM: Trump's comments intended to 'shock Europeans into action' Ms Badenoch's remarks come after reports that Tory MPs wanted her to take a stand on Ukraine since Mr Trump's interventions. Ukraine latest: Trump calls Zelenskyy a 'dictator ' Europe is scrambling to respond to a US shift in foreign policy - with Mr Trump making clear that Washington no longer sees the defence of the continent as its primary concern. Earlier on Wednesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when the war began, claimed Mr Trump's statements are \"not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action\". He asked when Europeans will \"stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?\" However on the other end of the political spectrum, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that \"calling Mr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' must be where the line is drawn\". \"It is my sincere hope that the whole political spectrum in the United Kingdom will speak with one voice in opposition to Trump's lies.\" However defence secretary John Healey earlier reacted to the US president's claim that Ukraine started the war. The cabinet minister told reporters on a visit to Norway, near the border with Russia: \"Three years ago, one country illegally invaded another, and since then, the Ukrainians have been fighting for their freedom. \"They've been fighting for their future, and they still are. So whilst all the focus may be on talks, not even negotiations, our concern as defence ministers is that we're not jeopardising the peace by forgetting about the war.\""

        "Headline": "A sinkhole in the Surrey village of Godstone has led to evacuations, disrupted water supplies and the declaration of a major incident. It is not the first sinkhole to have opened up in the UK and around the world in the last few months, so what's causing them?",
        "Content": " A major incident has been declared in a village in Surrey after a large sinkhole opened up. At least one garden in Godstone has been swallowed by the hole - which is believed to measure up to 62ft (19m) - and around 30 homes have been evacuated. Carl Bussey, assistant director of safer communities at Surrey County Council, said on Wednesday that the site continues to be \"assessed by structural experts, in order to manage the risk and understand what needs to be done to make safe and repair\". What actually caused the hole to open up, remains unknown.  Provider SES Water said the sinkhole caused a water pipe to burst, leading to some residents losing their supply - which have now all been restored. Residents in the area are no strangers to sinkholes, having also experienced one in 2019 - albeit this was only \"slight\" and did not cause the same extent of damage. The most recent Surrey sinkhole also occurred mere months after a large sinkhole appeared in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, which ate up the driveway of former Love Island winner Liam Reardon's family home. Back in September last year, AFC Wimbledon had to postpone a Carabao Cup third-round rematch after severe flooding caused what appeared to be a large sinkhole on the pitch at Cherry Red Records Stadium. So what is causing these sinkholes, and why have more seemingly started to appear in the UK?  What is a sinkhole? Sinkholes are often saucer-shaped holes that occur as the result of a collapse or removal of an underlying layer of rocks that is used to support the materials on the surface, the British Geological Survey (BGS) says. The shape of a sinkhole depends on the composition of the rocks underneath the surface and the different interacting processes taking place, according to the BGS. Sinkholes that result from the removal of a soluble rock such as chalk, gypsum or limestone are called solution sinkholes. Streams or rivers that enter a sinkhole and disappear underground are known as shallow holes. What causes a sinkhole? \"The main trigger for sinkholes is water,\" Dr Clive Edmonds, a geotechnical specialist who has studied sinkholes for 30 years, told The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). He said in 90% of cases, water saturating the ground is the main cause of collapse. Dr Edmonds adds that geology is also a main factor in the development of a sinkhole. The more soluble the rock, the more likely a sinkhole is to occur. Soluble rocks that are broken down by water form karst, a type of landscape that is characterised by sinkholes and underground caves. Building works, changes in water table level and mining can also trigger sinkholes, the BGS says. Commenting specifically on Godstone, Dr Philip Collins, deputy dean at Brunel University's College of Engineering, said the land immediately west of where the sinkhole appears was formerly used as a sand quarry. \"Sand can be strong when compacted as the particles are packed together, but weak when it becomes wet, and particularly if there is a lot of water under pressure,\" he said, suggesting the local geology contributed to the formation of the sinkhole. He added that in this case the sinkhole appears to have been caused by a \"washout of soil from beneath the road as a result of a burst water mains\". \"This burst would have pumped a large volume of water into the soil in a short period of time, overcoming its strength and turning it to a slurry which was then washed away. It isn't clear where the soil went yet, but it is likely to have gone into the sewers, which may cause problems elsewhere,\" he said. Andrew Farrant, a regional geologist for the BGS agreed. He said the \"cross-bedded sands\" and \"weakly cemented sandstones\" that Godstone is build upon are \"prone to erosion and flushing by running water\". But adds that this would normally not be a problem \"unless there is a sudden change in the hydrogeology, for example by digging a large hole below the local water table or due to a sudden ingress of water, from say a burst pipe, or heavy rainfall or flooding. \"It is probable that a burst water main has flushed out weak sandstone bedrock, creating a void which has then collapsed,\" Mr Farrant said. He noted the \"actual cause\" of the sinkhole cannot be defined without further information. SES Water, which provides water in the area, maintains the burst main was caused after the sinkhole occurred and not the other way around. Tandridge district council confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that there are \"historical sandpits in the area\" and the southern building control partnership has visited the site to establish homes around the sinkhole are structurally sound. What areas of the UK are prone to sinkholes? The BGS says most sinkholes are relatively small and occur in upland or rural areas. Areas like the Mendip Hills in Somerset, parts of Wales, the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales are susceptible because they are built on Carboniferous limestone - a hard sedimentary rock made largely of calcium carbonate. The most sinkhole-susceptible area in the UK, is the Permian gypsum deposits of northeast England, particularly around Ripon, the BGS says. Sinkholes also occur over salt deposits, commonly in areas such as Cheshire. While on the west coast of Scotland, parts of Assynt are prone to sinkholes due to the underlying Cambrian Durness Limestone. Can you predict or prevent a sinkhole? Often the first indicators of a sinkhole are dips and depressions on ground surfaces, Dr Edmonds told The Institution of Civil Engineers. When these leaks and cracks fill with water it can potentially lead to buildings moving, leaks in water mains or sewer water leaking on to the ground. Geobear, a ground and structural engineering company based in the UK, says strengthening the ground in high-risk areas prone to sinkholes may help to prevent them from opening up. They do that by injecting geopolymer resin into the affected area, which binds with the soil and allows properties to withstand any sinkholes far more effectively. The company adds that homeowners worried about sinkholes forming can help prevent them by calling professionals, installing proper drainage systems and planting vegetation around a property to help absorb rainwater run off, instead of it collecting in pools. Not just a UK problem... Sinkholes are not just a problem in the UK, and recent examples from across the globe show just how dangerous the phenomena can be. At the beginning of the year, a rescue mission was launched in Yashio, Japan, after a truck and its driver were swallowed by a swimming pool-sized sinkhole. Aerial footage shown by local broadcaster Nippon TV showed at least 12 fire engines trying to free the driver, who was reportedly trapped in his vehicle after it filled with sand and mud. The search went on for two weeks before being called off by officials, who were worried the ground would further collapse, Japanese news agency Kyodo News reported on 10 February. In December 2024, the body of Elizabeth Pollard, 64, was found in a sinkhole in Pennsylvania. The grandmother was last seen searching for her cat Pepper in the village of Marguerite, about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh, before she was found days later where a sinkhole had recently opened up above an area where coal was mined 70 years prior. Sinkholes are also not uncommon in China. In 2020, nine people died after a sinkhole swallowed an entire bus outside a hospital in the city of Xining, in Qinghai province. Another 17 people were injured in the event. And in 2010, a giant sinkhole opened up in Guatemala City, caused by the rains of Tropical Storm Agatha and making for some jaw-dropping pictures."

        "Content": "Leading figures from the world of horseracing joined hundreds of mourners at the funeral of Irish jockey Michael O'Sullivan, who died after falling from his horse earlier this month. Racehorse trainer Willie Mullins and his son, jockey, Patrick Mullins, and former jockey Ruby Walsh, were among those at the service at John the Baptist Church in Glantane, in County Cork, on Wednesday. O'Sullivan, 24, died in hospital on Sunday from injuries he suffered in a fall at Thurles Racecourse in County Tipperary on 6 February.   Priest Father Gerard Coleman said the jockey lived life to the full in a requiem mass, adding that he packed more into his 24 years than most people do in two lifetimes. O'Sullivan had maturity beyond his years, he said, and a \"tremendous understanding\". \"He understood his horses and that's why he was such a great rider. But he also understood people and that is why he made a lasting impression on everyone and won the hearts of the Irish people,\" said Father Coleman. \"Everyone loved him. He was an incredibly talented and dedicated sportsman and will never be forgotten.\" The jockey was riding the horse Wee Charlie, for trainer Gerard O'Leary, when he sustained the fatal injuries. He was one of three fallers at the final fence in a two-mile handicap chase at Thurles and the rest of the meeting was abandoned. He was airlifted to the intensive care unit at Cork University Hospital, where he died surrounded by his family in the early hours of Sunday. O'Sullivan shot to prominence on the opening day of the 2023 Cheltenham Festival, headlined by his Supreme Novices' Hurdle win on Marine Nationale, just months after turning professional. His coffin was brought to the church from his home in nearby Lombardstown. Young members of the Duhallow Pony Club formed a guard of honour as the cortege passed by in pouring rain.

The jockey's partner Charlotte spoke of her endless love for him in a poem she read to the church. After the funeral, a horse led the procession to St John's Cemetery for the burial. A minute's silence was held at the afternoon meetings at Ludlow and Doncaster."

        "Headline": "A sinkhole in the Surrey village of Godstone has led to evacuations, disrupted water supplies and the declaration of a major incident. It is not the first sinkhole to have opened up in the UK and around the world in the last few months, so what's causing them?",
        "Content": " A major incident has been declared in a village in Surrey after a large sinkhole opened up. At least one garden in Godstone has been swallowed by the hole - which is believed to measure up to 62ft (19m) - and around 30 homes have been evacuated. Carl Bussey, assistant director of safer communities at Surrey County Council, said on Wednesday that the site continues to be \"assessed by structural experts, in order to manage the risk and understand what needs to be done to make safe and repair\". What actually caused the hole to open up, remains unknown.  Provider SES Water said the sinkhole caused a water pipe to burst, leading to some residents losing their supply - which have now all been restored. Residents in the area are no strangers to sinkholes, having also experienced one in 2019 - albeit this was only \"slight\" and did not cause the same extent of damage. The most recent Surrey sinkhole also occurred mere months after a large sinkhole appeared in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, which ate up the driveway of former Love Island winner Liam Reardon's family home. Back in September last year, AFC Wimbledon had to postpone a Carabao Cup third-round rematch after severe flooding caused what appeared to be a large sinkhole on the pitch at Cherry Red Records Stadium. So what is causing these sinkholes, and why have more seemingly started to appear in the UK?  What is a sinkhole? Sinkholes are often saucer-shaped holes that occur as the result of a collapse or removal of an underlying layer of rocks that is used to support the materials on the surface, the British Geological Survey (BGS) says. The shape of a sinkhole depends on the composition of the rocks underneath the surface and the different interacting processes taking place, according to the BGS. Sinkholes that result from the removal of a soluble rock such as chalk, gypsum or limestone are called solution sinkholes. Streams or rivers that enter a sinkhole and disappear underground are known as shallow holes. What causes a sinkhole? \"The main trigger for sinkholes is water,\" Dr Clive Edmonds, a geotechnical specialist who has studied sinkholes for 30 years, told The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). He said in 90% of cases, water saturating the ground is the main cause of collapse. Dr Edmonds adds that geology is also a main factor in the development of a sinkhole. The more soluble the rock, the more likely a sinkhole is to occur. Soluble rocks that are broken down by water form karst, a type of landscape that is characterised by sinkholes and underground caves. Building works, changes in water table level and mining can also trigger sinkholes, the BGS says. Commenting specifically on Godstone, Dr Philip Collins, deputy dean at Brunel University's College of Engineering, said the land immediately west of where the sinkhole appears was formerly used as a sand quarry. \"Sand can be strong when compacted as the particles are packed together, but weak when it becomes wet, and particularly if there is a lot of water under pressure,\" he said, suggesting the local geology contributed to the formation of the sinkhole. He added that in this case the sinkhole appears to have been caused by a \"washout of soil from beneath the road as a result of a burst water mains\". \"This burst would have pumped a large volume of water into the soil in a short period of time, overcoming its strength and turning it to a slurry which was then washed away. It isn't clear where the soil went yet, but it is likely to have gone into the sewers, which may cause problems elsewhere,\" he said. Andrew Farrant, a regional geologist for the BGS agreed. He said the \"cross-bedded sands\" and \"weakly cemented sandstones\" that Godstone is build upon are \"prone to erosion and flushing by running water\". But adds that this would normally not be a problem \"unless there is a sudden change in the hydrogeology, for example by digging a large hole below the local water table or due to a sudden ingress of water, from say a burst pipe, or heavy rainfall or flooding. \"It is probable that a burst water main has flushed out weak sandstone bedrock, creating a void which has then collapsed,\" Mr Farrant said. He noted the \"actual cause\" of the sinkhole cannot be defined without further information. SES Water, which provides water in the area, maintains the burst main was caused after the sinkhole occurred and not the other way around. Tandridge district council confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that there are \"historical sandpits in the area\" and the southern building control partnership has visited the site to establish homes around the sinkhole are structurally sound. What areas of the UK are prone to sinkholes? The BGS says most sinkholes are relatively small and occur in upland or rural areas. Areas like the Mendip Hills in Somerset, parts of Wales, the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales are susceptible because they are built on Carboniferous limestone - a hard sedimentary rock made largely of calcium carbonate. The most sinkhole-susceptible area in the UK, is the Permian gypsum deposits of northeast England, particularly around Ripon, the BGS says. Sinkholes also occur over salt deposits, commonly in areas such as Cheshire. While on the west coast of Scotland, parts of Assynt are prone to sinkholes due to the underlying Cambrian Durness Limestone. Can you predict or prevent a sinkhole? Often the first indicators of a sinkhole are dips and depressions on ground surfaces, Dr Edmonds told The Institution of Civil Engineers. When these leaks and cracks fill with water it can potentially lead to buildings moving, leaks in water mains or sewer water leaking on to the ground. Geobear, a ground and structural engineering company based in the UK, says strengthening the ground in high-risk areas prone to sinkholes may help to prevent them from opening up. They do that by injecting geopolymer resin into the affected area, which binds with the soil and allows properties to withstand any sinkholes far more effectively. The company adds that homeowners worried about sinkholes forming can help prevent them by calling professionals, installing proper drainage systems and planting vegetation around a property to help absorb rainwater run off, instead of it collecting in pools. Not just a UK problem... Sinkholes are not just a problem in the UK, and recent examples from across the globe show just how dangerous the phenomena can be. At the beginning of the year, a rescue mission was launched in Yashio, Japan, after a truck and its driver were swallowed by a swimming pool-sized sinkhole. Aerial footage shown by local broadcaster Nippon TV showed at least 12 fire engines trying to free the driver, who was reportedly trapped in his vehicle after it filled with sand and mud. The search went on for two weeks before being called off by officials, who were worried the ground would further collapse, Japanese news agency Kyodo News reported on 10 February. In December 2024, the body of Elizabeth Pollard, 64, was found in a sinkhole in Pennsylvania. The grandmother was last seen searching for her cat Pepper in the village of Marguerite, about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh, before she was found days later where a sinkhole had recently opened up above an area where coal was mined 70 years prior. Sinkholes are also not uncommon in China. In 2020, nine people died after a sinkhole swallowed an entire bus outside a hospital in the city of Xining, in Qinghai province. Another 17 people were injured in the event. And in 2010, a giant sinkhole opened up in Guatemala City, caused by the rains of Tropical Storm Agatha and making for some jaw-dropping pictures."

Mr Sarwar, a close ally of the Sir Keir, was speaking to Sky News ahead of his party's conference in Glasgow this weekend - which the prime minister is expected to attend.

Mr Sarwar said: \"There's no secret there have been challenges in the last seven months, but there hasn't really been a focus on what the choice is in May 2026 and that fundamental choice in 2026 is going to be more decline, more incompetence with the SNP. \"I've been really open with Keir in private and in public that my objective, my plan of course was to help get rid of the Tories, of course was to help elect a UK Labour government - but my ambition was to use the general election as a stepping stone to electing a Scottish Labour government here in 2026, and I'm still confident that is exactly what will happen. \"I have proven the pollsters and the pundits and the commentators wrong many times over the last four years, and I'm confident that we'll prove them wrong again.\" Read more:Starmer confronts reality of Trump and Putin's emerging new world order Scottish Labour has been heavily criticised over its handling of the impending closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery this summer.

Some 400 workers, who face unemployment, have started receiving their redundancy notices in recent weeks as the political promises fail to come to fruition. Asked repeatedly by Sky News whether it was a \"mistake\" to make pledges that could not be delivered, Mr Sarwar said: \"Look. I'm deeply frustrated about this. \"We need further action both, and let me emphasise this, not just from the Scottish government, it requires more urgent action from a UK Labour government too.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give the Ukrainian president his backing after Donald Trump called him a \"dictator\". A Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir called Mr Zelenskyy this evening and shared his support for him \"as Ukraine's democratically elected leader\". The prime minister \"said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II\", the statement continued. He also \"reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression\".  Politics Live: Johnson responds to Trump's 'shock' Ukraine claims In a post on X about the call, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"The United Kingdom's role in fortifying Europe's defense and security is important for us.\" \n                  Why all roads lead through Riyadh - as Saudi Arabia emerges as key global power broker\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer meets Trump - but how does he prepare?\n                 The \"UK's support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens\", he added. The call was held after Mr Trump took aim at the Ukrainian president in a post on his Truth Social platform. It is likely the war of words will come up again when Sir Keir meets Mr Trump in Washington next week, to discuss security and Ukraine. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had been under pressure to condemn Mr Trump's attacks, earlier said Mr Zelenskyy \"is not a dictator. He is the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin's illegal invasion\". However, she said that Mr Trump \"is right that Europe needs to pull its weight - and that includes the UK\". She added: \"We need to get serious. The PM will have my support to increase defence spending - there is a fully funded plan to get to 2.5% sitting on his desk. \"That should be the bare minimum. Starmer should get on with it, get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\" Labour has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, from about 2.3% now, but there is no timeline as to when. This week Ms Badenoch admitted the Tories tried to increase the funding to 3% while they were in office but there \"wasn't enough money to do so\". It comes against the backdrop of a war of words between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, after officials from the US and Russia met in Saudi Arabia for talks to end the war - without representatives from Kyiv or Europe present.

In response, Mr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday the American leader is living in a \"disinformation space\" created by Russia, which has repeatedly sought to blame Ukraine for the war.  Mr Trump has since hit back, saying Mr Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" and branding him a \"dictator\". Mr Zelenskyy was elected as president of Ukraine in May 2019. Elections were previously scheduled to go ahead in 2024, but they were not held as a result of martial law being in place. Ex-PM: Trump's comments intended to 'shock Europeans into action' Ms Badenoch's remarks come after reports that Tory MPs wanted her to take a stand on Ukraine since Mr Trump's interventions. Ukraine latest: Trump calls Zelenskyy a 'dictator ' Europe is scrambling to respond to a US shift in foreign policy - with Mr Trump making clear that Washington no longer sees the defence of the continent as its primary concern. Earlier on Wednesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when the war began, claimed Mr Trump's statements are \"not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action\". He asked when Europeans will \"stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?\" However on the other end of the political spectrum, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that \"calling Mr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' must be where the line is drawn\". \"It is my sincere hope that the whole political spectrum in the United Kingdom will speak with one voice in opposition to Trump's lies.\" However defence secretary John Healey earlier reacted to the US president's claim that Ukraine started the war. The cabinet minister told reporters on a visit to Norway, near the border with Russia: \"Three years ago, one country illegally invaded another, and since then, the Ukrainians have been fighting for their freedom. \"They've been fighting for their future, and they still are. So whilst all the focus may be on talks, not even negotiations, our concern as defence ministers is that we're not jeopardising the peace by forgetting about the war.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n       It is now the \"most dangerous\" time to be a Muslim living in the UK, a monitoring organisation has told Sky News. Tell Mama, which tracks anti-Muslim hatred, also said Islamophobic incidents have reached a record level. It said 5,837 reports of anti-Muslim hate were made in 2024 - the most it has received in a single year. The figure compares to 3,767 in 2023 and 2,201 in 2022, according to the organisation. This is a rise of 165% in two years. It also said Islamophobic assaults surged by 73% in 2024 - with men targeted more than women. In a new report, Tell Mama said that specific events, including the Southport stabbings, the UK general election, the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 in 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza contributed to the \"notable spikes\". The latter, it said, resulted in \"record levels of reports\" - including over 2,000 cases in the first 100 days following October 7. The impact of Israel's assault on Gaza \"has left some people questioning their safety and sense of belonging in the UK\", the report added. Tell Mama said that anti-Muslim hate and extremism \"continue to be on a sharp upward trend in our country\". Its report said: \"We cannot and should never be complacent or dismissive of anti-Muslim hate as some social and political commentators are. \"Nor should we forget the very basic fact that Muslim communities should never be dehumanised or marginalised because of their identity.\" Read more on Sky News:Female British journalist missing in BrazilBanking giant confirms plans to axe UK jobsLarge sinkhole forces closure of Surrey street In response to these figures, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) told Sky News that it is \"deeply troubled\" by the sharp increase of Islamophobic assaults in 2024 - describing it as \"an unprecedented crisis culminating in last summer's violent riots\". The MCB warned: \"Our decision makers face a stark choice: ignore this hatred or confront it properly.\" The council is calling on the government to tackle \"anti-Muslim bigotry\" through a \"comprehensive national strategy\", and on everyday Britons to \"stand together\" against this \"alarming trend\" of anti-Muslim violence. A government spokesperson has described Tell Mama's report findings as \"extremely concerning\". They said: \"Attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society. \"We will seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs. \"We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms.\""

Officials from the White House and the Kremlin have this week begun holding discussions in Saudi Arabia. The decision for the talks to take place without representatives from Kyiv or Europe has caused concern, and sparked an emergency meeting of European leaders in France earlier this week. Mr Trump's latest comments - in which he also calls Mr Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\" - come after the Ukrainian president accused him of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\" as a result of his administration's discussions with Kremlin officials.  Ukraine latest: Follow updates as Putin makes peace talks claim In a post on his social media platform TruthSocial, the US president said Mr Zelenskyy had \"talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn't be won, that never had to start\". \"The only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle',\" he added. Mr Trump continued: \"Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left. \"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. \"Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going.\" \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues,\" he wrote. Mr Trump later repeated his comments in a rambling speech to a Saudi-run investment forum in Miami. Top end estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have died in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Millions of Ukrainians have fled their country as refugees. Mr Trump also repeated his claim that the Ukrainian president has low approval ratings - which has already been dismissed by Mr Zelenskyy as Russian disinformation - and claimed American aid money had been misused. The latest poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in early February, found 57% of Ukrainians trust their leader. Ukraine's general election, scheduled for April 2024, were delayed because of Russia's invasion in February 2022.  Speaking after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Zelenskyy called for pragmatism from the US. He said in his nightly address: \"We are standing strong on our own two feet. I am counting on Ukrainian unity, our courageâ€¦ on the unity of Europe and the pragmatism of America.\" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the US president labelling Mr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" is \"false and dangerous\", German newspaper Spiegel reported. \"It is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy his democratic legitimacy,\" Mr Scholz said. Putin: 'No one is excluding Ukraine from talks'  Mr Trump's latest post comes after Vladimir Putin insisted Kyiv could have a seat at the negotiating table. The Russian president said earlier on Wednesday: \"No one is excluding Ukraine from peace talks.\" \"We are ready, I have already said this a hundred times - if they want, please let these negotiations take place and we will be ready to return to the table,\" he said.

View from Ukraine by Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor With Donald Trump openly attacking him, Ukraine's president is dispensing with the diplomatic niceties towards a crucial partner and is instead fighting back. It is a risky move given the heavy reliance of Volodymyr Zelenskyy on American military support to fight Russia's invasion and the US leader's dislike of criticism. But the past week of disruptive, strongman diplomacy from the White House - upending traditional assumptions about US support for European and Ukrainian security - has clearly been too much for Kyiv to stomach without speaking back, and bluntly. Mr Zelenskyy used a press conference inside the presidential compound on Wednesday to say the American commander in chief is surrounded by a circle of disinformation after Mr Trump falsely claimed Ukraine was to blame for Russia's war and that Mr Zelenskyy has a public approval rating of just 4%.  The US president is pushing for elections in Ukraine - something that would be very difficult to conduct while the country is still under Russian missile and drone attack and with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fighting on the frontline. \n                  Why all roads lead through Riyadh - as Saudi Arabia emerges as key global power broker\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer backs 'democratically elected' Zelenskyy after Trump 'dictator' jibe at Ukrainian leader\n                 Mr Zelenskyy said the most recent surveys showed 57% of the population supported him - a similar rating to Mr Trump. He also issued his strongest criticism yet of an attempt by the Trump administration to make Kyiv sign away half of the wealth it has from rare minerals and other natural resources - equal in value to about $500bn. Mr Zelenskyy said he could not \"sell our state\", adding this was not a \"serious\" conversation. But he knows that he does need to have serious dialogue with Washington even after President Trump picked up the phone to Vladimir Putin a week ago, kicking off a thawing of ties between Moscow and Washington that led to a meeting of top US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and plans for a summit between the American and Russian presidents. A first step will be engaging with Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general currently Mr Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning - though was curiously absent from the Saudi Arabia talks despite his job title. Ukraine's president said he will talk with Mr Kellogg and would like to take him to visit the frontline and speak to soldiers to understand their view, while also talking to members of the public in the capital to hear what they have to say about the war, Mr Zelenskyy's efforts and also the comments by Mr Trump. The envoy, speaking to a small group of journalists when he stepped on the train, said he was there to listen and report back to Mr Trump.  Asked how confident he was that he would be able to bring Mr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, Mr Kellogg said: \"I'm always confident.\" The coming days will tell whether that confidence is well placed. Read more:Trump's diplomacy does not look good for UkraineTrump 'disappointed' by Ukraine's reaction to talks View from Russia by Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent Volodymyr Zelenskyy had the appearance of a beleaguered leader who knows he is now fighting a war on two fronts - against Russian forces on the ground and against American assaults over the airwaves. Ukraine's leader looked almost shell-shocked from Donald Trump's verbal volleys last night, in which the US president accused Kyiv of starting the war. What has been Ukraine's biggest supporter now suddenly poses an existential threat. But for now, Mr Zelenskyy is fighting back. He accused Mr Trump of being \"trapped in a disinformation bubble\" - that he has not just drunk the Kremlin's Kool-Aid, but is now bathing in it. He pushed back on Mr Trump's spurious claims of only having a 4% approval rating, calling it propaganda from Russia. Moscow has repeatedly tried to portray Mr Zelenskyy as an illegitimate leader, due to his term expiring under martial law. In reality, his numbers are similar to Mr Trump's, which should resonate with a man who became obsessed with TV ratings during his first term. But it seems that facts do not always matter now to the White House. And he was extremely dismissive - to the point of ridicule, almost - of the proposed US/Ukraine mineral deal. \"Not a serious conversation\", he said, rejecting Mr Trump's business-first approach. Mr Zelenskyy still wants the focus on Ukraine's scorched earth, not rare earths. His messages and manner are in stark contrast to those of Vladimir Putin. Ever since the US election in November, the Russian president has sought to flatter Mr Trump, sympathise with him and be deferential, even when responding to barbs. And in Riyadh yesterday, Moscow began reaping the rewards. But Mr Zelenskyy's position is different, of course. Once the man of the moment, he's now struggling to stay relevant - in danger of being run down by the Donald Trump deal-making juggernaut. For now, he's standing in the road trying to stop it. But any hope that it will change course or hit the brakes may be misplaced."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n At the Faena Hotel on Miami Beach, at breakfast, I overheard the conversation on the next table. \"Trump is creating instability,\" one man said to the other, who disagreed. It was a good natured but forthright debate that cut to the heart of a global divide right now about the language and actions of the world's most powerful man. The two men were guests at a Saudi-run investment forum taking place over the next three days here in Miami. The Future Investment Initiative (FII) is sometimes described as 'Davos in the desert'. The principal conference takes place every year in Saudi Arabia. It's run by the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund and describes itself as \"an annual event bringing people together to invest in the most promising solutions\". This Miami event is an offshoot of the Riyadh conference and it draws the very wealthiest from the world of finance, tech, innovation, politics, philanthropy and beyond. \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer backs 'democratically elected' Zelenskyy after Trump 'dictator' jibe at Ukrainian leader\n                 \n                  Starmer meets Trump - but how does he prepare?\n                 I recognised one of the men at breakfast as a billionaire philanthropist. I'll protect his identity given his conversation was private. But, safe to say, Mr Trump is the talk of the conference. The seminars over the next three days - or 'invite-only conclaves' as they are described - hit all the notes of the moment. \"Do states own the oceans?\", \"The end of multilateralism and what it means for the world\", \"How to create resilient economies for uncertain times\", and \"Is a new era of US-Middle East economic cooperation dawning?\" were among the topics being discussed. That last event bills Trump's point man/dealmaker for the Middle East (and Russia-Ukraine), Steve Witkoff as the main speaker. The moderator is Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the man who first raised the prospect of a 'Gaza Riviera'. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The first speaker at the event was the American president himself. Donald Trump is determined to see massive Saudi investment in America to the tune of $1trn (Â£794bn). In return, he is investing in Riyadh too. Saudi Arabia, the host of this glitzy event, has emerged as a key global power broker. The Tuesday Russia-US talks were in Riyadh. The expected Trump-Putin meeting will be there too. Since Donald Trump was last president, the kingdom has matured and emboldened its geopolitical clout. Back in his first term, Mr Trump recognised the value (literally) in Saudi Arabia. This time, Saudi Arabia is harnessing Mr Trump's power. They know money talks and that he likes to be kept close. Saudi Arabia is playing a strategic geopolitical game and it's plainly transactional. Essentially, it is saying \"we want to invest, we want you to, but we also have our own agenda in regional diplomacy\". On the Middle East, Saudi red lines over Gaza and the prospects of Arab diplomatic normalisation with Israel are a backstop to a total Trump-Netanyahu wipeout of the Palestinians. More from Sky News:Starmer backs ZelenskyyUkraine is 'fighting on two fronts'Trump 'disappointed' by Ukraine On Ukraine-Russia, the Saudis are more than happy to host as mediators. It puts them centre stage. On Iran, they have buried the hatchet with the supreme leader and could play a key role in any new nuclear deal. There was a time when the diplomatic roads ran through the obvious places; Washington, London, Brussels, Berlin, Paris. Now, it's Florida and Saudi Arabia. Brussels, London, Berlin, Paris and even the opposition in Washington are wholly left out."

        "Content": "The tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh has been found for the first time since Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922. In what has been dubbed a \"remarkable discovery\", the tomb of Thutmose II, the last missing royal tomb of the 18th dynasty, was found in the Western Valleys of the Theban Necropolis in Egypt. The tomb was uncovered by a joint British-Egyptian mission, about 1.5 miles west of the Valley of the Kings in Luxor's western mountain region. Objects recovered from the mission included fragments of alabaster jars (used to store perfumes, oils, and ointments) inscribed with the name Pharaoh Thutmose II, as well as inscriptions bearing the name of his wife Queen Hatshepsut - who became one of Egypt's few female pharaohs who ruled in her own right. For the first time ever, funeral furniture belonging to the pharaoh was found, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. No funeral furniture of Thutmose II currently exists in any museum worldwide. The mission was formed by the New Kingdom Research Foundation (NKRF), a British independent academic foundation, and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, a project affiliated to the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge. \"This discovery solves a great mystery of Ancient Egypt: the location of the tombs of the early 18th dynasty kings,\" said mission leader and field director Piers Litherland. \"The tomb of this ancestor of Tutankhamun had never been found because it was always thought to be at the other end of the mountain near the Valley of the Kings. \"Initially we thought we might have found the tomb of a royal wife, but the wide staircase and the large doorway suggested something more important. \"The discovery that the burial chamber had been decorated with scenes from the Amduat, a religious text which is reserved for kings, was immensely exciting and was the first indication that this was a king's tomb.\" Thutmose II died 3,500 years ago. He is believed to have ruled for around 14 years, from about 1493 to 1479 BCE, and fathered one child, Thutmose III. Read more from Sky News:Odds of asteroid hitting Earth rise againFather 'very concerned' as British journalist missing in BrazilPope Francis 'jokes around' with Giorgia Meloni Mohamed Abdel Badi, head of the Egyptian antiquities sector and co-leader of the mission, said the tomb was discovered in a poor state due to flooding that occurred shortly after the pharaoh's death. Archaeological evidence suggests the contents were moved to a second tomb due to the flood. Mohsen Kamel, assistant field director, said: \"The possible existence of a second, and most likely intact, tomb of Thutmose II is an astonishing possibility.\""

        "Content": "The risk of the 2024 YR4 asteroid hitting Earth at the end of 2032 has increased again, according to NASA data. Latest calculations have shown a 3.1% chance of the space rock making impact in just under eight years. It is a significant change since the European Space Agency (ESA) estimated in January there was 1.2% chance of a direct hit. More recent calculations showed the odds had fallen 2.3%. In comparison, astronomers say the chance of winning big on the lottery is about one in 14 million. The increased odds mean the asteroid - which is around the size of a football pitch - is the most threatening to Earth in modern asteroid forecasting and would cause \"severe damage\" to a region if it makes impact. Scientists continue to stress there is no need for alarm and that the odds of an impact will fluctuate. They are working to gather a better understanding of the asteroid's trajectory. NASA and the ESA's Webb Space Telescope will observe the asteroid for a few more weeks before it disappears from view as it heads towards Jupiter. It will not be able to be viewed again until 2028.  NASA calculations show possible 'risk corridor' Data also currently shows if the rock enters the Earth's atmosphere on 22 December 2032, it is likely to head along a large central belt of our planet and over numerous major cities. Estimates say the rock would travel \"somewhere\" along a \"risk corridor\" above areas which are home to millions of people - but NASA data does not currently say which cities and major towns would be in this zone. NASA scientists said: \"In the unlikely event that 2024 YR4 is on an impact trajectory, the impact would occur somewhere along a risk corridor which extends across the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia.\" Asteroids are space rocks that scientists believe are the leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago.

The Pope is said to have been reading newspapers and doing some work from his hospital room during his stay. Concerns have been growing about the pontiff's increasingly frail health. Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. Pilgrims arriving at the Vatican this week have offered their prayers that the Pope would recover soon.

She's gay with a Sri Lankan partner, the film-maker Sarah Bossard. And Ms Weidel, the leader of a party that obsesses about its love for Germany, is not even a full-time resident of the country. Instead, she splits her time between Berlin and Switzerland, along with her partner and their two sons. What's more, she's a West German at the top of the AfD, which is, and has always been, far stronger in East Germany. In a party that is often accused of harbouring extremists, she comes across as more reasoned and less obsessive. Ms Weidel, it is said, is the AfD's key to reaching Germans from three crucial areas - the middle classes, the politically unsure, and the country's West. But it would be wrong to consider her a moderate. She may have joined the AfD because of its economic policies, but she has enthusiastically endorsed the party's move to focus more on migration and German nationalism. Immigrants, she once said, were made up of \"burqas, girls in headscarves, knife-wielding men on government benefits and other good-for-nothing people\".

She describes herself as a \"liberal conservative\" but, when I saw her speak at her party conference earlier this year, she demanded the \"large scale repatriation of foreigners\" - a policy once seen as toxic, but now spelt out by her in syllables - \"re-mi-gra-tion\", Ms Weidel said, emphatically, to the sound of cheers.  Ms Weidel, a gay parent, has endorsed the definition of a family as being specifically mother, father and children. She says legalising gay marriage is unimportant. She has claimed that Germany is the real victim of the war in Ukraine, due to the economic damage it has, and will, suffer. The war, she said, \"is not our issue at all\" and claims that, when it ends, Ukraine should be held to account. Ms Weidel was born in Gutersloh, a town of around 100,000 people roughly halfway between Dortmund and Hanover, where she said she was repeatedly insulted and abused by immigrants from the Middle East. She studied in Germany's east, in Bayreuth, then worked for Goldman Sachs and the Bank of China, spending six years living in China.

Only recently, grudgingly, has she accepted it is no longer practical for Germany to stop using the Euro as its currency, but her Euroscepticism remains. The past of her country and her own family sit over her role as the AfD's leader. Ms Weidel's grandfather, Hans Weidel, was a Nazi judge, appointed by Adolf Hitler, a fact of which she claims to have been oblivious until researchers revealed it to her. During a live chat with Elon Musk, since viewed millions of times online, she claimed the Nazis were \"not right-wing\" and said Hitler was \"a communist, socialist guy\". In fact, Hitler loathed communists and socialists; they were some of the first people sent to concentration camps. She has questioned the point of Covid vaccines, doubted the evidence of global warming and echoed the \"great replacement\" theory of so many conspiracy theorists.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" as peace talks between the US and Russia continue â€“ without Ukraine at the table. Officials from the White House and the Kremlin have this week begun holding discussions in Saudi Arabia. The decision for the talks to take place without representatives from Kyiv or Europe has caused concern, and sparked an emergency meeting of European leaders in France earlier this week. Mr Trump's latest comments - in which he also calls Mr Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\" - come after the Ukrainian president accused him of living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space\" as a result of his administration's discussions with Kremlin officials.  Ukraine latest: Follow updates as Putin makes peace talks claim In a post on his social media platform TruthSocial, the US president said Mr Zelenskyy had \"talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn't be won, that never had to start\". \"The only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle',\" he added. Mr Trump continued: \"Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left. \"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. \"Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going.\" \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues,\" he wrote. Mr Trump later repeated his comments in a rambling speech to a Saudi-run investment forum in Miami. Top end estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have died in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Millions of Ukrainians have fled their country as refugees. Mr Trump also repeated his claim that the Ukrainian president has low approval ratings - which has already been dismissed by Mr Zelenskyy as Russian disinformation - and claimed American aid money had been misused. The latest poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in early February, found 57% of Ukrainians trust their leader. Ukraine's general election, scheduled for April 2024, were delayed because of Russia's invasion in February 2022.  Speaking after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Zelenskyy called for pragmatism from the US. He said in his nightly address: \"We are standing strong on our own two feet. I am counting on Ukrainian unity, our courageâ€¦ on the unity of Europe and the pragmatism of America.\" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the US president labelling Mr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" is \"false and dangerous\", German newspaper Spiegel reported. \"It is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy his democratic legitimacy,\" Mr Scholz said. Putin: 'No one is excluding Ukraine from talks'  Mr Trump's latest post comes after Vladimir Putin insisted Kyiv could have a seat at the negotiating table. The Russian president said earlier on Wednesday: \"No one is excluding Ukraine from peace talks.\" \"We are ready, I have already said this a hundred times - if they want, please let these negotiations take place and we will be ready to return to the table,\" he said. More from Sky News:Analysis: Ukraine is fighting war on two frontsTrump 'disappointed' by Ukraine  Referencing Mr Zelenskyy's 2022 decree that rejected talks with Moscow, he added: \"The Europeans have stopped contacts with Russia. The Ukrainian side has forbidden itself to negotiate.\" According to the Russian leader, the \"goal and subject\" of Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia \"was the restoration of Russia-US relations\". Mr Zelenskyy is expected to meet later with Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Russia launches assault on Odesa Overnight, Russian forces launched a drone attack on Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa, injuring four people including a child, Mr Zelenskyy said.

        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent  Ukraine's president appears to be fighting a war on two fronts - against Russian forces on the ground and against American assaults over the airwaves. View from Ukraine by Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor With Donald Trump openly attacking him, Ukraine's president is dispensing with the diplomatic niceties towards a crucial partner and is instead fighting back. It is a risky move given the heavy reliance of Volodymyr Zelenskyy on American military support to fight Russia's invasion and the US leader's dislike of criticism. But the past week of disruptive, strongman diplomacy from the White House - upending traditional assumptions about US support for European and Ukrainian security - has clearly been too much for Kyiv to stomach without speaking back, and bluntly. Mr Zelenskyy used a press conference inside the presidential compound on Wednesday to say the American commander in chief is surrounded by a circle of disinformation after Mr Trump falsely claimed Ukraine was to blame for Russia's war and that Mr Zelenskyy has a public approval rating of just 4%.  The US president is pushing for elections in Ukraine - something that would be very difficult to conduct while the country is still under Russian missile and drone attack and with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fighting on the frontline. \n                  Why all roads lead through Riyadh - as Saudi Arabia emerges as key global power broker\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer backs 'democratically elected' Zelenskyy after Trump 'dictator' jibe at Ukrainian leader\n                 Mr Zelenskyy said the most recent surveys showed 57% of the population supported him - a similar rating to Mr Trump. He also issued his strongest criticism yet of an attempt by the Trump administration to make Kyiv sign away half of the wealth it has from rare minerals and other natural resources - equal in value to about $500bn. Mr Zelenskyy said he could not \"sell our state\", adding this was not a \"serious\" conversation. But he knows that he does need to have serious dialogue with Washington even after President Trump picked up the phone to Vladimir Putin a week ago, kicking off a thawing of ties between Moscow and Washington that led to a meeting of top US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and plans for a summit between the American and Russian presidents. A first step will be engaging with Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general currently Mr Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning - though was curiously absent from the Saudi Arabia talks despite his job title. Ukraine's president said he will talk with Mr Kellogg and would like to take him to visit the frontline and speak to soldiers to understand their view, while also talking to members of the public in the capital to hear what they have to say about the war, Mr Zelenskyy's efforts and also the comments by Mr Trump. The envoy, speaking to a small group of journalists when he stepped on the train, said he was there to listen and report back to Mr Trump.  Asked how confident he was that he would be able to bring Mr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, Mr Kellogg said: \"I'm always confident.\" The coming days will tell whether that confidence is well placed. Read more:Trump's diplomacy does not look good for UkraineTrump 'disappointed' by Ukraine's reaction to talks View from Russia by Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent Volodymyr Zelenskyy had the appearance of a beleaguered leader who knows he is now fighting a war on two fronts - against Russian forces on the ground and against American assaults over the airwaves. Ukraine's leader looked almost shell-shocked from Donald Trump's verbal volleys last night, in which the US president accused Kyiv of starting the war. What has been Ukraine's biggest supporter now suddenly poses an existential threat. But for now, Mr Zelenskyy is fighting back. He accused Mr Trump of being \"trapped in a disinformation bubble\" - that he has not just drunk the Kremlin's Kool-Aid, but is now bathing in it. He pushed back on Mr Trump's spurious claims of only having a 4% approval rating, calling it propaganda from Russia. Moscow has repeatedly tried to portray Mr Zelenskyy as an illegitimate leader, due to his term expiring under martial law. In reality, his numbers are similar to Mr Trump's, which should resonate with a man who became obsessed with TV ratings during his first term. But it seems that facts do not always matter now to the White House. And he was extremely dismissive - to the point of ridicule, almost - of the proposed US/Ukraine mineral deal. \"Not a serious conversation\", he said, rejecting Mr Trump's business-first approach. Mr Zelenskyy still wants the focus on Ukraine's scorched earth, not rare earths. His messages and manner are in stark contrast to those of Vladimir Putin. Ever since the US election in November, the Russian president has sought to flatter Mr Trump, sympathise with him and be deferential, even when responding to barbs. And in Riyadh yesterday, Moscow began reaping the rewards. But Mr Zelenskyy's position is different, of course. Once the man of the moment, he's now struggling to stay relevant - in danger of being run down by the Donald Trump deal-making juggernaut. For now, he's standing in the road trying to stop it. But any hope that it will change course or hit the brakes may be misplaced."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n At the Faena Hotel on Miami Beach, at breakfast, I overheard the conversation on the next table. \"Trump is creating instability,\" one man said to the other, who disagreed. It was a good natured but forthright debate that cut to the heart of a global divide right now about the language and actions of the world's most powerful man. The two men were guests at a Saudi-run investment forum taking place over the next three days here in Miami. The Future Investment Initiative (FII) is sometimes described as 'Davos in the desert'. The principal conference takes place every year in Saudi Arabia. It's run by the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund and describes itself as \"an annual event bringing people together to invest in the most promising solutions\". This Miami event is an offshoot of the Riyadh conference and it draws the very wealthiest from the world of finance, tech, innovation, politics, philanthropy and beyond. \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer backs 'democratically elected' Zelenskyy after Trump 'dictator' jibe at Ukrainian leader\n                 \n                  Starmer meets Trump - but how does he prepare?\n                 I recognised one of the men at breakfast as a billionaire philanthropist. I'll protect his identity given his conversation was private. But, safe to say, Mr Trump is the talk of the conference. The seminars over the next three days - or 'invite-only conclaves' as they are described - hit all the notes of the moment. \"Do states own the oceans?\", \"The end of multilateralism and what it means for the world\", \"How to create resilient economies for uncertain times\", and \"Is a new era of US-Middle East economic cooperation dawning?\" were among the topics being discussed. That last event bills Trump's point man/dealmaker for the Middle East (and Russia-Ukraine), Steve Witkoff as the main speaker. The moderator is Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the man who first raised the prospect of a 'Gaza Riviera'. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The first speaker at the event was the American president himself. Donald Trump is determined to see massive Saudi investment in America to the tune of $1trn (Â£794bn). In return, he is investing in Riyadh too. Saudi Arabia, the host of this glitzy event, has emerged as a key global power broker. The Tuesday Russia-US talks were in Riyadh. The expected Trump-Putin meeting will be there too. Since Donald Trump was last president, the kingdom has matured and emboldened its geopolitical clout. Back in his first term, Mr Trump recognised the value (literally) in Saudi Arabia. This time, Saudi Arabia is harnessing Mr Trump's power. They know money talks and that he likes to be kept close. Saudi Arabia is playing a strategic geopolitical game and it's plainly transactional. Essentially, it is saying \"we want to invest, we want you to, but we also have our own agenda in regional diplomacy\". On the Middle East, Saudi red lines over Gaza and the prospects of Arab diplomatic normalisation with Israel are a backstop to a total Trump-Netanyahu wipeout of the Palestinians. More from Sky News:Starmer backs ZelenskyyUkraine is 'fighting on two fronts'Trump 'disappointed' by Ukraine On Ukraine-Russia, the Saudis are more than happy to host as mediators. It puts them centre stage. On Iran, they have buried the hatchet with the supreme leader and could play a key role in any new nuclear deal. There was a time when the diplomatic roads ran through the obvious places; Washington, London, Brussels, Berlin, Paris. Now, it's Florida and Saudi Arabia. Brussels, London, Berlin, Paris and even the opposition in Washington are wholly left out."

Krystena Murray, from Savannah, Georgia, gave birth to a healthy boy in December 2023 after deciding to try to have a child with the help of a sperm donor. After the birth, she knew there had been a mistake as the baby was black, while she and the donor were white. Ms Murray said she contacted the clinic, Coastal Fertility Specialists, and found out doctors had implanted another patient's embryo in her instead of her own. She said the baby's biological parents were notified and they demanded custody. Ms Murray voluntarily gave up custody of the then five-month-old boy to avoid a legal battle as part of a situation she said had left her \"emotionally and physically broken\". She said: \"My child was ultimately taken from me as the clinic had implanted into my womb an embryo from a stranger. I've never felt so violated.\" After handing the child over in a court, she told Sky's US partner network NBC News: \"I walked in a mum with a child and a baby who loved me and was mine and was attached to me, and I walked out of the building with an empty stroller and they left with my son.\" Ms Murray's lawsuit, which has been filed at a court in Georgia, says the clinic's \"extreme and outrageous\" mistake caused her to be \"turned into an unwitting surrogate, against her will, for another couple\". She said: \"The situation has left me emotionally and physically broken. \"I grew him, I raised him, I loved him. I saw no different than if he were mine, my own genetic embryo.\" Coastal Fertility Specialists, which runs an in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) clinic in Savannah and four others in neighbouring South Carolina, said in a statement to NBC News that it was an \"isolated event\" and apologised for \"an unprecedented error that resulted in an embryo transfer mix-up\".

That was, until last Friday afternoon when an email landed in his inbox, from a person he had never heard of, notifying him that his position had been terminated. Olek is one of about 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees to be fired suddenly. They are the latest victims of Elon Musk's \"move fast and break things\" approach to national government. \"I'm traumatised,\" Olek says. \"Why am I a target?

I ask what Olek would say to Musk if he had the opportunity. \"I'd like to tell him, come look at my bathrooms here and tell me if I'm essential or not,\" he says. \"I cleaned these toilets, armed with nothing but a putty knife and a pumice stone.\" National Parks are considered by many to be America's crown jewels.

They are taking pictures of the valley from the tunnel view outlook. \"I'm crestfallen,\" says Christopher, an urban ecologist and professor at the University of California. \"I think the folks that are making the cuts certainly aren't the ones that are coming here. If you see what we see, it's really hard to make the cuts because it just equates to money. But there is no money that can replace this,\" he says, gesturing to the vista. Danielle says the cuts are short-sighted. \"The discouraging thing is trying to explain to your kids why the billionaires don't see it from our perspective as everyday people,\" she says. \"How do you convince people, that don't understand, that this matters? And that we're actually doing ourselves a disservice when we think these greenspaces are not a part of our own lives.\" But others disagree.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Lawyers for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs say the rapper has been subject to a \"racist\" prosecution and are seeking to dismiss one of the criminal charges against him. In a court filing seen by Sky News, the 55-year-old's legal team say he \"has been singled out because he is a powerful black man\" and is being prosecuted \"for conduct that regularly goes unpunished\". Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution, in September 2024. He has pleaded not guilty, said his sexual relationships were consensual, and strenuously denied allegations of wrongdoing. His lawyers have now filed the motion to dismiss the transportation charge. \"This case is unprecedented in many ways, but perhaps most notably, and most disturbingly, no white person has ever been the target of a remotely similar prosecution,\" the court document states. It goes on to list his achievements as an \"extraordinarily successful artist, businessman, philanthropist and one of the most accomplished black people in this country\". However, \"like many other celebrities\", Combs has had \"complicated relationships with significant others as well as with alcohol and drugs throughout his time in the spotlight\", his lawyers say. \"But that doesn't make him a racketeer, or a sex trafficker.\" The rapper's legal team claims there \"has never been a similar prosecution\" under the Mann Act, the federal law the count falls under, which is also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act. They allege the US government has \"concocted\" its case based on allegations Combs would sometimes bring escorts into his relationships. \"No other person, and certainly no white person, has ever previously been prosecuted under the White-Slave Traffic Act for hiring male escorts from another state,\" their court filing states. They also allege the government's handling of the case \"demonstrates bias\", and add that during the investigation of Combs, his home was raided with \"utterly unnecessary military-level force\".

In September, Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs' lawyers, told US entertainment site TMZ he believed the US government had made the case \"as a takedown of a successful black man\". Prosecutors addressed the comments in a subsequent court hearing, US media reported in October, saying Mr Agnifilo had \"baselessly accused the government of engaging in a racist prosecution\", and that this risked prejudicing potential jurors. Combs' trial is currently set to begin in May."

On Tuesday, Pearce spoke about the 1997 film LA Confidential, choking up while alleging Spacey had pursued him while they were shooting the Oscar-winning film. He told The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast: \"I was sort of scared of Kevin because he's quite an aggressive man. \"He's extremely charming and brilliant at what he does... but I was young and susceptible, and he targeted me, no question.\" Pearce, 57, did not describe details of the alleged encounters but said he had a \"couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\" since filming LA Confidential.

You are not a victim.\" Spacey then posed a series of questions to Pearce: \"Did you also, by the way, tell the press that a year after we shot LA Confidential you flew to Savannah, Georgia - while I was shooting Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil - just to spend time with me?\" He then asked: \"Did you tell the press that too?

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of the only suspect ever to be charged with the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur, almost 30 years after his death, has been postponed for almost a year. During a short hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said she had little choice but to reschedule given new developments presented by Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis' lawyers. Davis, 61, was charged with Tupac's murder in September 2023 and has been in jail since his arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and his trial has already been pushed back twice, from June to November 2024, and then to March this year. Now, the case has been rescheduled for February 2026. \"It looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\" Judge Kierny said. Davis, a former Los Angeles gang leader, agreed when asked by the judge if he was okay with moving the trial by such a long time. His defence team argue it has been so long since the shooting that more time is needed for thorough investigations to ensure a fair trial. They filed a motion last week calling for the trial to be delayed, saying a private investigator had identified witnesses who could testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting. They also say they have witness information that Shakur was in stable condition while in hospital, and that they are consulting medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death. How did Tupac die? Shakur was shot in a drive-by in Las Vegas on the night of 7 September 1996. The rapper was sitting in the passenger seat of a BMW being driven by Marion \"Suge\" Knight, the founder of his record label, Death Row Records, when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them at a red light and shots were fired. Both men were taken to hospital. Knight was wounded, but Shakur died six days later. While Davis is not accused of being the gunman, he is accused of orchestrating the shooting. In Nevada, you can be charged with a crime, including murder, if you help someone commit the crime. Davis has previously claimed publicly in interviews and in a book published in 2019 that he was in the car involved. However, his court filings say any descriptions he has given in recent years were \"done for entertainment purposes and to make money\". In his memoir, Davis implicated his nephew, Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, a member of the South Side Compton Crips gang, saying he was one of two people in the backseat. Anderson, a known rival of Shakur, had been involved in a casino brawl with the rapper shortly before the shooting. Anderson, who denied any involvement, died in an unrelated gang shoot-out two years later.

Knight is now in jail for an unrelated crime in the Los Angeles area in 2015. Shakur, who was 25 when he died, is regarded as one of the most influential rappers of all time, known for hits including Dear Mama, Keep Ya Head Up, California Love, I Ain't Mad At Cha, and Changes. His killer has never been formally identified, and the case has been regarded as one of the world's most infamous unsolved murders."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Hundreds more high street jobs will be lost this week after Quiz Clothing, the troubled fashion retailer, called in administrators. Sky News understands that the company, which was listed until recently on the London Stock Exchange, will see the closure of 23 of its shops, with about 200 employees expected to be made redundant. Quiz, which is chaired by the former JD Sports chief Peter Cowgill, has appointed the insolvency practitioner Teneo as administrator to Zandra Retail, which operates Quiz's standalone stores in the UK and Ireland, after weeks of talks about a rescue deal. The transaction is expected to be structured as a pre-pack administration, with the remaining assets being acquired by Orion Retail, a subsidiary of the company controlled by the founding Ramzan family. Orion will hold the right to trade from 42 outlets previously occupied by Zandra. One rival bidder said they understood that Teneo and the buyers had worked to preserve as many jobs as possible, with the majority understood to have been salvaged. Sky News reported last month that Quiz Clothing traded from roughly 60 standalone stores and dozens more concessions, employing about 1,500 people. \n                  Inflation rises to a high not seen in nearly a year - official figures\n                 \n                  Money blog: Holiday company issues warning over rising costs\n                 \n                  Big chains like Wetherspoons will be able absorb extra costs - but frustrations at government are palpable \n                 QUIZ's online business, concessions and international operations are operated by other Group subsidiaries and are unaffected by this announcement. Sheraz Ramzan, CEO of Quiz, said in a statement issued to Sky News: \"The board took the difficult decision to appoint administrators to Zandra Retail Limited in light of the continuing challenging trading conditions impacting the Group's performance. \"We are deeply sorry to those affected by the store closures, including our retail colleagues. \"However, this decision will put the business in a more sustainable footing for the future and protect several hundred jobs as a result.\" Quiz's main lender, HSBC, had recently hired restructuring experts at Interpath to advise it. Quiz's troubles come amid growing financial pressure on retailers, many of which are facing a deepening challenge in 2025 as a result of looming hikes to employers' national insurance contributions. In recent weeks, Sky News has revealed that: WH Smith was in talks to sell its entire high street chain, numbering 500 stores and about 5,000 employees; Poundland's parent has hired advisers to assess options for the leading discount chain; Lakeland, the family-owned kitchenware retailer, has been put up for sale; and that The Original Factory Shop was being sold to Modella Capital. Gavin Maher, Joint Administrator, said: \"Although the sale has resulted in the transfer of a number of jobs, it has been necessary to make redundancies. \"We appreciate that this is a difficult and uncertain time for all involved and are communicating appropriately with all employees, customers and stakeholders.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Inflation has risen a surprising amount - to the highest in nearly a year - official figures show. This means prices are rising even more than at any time since last March, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for January. The consumer price index (CPI) ticked up steeply to 3% from 2.5% a month earlier. A lower rise to 2.8% was forecast by economists polled by Reuters and by the Bank of England. The rise has come from more expensive transport and food and non-alcoholic beverages costs. Flight prices did not fall as much as usual for this time of year. Meat, bread and cereals in particular became more expensive while an increase in private school fees was another factor, as new VAT rules meant prices rose nearly 13%. What does it mean for interest rates? Inflation is now higher above the Bank of England's 2% target and will make interest rate cuts less likely. Traders are pricing in an 82% chance of no rate cut at its March meeting. Two more rate cuts are still expected this year.  But there are some signs that could be welcomed by the rate-setters at the Bank. Coming in below forecast was services inflation, impacted by rising wages, which rose to 5%, rather than the anticipated 5.2%. The closely watched core inflation measure - which excludes volatile food and energy prices - increased as expected to 3.7%, up from 3.2% in December. Just the start More inflation rises are anticipated throughout the year. Last month, the Bank of England predicted it would reach 3.7% by the end of the year. But economic research firm Pantheon Macro said a 4% reading later this year \"is far from out of the question\". Responding to the figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Since the election, we've seen year-on-year wages after inflation growing at their fastest rate - worth an extra Â£1,000 a year on average - but I know that millions of families are still struggling to make ends meet. \"That's why we're going further and faster to deliver economic growth.\""

Though those same companies are also clear it will mean likely price rises for customers, fewer people being hired and fewer pubs or shops opening in the future. Many smaller businesses are equally clear it may force them to close altogether.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The industrial veterans who turned Melrose Industries into one of Britain's most prominent public companies are targeting a $2bn (Â£1.59bn) takeover of a US-based manufacturer of wire harnesses. Sky News has learnt that Rosebank Industries, which floated on the London stock market last summer, has identified Electrical Components International (ECI) as its first major acquisition. Talks with ECI's owner, Cerberus Capital Management, are understood to have been taking place for some time, according to banking sources. A person close to the talks cautioned on Wednesday, however, that a deal was not certain to be finalised. Rosebank is not yet thought to have formally sounded out new or existing investors about raising the equity financing that would be required to fund a deal, they added. If the deal's enterprise valuation is in the region of $2bn, that would leave Rosebank needing to raise roughly Â£1.5bn from the sale of new shares and new debt financing. The London-listed vehicle is understood to have other acquisition targets in its sights if the ECI deal does not materialise. Cerberus has owned Missouri-based ECI since 2018. The company operates dozens of production facilities and distribution centres globally, and its products are used in home appliances, as well as across the agriculture and construction industries. Read more:Inflation rises to a high not seen in nearly a yearThames Water multi-billion pound debt lifeline approved If confirmed, the transaction would be the latest to be struck by some of Britain's most prolific corporate dealmakers. Simon Peckham, the former Melrose chief who is now CEO of Rosebank, launched the new vehicle last year after months of deliberations about whether to structure it as a private or listed company. His former Melrose colleagues, Justin Dowley and Christopher Miller are also on the board of Rosebank. Their \"buy, improve, sell\" mantra saw them acquire a string of industrial assets at Melrose, the most notable of which was GKN, the historic British engineering group. That was then broken up, and Dowlais, its former automotive arm, has just agreed to be taken over by an American rival. Among the other industrial names that Melrose acquired were Nortek, Dynacast, and Elster. It was the Â£8bn takeover of GKN in 2018 which thrust Mr Peckham and his colleagues into the public spotlight, however, as the target company fought a bitter, and ultimately unsuccessful, battle for its independence. Rosebank has told investors that it will employ the same approach to executive remuneration as the one that saw Melrose's top team receive windfalls worth hundreds of millions of pounds over two decades. It has also said that once its first acquisition is identified and executed, it intends to move to the main London market. That would deliver a boost for the City at a time when companies - the latest of which is the mining giant Glencore - are weighing moving their listing to other exchanges in search of a higher valuation. A Rosebank spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n Inflation is rising faster than expected but the latest data is unlikely to shift the Bank of England's stance on interest rates. The headline rate of inflation hit 3% in January, up from 2.5% the previous month and higher than the 2.8% forecast by economists and the Bank of England. It's expected to go even higher, hitting 3.7% later in the year and moving even further away from the Bank's 2% target. Policymakers are hopeful that we are in a \"hump\" and that inflation will fall back to target. The latest increase was driven by a bigger-than-expected surge in airfares because of an erratic comparison with the same period last year and a VAT rise on private school fees. The Bank won't be too concerned about that. It will also look through increases in food prices, which can be volatile.  Core CPI inflation, which strips out the volatility by excluding food as well as energy, rose from 3.2% to 3.7%. That was in line with forecasts. Services inflation, which gives a better indication of underlying price pressures in the domestic economy, rose from 4.4% to 5%. That was lower than the Bank of England's 5.2% forecast. It means the Bank is likely to continue its measured approach to monetary policy. Although inflation is above target, weak economic growth has been weighing heavily on the minds of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). It's a balancing act. Two MPC members voted for a large 50 basis point interest rate cut this month. While the Bank is unlikely to cut again next month it is still expected to push through another two interest rate cuts this year. The Bank will have to hold its nerve. Wages are growing at their fastest pace in three years and rising energy prices will drive inflation higher this year, but the Bank expects the headline rate to then start falling. Weak economic growth should weigh on wages, taking the heat out of price pressures. That is the Bank's reading of the situation, but the last few years have shown us that the \"inflation tiger\" can be an unpredictable beast and the geo-political risks continue to abound, particularly the US president's tariffs policy. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The risks are pointed towards higher than expected inflation this year. \"We think the MPC would be 'brave' to keep cutting rates quarterly with wage growth around 6% year-over-year - at least double the rate consistent with inflation at target - stalling rather than collapsing jobs, and inflation well above 3%. \"We look for two more rate cuts this year, in May and November.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give the Ukrainian president his backing after Donald Trump called him a \"dictator\". A Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir called Mr Zelenskyy this evening and shared his support for him \"as Ukraine's democratically elected leader\". The prime minister \"said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II\", the statement continued. He also \"reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression\".  Politics Live: Johnson responds to Trump's 'shock' Ukraine claims In a post on X about the call, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"The United Kingdom's role in fortifying Europe's defense and security is important for us.\" \n                  Why all roads lead through Riyadh - as Saudi Arabia emerges as key global power broker\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch breaks her silence on Ukraine â€“ finally\n                 \n                  Starmer meets Trump - but how does he prepare?\n                 The \"UK's support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens\", he added. The call was held after Mr Trump took aim at the Ukrainian president in a post on his Truth Social platform. It is likely the war of words will come up again when Sir Keir meets Mr Trump in Washington next week, to discuss security and Ukraine. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had been under pressure to condemn Mr Trump's attacks, earlier said Mr Zelenskyy \"is not a dictator. He is the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin's illegal invasion\". However, she said that Mr Trump \"is right that Europe needs to pull its weight - and that includes the UK\". She added: \"We need to get serious. The PM will have my support to increase defence spending - there is a fully funded plan to get to 2.5% sitting on his desk. \"That should be the bare minimum. Starmer should get on with it, get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\" Labour has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, from about 2.3% now, but there is no timeline as to when. This week Ms Badenoch admitted the Tories tried to increase the funding to 3% while they were in office but there \"wasn't enough money to do so\". It comes against the backdrop of a war of words between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy, after officials from the US and Russia met in Saudi Arabia for talks to end the war - without representatives from Kyiv or Europe present.

In response, Mr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday the American leader is living in a \"disinformation space\" created by Russia, which has repeatedly sought to blame Ukraine for the war.  Mr Trump has since hit back, saying Mr Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left\" and branding him a \"dictator\". Mr Zelenskyy was elected as president of Ukraine in May 2019. Elections were previously scheduled to go ahead in 2024, but they were not held as a result of martial law being in place. Ex-PM: Trump's comments intended to 'shock Europeans into action' Ms Badenoch's remarks come after reports that Tory MPs wanted her to take a stand on Ukraine since Mr Trump's interventions. Ukraine latest: Trump calls Zelenskyy a 'dictator ' Europe is scrambling to respond to a US shift in foreign policy - with Mr Trump making clear that Washington no longer sees the defence of the continent as its primary concern. Earlier on Wednesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when the war began, claimed Mr Trump's statements are \"not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action\". He asked when Europeans will \"stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?\" However on the other end of the political spectrum, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said that \"calling Mr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' must be where the line is drawn\". \"It is my sincere hope that the whole political spectrum in the United Kingdom will speak with one voice in opposition to Trump's lies.\" However defence secretary John Healey earlier reacted to the US president's claim that Ukraine started the war. The cabinet minister told reporters on a visit to Norway, near the border with Russia: \"Three years ago, one country illegally invaded another, and since then, the Ukrainians have been fighting for their freedom. \"They've been fighting for their future, and they still are. So whilst all the focus may be on talks, not even negotiations, our concern as defence ministers is that we're not jeopardising the peace by forgetting about the war.\""

Amid warnings of a Trump-Putin stitch-up that betrays President Zelenskyy, the Tory leader had been missing in action, even neglecting to mention Ukraine in a conference speech this week. Now she has spoken out, finally. But in a contradictory statement, she said President Trump was wrong to claim that Zelenskyy is a dictator but right that Europe needs to pull its weight. Politics latest - Lammy urged to call out Trump attack on Zelenskyy  Then she said that under successive prime ministers the Conservatives had, and always would, stand with Ukraine, whereas Starmer should boost defence spending and \"show some leadership\". Perhaps she was goaded into breaking her silence by the typically flamboyant words of one of those successive Tory prime ministers, Boris Johnson, and attacks by the Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Mr Johnson, a cheerleader for both President Zelenskyy and President Trump since he was PM, tried to have it both ways too, criticising the US president's wild claims but backing his motives. \"Trump's statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action,\" he said in a pithy statement on Trump buddy Elon Musk's X. But at least Mr Johnson came up with a sensible suggestion: unfreeze the hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets being blocked by Belgium, France and other counties. Quite why Ms Badenoch urged Sir Keir Starmer to \"get on a plane to Washington\", when the whole world knows he's getting on a plane to Washington next week, is anybody's guess. More from Sky News:Analysis: Ukraine is fighting war on two frontsTrump 'disappointed' by Ukraine Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and self-appointed chief Trump basher in UK politics, has accused both the Conservatives and Reform UK of being \"Trump boot-lickers\". Strong words, no doubt partly motivated by political point-scoring against political opponents. Yet he later said he hoped \"the whole political spectrum in the UK would speak \"with one voice\".  Good luck with that. To be fair to Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer, there has until now been a political consensus in the UK in support of President Zelenskyy and Ukraine. But with Kemi Badenoch playing catch-up, criticising the PM's leadership, and James Cleverly now claiming David Lammy's \"silence is deafening\", that consensus is in danger of fraying."

Mr Sarwar said: \"There's no secret there have been challenges in the last seven months, but there hasn't really been a focus on what the choice is in May 2026 and that fundamental choice in 2026 is going to be more decline, more incompetence with the SNP. \"I've been really open with Keir in private and in public that my objective, my plan of course was to help get rid of the Tories, of course was to help elect a UK Labour government - but my ambition was to use the general election as a stepping stone to electing a Scottish Labour government here in 2026, and I'm still confident that is exactly what will happen. \"I have proven the pollsters and the pundits and the commentators wrong many times over the last four years, and I'm confident that we'll prove them wrong again.\" Read more:Starmer confronts reality of Trump and Putin's emerging new world order Scottish Labour has been heavily criticised over its handling of the impending closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery this summer.

Some 400 workers, who face unemployment, have started receiving their redundancy notices in recent weeks as the political promises fail to come to fruition. Asked repeatedly by Sky News whether it was a \"mistake\" to make pledges that could not be delivered, Mr Sarwar said: \"Look. I'm deeply frustrated about this. \"We need further action both, and let me emphasise this, not just from the Scottish government, it requires more urgent action from a UK Labour government too.\""

        "Content": "By Darren McCaffrey, presenter   \"They were a little bit arrogant to start with... I think they are learning on the job.\" The obvious frustration of Sir Tim Martin, founder of Wetherspoons, at the government and its handling of the economy. And he's not alone. I've spoken to dozens of business leaders in recent months, many angry about tax increases on employers just around the corner, which alongside Wednesday's inflation is piling costs on businesses - many who fear they won't survive. \"Spoons\" will of course, as will the big supermarkets, be able to absorb the double whammy of employee national insurance increases and a hike in the minimum wage from April. Though those same companies are also clear it will mean likely price rises for customers, fewer people being hired and fewer pubs or shops opening in the future. Many smaller businesses are equally clear it may force them to close altogether. Read more:Inflation rises to a high not seen in nearly a yearThames Water multi-billion pound debt lifeline approved The frustration and anger is rooted, they argue, in the political choices that Labour made before the election. Maybe good political choices but bad economic ones. In order to win, Sir Keir Starmer ruled out tax increases for employees, on VAT, on income tax - what Labour branded \"no tax on hard-working people\". But in doing so - they've boxed themselves in, once in power. With the public finances in a pretty poor state - taxes had to go up and it was decided they would go up on those who employ people. At a time when economic growth is at the heart of what the government wants to achieve, business believes ministers have shot themselves in the foot, making growth more expensive and thus less likely."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n A Senedd committee has warned against making lying in politics a criminal offence. It comes after the Welsh government committed to introduce legislation which would ban members of the Welsh parliament from deliberately deceiving. But the Senedd's standards committee, which the government asked to look into the matter, has concluded that lying on purpose should not be criminalised. Former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price put forward his party's motion in July last year, arguing that trust in politicians had \"fallen to an all-time low\". But before it went to a vote, the Welsh government's then counsel general, Mick Antoniw, said the government was \"committed to the principle\" and said it would introduce legislation ahead of the next Senedd election in 2026. Concerns had been raised by some members on the impact of such proposals on parliamentary privilege.

The committee said the perceived risks included the \"considerable existing strain on the justice system\", the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights and the \"difficulties of proving that a statement is false\".

A Welsh government spokesperson said the committee had \"produced a detailed and thorough report into deliberate deception as part of its inquiry into member accountability\". \"We will now consider its findings and recommendations before responding formally,\" they added."

        "Content": "The tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh has been found for the first time since Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922. In what has been dubbed a \"remarkable discovery\", the tomb of Thutmose II, the last missing royal tomb of the 18th dynasty, was found in the Western Valleys of the Theban Necropolis in Egypt. The tomb was uncovered by a joint British-Egyptian mission, about 1.5 miles west of the Valley of the Kings in Luxor's western mountain region. Objects recovered from the mission included fragments of alabaster jars (used to store perfumes, oils, and ointments) inscribed with the name Pharaoh Thutmose II, as well as inscriptions bearing the name of his wife Queen Hatshepsut - who became one of Egypt's few female pharaohs who ruled in her own right. For the first time ever, funeral furniture belonging to the pharaoh was found, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. No funeral furniture of Thutmose II currently exists in any museum worldwide. The mission was formed by the New Kingdom Research Foundation (NKRF), a British independent academic foundation, and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, a project affiliated to the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge. \"This discovery solves a great mystery of Ancient Egypt: the location of the tombs of the early 18th dynasty kings,\" said mission leader and field director Piers Litherland. \"The tomb of this ancestor of Tutankhamun had never been found because it was always thought to be at the other end of the mountain near the Valley of the Kings. \"Initially we thought we might have found the tomb of a royal wife, but the wide staircase and the large doorway suggested something more important. \"The discovery that the burial chamber had been decorated with scenes from the Amduat, a religious text which is reserved for kings, was immensely exciting and was the first indication that this was a king's tomb.\" Thutmose II died 3,500 years ago. He is believed to have ruled for around 14 years, from about 1493 to 1479 BCE, and fathered one child, Thutmose III. Read more from Sky News:Odds of asteroid hitting Earth rise againFather 'very concerned' as British journalist missing in BrazilPope Francis 'jokes around' with Giorgia Meloni Mohamed Abdel Badi, head of the Egyptian antiquities sector and co-leader of the mission, said the tomb was discovered in a poor state due to flooding that occurred shortly after the pharaoh's death. Archaeological evidence suggests the contents were moved to a second tomb due to the flood. Mohsen Kamel, assistant field director, said: \"The possible existence of a second, and most likely intact, tomb of Thutmose II is an astonishing possibility.\""

        "Content": "The risk of the 2024 YR4 asteroid hitting Earth at the end of 2032 has increased again, according to NASA data. Latest calculations have shown a 3.1% chance of the space rock making impact in just under eight years. It is a significant change since the European Space Agency (ESA) estimated in January there was 1.2% chance of a direct hit. More recent calculations showed the odds had fallen 2.3%. In comparison, astronomers say the chance of winning big on the lottery is about one in 14 million. The increased odds mean the asteroid - which is around the size of a football pitch - is the most threatening to Earth in modern asteroid forecasting and would cause \"severe damage\" to a region if it makes impact. Scientists continue to stress there is no need for alarm and that the odds of an impact will fluctuate. They are working to gather a better understanding of the asteroid's trajectory. NASA and the ESA's Webb Space Telescope will observe the asteroid for a few more weeks before it disappears from view as it heads towards Jupiter. It will not be able to be viewed again until 2028.  NASA calculations show possible 'risk corridor' Data also currently shows if the rock enters the Earth's atmosphere on 22 December 2032, it is likely to head along a large central belt of our planet and over numerous major cities. Estimates say the rock would travel \"somewhere\" along a \"risk corridor\" above areas which are home to millions of people - but NASA data does not currently say which cities and major towns would be in this zone. NASA scientists said: \"In the unlikely event that 2024 YR4 is on an impact trajectory, the impact would occur somewhere along a risk corridor which extends across the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia.\" Asteroids are space rocks that scientists believe are the leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago.

In a court filing seen by Sky News, the 55-year-old's legal team say he \"has been singled out because he is a powerful black man\" and is being prosecuted \"for conduct that regularly goes unpunished\". Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution, in September 2024. He has pleaded not guilty, said his sexual relationships were consensual, and strenuously denied allegations of wrongdoing. His lawyers have now filed the motion to dismiss the transportation charge. \"This case is unprecedented in many ways, but perhaps most notably, and most disturbingly, no white person has ever been the target of a remotely similar prosecution,\" the court document states. It goes on to list his achievements as an \"extraordinarily successful artist, businessman, philanthropist and one of the most accomplished black people in this country\". However, \"like many other celebrities\", Combs has had \"complicated relationships with significant others as well as with alcohol and drugs throughout his time in the spotlight\", his lawyers say. \"But that doesn't make him a racketeer, or a sex trafficker.\" The rapper's legal team claims there \"has never been a similar prosecution\" under the Mann Act, the federal law the count falls under, which is also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act. They allege the US government has \"concocted\" its case based on allegations Combs would sometimes bring escorts into his relationships. \"No other person, and certainly no white person, has ever previously been prosecuted under the White-Slave Traffic Act for hiring male escorts from another state,\" their court filing states. They also allege the government's handling of the case \"demonstrates bias\", and add that during the investigation of Combs, his home was raided with \"utterly unnecessary military-level force\".

In September, Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs' lawyers, told US entertainment site TMZ he believed the US government had made the case \"as a takedown of a successful black man\". Prosecutors addressed the comments in a subsequent court hearing, US media reported in October, saying Mr Agnifilo had \"baselessly accused the government of engaging in a racist prosecution\", and that this risked prejudicing potential jurors.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of the only suspect ever to be charged with the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur, almost 30 years after his death, has been postponed for almost a year. During a short hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said she had little choice but to reschedule given new developments presented by Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis' lawyers. Davis, 61, was charged with Tupac's murder in September 2023 and has been in jail since his arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and his trial has already been pushed back twice, from June to November 2024, and then to March this year. Now, the case has been rescheduled for February 2026. \"It looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\" Judge Kierny said. Davis, a former Los Angeles gang leader, agreed when asked by the judge if he was okay with moving the trial by such a long time. His defence team argue it has been so long since the shooting that more time is needed for thorough investigations to ensure a fair trial. They filed a motion last week calling for the trial to be delayed, saying a private investigator had identified witnesses who could testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting. They also say they have witness information that Shakur was in stable condition while in hospital, and that they are consulting medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death. How did Tupac die? Shakur was shot in a drive-by in Las Vegas on the night of 7 September 1996. The rapper was sitting in the passenger seat of a BMW being driven by Marion \"Suge\" Knight, the founder of his record label, Death Row Records, when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them at a red light and shots were fired. Both men were taken to hospital. Knight was wounded, but Shakur died six days later. While Davis is not accused of being the gunman, he is accused of orchestrating the shooting. In Nevada, you can be charged with a crime, including murder, if you help someone commit the crime. Davis has previously claimed publicly in interviews and in a book published in 2019 that he was in the car involved. However, his court filings say any descriptions he has given in recent years were \"done for entertainment purposes and to make money\". In his memoir, Davis implicated his nephew, Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, a member of the South Side Compton Crips gang, saying he was one of two people in the backseat. Anderson, a known rival of Shakur, had been involved in a casino brawl with the rapper shortly before the shooting. Anderson, who denied any involvement, died in an unrelated gang shoot-out two years later.

Knight is now in jail for an unrelated crime in the Los Angeles area in 2015. Shakur, who was 25 when he died, is regarded as one of the most influential rappers of all time, known for hits including Dear Mama, Keep Ya Head Up, California Love, I Ain't Mad At Cha, and Changes. His killer has never been formally identified, and the case has been regarded as one of the world's most infamous unsolved murders."

Spacey was found not liable during the subsequent civil lawsuit. He was also accused of groping an 18-year-old at a Massachusetts bar in 2016. Charges were dropped in 2019 after the accuser refused to give evidence. In 2023, Spacey was also acquitted by a UK jury of sexually assaulting four men while working as the artistic director of London's Old Vic Theatre. Last week an additional civil lawsuit was filed in the UK against Spacey and London's Old Vic alleging sexual abuse. Spacey has consistently denied any accusations of sexual misconduct."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Runners at a 10k trail race in Glasgow were sent in the wrong direction by a prankster pretending to be a marshal and who buried arrow signs marking the course. Acorn Trails said about 30 of the 115 participants at the event on Sunday were sent on a 2.5km (1.5 mile) detour by the woman. Organisers Alex Osborne and Michelle Sinsheimer told Sky News it is \"hard to laugh off the incident\" as the prank led the runners away from medical help had it been needed. Mr Osborne said: \"It's hard to laugh off the incident when you consider the possible implications had things not panned out as lightly as they did. \"There's a fine line between it being a humorous prank and an incident had one of the runners, not all of whom were local, got more lost when their warm clothing, refreshments and first aid were at the finish line. \"I'd ask the saboteur, who we were told is female, to consider the above, which I'd like to think they hadn't thought of on Sunday.\" The competitors affected by the \"mischievous\" interference have been offered a 50% discount on their entry to the next event. \n                  Woman, 74, first to be charged in Scotland under abortion buffer zone law\n                 \n                  Inquiry begins into death of baby at Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow\n                 \n                  Pharmacist jailed for abusing two women during medical examinations\n                 The near 10k race starts and finishes at the old golf clubhouse within Linn Park following two laps of Castlemilk Woodland. Marshals had been positioned at several turning points, but the woman was able to direct runners towards Linn Park Bridge from an unmanned spot.

Mr Osborne said: \"We've never had issues before. Maybe the odd sign tossed into a hedge, but never a course alteration or pretending to be part of the event staff. \"In terms of stewards at future events, we rely on volunteers giving up their own time and can only deploy the people we have available. \"We target spots where we think runners might get lost and where they appreciate the vocal support our amazing hi-vis heroes provide. \"It's not practical to have marshals in the place of every arrow sign as that would require a huge volume of people.\" Acorn Trails hosts a number of events throughout the year, with both runners and volunteers invited to get involved."
