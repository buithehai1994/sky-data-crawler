        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n I have rarely seen Sir Keir Starmer angry.  He is a politician who keeps his emotions buttoned up - in public, at least. But he was clearly brimming with anger as he called US President Donald Trump out for his \"insulting and frankly appalling\" remarks over non-US troops that served in Afghanistan. Trump latest - prince joins condemnation Sir Keir had been in Chequers overnight after hosting his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, for bilateral talks over Greenland and NATO, coming back to Downing Street on Friday morning amid growing national fury over Mr Trump's disgraceful slur about NATO troops. The prime minister, in his strongest rebuke yet to Mr Trump, was highly critical of his claim that NATO troops in Afghanistan \"stayed a little off the front lines\". For the record, 1,160 non-US coalition soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, and thousands more were wounded, some suffering life-changing injuries. A total of 457 British troops died in combat alongside US forces. That Mr Trump casually belittled those sacrifices has provoked an outpouring of anger and universal condemnation. It is an insult not just to our forces, but to a relationship forged from common language, and exceptionally close cultural, political, military and economic ties over decades. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 In making such offensive remarks, on the heels of threats over sanctions and invasions of a Nato ally, the so-called special relationship is fast becoming a toxic one. For a prime minister, whose first job is the security of this nation and people, a fellow leader insulting his armed forces is a low blow, and I'm told that Mr Starmer wanted to make his position very clear and to speak up for the UK's armed forces. Up until now, he has only ever condemned Mr Trump's comments or actions as wrong. The spell has been broken His comments on Friday were a clear step change as he strongly criticised Mr Trump personally and suggested the US president should apologise. As for the fallout, Downing Street's approach will be to try to continue along as it was, sticking to Britain's principles and values and co-operating with the US on defence, security and intelligence. But there is no doubt that this past week has broken the spell. An increasingly toxic partner Mr Trump's increasingly erratic and outlandish behaviour has left Sir Keir with no other option than to shift away from an approach of 'Trump containment' to calling him out. In other circumstances, a prime minister who has made a great play of Trump management only to see relations sour so badly could be in the firing line. Where he has cover is in the universal condemnation of Mr Trump from all political leaders If anything, Sir Keir will come under more pressure to increase his hostility towards our increasingly toxic partner, the US. Read more on Sky News:Trump's comments 'insulting' - PMDavos was 'hijacked' by one man Allies of his were at pains to stress this is not the beginning of the end of the special relationship, but it is equally true that the events of the past week have made that bond feel far less stable. Sir Keir was already looking to deepen and tighten ties with Europe. After the behaviour of the Trump White House this week, he perhaps wants to turbocharge it."

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A former Tory councillor has pleaded guilty to drugging and raping his now ex-wife over more than a decade.  Philip Young, 49, admitted 48 offences relating to Joanne Young, who has waived her legal right to anonymity, between 2010 and 2024. The charges include multiple counts of voyeurism, sexual assault, rape and administering a substance with intent to stupefy Ms Young, 48, \"to enable himself or another to engage in sexual activity with her\". Ms Young, who divorced him after his arrest in 2024, sat in court on the opposite side of the dock dressed in a long-sleeved black top, supported by her sister and a witness support officer. Four other men denied committing sexual offences against Ms Young, while a fifth is yet to enter pleas. Young, who served as a Conservative Swindon borough councillor, in Wiltshire, between 2007 and 2010, stood in the dock wearing a grey sweater. He confirmed his name and date of birth before entering his guilty pleas to the following charges, which took almost 30 minutes for the clerk to read out. • 11 counts of rape• Seven counts of sexual assault by penetration• Four counts of sexual touching• 11 counts of administering a substance with intent to stupefy/overpower to allow sexual activity• 14 counts of voyeurism• Publishing obscene articles Some of the rape and other sexual offences were allegedly jointly committed with other men. One of the voyeurism charges relates to at least 200 occasions between 2010 and 2024, while he admitted publishing non-consensual intimate photographs and videos of his ex-wife on no fewer than 500 occasions. Young has denied eight other charges, including making indecent and prohibited images of children and possessing extreme pornography. Police described Young as a British national who moved to Enfield, north London, from Swindon, Wiltshire. He has been remanded in custody at Bullingdon prison. Young appeared in the dock alongside five other men, who are also accused of sexual offences against Ms Young. Norman Macksoni, 47, from Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, appeared wearing a dark blue suit and pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and possession of extreme images. Conner Sanderson Doyle, 31, from Swindon, who had his long hair tied back in a ponytail and was wearing a pale blue suit and dark shirt, denied charges of sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching. Richard Wilkins, 61, from Swindon, wore a dark blue hooded sweatshirt, and denied one count of rape and one count of assault by penetration. Mohammed Hassan, 37, from Swindon, stood in the dock dressed in a dark suit to plead not guilty to sexual touching. Dean Hamilton, 47, of no fixed abode, appeared in court wearing a pale sweater over a light pink shirt with sunglasses hung in his collar. He is yet to enter pleas to one count of rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual touching. 'Incredible bravery'  Judge Angela Morris, the Recorder of Winchester, released all five of the other men ahead of a trial, which is expected to take up to six weeks, from 5 October. James Foster, specialist Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, said: \"Philip Young has pleaded guilty to 48 serious sexual offences committed against his former wife, Joanne Young. \"We worked closely with Wiltshire Police to build a thorough and compelling case that resulted in him pleading guilty to dozens of offences today.\" Wiltshire Police Detective Superintendent Geoff Smith paid tribute to Joanne Young's \"incredible bravery\". He said: \"Today's hearing is a significant landmark, which has seen Philip Young admit to dozens of serious sexual offences against Joanne Young. \"I'd like to pay tribute to Jo for her incredible bravery throughout this process. She continues to be supported by specially trained officers.\" After the hearing, Wiltshire Police issued an appeal to trace another suspect - a man described as being of a large build, with scarring to the back of his head, prominent lips and a hairy body. He is balding with short or shaved hair, and has one distinctive tattoo on the left side of his chest, in images released by the force, which was taken around April to May 2022. DS Smith said: \"We appreciate the graphic nature of these images and that they may be triggering to some people, however we need the public's help to identify this man. \"It is unknown whether he lives in Swindon or from outside the county, which is why we request that this is shared as widely as possible to assist our bid to identify him.\""

        "Content": "Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators are taking part in the first trilateral talks since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The three-way security discussions in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, are part of efforts to reach a deal to end the war. The Kremlin confirmed the talks would take place but warned that long-lasting peace would not be possible unless territorial issues were resolved. It comes after three US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, held a four-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday, while Mr Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates Here's everything you need to know as representatives from the three countries come together for peace talks. How close is a peace deal? The US has held talks with Russia, and separately with Ukrainian and European leaders, over various different drafts of a peace plan. US envoy Mr Witkoff said as recently as Thursday that \"a lot of progress\" had been made and negotiations were down to one last issue. The main sticking point on any agreed deal remains territory. Russia continues to demand that Ukraine surrenders the roughly 20% (1,900 square miles) of Donetsk it has not taken on the battlefield - land that Mr Zelenskyy has refused to withdraw from. Donetsk is one of two eastern regions that comprise Donbas. Russian forces already control nearly all of the other region, Luhansk. The Russian leader told Mr Trump last year that he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in return for both Donetsk and Luhansk regions. After the latest meeting with Mr Trump, the Ukrainian leader said that the future status of land in eastern Ukraine currently occupied by Russia is unresolved but that peace proposals are \"nearly ready\". Russian foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, also said that it was reaffirmed by Mr Putin to the US envoys that \"reaching a long-term settlement can't be expected without solving the territorial issue\". Security guarantees Mr Zelenskyy added that he is also waiting for Mr Trump to agree a specific date and time to sign a deal on US security guarantees for Kyiv. He said the document is \"done\" but is yet to be signed. The document is also yet to be made public. The country has sought strong ‌security guarantees from allies to counter any renewed Russian aggression in the future. Mr Trump's draft 28-point peace plan to end the war specifically outlined that Ukraine would receive \"robust\" security guarantees. The UK and France have already committed to send some troops to Ukraine in \"military hubs\" in the event of a ceasefire, as part of the Coalition of the Willing. Will any leaders be at trilateral talks? Only delegations from each country will meet in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Ukraine said it would send its lead negotiator Rustem Umerov and Mr Zelenskyy's newly appointed chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, while Moscow has said it will send Admiral Igor Kostyukov to head its team at the UAE-based security talks. Mr Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is expected to hold separate talks on economic issues with US envoy Mr Witkoff. Military analyst Michael Clarke said those within Ukraine's delegation could do \"a lot of negotiating\". He described Mr Umerov as \"very skilled\" while Mr Budanov was described by a US source to Sky News' correspondent Sally Lockwood as the only one of Mr Zelenskyy's staff that the US takes \"really seriously\". On the other hand, Michael Clarke said Moscow has not sent a \"politically important\" team. Mr Kostyukov is head of Russia's military intelligence, but is sanctioned by both the US and EU because of alleged involvement in trying to rig the 2016 US presidential election. \"Russians are going for military specialists who won't have the authority to talk politics and the Ukrainians are going for a range of people,\" Clarke said. Have we been here before? Sky News' Sally Lockwood said the trilateral meeting marks \"a significant moment\" but added that it is \"important to keep hopes rather tempered, because of course, we have been here before\". In November, military officials from all three sides met in Abu Dhabi, although it remains unclear if all were in the same room at the same time. A significant meeting between Ukrainian and Russian government officials also took place in Turkey last May. There were hopes that the encounter might mark a turning point in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two, but in reality the meeting barely lasted two hours. Then again in August, a historic meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Alaska saw the two leaders discuss the possibility of Ukraine giving up territory in exchange for an end to the fighting, but no firm agreements came from it. Lockwood added that the latest peace talks are a wait and watch situation. She said the fast pace at which peace talks in Abu Dhabi were agreed to could indicate that each side have at least \"contemplated a compromise they might be willing to accept\" before meeting. Read more:Zelenskyy drops brutal truth bombs upon European alliesTrump's new gang shouldn't be underestimated What's happening on the frontline? While peace talks happen in Abu Dhabi, Moscow has shown no signs that it's willing to halt its bombings of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Overnight, Russia fired about 101 drones at Ukraine, 76 of which were shot down, while 19 struck 12 locations, according to Ukraine's air force. In the east of the country, four people, including a five-year-old child, were killed in a Russian overnight strike, the state emergency service said. Nearly 2,000 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital are also without heating after a Russian attack last week caused a blackout, according to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko. The EU has said it will deploy 447 emergency generators from its strategic reserves in Poland to try and curb freezing conditions for some of those affected. Kremlin aide Mr Ushakov said on Thursday night that until a diplomatic solution is achieved, Russia would \"continue to consistently pursue the objectives of the special military ‌operation\". \"This is especially true on the battlefield, where the Russian armed forces hold the strategic initiative.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Labour's high command is attempting to bounce Andy Burnham into a super-quick decision on a Commons by-election comeback, giving him just 24 hours to decide. The party has published a timetable, with the whole selection process being completed next Saturday, suggesting Labour could be planning a dash to the polls as early as next month. As the prime minister's popularity has plunged in opinion polls, allies have urged Mr Burnham - Labour's king of the north - to return to the Commons, potentially to seize Sir Keir Starmer's crown. Today he received a top endorsement when former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said Mr Burnham should be allowed to stand in the forthcoming by-election. But in an announcement at 5pm on Friday, the party's ruling national executive declared that he has only until 5pm on Saturday to seek permission to stand as a by-election candidate. That means he only has hours to make up his mind on a decision that will make or break his political career: whether to stand in the looming Gorton and Denton by-election, or wait for another opportunity. As well as the 24-hour ultimatum facing Mr Burnham, the rest of the timetable for the by-election is brutally short. Applications opened at 5pm on Friday and will close at midnight on Sunday night. A longlist of candidates, probably six, will be drawn up on Monday by a selection panel, shortlisting interviews will be held on Tuesday and hustings and selection will take place next Saturday. If Mr Burnham does apply and is selected, the constituency in Greater Manchester, where Mr Burnham has been mayor since 2017, is set to host the most high-profile box-office by-election in decades. Read more from Sky News:Trump should apologise over Nato claims, PM suggestsFormer Tory councillor admits drugging and raping ex-wifeCelebrities attend Valentino funeral The by-election has been triggered by the resignation on health grounds of former minister Andrew Gwynne, who was revealed last year to have sent racist and sexist WhatsApp messages. But although Labour is defending a majority of 13,413, and won more than 50% of the vote at the general election, Mr Burnham faces several hurdles and a \"stop Burnham\" campaign by allies of the prime minister. At Labour's conference last autumn, Mr Burnham faced a backlash from Starmer loyalists after criticising the government and claiming that he had been urged by Labour MPs to stand for leader. As well as a rule stating that elected mayors must seek the permission of the national executive before seeking nomination as a parliamentary candidate, Mr Burnham would have to quit as mayor. That would trigger a costly election for his successor, which Labour could lose, given the unpopularity of Sir Keir's government and the current surge in support for Reform UK and the Green Party. Also, if the national executive bows to pressure from a \"stop Burnham\" campaign, it could thwart Mr Burnham by imposing a women-only or black, Asian and minority ethnic-only shortlist. Another risk is that even if he is Labour's by-election candidate, he could lose. That would almost certainly mean the end of his political career, since there would be no second chance to challenge Sir Keir. In a by-election last year in Runcorn and Helsby, Reform UK, second in Gorton and Denton in 2024, overturned a Labour majority of 14,696 and won by a wafer-thin majority of just six votes. If he stands in Gordon and Denton, Mr Burnham could also be opposed by George Galloway, who defeated Labour in a 2024 by-election in Rochdale, and Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader."

The government has withdrawn a debate and votes in the House of Lords due on Monday in the latest round of parliamentary \"ping pong\" on the Chagos legislation. Welcoming the move, a jubilant shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel declared: \"This is a major victory for everyone standing against Keir Starmer's disgraceful Chagos surrender.\" Peers had been due to debate motions passed in the Commons on Tuesday overturning Lords amendments to the Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill.  Earlier this month, the Lords inflicted four defeats on the government over the bill, demanding stopping payments to Mauritius, a referendum, costings and a parliamentary veto. Last weekend, US President Donald Trump branded the deal \"an act of great stupidity\" and a sign of \"total weakness\", prompting Kemi Badenoch to taunt Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs: \"We didn't need President Trump to tell us that.

In response to the postponement of Monday's debate, Ms Patel posted on X: \"In the face of relentless Conservative pressure, Labour have pulled their shameful Chagos Surrender Bill from Monday's House of Lords order paper... The deal, which hands British sovereign territory and £35 billion to an ally of China, should be dropped altogether. \"The Conservatives will continue to fight the surrender every step of the way.\" Defending the Conservatives' determination to block the bill, shadow Foreign Office spokesman Lord Callanan said: \"We are carrying out our constitutional duty to scrutinise bad legislation. \"It is Labour that are irresponsible and reckless for asking Parliament to pass a bill that risks breaking international law. \"The government admitted they need to amend the 1966 Treaty with the USA on 22 December, but still haven't concluded that work. \"This bill, which will cost the British people £35 billion and fundamentally threatens our national security, cannot proceed.\" Read more:What is in the Chagos Islands deal and why is it controversial?Trump's Chagos broadside leaves Starmer walking thinner tightrope But the government denied it was in retreat, confirming Monday's withdrawal from Lords debates but insisting the business would be rescheduled. \"The government remains fully committed to the deal to secure the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, which is vital for our national security,\" a spokesperson told Sky News. \"This is irresponsible and reckless behaviour by peers, whose roles is to check legislation, not interfere with our national security priorities.\" Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app On the Conservative claim that the deal breaches international law, the spokesperson added: \"This is complete nonsense.

        "Content": "A former Olympic snowboarder accused of drug trafficking and setting up the murder of a federal witness, has been arrested, the head of the FBI has said. Ryan Wedding, a Canadian who competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, was held in Mexico on Thursday night, FBI director Kash Patel said. Wedding, 44, was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted fugitives list and the agency had offered a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Trump latest - Harry weighs in over Afghanistan 'sacrifice' As well as running a large-scale drug trafficking operation, authorities believe he organised several killings to further his alleged drug crimes. He was believed to have been living in Mexico for more than a decade under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel, while helping it funnel massive quantities of drugs into the US and Canada. Mr Patel and US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed his arrest on social media, with Mr Patel telling reporters at an airport near Los Angeles on Friday that Wedding was \"the largest narco trafficker in modern times\", comparing him to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Pablo Escobar. He said Wedding, who finished 24th in the parallel giant slalom, according to Olympic records, was being brought to the US. Wedding was charged in 2024 with running a drug ring that moved tons of cocaine each year in long-haul lorries between Colombia, Mexico, Southern California and Canada. Among the aliases he used were El Jefe, Public Enemy and James Conrad King, authorities said. In November, Ms Bondi said he had also been charged with setting up the killing of a witness in Colombia to help him avoid extradition to the US. He and his co-conspirators used a Canadian website called The Dirty News to post a photograph of the witness so he could be identified and killed, according to prosecutors. The witness was then followed to a restaurant in the city of Medellin and shot in the head in January.

He was convicted in the US of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to prison in 2010, but after being released, he returned to drug trafficking under the cartel's protection."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       He is the Lewisham-born actor who, at the age of 73, finds himself in the running for an Oscar. While Delroy Lindo can now reflect that being an Oscar nominee \"has a certain ring to it\", the Sinners star says he was taken by surprise at the news when it first broke. \"My son called me,\" he explains. \"I will not say I was asleep, but I was not fully awake, and I'm listening to my son very excitedly say how proud of me he was. \"And I then noticed on my phone I had 179 Text messages, so I knew that something was up.\"  While he says he is happy for viewers in the UK to \"absolutely\" root for him in the best supporting actor category on Oscars night, the Sinners star - who moved to the US in his teens - says he no longer considers himself a Brit. \"My career has been birthed and nurtured in America,\" said Lindo. \"I was born in Lewisham hospital, my family's from Jamaica, and my mom was part of the Windrush generation. I am British to that extent, that is my reality. \"[But] I thank God I came to America, that I went to acting school in America, that I was a New York-based theatre actor for 10 years before I started doing film, and I thank God Spike Lee saw me on Broadway.\" As an actor who has quietly built a career of elevating whatever project he's in, some of Lindo's most unforgettable work has been with Lee. In films like Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers and Da 5 Bloods, he's played men shaped by power, anger and history. While, arguably, the recognition is long overdue, his performance in Ryan Coogler's vampire horror Sinners is a stand-out one. His role as the world-weary blues musician Delta Slim is one of the most layered characters of the piece - and one of the most talked about moments in the Jim Crow-era horror is the monologue Lindo delivers about a friend who was lynched. \"I started hearing from audiences how that scene was resonating for them, and at that point I knew there was something of real value,\" he explains. \"The fact that Ryan gifted me that monologue in the car, that's really rich stuff for any actor to wrestle with.\" Read more from Sky News:Oscar nominations: The biggest snubs and surprisesOscar nominations 2026: The full list of stars and films Regardless of how many awards Sinners wins, with its record-breaking 16 nominations it has already made it into the Oscars history books.

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Donald Trump's claims British troops were not on the frontline in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\" - and suggested he should apologise. Veterans and their families, as well as MPs from all parties, have reacted with fury after the US president said NATO troops stayed \"a little off the frontlines\" in Afghanistan. In an interview with Fox News in Davos, Mr Trump repeated his criticism, saying he was not \"sure\" the military alliance would \"be there if we ever needed them\". He added: \"We've never needed them. They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.\" On Friday afternoon, Sir Keir said: \"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling. \"And I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.\" He added that if he had said something like that, he would \"certainly apologise\". Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Trump was \"wrong\" to diminish the role of NATO and British troops in Afghanistan. The prime minister's official spokesman said UK forces had served alongside the US and NATO in \"sustained combat operations\". Pointing to the 457 British deaths in Afghanistan and the \"many hundreds\" more who were wounded, he added: \"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.\" America is the only NATO member to have invoked the collective security provisions of its Article 5 clause - that an attack against one member is an attack on all. Trump's remarks 'the ultimate insult' Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries when his vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan in 2006, said the US president's comments were \"the ultimate insult\". Mr Parkinson is widely viewed as the most severely injured British soldier to have survived the war. The blast left the former lance bombardier with both legs amputated, a twisted spine and brain damage. His mother said: \"I can assure you, the Taliban didn't plant IEDs [improvised explosive devices] miles and miles back from the front line. \"Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads - 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation. \"To hear this man say: 'Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the front lines'... It's the ultimate insult.\" She said Sir Keir Starmer has \"got to stand up for his own armed forces and he's got to absolutely refute what Donald Trump said\". \"Call him out,\" she added. US correspondent Trump's words will be a gut punch for the families of the 1,160 non-American coalition soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.  It will be a gut punch too for the thousands more who were wounded fighting this war, many left without limbs. And it will be a gut punch to the soldiers of so many nations who stood up to fight alongside American soldiers on the frontlines and for whom not a day will pass without them thinking about their experiences in that war. Afghanistan was America's war. America's friends stood up and answered the call for support after 9/11. For over two decades America's allies would continue with that support in an increasing futile conflict. I spent time with British and Danish soldiers in Helmand Province in 2007. They were very much on the frontline. The Danish lost more soldiers in Afghanistan per capita than any other NATO nation. Battles in towns like Sangin, Musa Qala, Babaji and Nad Ali are etched in the memories of the many who were there and the many families of those who didn't come back. Britons remember what became a desperately sad routine: coffins draped in the Union flag passing through the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett as the fallen were repatriated and returned to their loved ones. 457 British service men and women died in Afghanistan. Trump dodged the draft for the Vietnam War five times. He was a student for four of his five call ups, allowing him to legally avoid the draft. And for the fifth call-up, he obtained a doctor's note for 'bone spurs'. Tap here to read Mark's full piece. 'We shed blood, sweat and tears' Defence minister Al Carns said: \"I served five tours in Afghanistan, many alongside my American colleagues. We shed blood, sweat and tears together. Not everybody came home. \"These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting the US, our shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\" The former commando, who served five tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry, said Mr Trump's comments were \"ridiculous\", adding: \"Many courageous and honourable service personnel from many nations fought on the front line. Many fought way beyond it.\" Robert Dicketts, whose son Oliver Dicketts, 27, was killed while serving with the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan in 2006, said: \"When I read it, I thought, 'What a bloody cheek!'. \"I think my thoughts about Donald Trump are probably unprintable. \"To put it politely, Donald Trump's knowledge of history is lacking considerably.\" 'Heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation' The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. The US saw 2,461 deaths. America's allies suffered 1,160 deaths during the conflict - around a third of the total coalition deaths. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.\" Trump is 'plainly wrong' Social care minister Stephen Kinnock also pointed to the fact that the only time NATO's Article 5 clause - a call for allies to come to a member's defence - had been activated \"was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11\". \"And many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European and NATO allies gave their lives in support of American missions, American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he said. \"I am incredibly proud of our armed forces. They have put their lives on the line for our country. They are the definition of honour and valour and patriotism - and anybody who seeks to criticise what they have done and the sacrifices they make is plainly wrong,\" Mr Kinnock added. Ben McBean lost two limbs while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan. The former commando said: \"If someone's speaking the truth, you don't mind, but when it's completely rubbish, it offends you. I was on the frontline every day that I was there. \"I have to live like this. I have to try and raise my family with these injuries. Things are difficult mentally, physically and emotionally, and to have someone who can't even fight sleep sit there and just say 'you guys were slightly further back', along with other nations, is offensive.\" 'We have always been there' Dame Emily Thornberry MP, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Trump's comments were \"an insult\" to the families of those who died and \"so much more than a mistake\". Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, Dame Emily said: \"How dare he say we weren't on the frontline, how dare he. \"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us; we have always been there.\" In a social media post, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey MP said: \"Trump avoided military service five times. \"How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed.\" Josh Babarinde, Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne, wrote in a post on X: \"[Donald Trump] can go f**k himself. \"Anyone who mocks, demeans or minimises the sacrifices of British troops is no friend of our nation.\" \"The US is a historic friend of the UK's - but not this guy,\" he said, referring to Mr Trump. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the sacrifice of British and other NATO troops deserved respect, not denigration, adding his comments were \"complete nonsense\" which could weaken the NATO alliance. \"I spoke to parents of young men who had lost their lives in Afghanistan, and I think it is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that,\" she said. Mrs Badenoch said there was \"too much careless talk from President Trump\" and \"we mustn't have these sort of throwaway comments that actually weaken the strong relationship between those countries in the alliance\". 'I saw the sacrifices made by British soldiers' Tory MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\". He said: \"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers I served alongside in Sangin, where we suffered horrific casualties, as did the US Marines the following year. \"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump promises Greenland 'deal' will be 'amazing' for USIs president's peace board a new UN or a gang of friends? Former UK ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Nicholas Kay told Sky News the US president was \"wrong\" and he \"clearly does not value and appreciate NATO in the same way he ought to\". \"The president is wrong. He is not known for his respect for other people, and he is not known for his accuracy with facts, and I'm afraid this is another example,\" he said. Last year, US vice president JD Vance hit back at claims of \"disrespecting\" British troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after suggesting a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine would be \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". At the time, only the UK and France had pledged troops to a potential peacekeeping force."

The government has withdrawn a debate and votes in the House of Lords due on Monday in the latest round of parliamentary \"ping pong\" on the Chagos legislation. Welcoming the move, a jubilant shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel declared: \"This is a major victory for everyone standing against Keir Starmer's disgraceful Chagos surrender.\" Peers had been due to debate motions passed in the Commons on Tuesday overturning Lords amendments to the Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill.  Earlier this month, the Lords inflicted four defeats on the government over the bill, demanding stopping payments to Mauritius, a referendum, costings and a parliamentary veto. Last weekend, US President Donald Trump branded the deal \"an act of great stupidity\" and a sign of \"total weakness\", prompting Kemi Badenoch to taunt Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs: \"We didn't need President Trump to tell us that. We've been saying that for 12 months.\" In Tuesday's Commons debate overturning the Lords amendments, rebel Labour MP Graham Stringer called on the government to pause the Chagos deal.

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n A former Tory councillor has pleaded guilty to drugging and raping his now ex-wife over more than a decade.  Philip Young, 49, admitted 48 offences relating to Joanne Young, who has waived her legal right to anonymity, between 2010 and 2024. The charges include multiple counts of voyeurism, sexual assault, rape and administering a substance with intent to stupefy Ms Young, 48, \"to enable himself or another to engage in sexual activity with her\". Ms Young, who divorced him after his arrest in 2024, sat in court on the opposite side of the dock dressed in a long-sleeved black top, supported by her sister and a witness support officer. Four other men denied committing sexual offences against Ms Young, while a fifth is yet to enter pleas. Young, who served as a Conservative Swindon borough councillor, in Wiltshire, between 2007 and 2010, stood in the dock wearing a grey sweater. He confirmed his name and date of birth before entering his guilty pleas to the following charges, which took almost 30 minutes for the clerk to read out. • 11 counts of rape• Seven counts of sexual assault by penetration• Four counts of sexual touching• 11 counts of administering a substance with intent to stupefy/overpower to allow sexual activity• 14 counts of voyeurism• Publishing obscene articles Some of the rape and other sexual offences were allegedly jointly committed with other men. One of the voyeurism charges relates to at least 200 occasions between 2010 and 2024, while he admitted publishing non-consensual intimate photographs and videos of his ex-wife on no fewer than 500 occasions. Young has denied eight other charges, including making indecent and prohibited images of children and possessing extreme pornography. Police described Young as a British national who moved to Enfield, north London, from Swindon, Wiltshire. He has been remanded in custody at Bullingdon prison. Young appeared in the dock alongside five other men, who are also accused of sexual offences against Ms Young. Norman Macksoni, 47, from Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, appeared wearing a dark blue suit and pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and possession of extreme images. Conner Sanderson Doyle, 31, from Swindon, who had his long hair tied back in a ponytail and was wearing a pale blue suit and dark shirt, denied charges of sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching. Richard Wilkins, 61, from Swindon, wore a dark blue hooded sweatshirt, and denied one count of rape and one count of assault by penetration. Mohammed Hassan, 37, from Swindon, stood in the dock dressed in a dark suit to plead not guilty to sexual touching. Dean Hamilton, 47, of no fixed abode, appeared in court wearing a pale sweater over a light pink shirt with sunglasses hung in his collar. He is yet to enter pleas to one count of rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual touching. 'Incredible bravery'  Judge Angela Morris, the Recorder of Winchester, released all five of the other men ahead of a trial, which is expected to take up to six weeks, from 5 October. James Foster, specialist Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, said: \"Philip Young has pleaded guilty to 48 serious sexual offences committed against his former wife, Joanne Young. \"We worked closely with Wiltshire Police to build a thorough and compelling case that resulted in him pleading guilty to dozens of offences today.\" Wiltshire Police Detective Superintendent Geoff Smith paid tribute to Joanne Young's \"incredible bravery\". He said: \"Today's hearing is a significant landmark, which has seen Philip Young admit to dozens of serious sexual offences against Joanne Young. \"I'd like to pay tribute to Jo for her incredible bravery throughout this process. She continues to be supported by specially trained officers.\" After the hearing, Wiltshire Police issued an appeal to trace another suspect - a man described as being of a large build, with scarring to the back of his head, prominent lips and a hairy body. He is balding with short or shaved hair, and has one distinctive tattoo on the left side of his chest, in images released by the force, which was taken around April to May 2022. DS Smith said: \"We appreciate the graphic nature of these images and that they may be triggering to some people, however we need the public's help to identify this man. \"It is unknown whether he lives in Swindon or from outside the county, which is why we request that this is shared as widely as possible to assist our bid to identify him.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Labour's high command is attempting to bounce Andy Burnham into a super-quick decision on a Commons by-election comeback, giving him just 24 hours to decide. The party has published a timetable, with the whole selection process being completed next Saturday, suggesting Labour could be planning a dash to the polls as early as next month. As the prime minister's popularity has plunged in opinion polls, allies have urged Mr Burnham - Labour's king of the north - to return to the Commons, potentially to seize Sir Keir Starmer's crown. Today he received a top endorsement when former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said Mr Burnham should be allowed to stand in the forthcoming by-election. But in an announcement at 5pm on Friday, the party's ruling national executive declared that he has only until 5pm on Saturday to seek permission to stand as a by-election candidate. That means he only has hours to make up his mind on a decision that will make or break his political career: whether to stand in the looming Gorton and Denton by-election, or wait for another opportunity. As well as the 24-hour ultimatum facing Mr Burnham, the rest of the timetable for the by-election is brutally short. Applications opened at 5pm on Friday and will close at midnight on Sunday night. A longlist of candidates, probably six, will be drawn up on Monday by a selection panel, shortlisting interviews will be held on Tuesday and hustings and selection will take place next Saturday. If Mr Burnham does apply and is selected, the constituency in Greater Manchester, where Mr Burnham has been mayor since 2017, is set to host the most high-profile box-office by-election in decades. Read more from Sky News:Trump should apologise over Nato claims, PM suggestsFormer Tory councillor admits drugging and raping ex-wifeCelebrities attend Valentino funeral The by-election has been triggered by the resignation on health grounds of former minister Andrew Gwynne, who was revealed last year to have sent racist and sexist WhatsApp messages. But although Labour is defending a majority of 13,413, and won more than 50% of the vote at the general election, Mr Burnham faces several hurdles and a \"stop Burnham\" campaign by allies of the prime minister. At Labour's conference last autumn, Mr Burnham faced a backlash from Starmer loyalists after criticising the government and claiming that he had been urged by Labour MPs to stand for leader. As well as a rule stating that elected mayors must seek the permission of the national executive before seeking nomination as a parliamentary candidate, Mr Burnham would have to quit as mayor. That would trigger a costly election for his successor, which Labour could lose, given the unpopularity of Sir Keir's government and the current surge in support for Reform UK and the Green Party. Also, if the national executive bows to pressure from a \"stop Burnham\" campaign, it could thwart Mr Burnham by imposing a women-only or black, Asian and minority ethnic-only shortlist. Another risk is that even if he is Labour's by-election candidate, he could lose. That would almost certainly mean the end of his political career, since there would be no second chance to challenge Sir Keir. In a by-election last year in Runcorn and Helsby, Reform UK, second in Gorton and Denton in 2024, overturned a Labour majority of 14,696 and won by a wafer-thin majority of just six votes. If he stands in Gordon and Denton, Mr Burnham could also be opposed by George Galloway, who defeated Labour in a 2024 by-election in Rochdale, and Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       He is the Lewisham-born actor who, at the age of 73, finds himself in the running for an Oscar. While Delroy Lindo can now reflect that being an Oscar nominee \"has a certain ring to it\", the Sinners star says he was taken by surprise at the news when it first broke. \"My son called me,\" he explains. \"I will not say I was asleep, but I was not fully awake, and I'm listening to my son very excitedly say how proud of me he was. \"And I then noticed on my phone I had 179 Text messages, so I knew that something was up.\"  While he says he is happy for viewers in the UK to \"absolutely\" root for him in the best supporting actor category on Oscars night, the Sinners star - who moved to the US in his teens - says he no longer considers himself a Brit. \"My career has been birthed and nurtured in America,\" said Lindo. \"I was born in Lewisham hospital, my family's from Jamaica, and my mom was part of the Windrush generation. I am British to that extent, that is my reality. \"[But] I thank God I came to America, that I went to acting school in America, that I was a New York-based theatre actor for 10 years before I started doing film, and I thank God Spike Lee saw me on Broadway.\" As an actor who has quietly built a career of elevating whatever project he's in, some of Lindo's most unforgettable work has been with Lee. In films like Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers and Da 5 Bloods, he's played men shaped by power, anger and history. While, arguably, the recognition is long overdue, his performance in Ryan Coogler's vampire horror Sinners is a stand-out one. His role as the world-weary blues musician Delta Slim is one of the most layered characters of the piece - and one of the most talked about moments in the Jim Crow-era horror is the monologue Lindo delivers about a friend who was lynched. \"I started hearing from audiences how that scene was resonating for them, and at that point I knew there was something of real value,\" he explains. \"The fact that Ryan gifted me that monologue in the car, that's really rich stuff for any actor to wrestle with.\" Read more from Sky News:Oscar nominations: The biggest snubs and surprisesOscar nominations 2026: The full list of stars and films Regardless of how many awards Sinners wins, with its record-breaking 16 nominations it has already made it into the Oscars history books.

        "Content": "\n          Military analyst\n       Over 1,000 non-US NATO troops died in Afghanistan and at least double that number were seriously wounded in supporting US policy there. It is for this reason that many in the UK have condemned Donald Trump, who claimed during the war in Afghanistan that NATO troops stayed \"a little off the frontlines\". Beyond the outrage among British veterans of the Afghan operation and the pain of the families who lost people, there is another point that matters in Whitehall: Britain went into the Afghan operations with the US from the very beginning, and did not come out until the very end, when the US itself came out. On the night of the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001, which began the whole Afghan operation, all US airspace was totally closed. Only one foreign aircraft was in the air that night - the plane carrying Britain's intelligence chiefs to consult with their American counterparts. Britain had 20,000 troops just finishing a big exercise in Oman right then. London was ready to send them straight to Afghanistan if necessary. \"No\", said the Americans, \"we will do this differently; special forces only\". So British special forces were immediately deployed into the mountains of the south and the Tora Bora complex to work with their US colleagues in seeking out Taliban leaders and fighters. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 When the US transitioned to a bigger Afghan operation in 2006, it was the British who worked with the Dutch and the Canadians to create a NATO operation to bolster the whole American effort. Three American presidents then successively pulled the plug on the commitment - Barack Obama, Donald Trump in his first term and then Joe Biden.

He stabbed her 18 times at 11.50am before \"casually\" walking away while bystanders rushed to help the victim. Debella was sentenced to a hospital order and a restriction order at a hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday. He can be detained indefinitely. The court heard that the 24-year-old was obsessed with gory online videos that mirrored the violence he would later carry out in real life. He had searched on his computer for \"killing video\" and visited a website containing graphic violent content. Despite living in a residential home supporting people with mental health problems, Debella was able to buy a hunting knife over the internet. It was delivered to the home in Colindale, in the north London borough of Barnet, around an hour before he used it to kill Ms Mukhey. Ms Mukhey's husband, Hari, said the grandmother-of-two was the \"centre of our home\". He said that her absence has left a silence that\" nothing can fill\" and thanked \"brave members of the public\" who went to his wife's aide. Mr Mukhey said the trial had forced him to confront \"deeply troubling\" facts about the psychological assessments of her killer, however. Judge Philip Katz KC said: \"Anita Mukhey was the heart of the family. She was a wife, mother and grandmother, aged 66 when she was stabbed to death by a complete stranger on a busy main road in north London.\" Debella did not appear in court to hear the verdict. He had previously been judged too unwell to stand trial for murder. In a statement - issued after the jury found Debella committed the act of killing Ms Mukhey - her family said: \"The court has heard that a man with a severe mental illness was known to services and assessed by consultant psychiatrists as psychologically stable and safe for the community. \"At the same time, he was engaging in escalating behaviour outside those assessments, including acquiring weapons and researching extreme violence - behaviour that ultimately mirrored the violence he later carried out. \"That disconnect is hard to accept. It raises serious questions about how risk is assessed, and about whether current models are equipped to detect danger that develops beyond the spoken words of the consulting room.\" Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Alex Gammampila said the verdict would offer \"little comfort\" to Ms Mukhey's family. He added: \"I want to recognise the dignity and courage they have shown over the past 20 months.\""

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Donald Trump's claims British troops were not on the frontline in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\" - and suggested he should apologise. Veterans and their families, as well as MPs from all parties, have reacted with fury after the US president said NATO troops stayed \"a little off the frontlines\" in Afghanistan. In an interview with Fox News in Davos, Mr Trump repeated his criticism, saying he was not \"sure\" the military alliance would \"be there if we ever needed them\". He added: \"We've never needed them. They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.\" On Friday afternoon, Sir Keir said: \"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling. \"And I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.\" He added that if he had said something like that, he would \"certainly apologise\". Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Trump was \"wrong\" to diminish the role of NATO and British troops in Afghanistan. The prime minister's official spokesman said UK forces had served alongside the US and NATO in \"sustained combat operations\". Pointing to the 457 British deaths in Afghanistan and the \"many hundreds\" more who were wounded, he added: \"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.\" America is the only NATO member to have invoked the collective security provisions of its Article 5 clause - that an attack against one member is an attack on all. Trump's remarks 'the ultimate insult' Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries when his vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan in 2006, said the US president's comments were \"the ultimate insult\". Mr Parkinson is widely viewed as the most severely injured British soldier to have survived the war. The blast left the former lance bombardier with both legs amputated, a twisted spine and brain damage. His mother said: \"I can assure you, the Taliban didn't plant IEDs [improvised explosive devices] miles and miles back from the front line. \"Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads - 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation. \"To hear this man say: 'Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the front lines'... It's the ultimate insult.\" She said Sir Keir Starmer has \"got to stand up for his own armed forces and he's got to absolutely refute what Donald Trump said\". \"Call him out,\" she added. US correspondent Trump's words will be a gut punch for the families of the 1,160 non-American coalition soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.  It will be a gut punch too for the thousands more who were wounded fighting this war, many left without limbs. And it will be a gut punch to the soldiers of so many nations who stood up to fight alongside American soldiers on the frontlines and for whom not a day will pass without them thinking about their experiences in that war. Afghanistan was America's war. America's friends stood up and answered the call for support after 9/11. For over two decades America's allies would continue with that support in an increasing futile conflict. I spent time with British and Danish soldiers in Helmand Province in 2007. They were very much on the frontline. The Danish lost more soldiers in Afghanistan per capita than any other NATO nation. Battles in towns like Sangin, Musa Qala, Babaji and Nad Ali are etched in the memories of the many who were there and the many families of those who didn't come back. Britons remember what became a desperately sad routine: coffins draped in the Union flag passing through the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett as the fallen were repatriated and returned to their loved ones. 457 British service men and women died in Afghanistan. Trump dodged the draft for the Vietnam War five times. He was a student for four of his five call ups, allowing him to legally avoid the draft. And for the fifth call-up, he obtained a doctor's note for 'bone spurs'. Tap here to read Mark's full piece. 'We shed blood, sweat and tears' Defence minister Al Carns said: \"I served five tours in Afghanistan, many alongside my American colleagues. We shed blood, sweat and tears together. Not everybody came home. \"These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting the US, our shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\" The former commando, who served five tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry, said Mr Trump's comments were \"ridiculous\", adding: \"Many courageous and honourable service personnel from many nations fought on the front line. Many fought way beyond it.\" Robert Dicketts, whose son Oliver Dicketts, 27, was killed while serving with the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan in 2006, said: \"When I read it, I thought, 'What a bloody cheek!'. \"I think my thoughts about Donald Trump are probably unprintable. \"To put it politely, Donald Trump's knowledge of history is lacking considerably.\" 'Heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation' The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. The US saw 2,461 deaths. America's allies suffered 1,160 deaths during the conflict - around a third of the total coalition deaths. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.\" Trump is 'plainly wrong' Social care minister Stephen Kinnock also pointed to the fact that the only time NATO's Article 5 clause - a call for allies to come to a member's defence - had been activated \"was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11\". \"And many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European and NATO allies gave their lives in support of American missions, American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he said. \"I am incredibly proud of our armed forces. They have put their lives on the line for our country. They are the definition of honour and valour and patriotism - and anybody who seeks to criticise what they have done and the sacrifices they make is plainly wrong,\" Mr Kinnock added. Ben McBean lost two limbs while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan. The former commando said: \"If someone's speaking the truth, you don't mind, but when it's completely rubbish, it offends you. I was on the frontline every day that I was there. \"I have to live like this. I have to try and raise my family with these injuries. Things are difficult mentally, physically and emotionally, and to have someone who can't even fight sleep sit there and just say 'you guys were slightly further back', along with other nations, is offensive.\" 'We have always been there' Dame Emily Thornberry MP, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Trump's comments were \"an insult\" to the families of those who died and \"so much more than a mistake\". Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, Dame Emily said: \"How dare he say we weren't on the frontline, how dare he. \"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us; we have always been there.\" In a social media post, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey MP said: \"Trump avoided military service five times. \"How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed.\" Josh Babarinde, Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne, wrote in a post on X: \"[Donald Trump] can go f**k himself. \"Anyone who mocks, demeans or minimises the sacrifices of British troops is no friend of our nation.\" \"The US is a historic friend of the UK's - but not this guy,\" he said, referring to Mr Trump. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the sacrifice of British and other NATO troops deserved respect, not denigration, adding his comments were \"complete nonsense\" which could weaken the NATO alliance. \"I spoke to parents of young men who had lost their lives in Afghanistan, and I think it is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that,\" she said. Mrs Badenoch said there was \"too much careless talk from President Trump\" and \"we mustn't have these sort of throwaway comments that actually weaken the strong relationship between those countries in the alliance\". 'I saw the sacrifices made by British soldiers' Tory MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\". He said: \"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers I served alongside in Sangin, where we suffered horrific casualties, as did the US Marines the following year. \"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump promises Greenland 'deal' will be 'amazing' for USIs president's peace board a new UN or a gang of friends? Former UK ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Nicholas Kay told Sky News the US president was \"wrong\" and he \"clearly does not value and appreciate NATO in the same way he ought to\". \"The president is wrong. He is not known for his respect for other people, and he is not known for his accuracy with facts, and I'm afraid this is another example,\" he said. Last year, US vice president JD Vance hit back at claims of \"disrespecting\" British troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after suggesting a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine would be \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". At the time, only the UK and France had pledged troops to a potential peacekeeping force."

        "Content": "The co-owner of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire has been released on bail. Jacques Moretti, who ran Le Constellation with his wife Jessica, was arrested on 9 January following the blaze in the early hours of New Year's Day. A court originally ordered him to be detained for three months, unless suitable \"security measures\" were agreed, amid fears he was a flight risk.   But on Friday, the court said Moretti could now be released, on the condition that he must stay in Switzerland, surrender his identity documents and report to the police every day. A bail of 200,000 francs (£190,000) was also paid. His wife was kept under house arrest earlier this month. The couple are suspected of negligent homicide, negligent bodily harm and causing a fire by negligence. The criminal investigation continues. Following Jacques Moretti release, a lawyer representing the couple said they would \"both continue to comply with all requests from the authorities\". They added: \"Their thoughts remain constantly with the victims of this tragedy.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump should apologise over Nato claims, PM suggestsFormer Tory councillor admits drugging and raping ex-wifeCelebrities attend Valentino funeral More than 100 people were also injured in the fire, and many survivors remain in hospital with severe burns.

Investigators believe the fire began when sparkling candles ignited the bar's ceiling, which had been fitted with soundproofing material. Local officials said the venue had not had a fire safety inspection since 2019."

        "Content": "Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators are taking part in the first trilateral talks since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The three-way security discussions in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, are part of efforts to reach a deal to end the war. The Kremlin confirmed the talks would take place but warned that long-lasting peace would not be possible unless territorial issues were resolved. It comes after three US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, held a four-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday, while Mr Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates Here's everything you need to know as representatives from the three countries come together for peace talks. How close is a peace deal? The US has held talks with Russia, and separately with Ukrainian and European leaders, over various different drafts of a peace plan. US envoy Mr Witkoff said as recently as Thursday that \"a lot of progress\" had been made and negotiations were down to one last issue. The main sticking point on any agreed deal remains territory. Russia continues to demand that Ukraine surrenders the roughly 20% (1,900 square miles) of Donetsk it has not taken on the battlefield - land that Mr Zelenskyy has refused to withdraw from. Donetsk is one of two eastern regions that comprise Donbas. Russian forces already control nearly all of the other region, Luhansk. The Russian leader told Mr Trump last year that he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in return for both Donetsk and Luhansk regions. After the latest meeting with Mr Trump, the Ukrainian leader said that the future status of land in eastern Ukraine currently occupied by Russia is unresolved but that peace proposals are \"nearly ready\". Russian foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, also said that it was reaffirmed by Mr Putin to the US envoys that \"reaching a long-term settlement can't be expected without solving the territorial issue\". Security guarantees Mr Zelenskyy added that he is also waiting for Mr Trump to agree a specific date and time to sign a deal on US security guarantees for Kyiv. He said the document is \"done\" but is yet to be signed. The document is also yet to be made public. The country has sought strong ‌security guarantees from allies to counter any renewed Russian aggression in the future. Mr Trump's draft 28-point peace plan to end the war specifically outlined that Ukraine would receive \"robust\" security guarantees. The UK and France have already committed to send some troops to Ukraine in \"military hubs\" in the event of a ceasefire, as part of the Coalition of the Willing. Will any leaders be at trilateral talks? Only delegations from each country will meet in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Ukraine said it would send its lead negotiator Rustem Umerov and Mr Zelenskyy's newly appointed chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, while Moscow has said it will send Admiral Igor Kostyukov to head its team at the UAE-based security talks. Mr Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is expected to hold separate talks on economic issues with US envoy Mr Witkoff. Military analyst Michael Clarke said those within Ukraine's delegation could do \"a lot of negotiating\". He described Mr Umerov as \"very skilled\" while Mr Budanov was described by a US source to Sky News' correspondent Sally Lockwood as the only one of Mr Zelenskyy's staff that the US takes \"really seriously\". On the other hand, Michael Clarke said Moscow has not sent a \"politically important\" team. Mr Kostyukov is head of Russia's military intelligence, but is sanctioned by both the US and EU because of alleged involvement in trying to rig the 2016 US presidential election. \"Russians are going for military specialists who won't have the authority to talk politics and the Ukrainians are going for a range of people,\" Clarke said. Have we been here before? Sky News' Sally Lockwood said the trilateral meeting marks \"a significant moment\" but added that it is \"important to keep hopes rather tempered, because of course, we have been here before\". In November, military officials from all three sides met in Abu Dhabi, although it remains unclear if all were in the same room at the same time. A significant meeting between Ukrainian and Russian government officials also took place in Turkey last May. There were hopes that the encounter might mark a turning point in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two, but in reality the meeting barely lasted two hours. Then again in August, a historic meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Alaska saw the two leaders discuss the possibility of Ukraine giving up territory in exchange for an end to the fighting, but no firm agreements came from it. Lockwood added that the latest peace talks are a wait and watch situation. She said the fast pace at which peace talks in Abu Dhabi were agreed to could indicate that each side have at least \"contemplated a compromise they might be willing to accept\" before meeting. Read more:Zelenskyy drops brutal truth bombs upon European alliesTrump's new gang shouldn't be underestimated What's happening on the frontline? While peace talks happen in Abu Dhabi, Moscow has shown no signs that it's willing to halt its bombings of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Overnight, Russia fired about 101 drones at Ukraine, 76 of which were shot down, while 19 struck 12 locations, according to Ukraine's air force. In the east of the country, four people, including a five-year-old child, were killed in a Russian overnight strike, the state emergency service said. Nearly 2,000 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital are also without heating after a Russian attack last week caused a blackout, according to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko. The EU has said it will deploy 447 emergency generators from its strategic reserves in Poland to try and curb freezing conditions for some of those affected. Kremlin aide Mr Ushakov said on Thursday night that until a diplomatic solution is achieved, Russia would \"continue to consistently pursue the objectives of the special military ‌operation\". \"This is especially true on the battlefield, where the Russian armed forces hold the strategic initiative.\""

The biggest names ​in fashion - including Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Maria Grazia Chiuri - gathered in the Basilica di Santa ⁠Maria degli Angeli on Friday for the funeral.

To suggest that coalition forces fighting with the Americans in Afghanistan \"stayed a little back; a little off the frontlines\" will also resonate far wider than debates over geopolitical realignment. It's hard to know sometimes whether Trump is ignorant or just doesn't really care.

It will be a gut punch too for the thousands more who were wounded fighting this war, many left without limbs. And it will be a gut punch to the soldiers of so many nations who stood up to fight alongside American soldiers on the frontlines and for whom not a day will pass without them thinking about their experiences in that war. Afghanistan was America's war. America's friends stood up and answered the call for support after 9/11. For over two decades, America's allies would continue with that support in an increasingly futile conflict. I spent time with British and Danish soldiers in Helmand Province in 2007. They were very much on the frontline. The Danish lost more soldiers in Afghanistan per capita than any other NATO nation. Battles in towns like Sangin, Musa Qala, Babaji and Nad Ali are etched in the memories of the many who were there and the many families of those who didn't come back. Britons remember what became a desperately sad routine: coffins draped in the Union flag passing through the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett as the fallen were repatriated and returned to their loved ones.

Ryan Wedding, a Canadian who competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, was held in Mexico on Thursday night, FBI director Kash Patel said. Wedding, 44, was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted fugitives list and the agency had offered a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Trump latest - Harry weighs in over Afghanistan 'sacrifice' As well as running a large-scale drug trafficking operation, authorities believe he organised several killings to further his alleged drug crimes. He was believed to have been living in Mexico for more than a decade under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel, while helping it funnel massive quantities of drugs into the US and Canada. Mr Patel and US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed his arrest on social media, with Mr Patel telling reporters at an airport near Los Angeles on Friday that Wedding was \"the largest narco trafficker in modern times\", comparing him to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Pablo Escobar. He said Wedding, who finished 24th in the parallel giant slalom, according to Olympic records, was being brought to the US. Wedding was charged in 2024 with running a drug ring that moved tons of cocaine each year in long-haul lorries between Colombia, Mexico, Southern California and Canada. Among the aliases he used were El Jefe, Public Enemy and James Conrad King, authorities said. In November, Ms Bondi said he had also been charged with setting up the killing of a witness in Colombia to help him avoid extradition to the US. He and his co-conspirators used a Canadian website called The Dirty News to post a photograph of the witness so he could be identified and killed, according to prosecutors. The witness was then followed to a restaurant in the city of Medellin and shot in the head in January.

Beyond the outrage among British veterans of the Afghan operation and the pain of the families who lost people, there is another point that matters in Whitehall: Britain went into the Afghan operations with the US from the very beginning, and did not come out until the very end, when the US itself came out. On the night of the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001, which began the whole Afghan operation, all US airspace was totally closed. Only one foreign aircraft was in the air that night - the plane carrying Britain's intelligence chiefs to consult with their American counterparts. Britain had 20,000 troops just finishing a big exercise in Oman right then. London was ready to send them straight to Afghanistan if necessary. \"No\", said the Americans, \"we will do this differently; special forces only\".

This week, Davos provided a safe space for a full-frontal assault on the continent's economic and political model that will be felt long after the canapes are cleared. The World Economic Forum has always relied on a political presence to bring relevance to its annual meeting, but never has it been hijacked so comprehensively by one man. Donald Trump's attendance at the head of the largest-ever American delegation was always going to dominate attention. His wild threats against Greenland, made as delegates were packing their cashmere and Canada Goose at the weekend, ensured a monopoly. The diplomatic fallout dominated the public platforms. Ursula von der Leyen talked of a new \"European independence\" and French President Emmanuel Macron, bizarre in mirrored Aviators, decried Trump's threats as bullying. Perhaps the most significant words came from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The former Bank of England governor talked of a \"rupture\" and called for a new alliance to face down American and Chinese belligerence. \"The middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" he said. The official Davos theme was \"a spirit of dialogue\" but when it came Trump's address was more a case of \"shut up and listen\". It was a familiar blend of braggadocio and bombast, with some falsehoods and insults thrown in. He claimed China, home to the largest wind farms in the world, had none, and told the audience they would all be speaking German, \"and maybe a little Japanese\" had it not been for the US in the Second World War. There were some home truths too, including for the UK. His fixation with \"windmills\" and renewable energy seems eccentric, and his projections for North Sea oil and gas reserves are contested, but when he pointed to the soaring cost of energy, he was not wrong. Trump's climbdown on Greenland endorsed predictions from business leaders in Davos that calm heads would prevail. \"Cool cats win spats,\" said one British executive. 'We have come with a clear message' If the immediate threat of tariffs passed, the challenge of US disruption did not. Even before Greenland, the American delegation here was spoiling for a fight. Commerce secretary Howard Lutkin was belligerent at every opportunity. \"We have come with a clear message,\" he said on a panel, sat next to Chancellor Rachel Reeves: \"Globalism is dead.\" At a private dinner following Trump's tariffs retreat, a fellow guest described his triumphalism as \"embarrassing\". European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde walked out of another event following Lutkin's remarks about Europe. US trade representative Jamieson Greer was equally strident, telling reporters that no one, not even European allies, could take access to American markets for granted. It was a measure of US dominance of the agenda that perhaps the highest-powered Davos line-up ever assembled was reduced to a supporting cast. Only in this weird week in January can you see the likes of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Elon Musk, David Beckham (dodging his own family drama), MI6 boss Blaise Metrewelli, Matt Damon and Rachel Reeves in a single afternoon. Davos remains a gold-plated networking platform and, if the public festival of ideas was largely sidelined, behind-the-scenes dealmaking continued. How did Britain fare at Davos? There was a sizeable UK delegation led by the chancellor, in good humour and bullish about the reception she received. Changes to visa regulations to attract overseas talent went down well, and investors were far more positive than the gloomy sentiment about Britain that dominates domestic politics (and media). Privately, however, British and American executives were sceptical about the clarity of the UK's pitch, which rests on strengths in higher education, life sciences and the rule of law, outweighing concerns about taxation, energy costs and the speed of decision making. \"We need to tell a better story,\" said one supportive executive. There is a broader question for Britain raised by this disruptive Davos. In a world of great powers and trade tension, sitting outside the EU bloc but yet to exploit the opportunities that might be offered, how can it be heard? An American bank executive said it is already costing the UK. \"Just imagine the opportunity Britain would have today if it was still in the EU. There are American investors deeply uncomfortable about Trump who would like to move some money. With the language, the institutions, the rule of law, they would come to the UK as a bridge to Europe.\" If there is no appetite to re-fight the battles of Brexit, there are moves to get closer to the EU, but these will bring friction with the US.

The truth is, the UK has few economic weapons to deploy in response. For now, we were not alone in being drowned out in Davos."

The decision will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law in 2024 that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied.

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Donald Trump's claims British troops were not on the frontline in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\" - and suggested he should apologise. Veterans and their families, as well as MPs from all parties, have reacted with fury after the US president said NATO troops stayed \"a little off the frontlines\" in Afghanistan. In an interview with Fox News in Davos, Mr Trump repeated his criticism, saying he was not \"sure\" the military alliance would \"be there if we ever needed them\". He added: \"We've never needed them. They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.\" On Friday afternoon, Sir Keir said: \"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling. \"And I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.\" He added that if he had said something like that, he would \"certainly apologise\". Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Trump was \"wrong\" to diminish the role of NATO and British troops in Afghanistan. The prime minister's official spokesman said UK forces had served alongside the US and NATO in \"sustained combat operations\". Pointing to the 457 British deaths in Afghanistan and the \"many hundreds\" more who were wounded, he added: \"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.\" America is the only NATO member to have invoked the collective security provisions of its Article 5 clause - that an attack against one member is an attack on all. Trump's remarks 'the ultimate insult' Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries when his vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan in 2006, said the US president's comments were \"the ultimate insult\". Mr Parkinson is widely viewed as the most severely injured British soldier to have survived the war. The blast left the former lance bombardier with both legs amputated, a twisted spine and brain damage. His mother said: \"I can assure you, the Taliban didn't plant IEDs [improvised explosive devices] miles and miles back from the front line. \"Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads - 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation. \"To hear this man say: 'Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the front lines'... It's the ultimate insult.\" She said Sir Keir Starmer has \"got to stand up for his own armed forces and he's got to absolutely refute what Donald Trump said\". \"Call him out,\" she added. US correspondent Trump's words will be a gut punch for the families of the 1,160 non-American coalition soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.  It will be a gut punch too for the thousands more who were wounded fighting this war, many left without limbs. And it will be a gut punch to the soldiers of so many nations who stood up to fight alongside American soldiers on the frontlines and for whom not a day will pass without them thinking about their experiences in that war. Afghanistan was America's war. America's friends stood up and answered the call for support after 9/11. For over two decades America's allies would continue with that support in an increasing futile conflict. I spent time with British and Danish soldiers in Helmand Province in 2007. They were very much on the frontline. The Danish lost more soldiers in Afghanistan per capita than any other NATO nation. Battles in towns like Sangin, Musa Qala, Babaji and Nad Ali are etched in the memories of the many who were there and the many families of those who didn't come back. Britons remember what became a desperately sad routine: coffins draped in the Union flag passing through the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett as the fallen were repatriated and returned to their loved ones. 457 British service men and women died in Afghanistan. Trump dodged the draft for the Vietnam War five times. He was a student for four of his five call ups, allowing him to legally avoid the draft. And for the fifth call-up, he obtained a doctor's note for 'bone spurs'. Tap here to read Mark's full piece. 'We shed blood, sweat and tears' Defence minister Al Carns said: \"I served five tours in Afghanistan, many alongside my American colleagues. We shed blood, sweat and tears together. Not everybody came home. \"These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting the US, our shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\" The former commando, who served five tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry, said Mr Trump's comments were \"ridiculous\", adding: \"Many courageous and honourable service personnel from many nations fought on the front line. Many fought way beyond it.\" Robert Dicketts, whose son Oliver Dicketts, 27, was killed while serving with the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan in 2006, said: \"When I read it, I thought, 'What a bloody cheek!'. \"I think my thoughts about Donald Trump are probably unprintable. \"To put it politely, Donald Trump's knowledge of history is lacking considerably.\" 'Heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation' The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. The US saw 2,461 deaths. America's allies suffered 1,160 deaths during the conflict - around a third of the total coalition deaths. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.\" Trump is 'plainly wrong' Social care minister Stephen Kinnock also pointed to the fact that the only time NATO's Article 5 clause - a call for allies to come to a member's defence - had been activated \"was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11\". \"And many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European and NATO allies gave their lives in support of American missions, American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he said. \"I am incredibly proud of our armed forces. They have put their lives on the line for our country. They are the definition of honour and valour and patriotism - and anybody who seeks to criticise what they have done and the sacrifices they make is plainly wrong,\" Mr Kinnock added. Ben McBean lost two limbs while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan. The former commando said: \"If someone's speaking the truth, you don't mind, but when it's completely rubbish, it offends you. I was on the frontline every day that I was there. \"I have to live like this. I have to try and raise my family with these injuries. Things are difficult mentally, physically and emotionally, and to have someone who can't even fight sleep sit there and just say 'you guys were slightly further back', along with other nations, is offensive.\" 'We have always been there' Dame Emily Thornberry MP, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Trump's comments were \"an insult\" to the families of those who died and \"so much more than a mistake\". Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, Dame Emily said: \"How dare he say we weren't on the frontline, how dare he. \"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us; we have always been there.\" In a social media post, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey MP said: \"Trump avoided military service five times. \"How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed.\" Josh Babarinde, Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne, wrote in a post on X: \"[Donald Trump] can go f**k himself. \"Anyone who mocks, demeans or minimises the sacrifices of British troops is no friend of our nation.\" \"The US is a historic friend of the UK's - but not this guy,\" he said, referring to Mr Trump. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the sacrifice of British and other NATO troops deserved respect, not denigration, adding his comments were \"complete nonsense\" which could weaken the NATO alliance. \"I spoke to parents of young men who had lost their lives in Afghanistan, and I think it is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that,\" she said. Mrs Badenoch said there was \"too much careless talk from President Trump\" and \"we mustn't have these sort of throwaway comments that actually weaken the strong relationship between those countries in the alliance\". 'I saw the sacrifices made by British soldiers' Tory MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\". He said: \"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers I served alongside in Sangin, where we suffered horrific casualties, as did the US Marines the following year. \"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump promises Greenland 'deal' will be 'amazing' for USIs president's peace board a new UN or a gang of friends? Former UK ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Nicholas Kay told Sky News the US president was \"wrong\" and he \"clearly does not value and appreciate NATO in the same way he ought to\". \"The president is wrong. He is not known for his respect for other people, and he is not known for his accuracy with facts, and I'm afraid this is another example,\" he said. Last year, US vice president JD Vance hit back at claims of \"disrespecting\" British troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after suggesting a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine would be \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". At the time, only the UK and France had pledged troops to a potential peacekeeping force."

To suggest that coalition forces fighting with the Americans in Afghanistan \"stayed a little back; a little off the frontlines\" will also resonate far wider than debates over geopolitical realignment.

        "Content": "A major winter storm is set to sweep the United States this weekend, bringing with it snow, sleet, ice and sub-zero temperatures from the Arizona-New Mexico border to upstate New York. What is it? A winter storm is defined as a combination of heavy snow, blowing snow and/or dangerous wind chills, according to the NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, which also describes it as \"life-threatening\". The approaching storm is due to an area of low pressure moving up from the Gulf of Mexico (bringing lots of moisture) and meeting extremely cold Arctic air plunging south from Canada. The winter storm set to hit the US comes with warnings of ice. An ice storm is one which results in the accumulation of at least a quarter of an inch of ice on exposed surfaces - creating hazardous driving and walking conditions and the threat of downed power lines and trees. Where is it heading? The National Weather Service has warned communities the \"significant, long-duration winter storm\" will bring \"widespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Southern Rockies to New England\" - lasting from Friday until Monday, and to prepare for \"bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills\". The storm is expected to bring a crippling ice storm from Texas through parts of the South, potentially around 30cm (12ins) of snow from Oklahoma through Washington DC, New York and Boston. Then a final punch of bitterly cold air could plunge wind chill temperatures to -46C (-50F) in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota. Forecasters are warning the damage, especially in areas hit by heavy snowfall and ice, could rival a hurricane. \"The storm will cause significant to locally catastrophic ice accumulations with the potential for long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions,\" the NWS said. \"In the wake of the storm, communities from the Southern Plains to the Northeast will contend with bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills. This will cause prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.\" Millions braced for 'catastrophic' winter storm About 160 million people - nearly half the population of the United States - are under a variety of watches, warnings and alerts. The alerts stretch from Arizona and Montana in the west to the Carolinas and Maine in the east. So far, 12 states have declared states of emergency ahead of the winter storm. These include Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Missouri. What has the federal response been? The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has pre-positioned supplies and is deploying more than 200 call centre specialists across the country ahead of the winter storm, according to an agency document obtained by Sky's US partner network NBC News. The document said supplies and equipment include 250,000 meals, 400,000 litres of water, 30 generators and 12 shuttle drivers at Camp Minden, Louisiana. A further 24 shuttle drivers are being deployed at distribution centres in Greencastle, Pennsylvania; 12 in Fort Worth, Texas; and 22 in Atlanta to quickly move commodities. A total of 28 search and rescue teams are also on standby. FEMA's National Response Coordination Center and regional centres are activated. What have people been told to do? Residents have been advised to stay at home and off the roads and to prepare by stocking up on food and drink supplies. \"Items like flashlights, batteries, and battery back-ups can make all the difference,\" the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management said in a social media post. Items including mobile phone chargers, radios, winter clothing, blankets and a first-aid kit should also be added to households' emergency kits. It warned people should never run a generator inside a house or garage to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency said people should regularly check the weather forecast for any changes and gather emergency supplies for both their homes and cars, check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and refuel cars and heating sources. It also said people should check in on neighbours and family, properly ventilate emergency heat sources, keep generators 20ft from homes and to be careful while shovelling snow and ice."

While Delroy Lindo can now reflect that being an Oscar nominee \"has a certain ring to it\", the Sinners star says he was taken by surprise at the news when it first broke. \"My son called me,\" he explains. \"I will not say I was asleep, but I was not fully awake, and I'm listening to my son very excitedly say how proud of me he was. \"And I then noticed on my phone I had 179 Text messages, so I knew that something was up.\"  While he says he is happy for viewers in the UK to \"absolutely\" root for him in the best supporting actor category on Oscars night, the Sinners star - who moved to the US in his teens - says he no longer considers himself a Brit. \"My career has been birthed and nurtured in America,\" said Lindo. \"I was born in Lewisham hospital, my family's from Jamaica, and my mom was part of the Windrush generation. I am British to that extent, that is my reality. \"[But] I thank God I came to America, that I went to acting school in America, that I was a New York-based theatre actor for 10 years before I started doing film, and I thank God Spike Lee saw me on Broadway.\" As an actor who has quietly built a career of elevating whatever project he's in, some of Lindo's most unforgettable work has been with Lee. In films like Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers and Da 5 Bloods, he's played men shaped by power, anger and history. While, arguably, the recognition is long overdue, his performance in Ryan Coogler's vampire horror Sinners is a stand-out one. His role as the world-weary blues musician Delta Slim is one of the most layered characters of the piece - and one of the most talked about moments in the Jim Crow-era horror is the monologue Lindo delivers about a friend who was lynched. \"I started hearing from audiences how that scene was resonating for them, and at that point I knew there was something of real value,\" he explains. \"The fact that Ryan gifted me that monologue in the car, that's really rich stuff for any actor to wrestle with.\" Read more from Sky News:Oscar nominations: The biggest snubs and surprisesOscar nominations 2026: The full list of stars and films Regardless of how many awards Sinners wins, with its record-breaking 16 nominations it has already made it into the Oscars history books.

Ryan Wedding, a Canadian who competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, was held in Mexico on Thursday night, FBI director Kash Patel said. Wedding, 44, was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted fugitives list and the agency had offered a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Trump latest - Harry weighs in over Afghanistan 'sacrifice' As well as running a large-scale drug trafficking operation, authorities believe he organised several killings to further his alleged drug crimes. He was believed to have been living in Mexico for more than a decade under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel, while helping it funnel massive quantities of drugs into the US and Canada. Mr Patel and US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed his arrest on social media, with Mr Patel telling reporters at an airport near Los Angeles on Friday that Wedding was \"the largest narco trafficker in modern times\", comparing him to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Pablo Escobar. He said Wedding, who finished 24th in the parallel giant slalom, according to Olympic records, was being brought to the US. Wedding was charged in 2024 with running a drug ring that moved tons of cocaine each year in long-haul lorries between Colombia, Mexico, Southern California and Canada. Among the aliases he used were El Jefe, Public Enemy and James Conrad King, authorities said. In November, Ms Bondi said he had also been charged with setting up the killing of a witness in Colombia to help him avoid extradition to the US. He and his co-conspirators used a Canadian website called The Dirty News to post a photograph of the witness so he could be identified and killed, according to prosecutors. The witness was then followed to a restaurant in the city of Medellin and shot in the head in January.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n TalkTalk Group has kicked off talks with prospective bidders for divisions including one of Britain's biggest consumer internet providers. Sky News has learnt that TalkTalk, which supplies landline and broadband services to about 1.7 million UK customers, has begun discussions with potential buyers in the last few days. The initiation of talks comes about four months after the privately owned company appointed bankers to oversee a sale. Industry sources said the likes of Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 were among those expected to explore bids for parts of the group, which was founded by The Carphone Warehouse billionaire Sir Charles Dunstone. TalkTalk ranks among the largest broadband suppliers in the country, behind BT Group, Sky and VMO2. In addition to its consumer division, the PlatformX Communications (PXC) wholesale and network unit of TalkTalk is also for sale. Within the latter unit, TalkTalk's ethernet subsidiary could also be sold on a standalone basis. \n                  TalkTalk Group picks bankers to spearhead break-up\n                 \n                  Broadband provider TalkTalk plots £200m sale of corporate arm\n                 \n                  TalkTalk shares rise over Toscafund's takeover bid\n                 TalkTalk, which has been grappling with a heavily indebted balance sheet for some time, secured a significant boost last summer when it agreed a £120m capital injection. The bulk of those funds came from Ares Management, an existing lender to and shareholder in the company. That new funding followed a £1.2bn refinancing completed in 2024, but which failed to prevent bondholders pushing for further moves to strengthen its balance sheet. Over the last 18 months, TalkTalk has slashed hundreds of jobs in an attempt to exert a tighter grip on costs. It also raised £50m from two disposals last March and June, comprising the sale of non-core customers to Utility Warehouse. The company's business arm is separately owned by TalkTalk's shareholders, following a deal struck in 2023. TalkTalk was taken private from the London Stock Exchange in a £1.1bn deal led by Toscafund and Penta Capital. Sir Charles, the group's executive chairman, is also a shareholder.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Switzerland has been neutral ground in the heart of Europe for more than 500 years. This week, Davos provided a safe space for a full-frontal assault on the continent's economic and political model that will be felt long after the canapes are cleared. The World Economic Forum has always relied on a political presence to bring relevance to its annual meeting, but never has it been hijacked so comprehensively by one man. Donald Trump's attendance at the head of the largest-ever American delegation was always going to dominate attention. His wild threats against Greenland, made as delegates were packing their cashmere and Canada Goose at the weekend, ensured a monopoly. The diplomatic fallout dominated the public platforms. Ursula von der Leyen talked of a new \"European independence\" and French President Emmanuel Macron, bizarre in mirrored Aviators, decried Trump's threats as bullying. Perhaps the most significant words came from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The former Bank of England governor talked of a \"rupture\" and called for a new alliance to face down American and Chinese belligerence. \"The middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" he said. The official Davos theme was \"a spirit of dialogue\" but when it came Trump's address was more a case of \"shut up and listen\". It was a familiar blend of braggadocio and bombast, with some falsehoods and insults thrown in. He claimed China, home to the largest wind farms in the world, had none, and told the audience they would all be speaking German, \"and maybe a little Japanese\" had it not been for the US in the Second World War. There were some home truths too, including for the UK. His fixation with \"windmills\" and renewable energy seems eccentric, and his projections for North Sea oil and gas reserves are contested, but when he pointed to the soaring cost of energy, he was not wrong. Trump's climbdown on Greenland endorsed predictions from business leaders in Davos that calm heads would prevail. \"Cool cats win spats,\" said one British executive. 'We have come with a clear message' If the immediate threat of tariffs passed, the challenge of US disruption did not. Even before Greenland, the American delegation here was spoiling for a fight. Commerce secretary Howard Lutkin was belligerent at every opportunity. \"We have come with a clear message,\" he said on a panel, sat next to Chancellor Rachel Reeves: \"Globalism is dead.\" At a private dinner following Trump's tariffs retreat, a fellow guest described his triumphalism as \"embarrassing\". European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde walked out of another event following Lutkin's remarks about Europe. US trade representative Jamieson Greer was equally strident, telling reporters that no one, not even European allies, could take access to American markets for granted. It was a measure of US dominance of the agenda that perhaps the highest-powered Davos line-up ever assembled was reduced to a supporting cast. Only in this weird week in January can you see the likes of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Elon Musk, David Beckham (dodging his own family drama), MI6 boss Blaise Metrewelli, Matt Damon and Rachel Reeves in a single afternoon. Davos remains a gold-plated networking platform and, if the public festival of ideas was largely sidelined, behind-the-scenes dealmaking continued. How did Britain fare at Davos? There was a sizeable UK delegation led by the chancellor, in good humour and bullish about the reception she received. Changes to visa regulations to attract overseas talent went down well, and investors were far more positive than the gloomy sentiment about Britain that dominates domestic politics (and media). Privately, however, British and American executives were sceptical about the clarity of the UK's pitch, which rests on strengths in higher education, life sciences and the rule of law, outweighing concerns about taxation, energy costs and the speed of decision making. \"We need to tell a better story,\" said one supportive executive. There is a broader question for Britain raised by this disruptive Davos. In a world of great powers and trade tension, sitting outside the EU bloc but yet to exploit the opportunities that might be offered, how can it be heard? An American bank executive said it is already costing the UK. \"Just imagine the opportunity Britain would have today if it was still in the EU. There are American investors deeply uncomfortable about Trump who would like to move some money. With the language, the institutions, the rule of law, they would come to the UK as a bridge to Europe.\" If there is no appetite to re-fight the battles of Brexit, there are moves to get closer to the EU, but these will bring friction with the US. Read more:What global leaders said at DavosCalifornia governor tells EU to stand up to Donald Trump Jamieson Greer told Sky News that moves to align with EU agriculture regulations \"were a problem\". \"If others want to put up trade barriers, we are bringing them down because that is in our national interest,\" Reeves told me. The truth is, the UK has few economic weapons to deploy in response. For now, we were not alone in being drowned out in Davos."

        "Content": "The US and China have signed off on a deal for TikTok's Chinese owner to hand over the company's American division to investors backed by Donald Trump. It means the US version of TikTok will become majority-owned by a group of investors that includes American tech giant Oracle, California-based private equity fund Silver Lake, and United Arab Emirates investment firm MGX. The deal will ensure the video platform can continue operating in the US and comes just ahead of a takeover deadline set by the Trump administration that was extended several times. Writing on Truth Social after the deal's announcement, Mr Trump said he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!\". He went on to thank China's Xi Jinping for not blocking the deal, and later told reporters aboard Air Force One he'd visit China in April, with Mr Xi to visit the US towards the end of the year. How we got here In a December memo, TikTok said ByteDance - the social media app's Chinese owner - will retain a 19.9% stake in US operations. Reuters reports that Silver Lake, Oracle and MGX will each be managing investors with 15% stake each, with Adam Presser serving as the joint venture's chief. The decision will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law in 2024 that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied.

In 2024, Mr Trump voiced his opposition to a ban on the platform, despite having signed an executive order during his first term which would effectively ban the app. The TikTok deal comes as multiple countries around the world - including the UK - are considering a potential Australian-style ban on social media use for under-16s."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Retail sales in the UK bounced back in December with a better-than-expected performance over the Christmas season, according to new figures. The total volume of retail sales, which measures the quantity bought, increased by 0.4% last month, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While the rise is small, it's well above the 0.1% drop forecast by economists polled by the Reuters news agency. Money blog: World's most powerful passports ranked The figures are a positive sign for retailers, who can often rely on trading during the key Christmas month to fund operations for the rest of the year. It comes after an online trading boost, with sales across internet retailers rising by 4.4% - the biggest rise since last February - thanks to strong demand for gold and silver after a lull in November. Retail sales figures matter as they measure household consumption, the largest expenditure in the UK economy. \n                  Uncertain future for 33 Russell & Bromley shops after Next buys shoe chain\n                 \n                  Under-fire WH Smith holds Court in search for next chair\n                 \n                  Next puts best foot forward in pursuit of Russell & Bromley \n                 Growing retail sales can mean economic growth, which the government has repeatedly said is its top priority. The latest figures hint that consumers may have shaken off their pre-budget worries. The late date of the budget (26 November) and speculation over its content had contributed to the economy contracting in October, the ONS said. Why the rise in sales? Part of the latest retail sales increase was down to demand for metals like gold and silver from online jewellers, the ONS said. The price of both materials reached record highs during December, meaning it was more expensive to buy than before. A similar trend of people looking to buy gold was seen in September. Investors tend to move money out of shares and into perceived safe-haven investments, like gold, amid political and international uncertainty. As many department stores noted, the official figures showed there was a big drop-off in people buying household goods. Consumers did, however, turn in big numbers to online shops, street stalls and markets. Sales in these so-called \"non-store retailers\" rose 4.2% last month, the figures show. The bigger picture Across the 12 months to December, retail sales also defied expectations, rising 2.5%. Only a 1.1% increase had been expected by the Reuters poll of economists. But when looked at on a three-monthly basis, from October to December, the period described as the golden quarter for retailers, there was a 0.3% contraction compared to the previous three months. The prior three months, from July to September, had been strong for the shops due to good weather and the UEFA Women's Euros. For 2025 as a whole, sales volumes remained below pre-COVID pandemic levels, having not fully recovered from a 2023 fall, when there was double-digit inflation."

Sky News has seen a letter from Michael Healy, the UK managing director of IG Group, in which he argues that cash ISAs \"have become too popular relative to their economic utility, serving for too long as the default for savings despite yielding poor long-term returns and contributing little to productive investment or individual wealth accumulation\". His letter to the chancellor was sent earlier this week, days after rival AJ Bell lambasted the Treasury's move to cut the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £12,000 next year, saying the proposals were \"doomed to fail in their aim of encouraging more people to invest for the long term\". Money blog: World's most powerful passports ranked - as UK's position changes A heated meeting between industry players and officials from the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs last week saw a deluge of criticism of the proposed reforms. However, Mr Healy, whose company has roughly 900,000 customers in the UK, said rivals' views were \"symbolic of a deeper reluctance within parts of our industry to embrace change, even when the status quo is demonstrably failing most people in the UK as well as the economy\". \"There remains a strong instinct to defend existing structures, irrespective of their long-term efficacy,\" Mr Healy wrote. He argued that cash ISAs should be phased out altogether, rather than simply having their annual allowance curtailed. And he said that industry peers were deliberately mischaracterising the intention of the government's proposals. \"Suggestions that the reforms will perversely drive people into Cash ISAs ahead of the change miss the fundamental point. \"Policy nudges are exactly what is required to shift this equilibrium, and savers are not left without options - Premium Bonds remain available, and older savers, who formed the main basis of the argument against cutting the ISA allowance, have been allowed to retain a £20k limit.\" \"We are also concerned by the strength of industry resistance to addressing the issue of uninvested cash sitting in Stocks and Shares ISAs,\" he wrote, addressing one of the principal complaints of senior industry figures who have argued that taxing cash balances in non-cash ISAs would risk undermining the products' positioning as a tax-free savings haven altogether. Read more from Sky News:Trump-backed investors finalise TikTok dealSurprise bounceback in December sales \"This is a solvable challenge,\" Mr Healy wrote. \"With clear, proportionate rules that distinguish between transactional cash and long-term idle balances, and with reporting burdens placed on platforms and HMRC rather than on consumers, this problem does not need to be an obstacle. \"We reiterate our belief that the ISA wrapper should, over time, be reserved for investments alone. \"This would deliver the simplicity that critics of reform frequently claim to want, but with an alignment of incentives that better serves savers, investors, and the UK economy. \"We strongly encourage the government not only to hold its nerve but to go further in recalibrating tax-advantaged savings towards long-term investment.\""

The government has withdrawn a debate and votes in the House of Lords due on Monday in the latest round of parliamentary \"ping pong\" on the Chagos legislation. Welcoming the move, a jubilant shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel declared: \"This is a major victory for everyone standing against Keir Starmer's disgraceful Chagos surrender.\" Peers had been due to debate motions passed in the Commons on Tuesday overturning Lords amendments to the Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill.  Earlier this month, the Lords inflicted four defeats on the government over the bill, demanding stopping payments to Mauritius, a referendum, costings and a parliamentary veto. Last weekend, US President Donald Trump branded the deal \"an act of great stupidity\" and a sign of \"total weakness\", prompting Kemi Badenoch to taunt Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs: \"We didn't need President Trump to tell us that. We've been saying that for 12 months.\" In Tuesday's Commons debate overturning the Lords amendments, rebel Labour MP Graham Stringer called on the government to pause the Chagos deal. In response to the postponement of Monday's debate, Ms Patel posted on X: \"In the face of relentless Conservative pressure, Labour have pulled their shameful Chagos Surrender Bill from Monday's House of Lords order paper... The deal, which hands British sovereign territory and £35 billion to an ally of China, should be dropped altogether. \"The Conservatives will continue to fight the surrender every step of the way.\" Defending the Conservatives' determination to block the bill, shadow Foreign Office spokesman Lord Callanan said: \"We are carrying out our constitutional duty to scrutinise bad legislation. \"It is Labour that are irresponsible and reckless for asking Parliament to pass a bill that risks breaking international law. \"The government admitted they need to amend the 1966 Treaty with the USA on 22 December, but still haven't concluded that work. \"This bill, which will cost the British people £35 billion and fundamentally threatens our national security, cannot proceed.\" Read more:What is in the Chagos Islands deal and why is it controversial?Trump's Chagos broadside leaves Starmer walking thinner tightrope But the government denied it was in retreat, confirming Monday's withdrawal from Lords debates but insisting the business would be rescheduled. \"The government remains fully committed to the deal to secure the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, which is vital for our national security,\" a spokesperson told Sky News. \"This is irresponsible and reckless behaviour by peers, whose roles is to check legislation, not interfere with our national security priorities.\" Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app On the Conservative claim that the deal breaches international law, the spokesperson added: \"This is complete nonsense. The deal fully complies with international law.\" A Labour source in the Lords revealed to Sky News that Monday's debate was withdrawn because the Conservatives tabled a wrecking amendment late on Friday. The source insisted the debate would be rescheduled and chief whip Lord Kennedy would determine when, in consultation with others in government - but it is expected to be in the next few weeks. \"It is simply a response to Tory peers having flexed their much greater numbers in the House by tabling a wrecking amendment to a government bill just hours before the end of business ahead of a scheduled debate on the next sitting day,\" the source said."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n I have rarely seen Sir Keir Starmer angry.  He is a politician who keeps his emotions buttoned up - in public, at least. But he was clearly brimming with anger as he called US President Donald Trump out for his \"insulting and frankly appalling\" remarks over non-US troops that served in Afghanistan. Trump latest - prince joins condemnation Sir Keir had been in Chequers overnight after hosting his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, for bilateral talks over Greenland and NATO, coming back to Downing Street on Friday morning amid growing national fury over Mr Trump's disgraceful slur about NATO troops. The prime minister, in his strongest rebuke yet to Mr Trump, was highly critical of his claim that NATO troops in Afghanistan \"stayed a little off the front lines\". For the record, 1,160 non-US coalition soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, and thousands more were wounded, some suffering life-changing injuries. A total of 457 British troops died in combat alongside US forces. That Mr Trump casually belittled those sacrifices has provoked an outpouring of anger and universal condemnation. It is an insult not just to our forces, but to a relationship forged from common language, and exceptionally close cultural, political, military and economic ties over decades. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 In making such offensive remarks, on the heels of threats over sanctions and invasions of a Nato ally, the so-called special relationship is fast becoming a toxic one. For a prime minister, whose first job is the security of this nation and people, a fellow leader insulting his armed forces is a low blow, and I'm told that Mr Starmer wanted to make his position very clear and to speak up for the UK's armed forces. Up until now, he has only ever condemned Mr Trump's comments or actions as wrong. The spell has been broken His comments on Friday were a clear step change as he strongly criticised Mr Trump personally and suggested the US president should apologise. As for the fallout, Downing Street's approach will be to try to continue along as it was, sticking to Britain's principles and values and co-operating with the US on defence, security and intelligence. But there is no doubt that this past week has broken the spell. An increasingly toxic partner Mr Trump's increasingly erratic and outlandish behaviour has left Sir Keir with no other option than to shift away from an approach of 'Trump containment' to calling him out. In other circumstances, a prime minister who has made a great play of Trump management only to see relations sour so badly could be in the firing line. Where he has cover is in the universal condemnation of Mr Trump from all political leaders If anything, Sir Keir will come under more pressure to increase his hostility towards our increasingly toxic partner, the US. Read more on Sky News:Trump's comments 'insulting' - PMDavos was 'hijacked' by one man Allies of his were at pains to stress this is not the beginning of the end of the special relationship, but it is equally true that the events of the past week have made that bond feel far less stable. Sir Keir was already looking to deepen and tighten ties with Europe. After the behaviour of the Trump White House this week, he perhaps wants to turbocharge it."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has said Donald Trump's claims British troops were not on the frontline in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\" - and suggested he should apologise. Veterans and their families, as well as MPs from all parties, have reacted with fury after the US president said NATO troops stayed \"a little off the frontlines\" in Afghanistan. In an interview with Fox News in Davos, Mr Trump repeated his criticism, saying he was not \"sure\" the military alliance would \"be there if we ever needed them\". He added: \"We've never needed them. They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.\" On Friday afternoon, Sir Keir said: \"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling. \"And I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.\" He added that if he had said something like that, he would \"certainly apologise\". Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Trump was \"wrong\" to diminish the role of NATO and British troops in Afghanistan. The prime minister's official spokesman said UK forces had served alongside the US and NATO in \"sustained combat operations\". Pointing to the 457 British deaths in Afghanistan and the \"many hundreds\" more who were wounded, he added: \"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.\" America is the only NATO member to have invoked the collective security provisions of its Article 5 clause - that an attack against one member is an attack on all. Trump's remarks 'the ultimate insult' Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries when his vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan in 2006, said the US president's comments were \"the ultimate insult\". Mr Parkinson is widely viewed as the most severely injured British soldier to have survived the war. The blast left the former lance bombardier with both legs amputated, a twisted spine and brain damage. His mother said: \"I can assure you, the Taliban didn't plant IEDs [improvised explosive devices] miles and miles back from the front line. \"Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads - 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation. \"To hear this man say: 'Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the front lines'... It's the ultimate insult.\" She said Sir Keir Starmer has \"got to stand up for his own armed forces and he's got to absolutely refute what Donald Trump said\". \"Call him out,\" she added. US correspondent Trump's words will be a gut punch for the families of the 1,160 non-American coalition soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.  It will be a gut punch too for the thousands more who were wounded fighting this war, many left without limbs. And it will be a gut punch to the soldiers of so many nations who stood up to fight alongside American soldiers on the frontlines and for whom not a day will pass without them thinking about their experiences in that war. Afghanistan was America's war. America's friends stood up and answered the call for support after 9/11. For over two decades America's allies would continue with that support in an increasing futile conflict. I spent time with British and Danish soldiers in Helmand Province in 2007. They were very much on the frontline. The Danish lost more soldiers in Afghanistan per capita than any other NATO nation. Battles in towns like Sangin, Musa Qala, Babaji and Nad Ali are etched in the memories of the many who were there and the many families of those who didn't come back. Britons remember what became a desperately sad routine: coffins draped in the Union flag passing through the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett as the fallen were repatriated and returned to their loved ones. 457 British service men and women died in Afghanistan. Trump dodged the draft for the Vietnam War five times. He was a student for four of his five call ups, allowing him to legally avoid the draft. And for the fifth call-up, he obtained a doctor's note for 'bone spurs'. Tap here to read Mark's full piece. 'We shed blood, sweat and tears' Defence minister Al Carns said: \"I served five tours in Afghanistan, many alongside my American colleagues. We shed blood, sweat and tears together. Not everybody came home. \"These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting the US, our shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\" The former commando, who served five tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry, said Mr Trump's comments were \"ridiculous\", adding: \"Many courageous and honourable service personnel from many nations fought on the front line. Many fought way beyond it.\" Robert Dicketts, whose son Oliver Dicketts, 27, was killed while serving with the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan in 2006, said: \"When I read it, I thought, 'What a bloody cheek!'. \"I think my thoughts about Donald Trump are probably unprintable. \"To put it politely, Donald Trump's knowledge of history is lacking considerably.\" 'Heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation' The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the Afghanistan conflict. The US saw 2,461 deaths. America's allies suffered 1,160 deaths during the conflict - around a third of the total coalition deaths. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.\" Trump is 'plainly wrong' Social care minister Stephen Kinnock also pointed to the fact that the only time NATO's Article 5 clause - a call for allies to come to a member's defence - had been activated \"was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11\". \"And many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European and NATO allies gave their lives in support of American missions, American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he said. \"I am incredibly proud of our armed forces. They have put their lives on the line for our country. They are the definition of honour and valour and patriotism - and anybody who seeks to criticise what they have done and the sacrifices they make is plainly wrong,\" Mr Kinnock added. Ben McBean lost two limbs while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan. The former commando said: \"If someone's speaking the truth, you don't mind, but when it's completely rubbish, it offends you. I was on the frontline every day that I was there. \"I have to live like this. I have to try and raise my family with these injuries. Things are difficult mentally, physically and emotionally, and to have someone who can't even fight sleep sit there and just say 'you guys were slightly further back', along with other nations, is offensive.\" 'We have always been there' Dame Emily Thornberry MP, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Trump's comments were \"an insult\" to the families of those who died and \"so much more than a mistake\". Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, Dame Emily said: \"How dare he say we weren't on the frontline, how dare he. \"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us; we have always been there.\" In a social media post, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey MP said: \"Trump avoided military service five times. \"How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed.\" Josh Babarinde, Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne, wrote in a post on X: \"[Donald Trump] can go f**k himself. \"Anyone who mocks, demeans or minimises the sacrifices of British troops is no friend of our nation.\" \"The US is a historic friend of the UK's - but not this guy,\" he said, referring to Mr Trump. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the sacrifice of British and other NATO troops deserved respect, not denigration, adding his comments were \"complete nonsense\" which could weaken the NATO alliance. \"I spoke to parents of young men who had lost their lives in Afghanistan, and I think it is a disgrace to denigrate their memory like that,\" she said. Mrs Badenoch said there was \"too much careless talk from President Trump\" and \"we mustn't have these sort of throwaway comments that actually weaken the strong relationship between those countries in the alliance\". 'I saw the sacrifices made by British soldiers' Tory MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\". He said: \"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers I served alongside in Sangin, where we suffered horrific casualties, as did the US Marines the following year. \"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump promises Greenland 'deal' will be 'amazing' for USIs president's peace board a new UN or a gang of friends? Former UK ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Nicholas Kay told Sky News the US president was \"wrong\" and he \"clearly does not value and appreciate NATO in the same way he ought to\". \"The president is wrong. He is not known for his respect for other people, and he is not known for his accuracy with facts, and I'm afraid this is another example,\" he said. Last year, US vice president JD Vance hit back at claims of \"disrespecting\" British troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after suggesting a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine would be \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". At the time, only the UK and France had pledged troops to a potential peacekeeping force."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Labour's high command is attempting to bounce Andy Burnham into a super-quick decision on a Commons by-election comeback, giving him just 24 hours to decide. The party has published a timetable, with the whole selection process being completed next Saturday, suggesting Labour could be planning a dash to the polls as early as next month. As the prime minister's popularity has plunged in opinion polls, allies have urged Mr Burnham - Labour's king of the north - to return to the Commons, potentially to seize Sir Keir Starmer's crown. Today he received a top endorsement when former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said Mr Burnham should be allowed to stand in the forthcoming by-election. But in an announcement at 5pm on Friday, the party's ruling national executive declared that he has only until 5pm on Saturday to seek permission to stand as a by-election candidate. That means he only has hours to make up his mind on a decision that will make or break his political career: whether to stand in the looming Gorton and Denton by-election, or wait for another opportunity. As well as the 24-hour ultimatum facing Mr Burnham, the rest of the timetable for the by-election is brutally short. Applications opened at 5pm on Friday and will close at midnight on Sunday night. A longlist of candidates, probably six, will be drawn up on Monday by a selection panel, shortlisting interviews will be held on Tuesday and hustings and selection will take place next Saturday. If Mr Burnham does apply and is selected, the constituency in Greater Manchester, where Mr Burnham has been mayor since 2017, is set to host the most high-profile box-office by-election in decades. Read more from Sky News:Trump should apologise over Nato claims, PM suggestsFormer Tory councillor admits drugging and raping ex-wifeCelebrities attend Valentino funeral The by-election has been triggered by the resignation on health grounds of former minister Andrew Gwynne, who was revealed last year to have sent racist and sexist WhatsApp messages. But although Labour is defending a majority of 13,413, and won more than 50% of the vote at the general election, Mr Burnham faces several hurdles and a \"stop Burnham\" campaign by allies of the prime minister. At Labour's conference last autumn, Mr Burnham faced a backlash from Starmer loyalists after criticising the government and claiming that he had been urged by Labour MPs to stand for leader. As well as a rule stating that elected mayors must seek the permission of the national executive before seeking nomination as a parliamentary candidate, Mr Burnham would have to quit as mayor. That would trigger a costly election for his successor, which Labour could lose, given the unpopularity of Sir Keir's government and the current surge in support for Reform UK and the Green Party. Also, if the national executive bows to pressure from a \"stop Burnham\" campaign, it could thwart Mr Burnham by imposing a women-only or black, Asian and minority ethnic-only shortlist. Another risk is that even if he is Labour's by-election candidate, he could lose. That would almost certainly mean the end of his political career, since there would be no second chance to challenge Sir Keir. In a by-election last year in Runcorn and Helsby, Reform UK, second in Gorton and Denton in 2024, overturned a Labour majority of 14,696 and won by a wafer-thin majority of just six votes. If he stands in Gordon and Denton, Mr Burnham could also be opposed by George Galloway, who defeated Labour in a 2024 by-election in Rochdale, and Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader."

It comes after the MP, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK last week, claimed Tory chief whip Rebecca Harris contacted him in 2024 to say there was \"a special place in hell\" for him. He alleged Ms Harris \"messaged me with a litany of insults\" after he wrote an article for the Mail on Sunday, in which he called for the UK's foreign aid budget to be halved to fund an increase in defence spending. When quizzed about the allegation, Mrs Badenoch said Mr Jenrick was \"lying\" about the exchange and said it was her party's policy to spend more money on the British military and \"take it away from aid\". Mrs Badenoch told GB News earlier on Friday: \"He's lying. And I think it's a real shame he's being allowed to air these views. He's left the party – it's time for him to move on.\" But hours later, Mr Jenrick posted an image of messages purporting to be from Ms Harris, which he captioned with the words: \"They still won't tell the truth.\" According to the purported texts, the chief whip told Mr Jenrick: \"This is actual feedback / Leave the party and be a commentator... Go away... You're a bloodsucker. \"You have a really special place in hell\". She allegedly continued: \"Running us down in public just to feel good on heaven knows what basis / if you aren't happy with the direction of travel fine – please use your party connections to deal with it but not in public – best announce you and Suella [Braverman] are stranding [sic] down now.\" \"You've lost the plot,\" Ms Harris appears to add.

Instead, they show a government whip trying to reason with someone who was working with the 'Grid of Shit' plotters, and whose scheming helped contribute to a Labour landslide and the worst result for the Conservative Party in its history. \"With his love of backstabbing and psychodrama, Jenrick will fit right in with Reform.\" The row is the latest twist in a heated war of words between Mr Jenrick and his former party following his defection. Despite the apparent reference to Ms Braverman in the text by Ms Harris, she remains a member of the Conservatives and has not left the party."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The London-listed trading and investing platform IG Group has broken ranks with industry rivals by backing Rachel Reeves's plans to overhaul Britain's most popular savings product. Sky News has seen a letter from Michael Healy, the UK managing director of IG Group, in which he argues that cash ISAs \"have become too popular relative to their economic utility, serving for too long as the default for savings despite yielding poor long-term returns and contributing little to productive investment or individual wealth accumulation\". His letter to the chancellor was sent earlier this week, days after rival AJ Bell lambasted the Treasury's move to cut the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £12,000 next year, saying the proposals were \"doomed to fail in their aim of encouraging more people to invest for the long term\". Money blog: World's most powerful passports ranked - as UK's position changes A heated meeting between industry players and officials from the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs last week saw a deluge of criticism of the proposed reforms. However, Mr Healy, whose company has roughly 900,000 customers in the UK, said rivals' views were \"symbolic of a deeper reluctance within parts of our industry to embrace change, even when the status quo is demonstrably failing most people in the UK as well as the economy\". \"There remains a strong instinct to defend existing structures, irrespective of their long-term efficacy,\" Mr Healy wrote. He argued that cash ISAs should be phased out altogether, rather than simply having their annual allowance curtailed. And he said that industry peers were deliberately mischaracterising the intention of the government's proposals. \"Suggestions that the reforms will perversely drive people into Cash ISAs ahead of the change miss the fundamental point. \"Policy nudges are exactly what is required to shift this equilibrium, and savers are not left without options - Premium Bonds remain available, and older savers, who formed the main basis of the argument against cutting the ISA allowance, have been allowed to retain a £20k limit.\" \"We are also concerned by the strength of industry resistance to addressing the issue of uninvested cash sitting in Stocks and Shares ISAs,\" he wrote, addressing one of the principal complaints of senior industry figures who have argued that taxing cash balances in non-cash ISAs would risk undermining the products' positioning as a tax-free savings haven altogether. Read more from Sky News:Trump-backed investors finalise TikTok dealSurprise bounceback in December sales \"This is a solvable challenge,\" Mr Healy wrote. \"With clear, proportionate rules that distinguish between transactional cash and long-term idle balances, and with reporting burdens placed on platforms and HMRC rather than on consumers, this problem does not need to be an obstacle. \"We reiterate our belief that the ISA wrapper should, over time, be reserved for investments alone. \"This would deliver the simplicity that critics of reform frequently claim to want, but with an alignment of incentives that better serves savers, investors, and the UK economy. \"We strongly encourage the government not only to hold its nerve but to go further in recalibrating tax-advantaged savings towards long-term investment.\""

        "Content": "A major winter storm is set to sweep the United States this weekend, bringing with it snow, sleet, ice and sub-zero temperatures from the Arizona-New Mexico border to upstate New York. What is it? A winter storm is defined as a combination of heavy snow, blowing snow and/or dangerous wind chills, according to the NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, which also describes it as \"life-threatening\". The approaching storm is due to an area of low pressure moving up from the Gulf of Mexico (bringing lots of moisture) and meeting extremely cold Arctic air plunging south from Canada. The winter storm set to hit the US comes with warnings of ice. An ice storm is one which results in the accumulation of at least a quarter of an inch of ice on exposed surfaces - creating hazardous driving and walking conditions and the threat of downed power lines and trees. Where is it heading? The National Weather Service has warned communities the \"significant, long-duration winter storm\" will bring \"widespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Southern Rockies to New England\" - lasting from Friday until Monday, and to prepare for \"bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills\". The storm is expected to bring a crippling ice storm from Texas through parts of the South, potentially around 30cm (12ins) of snow from Oklahoma through Washington DC, New York and Boston. Then a final punch of bitterly cold air could plunge wind chill temperatures to -46C (-50F) in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota. Forecasters are warning the damage, especially in areas hit by heavy snowfall and ice, could rival a hurricane. \"The storm will cause significant to locally catastrophic ice accumulations with the potential for long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions,\" the NWS said. \"In the wake of the storm, communities from the Southern Plains to the Northeast will contend with bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills. This will cause prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.\" Millions braced for 'catastrophic' winter storm About 160 million people - nearly half the population of the United States - are under a variety of watches, warnings and alerts. The alerts stretch from Arizona and Montana in the west to the Carolinas and Maine in the east. So far, 12 states have declared states of emergency ahead of the winter storm. These include Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Missouri. What has the federal response been? The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has pre-positioned supplies and is deploying more than 200 call centre specialists across the country ahead of the winter storm, according to an agency document obtained by Sky's US partner network NBC News. The document said supplies and equipment include 250,000 meals, 400,000 litres of water, 30 generators and 12 shuttle drivers at Camp Minden, Louisiana. A further 24 shuttle drivers are being deployed at distribution centres in Greencastle, Pennsylvania; 12 in Fort Worth, Texas; and 22 in Atlanta to quickly move commodities. A total of 28 search and rescue teams are also on standby. FEMA's National Response Coordination Center and regional centres are activated. What have people been told to do? Residents have been advised to stay at home and off the roads and to prepare by stocking up on food and drink supplies. \"Items like flashlights, batteries, and battery back-ups can make all the difference,\" the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management said in a social media post. Items including mobile phone chargers, radios, winter clothing, blankets and a first-aid kit should also be added to households' emergency kits. It warned people should never run a generator inside a house or garage to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency said people should regularly check the weather forecast for any changes and gather emergency supplies for both their homes and cars, check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and refuel cars and heating sources. It also said people should check in on neighbours and family, properly ventilate emergency heat sources, keep generators 20ft from homes and to be careful while shovelling snow and ice."

        "Content": "The US and China have signed off on a deal for TikTok's Chinese owner to hand over the company's American division to investors backed by Donald Trump. It means the US version of TikTok will become majority-owned by a group of investors that includes American tech giant Oracle, California-based private equity fund Silver Lake, and United Arab Emirates investment firm MGX. The deal will ensure the video platform can continue operating in the US and comes just ahead of a takeover deadline set by the Trump administration that was extended several times. Writing on Truth Social after the deal's announcement, Mr Trump said he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!\". He went on to thank China's Xi Jinping for not blocking the deal, and later told reporters aboard Air Force One he'd visit China in April, with Mr Xi to visit the US towards the end of the year. How we got here In a December memo, TikTok said ByteDance - the social media app's Chinese owner - will retain a 19.9% stake in US operations. Reuters reports that Silver Lake, Oracle and MGX will each be managing investors with 15% stake each, with Adam Presser serving as the joint venture's chief. The decision will end years of uncertainty over the app's future in the States, after Joe Biden signed a law in 2024 that required TikTok's Chinese owners to sell up - or else it would be blocked. The law was introduced amid concerns from some US politicians that ByteDance might share user data with the Chinese government, despite repeated assurances from the firm that it would not. Critics also expressed fears that Chinese authorities may be able to manipulate TikTok's algorithms and shape what content users see and are influenced by. This claim was also denied.

        "Content": "Stars of the runway and the screen have said farewell to fashion designer Valentino at a church service in Rome. The biggest names ​in fashion - including Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Maria Grazia Chiuri - gathered in the Basilica di Santa ⁠Maria degli Angeli on Friday for the funeral. The couturier, who built one of ⁠Italy's most celebrated fashion houses, died on Monday aged 93, with the news being met by an outpouring of tributes from global celebrities. The crowd of mourners - which included actresses Anne Hathaway and Elizabeth Hurley and models Natalia Vodianova and Bianca Brandolini d'Adda - was dotted with splashes of his signature colour \"Valentino red\". The mourners also included Vogue's global editorial director Anna Wintour, American socialite Olivia Palermo and Valentino's current creative director Alessandro Michele and his predecessor Pierpaolo Piccioli. Valentino's chief executive Riccardo Bellini, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, Antoine Arnault, the eldest son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and Rachid Mohamed Rachid, ‌chief executive of Mayhoola, also attended. Valentino's co-founder Giancarlo Giammetti, dressed in ​a tailored black satin suit, and his partner, ​Bruce Hoeksema, accompanied the wooden coffin as it entered the church, drawing applause from the crowd outside. \n                  Cara Delevingne reveals how Topshop inspired her fashion sense - as brand relaunches in London\n                 \n                  Online fashion marketplace Trouva pauses trading and hunts buyer\n                 \n                  Basic questions unanswered by Shein at Business and Trade Committee despite firm eyeing London listing\n                 \"Through him, I discovered beauty, a beauty that followed us throughout our lives, that has kept us busy. We met when we were kids, we dreamed the same dreams, ‌we managed to realise some of them, I would even say many of them,\" Mr Giammetti said in ‌his eulogy. Mr Hoeksema said: \"You ​were beside me when words were not needed. Life was not always perfect, but it was real. One day at a time, for more than 40 years.\" Valentino dresses became a fixture of Hollywood red carpets - with Julia Roberts, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lopez and Cate Blanchett among the stars to have worn his designs. Other famous names included Princess Diana, Queen Rania of Jordan, and former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy - who wore his dresses throughout her mourning period for John F Kennedy. Hundreds gathered at the basilica, which was designed by Michelangelo and built on the ruins of ancient Roman baths, and famed for the red of its marbled walls and columns. More than 10,000 people have paid their respects to ​Valentino over the past two days as he lay in state in Rome's Piazza Mignanelli, next to his fashion house's historical headquarters. Born Valentino Garavani, in Voghera, northern Italy, he became known simply as Valentino - sharing the name with his eponymous fashion line."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       He is the Lewisham-born actor who, at the age of 73, finds himself in the running for an Oscar. While Delroy Lindo can now reflect that being an Oscar nominee \"has a certain ring to it\", the Sinners star says he was taken by surprise at the news when it first broke. \"My son called me,\" he explains. \"I will not say I was asleep, but I was not fully awake, and I'm listening to my son very excitedly say how proud of me he was. \"And I then noticed on my phone I had 179 Text messages, so I knew that something was up.\"  While he says he is happy for viewers in the UK to \"absolutely\" root for him in the best supporting actor category on Oscars night, the Sinners star - who moved to the US in his teens - says he no longer considers himself a Brit. \"My career has been birthed and nurtured in America,\" said Lindo. \"I was born in Lewisham hospital, my family's from Jamaica, and my mom was part of the Windrush generation. I am British to that extent, that is my reality. \"[But] I thank God I came to America, that I went to acting school in America, that I was a New York-based theatre actor for 10 years before I started doing film, and I thank God Spike Lee saw me on Broadway.\" As an actor who has quietly built a career of elevating whatever project he's in, some of Lindo's most unforgettable work has been with Lee. In films like Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers and Da 5 Bloods, he's played men shaped by power, anger and history. While, arguably, the recognition is long overdue, his performance in Ryan Coogler's vampire horror Sinners is a stand-out one. His role as the world-weary blues musician Delta Slim is one of the most layered characters of the piece - and one of the most talked about moments in the Jim Crow-era horror is the monologue Lindo delivers about a friend who was lynched. \"I started hearing from audiences how that scene was resonating for them, and at that point I knew there was something of real value,\" he explains. \"The fact that Ryan gifted me that monologue in the car, that's really rich stuff for any actor to wrestle with.\" Read more from Sky News:Oscar nominations: The biggest snubs and surprisesOscar nominations 2026: The full list of stars and films Regardless of how many awards Sinners wins, with its record-breaking 16 nominations it has already made it into the Oscars history books. Whatever happens, Lindo says he's looking forward to celebrating all that he and his co-stars have already achieved. The Oscars takes place in Los Angeles on 15 March."
