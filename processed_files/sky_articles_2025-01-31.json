        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he will place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China from Saturday. The move raises fears of price increases for US consumers as the US president suggested he would try to blunt the impact on oil imports. He has been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater co-operation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. And he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing.

Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could cut inflation, but tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, car, lumber and agricultural sectors. Mr Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports. \"I'm probably going to reduce the tariff a little bit on that,\" Mr Trump said. \"We think we're going to bring it down to 10%.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. US daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day. China responded aggressively to tariffs Mr Trump imposed on Chinese goods during his first term, targeting the president's supporters in rural America with retaliatory taxes on US farm exports. Both Canada and Mexico have said they have prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: \"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"  Read more:UK 'not the target' of Trump's tariffs as free trade deal talks could be back on the cards Mr Trudeau said tariffs would have \"disastrous consequences\" for the US, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Mr Trump's team since before he returned to the White House. But she emphasised that Mexico has a \"plan A, plan B, plan C for what the United States government decides\". \"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she added. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said the two countries should resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation. \"There is no winner in a trade war or tariff war, which serves the interests of neither side nor the world,\" Mr Liu said in a statement. \"Despite the differences, our two countries share huge common interests and space for co-operation.\" Mr Trump also spoke about a plan for tariffs on the European Union without giving specific details. He told reporters at the White House that he would \"absolutely\" put tariffs on the bloc, adding \"the European Union has treated us so terribly\"."

        "Content": "By Adam Parsons, news correspondent, in Ramallah   One of the most high-profile prisoners to be released by Israel has told Sky News that the world has ignored Palestinians and says Britain is one of the countries he blames for taking away his freedom. Zakaria Zubeidi was imprisoned in 2019 after being found guilty by an Israeli military court of involvement in terrorism. He was released as part of the ceasefire agreement and welcomed back to the West Bank by crowds of well-wishers, including the man who was prime minister less than a year ago. Analysis: Zubeidi an 'extremist' to Israel but inspiration to Palestine  In his first interview with a European broadcaster, Zubeidi told Sky News he still believes in \"a resistance that will lead us to freedom\" but claimed that Israeli occupation of the West Bank was wholly down to the international community. \"My life is worthless without freedom,\" he said, speaking in Ramallah. \"Freedom has no price. But the world that has denied me my freedom - particularly Britain, France, and the United States - must return what they have taken from me and my children. \n                  Emily Damari: Freed British-Israeli hostage tells PM she was held in United Nations facilities and denied access to medical care\n                 \n                  Freed prisoner Zakaria Zubeidi a 'murderous extremist' to Israel but an inspiration to Palestinians\n                 \n                  Three Israelis and five Thai hostages freed in Gaza\n                 \"They are the ones who need to reconsider their mistakes, not me. \"They are the ones who have wronged us, and they should think about rectifying the harm they have caused to me and my children.\" Zubeidi, whose mother, brother and son have all died as a result of Israeli military action, has admitted involvement in a 2002 bombing that killed six people. However, he has also been acclaimed by many in the West Bank as a symbol of the resistance. He was famously part of a group of prisoners who briefly escaped their Israeli jail after using kitchen utensils to dig a tunnel. \"My message to the Palestinian people is to prioritise their safety and well-being because the assault being carried out against them is immense. I have no message for the occupation [Israel],\" he said. \"My message is to the world - the same world that granted the occupation the right to live on my land - to grant me my freedom.\" Read more:Trump's Gaza comments trigger tensions with supportersHamas names hostages it says will be released tomorrow In common with many other released prisoners, he claimed to have been beaten while behind bars, saying: \"The situation in Israeli prisons is extremely harsh. We've witnessed it all: severe beatings, attack dogs, relentless insults. Every form of abuse imaginable has been inflicted on the bodies of our prisoners.\" While many in Israel will consider Zubeidi to be a dangerous, murderous extremist, he is considered a totemic figure in the West Bank, and a natural leader in Jenin, where he grew up in a refugee camp. After being released, Israeli authorities banned him from returning to Jenin. Instead, he has remained in Ramallah, where a long line of people came to a school building to shake his hand and hug him. Among them, former prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who resigned less than a year ago. He embraced Zubeidi and told Sky News the release of prisoners could be a catalyst for an enduring peace deal. \"We would like to see all prisoners released and we would like to see all hostages going home,\" said Mr Shtayyeh. He continued: \"It's a historic moment for everybody. It's time for this bloodshed to stop. And I think it is a moment of truth for everybody. \"In Gaza, 60,000 people have been killed, more than 120,000 have been injured. And of course, there have been so many casualties in Israel, too. \"We know that. And this time Palestinians are desperate for peace. We want a genuine peace process that does really bring peace and justice for everybody.\" More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Hamas-run authorities in Gaza, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive followed Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when it took 250 people hostage and killed around 1,200 others."

        "Content": " The Duke of York told Jeffrey Epstein they would \"play some more soon!\" two months after he claimed he cut contact with the convicted paedophile.  The emails were disclosed in a filing by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who are defending an appeal by former Barclays boss, Jes Staley. Staley is challenging a decision to ban him from the industry for misleading regulators on his ties to Epstein, one of the most severe measures the FCA can impose. The court documents show an exchange of messages between Epstein and \"a member of the British Royal Family\" - believed to be Prince Andrew. It suggests the duke and Epstein - who killed himself in jail in 2019 - were in contact for longer than he has previously admitted. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. After his release, Epstein and the duke were photographed walking together in New York's Central Park, in December 2010. The prince has claimed this was the last contact he had with Epstein. In a 2019 interview with Newsnight, Andrew said he visited Epstein in person to tell him they could no longer be friends, believing it was the \"honourable\" thing to do. \n                  The Royal Year: King Charles and Camilla \n                 \n                  Prince Andrew's Sandringham withdrawal a surprise, but he won't be out of mind\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew will not join rest of Royal Family for Christmas after Chinese 'spy' Yang Tengbo named\n                 Yet emails between the pair, which were handed to a court in London, show they kept exchanging messages until at least 27 February 2011. On this date, Andrew emailed Epstein: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!!!!\" The disgraced duke has come under fire for his relationship with the paedophile financier. In 2022, he settled a multi-million pound claim with Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the royal. Andrew stepped down from royal duties and public life and had claimed he never met Ms Giuffre. He agreed to settle the claim without admitting liability. He has previously strenuously denied all allegations against him. Newsnight interview 'ill-advised' - aide Other court documents released on Friday revealed one of the prince's senior aides admitted in a letter to an alleged Chinese spy that the duke's Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis was \"hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful\". Dominic Hampshire wrote to Yang Tengbo on Buckingham Palace notepaper in March 2020. In the letter, he said they \"have dealt with the aftermath of a hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful television interview\". Mr Hampshire praised Mr Yang, writing that \"in what originally seemed like a lost cause, you have somehow managed to not only salvage but maintain and then incredibly, enhance the reputation of my principal [Prince Andrew] in China. \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor; we orchestrated a very powerful verbal message of support to China at a Chinese New Year's dinner and between the three of us, we have written, amended and then always agreed a number of letters at the highest level possible.\" Mr Yang said in a statement on Friday the spying allegations against him are \"entirely unfounded\". The Jes Staley emails Emails showed Epstein inviting Andrew to meet Staley on 27 February, saying: \"jes staley will be in London on next tue afternoon, if you have time [sic].\" Andrew replied: \"Jes is coming on 1st March or next week?\" The pair then engaged in a discussion about press articles, before the duke told Epstein they would \"play some more soon\". Sky News has contacted Prince Andrew for a comment. Royal correspondent Just when you thought Prince Andrew couldn't fall any further, another twist emerges in his shameful association with Jeffrey Epstein. He'd claimed the last time he had contact with the convicted paedophile was in December 2010, when the pair were infamously photographed together in Central Park. The Duke of York insisted he thought he was being \"honourable\" when choosing to stay with Epstein and personally tell him they could no longer be friends. But this email suggests the pair stayed in touch beyond this date. We don't know for how long, but it leaves Prince Andrew once more facing difficult and damaging questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. And yet again, Andrew's judgement is under considerable scrutiny. Last year had ended badly for the disgraced Duke after his association with an alleged Chinese spy was exposed. He had to keep clear of the Royal Family's traditional Christmas day gathering at Sandringham. The Duke of York has always denied witnessing or suspecting any of Epstein's behaviour. But their friendship cost him his reputation. He now leads a reclusive life in Windsor, stripped of responsibility and royal roles. Yet still making uncomfortable headlines for the rest of his family."

        "Content": "An 18-year-old who crashed his car into a bus stop and seriously injured a four-year-old was sentenced to two years and two months in a young offenders institute. James Doherty, 18, was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on Friday for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Judge Peter Blair described the teenager as an \"idiot\" whose \"terrible driving\" had led to the incident. He was also banned from driving for four years and one month.  The court heard the teenager had arrived in England with his pregnant wife a week before the incident, had no driving licence or insurance, and purchased a BMW vehicle which had under-inflated rear tyres. At around 2pm on 17 November, Doherty drove around a corner in the Lawrence Weston area of Bristol too fast and crashed straight into a bus stop. A four-year-old boy who was waiting with his father and stepmother was left trapped under the vehicle, but Doherty and his wife, who was a passenger in the car, ran off from the scene. Later that day, Doherty handed himself in at a local police station. He then pleaded guilty at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 19 November. During sentencing, Judge Blair said: \"When you came round that corner, the rear of the vehicle that you had just acquired swung out. \"You countered that in an inappropriate way, which had you swinging the car right back across the road where there was a bus stop.\" The court also heard that when the victim's stepmother asked Doherty's wife for help to lift the car off him, she replied, \"no\". \"That was extraordinarily culpable and utterly cowardly, for which you should rightly feel incredible shame,\" the judge added, before explaining how the boy could have died from his injuries. \"He, in fact, has survived but he has suffered terribly in terms of pain through the treatment and the therapy that is going to be required for him for years.\" Prosecuting, Kaj Scarsbrook said the boy had injuries including collapsed lungs, a fractured pelvis, fractured ribs and a spinal fracture. His stepmother also sustained injuries to her leg. The boy's father told the court the incident's effect on the family has been \"indescribable\", and said he and the woman injured in the crash have experienced distressing flashbacks. His stepfather also said in court: \"This tragedy has affected our entire family. Emotionally, we are broken watching our child suffer every day.\" Doherty and his wife are expecting a baby, which is due to be born in April. Read more:Grenfell fire families sent letter about unidentified remainsJudges involved in Sara Sharif family court proceedings named Speaking after the case, Avon and Somerset Police's senior collision investigator David Paniccia-Brown said \"we feared the boy would not survive\" the collision, but \"fortunately he has pulled through\". She added: \"We want to thank the family for the dignity and composure they have shown throughout this upsetting case, the pain of which both mentally and physically will not end with any court sentence.\" The officer also thanked members of the public who helped free the boy from the vehicle, saying: \"It was a hugely distressing scene but they showed kindness and selflessness in a time of crisis and that should be recognised.\""

In the letter, he said they \"have dealt with the aftermath of a hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful television interview\". Mr Hampshire praised Mr Yang, writing that \"in what originally seemed like a lost cause, you have somehow managed to not only salvage but maintain and then incredibly, enhance the reputation of my principal [Prince Andrew] in China. \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor; we orchestrated a very powerful verbal message of support to China at a Chinese New Year's dinner and between the three of us, we have written, amended and then always agreed a number of letters at the highest level possible.\" Mr Yang said in a statement on Friday the spying allegations against him are \"entirely unfounded\". The Jes Staley emails Emails showed Epstein inviting Andrew to meet Staley on 27 February, saying: \"jes staley will be in London on next tue afternoon, if you have time [sic].\" Andrew replied: \"Jes is coming on 1st March or next week?\" The pair then engaged in a discussion about press articles, before the duke told Epstein they would \"play some more soon\". Sky News has contacted Prince Andrew for a comment. Royal correspondent Just when you thought Prince Andrew couldn't fall any further, another twist emerges in his shameful association with Jeffrey Epstein. He'd claimed the last time he had contact with the convicted paedophile was in December 2010, when the pair were infamously photographed together in Central Park. The Duke of York insisted he thought he was being \"honourable\" when choosing to stay with Epstein and personally tell him they could no longer be friends. But this email suggests the pair stayed in touch beyond this date. We don't know for how long, but it leaves Prince Andrew once more facing difficult and damaging questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. And yet again, Andrew's judgement is under considerable scrutiny. Last year had ended badly for the disgraced Duke after his association with an alleged Chinese spy was exposed. He had to keep clear of the Royal Family's traditional Christmas day gathering at Sandringham. The Duke of York has always denied witnessing or suspecting any of Epstein's behaviour. But their friendship cost him his reputation. He now leads a reclusive life in Windsor, stripped of responsibility and royal roles. Yet still making uncomfortable headlines for the rest of his family."

Eliza and Henrietta Huszti, both aged 32, were last spotted on CCTV in the city's Market Street at Victoria Bridge at about 2.12am on Tuesday 7 January. The women were seen crossing the bridge and turning right on to a footpath next to the River Dee in the direction of Aberdeen Boat Club. On Friday, it was confirmed a woman's body had been recovered from the water east of the club. Although the body is yet to be formally identified, Police Scotland said the family of Henrietta had been informed. The force added there were \"no apparent suspicious circumstances\", with searches ongoing for Eliza. The Police Scotland dive and marine unit, along with other specialist officers, are carrying out further searches of the river and the riverbanks between Queen Elizabeth Bridge and Victoria Bridge. Superintendent David Howieson said: \"Our thoughts are with the Huszti family today. We are keeping them fully updated following this recovery and the further search activity which is ongoing. \"Our priority remains finding both of the sisters and search has focused on the River Dee and will do so in the coming days. \"We are carrying out further searches of the river in the area where the body was recovered this morning. \"The river in this area is tidal and conditions are challenging but we will continue to search and make every effort to locate both of the sisters. \"We have sought guidance from a number of experts and this will continue to inform our search activity.\" Investigating officers previously said there had been \"no evidence\" of the women leaving the immediate area and there had been nothing to suggest \"suspicious circumstances or criminality\". The police revealed that the sisters - who are part of a set of triplets and originally from Hungary - visited the bridge where they were last seen about 12 hours before they disappeared. They also sent a text message to their landlady on the morning they vanished, indicating they would not be returning to the flat.

Emily Damari, 28, was taken hostage after being kidnapped from her home on 7 October 2023 by Hamas gunmen who shot her in the hand and leg, as well as killing her pet dog.

Israel and Hamas are exchanging hostages and prisoners as a fragile ceasefire holds in Gaza. Ofer Kalderon, Keith Samuel Siegel and Yarden Bibas will be released, Hamas armed wing spokesperson Abu Obeida said. Yarden was kidnapped alongside his wife, Shiri Babas, and their two sons, four-year-old Ariel and 10-month-old Kfir. He is believed to be the only family member left alive - in November 2023, Hamas said his wife and children had died in an Israeli airstrike before the current ceasefire."

        "Content": "An 18-year-old who crashed his car into a bus stop and seriously injured a four-year-old was sentenced to two years and two months in a young offenders institute. James Doherty, 18, was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on Friday for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Judge Peter Blair described the teenager as an \"idiot\" whose \"terrible driving\" had led to the incident. He was also banned from driving for four years and one month.  The court heard the teenager had arrived in England with his pregnant wife a week before the incident, had no driving licence or insurance, and purchased a BMW vehicle which had under-inflated rear tyres. At around 2pm on 17 November, Doherty drove around a corner in the Lawrence Weston area of Bristol too fast and crashed straight into a bus stop. A four-year-old boy who was waiting with his father and stepmother was left trapped under the vehicle, but Doherty and his wife, who was a passenger in the car, ran off from the scene. Later that day, Doherty handed himself in at a local police station. He then pleaded guilty at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 19 November. During sentencing, Judge Blair said: \"When you came round that corner, the rear of the vehicle that you had just acquired swung out. \"You countered that in an inappropriate way, which had you swinging the car right back across the road where there was a bus stop.\" The court also heard that when the victim's stepmother asked Doherty's wife for help to lift the car off him, she replied, \"no\". \"That was extraordinarily culpable and utterly cowardly, for which you should rightly feel incredible shame,\" the judge added, before explaining how the boy could have died from his injuries. \"He, in fact, has survived but he has suffered terribly in terms of pain through the treatment and the therapy that is going to be required for him for years.\" Prosecuting, Kaj Scarsbrook said the boy had injuries including collapsed lungs, a fractured pelvis, fractured ribs and a spinal fracture. His stepmother also sustained injuries to her leg. The boy's father told the court the incident's effect on the family has been \"indescribable\", and said he and the woman injured in the crash have experienced distressing flashbacks. His stepfather also said in court: \"This tragedy has affected our entire family. Emotionally, we are broken watching our child suffer every day.\" Doherty and his wife are expecting a baby, which is due to be born in April. Read more:Grenfell fire families sent letter about unidentified remainsJudges involved in Sara Sharif family court proceedings named Speaking after the case, Avon and Somerset Police's senior collision investigator David Paniccia-Brown said \"we feared the boy would not survive\" the collision, but \"fortunately he has pulled through\". She added: \"We want to thank the family for the dignity and composure they have shown throughout this upsetting case, the pain of which both mentally and physically will not end with any court sentence.\" The officer also thanked members of the public who helped free the boy from the vehicle, saying: \"It was a hugely distressing scene but they showed kindness and selflessness in a time of crisis and that should be recognised.\""

The investment, announced last year in the Tories' spring budget, was dependent on a \"mutual agreement\" with the Treasury and third parties, it was said at the time. It will no longer go ahead because Labour ministers have offered less funding than their predecessors, the pharmaceutical giant said. An AstraZeneca spokesperson told Sky News: \"Following discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke. \"Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal.\" The money would have expanded an existing site in Speke and was hailed at the time as a \"vote of confidence\" in Liverpool and the UK's life science sector.

The spokesperson added: \"All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution. \"AstraZeneca remains closely engaged with the government's work to develop our new industrial strategy, and more broadly we continue to have a thriving life sciences sector, worth Â£108 billion to the economy and providing over 300,000 highly skilled jobs across the country.\" The decision is a blow to Rachel Reeves's renewed attempts to deliver economic growth. In a speech earlier this week which named AstraZeneca, the chancellor said life sciences would be key to boosting the economy. She announced plans to deliver an Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor, which she claimed would add up to Â£78bn to the public coffers. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: \"There's no vaccine for incompetence. In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\" The new plant at Speke was intended to enhance the UK's pandemic preparedness. Reports that it was under threat emerged shortly after Labour won the general election, when ministers warned of the need to make cuts to infrastructure projects to fill a Â£22bn \"black hole\" in the public finances. The confirmation comes after former health secretary Matt Hancock said that the UK needed to improve its own vaccine manufacturing capability as a \"critical\" part of preparing for a future pandemic. Mr Hancock told the COVID Inquiry earlier in January that Britain's vaccine manufacturing capacity was \"weak\". He added: \"Having that manufacture and fill and finish onshore, physically within the UK, is critical in the way that it simply isn't in normal times.\""

Three rate cuts are now expected this year. A series of record-breaking closes were recorded in mid-January after a weak pound made buying shares with sterling cheaper. The cheaper cost increased demand and boosted share prices. What is the FTSE 100? The index is made up of many mining and international oil and gas companies, as well as UK banks and supermarkets.

Other well-known names include Rolls-Royce, Unilever, easyJet, BT Group and Next. FTSE stands for Financial Times Stock Exchange. If a company's share price drops significantly it can slip outside of the FTSE 100 and into the larger and more UK-based FTSE 250 index. The inverse works for the FTSE 250 companies, the 101st to 250th most valuable firms on the London Stock Exchange. If their share price rises significantly they could move into the FTSE 100.

        "Content": "By Adam Parsons, news correspondent, in Ramallah   One of the most high-profile prisoners to be released by Israel has told Sky News that the world has ignored Palestinians and says Britain is one of the countries he blames for taking away his freedom. Zakaria Zubeidi was imprisoned in 2019 after being found guilty by an Israeli military court of involvement in terrorism. He was released as part of the ceasefire agreement and welcomed back to the West Bank by crowds of well-wishers, including the man who was prime minister less than a year ago. Analysis: Zubeidi an 'extremist' to Israel but inspiration to Palestine  In his first interview with a European broadcaster, Zubeidi told Sky News he still believes in \"a resistance that will lead us to freedom\" but claimed that Israeli occupation of the West Bank was wholly down to the international community. \"My life is worthless without freedom,\" he said, speaking in Ramallah. \"Freedom has no price. But the world that has denied me my freedom - particularly Britain, France, and the United States - must return what they have taken from me and my children. \n                  Emily Damari: Freed British-Israeli hostage tells PM she was held in United Nations facilities and denied access to medical care\n                 \n                  Freed prisoner Zakaria Zubeidi a 'murderous extremist' to Israel but an inspiration to Palestinians\n                 \n                  Three Israelis and five Thai hostages freed in Gaza\n                 \"They are the ones who need to reconsider their mistakes, not me. \"They are the ones who have wronged us, and they should think about rectifying the harm they have caused to me and my children.\" Zubeidi, whose mother, brother and son have all died as a result of Israeli military action, has admitted involvement in a 2002 bombing that killed six people. However, he has also been acclaimed by many in the West Bank as a symbol of the resistance. He was famously part of a group of prisoners who briefly escaped their Israeli jail after using kitchen utensils to dig a tunnel. \"My message to the Palestinian people is to prioritise their safety and well-being because the assault being carried out against them is immense. I have no message for the occupation [Israel],\" he said. \"My message is to the world - the same world that granted the occupation the right to live on my land - to grant me my freedom.\" Read more:Trump's Gaza comments trigger tensions with supportersHamas names hostages it says will be released tomorrow In common with many other released prisoners, he claimed to have been beaten while behind bars, saying: \"The situation in Israeli prisons is extremely harsh. We've witnessed it all: severe beatings, attack dogs, relentless insults. Every form of abuse imaginable has been inflicted on the bodies of our prisoners.\" While many in Israel will consider Zubeidi to be a dangerous, murderous extremist, he is considered a totemic figure in the West Bank, and a natural leader in Jenin, where he grew up in a refugee camp. After being released, Israeli authorities banned him from returning to Jenin. Instead, he has remained in Ramallah, where a long line of people came to a school building to shake his hand and hug him. Among them, former prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who resigned less than a year ago. He embraced Zubeidi and told Sky News the release of prisoners could be a catalyst for an enduring peace deal. \"We would like to see all prisoners released and we would like to see all hostages going home,\" said Mr Shtayyeh. He continued: \"It's a historic moment for everybody. It's time for this bloodshed to stop. And I think it is a moment of truth for everybody. \"In Gaza, 60,000 people have been killed, more than 120,000 have been injured. And of course, there have been so many casualties in Israel, too. \"We know that. And this time Palestinians are desperate for peace. We want a genuine peace process that does really bring peace and justice for everybody.\" More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Hamas-run authorities in Gaza, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive followed Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when it took 250 people hostage and killed around 1,200 others."

        "Content": "Three Israeli hostages who will be released on Saturday have been named by Hamas.  Israel and Hamas are exchanging hostages and prisoners as a fragile ceasefire holds in Gaza. Ofer Kalderon, Keith Samuel Siegel and Yarden Bibas will be released, Hamas armed wing spokesperson Abu Obeida said in a post on his telegram channel. It follows yesterday's release of eight hostages - three Israelis and five Thai nationals - being held by Hamas in Gaza. After a chaotic release that saw crowds swarm sections of the handover, Israel temporarily delayed the freeing of 110 Palestinians expected in exchange - underscoring how fragile the truce is. In the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is returning 33 hostages over six weeks. In return, Israel is freeing 737 Palestinian prisoners. Who are the hostages being freed?  \n                  Three Israelis and five Thai hostages freed in Gaza\n                 \n                  Hamas to release three Israeli and five Thai hostages amid ceasefire\n                 \n                  Thousands of Palestinians returning to northern Gaza as new round of Hamas hostage releases announced\n                 All three of the hostages set to be released were taken in the October 7 2023 attack. Yarden Bibas, now 35, was taken alongside his wife, Shiri Babas, and their two sons, four-year-old Ariel and 10-month-old Kfir - the youngest of Hamas's hostages. It is believed Yarden could be the only family member still alive. In November 2023, Hamas said his wife and children had died in an Israeli airstrike before the current ceasefire. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said at the time it was \"examining the reliability of the information\". Keith Samuel Siegel, a 65-year-old dual US citizen, was abducted with his wife Aviva Adrienne Siegel - who was freed in the first hostage-for-prisoner exchange in November 2023. Last year, he featured in a video released by Hamas during the Passover holiday. In the footage, he broke down in tears and said he hoped he would be reunited with his family. Ofer Kalderon, 54, is the uncle of a 12-year-old girl found dead after Hamas's October 7 attack. The bodies of Noya Dan, who was autistic, and her grandmother, Carmela Dan, were found nearly a fortnight after the pair were reported missing. More from Sky News:What is in the ceasefire deal?Palestinians return to northern Gaza  Mr Kalderon's two children, Erez and Sahar, who were 12 and 16 at the time, were abducted alongside him. They were also released in the first exchange. The release will be the fourth since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 19 January.  While the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is still holding, unrest is continuing elsewhere in the Middle East. Early this morning, two people were killed and 10 others were wounded in an Israeli airstrike on an unofficial border crossing in eastern Lebanon. The IDF said in a statement it had struck \"a military site that included underground infrastructure for developing and producing combat equipment\" used by Hezbollah."

        "Content": "A British-Israeli hostage held by Hamas for 15 months in Gaza has told Sir Keir Starmer she was detained in a United Nations facility but denied medical treatment during her captivity. Emily Damari, 28, was taken hostage after being kidnapped from her home on 7 October 2023 by Hamas gunmen who shot her in the hand and leg, as well as killing her pet dog.

        "Content": "An Italian court has ordered that dozens of migrants taken to Albania must be transferred to Italy in the latest setback for Rome's controversial plan to deter people from arriving by sea. The group of 43 from Egypt and Bangladesh, whose asylum requests have already been rejected, were brought to Albania this week after being picked up in the Mediterranean. They were housed at two camps the Italian government built in the Balkan country in the hope of using them to house migrants while their asylum applications were processed.   The appeals court in Rome referred the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg, which is expected to issue a ruling next month. It's a scheme devised by the right-wing government led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to deter illegal migration by sea by holding asylum proceedings outside the EU.  The facilities were set up to house up to 3,000 migrants rescued by the Italian coastguard each month. Italy is the first country for tens of thousands of migrants who make the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean Sea. But Friday's ruling was the third time judges have defied the proposal and ordered migrants be taken to Italy since a first group was taken to Albania in October. Opposition politician Nicola Fratoianni said: \"As any person with common sense would have imagined, yet another deportation of migrants to Albania has come to nothing.\" The Italian interior ministry declined to comment. The migrants would probably be taken to Italy on Saturday, Reuters said, quoting sources close to the situation. The Albanian facilities have been empty since November, when judges last ordered those detained there to be transferred to Italy, citing doubts over the scheme's compliance with a recent ECJ ruling. That ruling, which was not specifically related to Italy, said with regard to migrants that no nation of origin could be considered safe if even just a part of its territory was deemed dangerous. Read more:New video of Washington air crashFreed prisoner's anger at UK & USShip seized over damaged cable Italian judges said the ruling threw into question the government's plan to take to Albania migrants from a list of \"safe\" countries, in the hope of swiftly repatriating them when their asylum requests were, in all likelihood, rejected. Senior figures in Ms Meloni's coalition government have accused the courts of trying to undermine the plan for political reasons. The ECJ is set to review Italy's scheme in the next few weeks to clarify whether it is in compliance with EU law."

Rubble and damaged flowers were strewn on top of and around the tomb. The stone bearing his name and dates was lying on the ground, while the stone cross on top of the grave had been smashed into pieces, according to French newspaper Le Monde.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  We all know Donald Trump loves a tariff. Not long ago he said it was his favourite word in the English language. But one thing that might perplex people somewhat is why he is quite so keen on imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada. After all, in his first term, his main focus when it came to trade was China. It was under Donald Trump that swingeing new tariffs were imposed on China and Vietnam (often seen as a backdoor conduit for Chinese goods). Canada and Mexico, on the other hand, got a brand new trade deal to take the place of the long-standing NAFTA agreement. Money blog: Wine could be more expensive to buy tomorrow So what changed? While the president has talked repeatedly about how the tariffs will deter Mexico and Canada from sending opioids into the US, a more compelling explanation comes when you look at the American trade data. There you see that since those tariffs were imposed in his first term, imports from China to the US have fallen quite considerably. Meanwhile, imports from Mexico and Canada have risen sharply, with Mexico now overtaking China as the biggest importer into the US. If there's one thing Donald Trump hates, about as much as he loves tariffs, it's trade deficits - where you import more goods from a country than you export. Economists see deficits as an inevitable function of being a modern developed economy; Trump sees them as a kind of punishment - a subsidy for foreign countries. Trump's odd way of looking at the world This is, to put it lightly, an odd way of looking at the world. While there are very legitimate concerns about the structure of the US economy, its inability to build its manufacturing sector and the impact of Chinese manufacturing overcapacity on the rest of the world, seeing all deficits as inherently bad is bizarre. Nonetheless, if you view the world that way, you won't like the look of the US trade position with Mexico. Look at those numbers and you see that the trade deficit has ballooned in recent years - and not just because of America sucking up lots of Mexican oil. The US is also importing far more cars from Mexico than it sends there. That is, to a large extent, a function of that free trade deal, which has encouraged car manufacturers (including some American manufacturers) to assemble their cars in Mexico. However, there are also suspicions that the Mexican deficit with the US is, to some extent, a function of the way the global trading system has shifted in the past half-decade.   ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Where once goods would flow directly from China to the US, there's evidence to suggest many of them are instead flowing, mostly in the form of components, to \"third countries\", including Mexico, and then being assembled into finished products and sent into the US. And this process might accelerate in the coming years. Read more:British businesses stop shipping to Northern IrelandMuslim charities still being debanked despite Farage furore Look at the number of cars flowing from China to Mexico in recent years and it's rising rapidly. All of which is to say, there are some intriguing dynamics in international trade which have raised eyebrows in the White House. What's going to happen? What would the impact of tariffs be? Well, most economic models suggest they would lift inflation and reduce economic growth. In short, they would be bad - especially if levied on nearly all goods. But, this being Donald Trump, there are still big questions about precisely how these tariffs would actually be applied. The past few weeks have been chaotic for the normally dull world of trade economics. The coming years will be more chaotic still."

        "Content": " The Duke of York told Jeffrey Epstein they would \"play some more soon!\" two months after he claimed he cut contact with the convicted paedophile.  The emails were disclosed in a filing by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who are defending an appeal by former Barclays boss, Jes Staley. Staley is challenging a decision to ban him from the industry for misleading regulators on his ties to Epstein, one of the most severe measures the FCA can impose. The court documents show an exchange of messages between Epstein and \"a member of the British Royal Family\" - believed to be Prince Andrew. It suggests the duke and Epstein - who killed himself in jail in 2019 - were in contact for longer than he has previously admitted. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. After his release, Epstein and the duke were photographed walking together in New York's Central Park, in December 2010. The prince has claimed this was the last contact he had with Epstein. In a 2019 interview with Newsnight, Andrew said he visited Epstein in person to tell him they could no longer be friends, believing it was the \"honourable\" thing to do. \n                  The Royal Year: King Charles and Camilla \n                 \n                  Prince Andrew's Sandringham withdrawal a surprise, but he won't be out of mind\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew will not join rest of Royal Family for Christmas after Chinese 'spy' Yang Tengbo named\n                 Yet emails between the pair, which were handed to a court in London, show they kept exchanging messages until at least 27 February 2011. On this date, Andrew emailed Epstein: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!!!!\" The disgraced duke has come under fire for his relationship with the paedophile financier. In 2022, he settled a multi-million pound claim with Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the royal. Andrew stepped down from royal duties and public life and had claimed he never met Ms Giuffre. He agreed to settle the claim without admitting liability. He has previously strenuously denied all allegations against him. Newsnight interview 'ill-advised' - aide Other court documents released on Friday revealed one of the prince's senior aides admitted in a letter to an alleged Chinese spy that the duke's Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis was \"hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful\". Dominic Hampshire wrote to Yang Tengbo on Buckingham Palace notepaper in March 2020. In the letter, he said they \"have dealt with the aftermath of a hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful television interview\". Mr Hampshire praised Mr Yang, writing that \"in what originally seemed like a lost cause, you have somehow managed to not only salvage but maintain and then incredibly, enhance the reputation of my principal [Prince Andrew] in China. \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor; we orchestrated a very powerful verbal message of support to China at a Chinese New Year's dinner and between the three of us, we have written, amended and then always agreed a number of letters at the highest level possible.\" Mr Yang said in a statement on Friday the spying allegations against him are \"entirely unfounded\". The Jes Staley emails Emails showed Epstein inviting Andrew to meet Staley on 27 February, saying: \"jes staley will be in London on next tue afternoon, if you have time [sic].\" Andrew replied: \"Jes is coming on 1st March or next week?\" The pair then engaged in a discussion about press articles, before the duke told Epstein they would \"play some more soon\". Sky News has contacted Prince Andrew for a comment. Royal correspondent Just when you thought Prince Andrew couldn't fall any further, another twist emerges in his shameful association with Jeffrey Epstein. He'd claimed the last time he had contact with the convicted paedophile was in December 2010, when the pair were infamously photographed together in Central Park. The Duke of York insisted he thought he was being \"honourable\" when choosing to stay with Epstein and personally tell him they could no longer be friends. But this email suggests the pair stayed in touch beyond this date. We don't know for how long, but it leaves Prince Andrew once more facing difficult and damaging questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. And yet again, Andrew's judgement is under considerable scrutiny. Last year had ended badly for the disgraced Duke after his association with an alleged Chinese spy was exposed. He had to keep clear of the Royal Family's traditional Christmas day gathering at Sandringham. The Duke of York has always denied witnessing or suspecting any of Epstein's behaviour. But their friendship cost him his reputation. He now leads a reclusive life in Windsor, stripped of responsibility and royal roles. Yet still making uncomfortable headlines for the rest of his family."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @LaraKeay\n Everyone on board the passenger jet and US Army helicopter that collided above Washington DC on Wednesday is thought to have died. The crash happened as the jet came into land at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 8.47pm local time (1.47am UK). Follow Washington latest: More details of victims emerge After several fatal crashes in 2024, anxious flyers may have been left wondering whether planes really are still the safest way to travel. Here, Sky News talks to the experts to find out. Are plane crashes getting more common? There were two deadly crashes in just four days in December. On Christmas Day, a Russian missile shot down an Azerbaijan Airlines flight from Baku as it approached Grozny. The plane tried to divert but ultimately crash-landed - killing 38 of the 67 people on board, including both pilots and a flight attendant. On 29 December, a Jeju Air flight from Bangkok crashed and skidded off the runway at Muan airport in South Korea - killing 179 people and leaving just two survivors. Marco Chan, senior lecturer in aviation operations at Buckinghamshire New University's School of Aviation and Security, says that while on face value 2024 \"wasn't a particularly great year for safety\", the global plane accident rate is still only around 1.3 per one million flights. A study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimates that between 2018 and 2022 the fatality rate on commercial planes was one per 13.7 million passengers. This suggests plane deaths are far rarer than they were between 2008 and 2017 - when there was roughly one death for every 7.9 million boardings - and between 1968 and 1977, when one passenger in every 350,000 died.  Read moreWhat we know about the passengersWhat does the flight data tell us?What were the pilots doing? Paul Kennard, a former RAF Chinook pilot and private consultant specialising in mid-air collision avoidance, stressed plane crashes are still \"vanishingly rare\". \"The reason they make the news is because they're so rare - and the number of lives that are impacted in one go,\" he tells Sky News. \"But it is still true that your journey to the airport is far more dangerous than getting on the plane.\" Comparing air travel with other modes of transport, figures show that 1,607 people were killed in road accidents in the UK during the year ending June 2024 - the equivalent of around four a day. On the rail network, 10 people died between April 2023 and May 2024. What is the most dangerous part of a plane journey? Mr Chan, who is also an experienced Airbus pilot, says take-off and landing are the most \"critical\" phases of any flight. \"We call them critical because, for example during take-off, the engine is the closest to maximum power and the tank is close to full - so you're trying to lift quite a heavy plane off the ground. \"It's the same with landing, trying to bring a relatively heavy piece of metal on to the runway means any kind of malfunction could have an impact.\" He adds that there is far less risk while the plane is cruising at high altitude, as there is less traffic. Which part of the plane is safest? Mr Chan says statistically, people sitting at the back of the plane appear more likely to survive a crash. \"The tail tapers up - and it's usually the last part of the plane to be impacted,\" he says. It may seem obvious, but Mr Chan adds that the safest place to be is in your seat with your seatbelt fastened. Recalling the death of a passenger due to turbulence on a Singapore Airlines flight in May, he advises keeping seatbelts on for as much of the flight as possible, as turbulence usually occurs suddenly, not giving people enough time to put their seatbelt back on or return to their seat. Is air travel more dangerous in different parts of the world? Since the crash in Washington DC, several experts have claimed there have long been concerns about the state of US air traffic control system. Aviation industry analyst Sally Gethin told Sky News it is \"outdated\", still \"using analogue systems\" and suffering major staff shortages. Asked if this means US flights are more dangerous than others travelling elsewhere, Mr Kennard disagrees. \"The US has such a high volume of flights - not just commercial aircraft but military and general aviation as well - so they are statistically more likely to have more incidents and accidents,\" he adds. Mr Chan adds that risk level appears to depend more on the airports where the planes take off and land. \"Certain airports are more challenging for the pilots to land safely - but that will just mean additional training is put in place\", he says, giving Kathmandu airport in Nepal as an example. \"It doesn't mean the accident rate will be higher,\" he adds. \"Because the extra training usually makes things safer. \"Whereas with airports that look easier to navigate on paper - or where a pilot operates on a weekly basis - accidents can happen because they feel slightly more relaxed and human nature means they get more complacent.\"  So why are planes so safe? Firstly, the experts point to the rigorous levels of training pilots and other crew have to undergo. \"It's a very high barrier to entry for crew and air traffic control,\" Mr Kennard says, adding that pilots' skills, health and fitness are assessed multiple times a year. Comparing pilots and drivers on the road, Mr Kennard says: \"With road travel, once you pass your test you can drive between the ages of 17 and 90 without being retested. \"And the average car on the road is checked and maintained significantly less than any aircraft in the sky.\" Mr Chan adds that training procedures are constantly being updated - particularly after crashes happen - to prevent them reoccurring. He also stresses that budget airlines are no less safe, as all carriers must adhere to the same regulations. Low-cost airlines typically travel shorter distances and therefore operate more flights, which could arguably make them safer as pilots get more repeat experience of the same routes. Finally, he points out that nearly all engineering and computer systems on a plane have backup contingencies in case one fails. \"The aeroplane is a very complicated system - but it's a very safe one - with dual, sometimes triple, redundancies,\" he adds."

        "Content": "By Rachel McGrath, news reporter   The surviving members of Nirvana surprised fans by reuniting at a concert to raise money for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts. Thursday night's two-venue, five-hour extravaganza featured performances from plenty of California natives and stars with ties to the region but the Nirvana reunion was the biggest surprise of the evening. Band members Pat Smear, Krist Novoselic and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl performed with a series of guest female vocalists. Their set started with St Vincent as the frontwoman, before Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Joan Jett and Grohl's singer daughter Violet each joined them on stage. Eschewing some of Nirvana's best-known tracks, the supergroup instead made inspired choices and launched into Breed, School and Territorial Pissings. With Violet on stage, they closed their set with All Apologies.  The evening had been kicked off by Billie Eilish and Green Day.

The FTSE 100 index of most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange closed at 8,666.65, breaking the record set on Thursday night after four consecutive days of rises. January has been the best month in more than two years for the FTSE 100. Money blog: Cheap supermarket tea beats Yorkshire to be named tastiest  Not since November 2022, during a stock market rebound after the Liz Truss's mini-budget, has the top flight index performed so well. It comes as investors have looked to move away from tech stocks after new Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek proved such technology can be created with less investment and more quickly than its US rivals. Those companies developing AI had soared in value in recent years.  Read more:British businesses stop shipping to Northern IrelandMuslim charities still being debanked despite Farage furore But the multinational mining and oil and gas companies that make up the FTSE 100 benefitted from that move to shelter. Also behind the latest record high are the market expectations for more interest rate cuts in 2025, something which would make borrowing cheaper and likely kickstart spending. Three rate cuts are now expected this year. A series of record-breaking closes were recorded in mid-January after a weak pound made buying shares with sterling cheaper. The cheaper cost increased demand and boosted share prices. What is the FTSE 100? The index is made up of many mining and international oil and gas companies, as well as UK banks and supermarkets. Familiar to a UK audience are lenders such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds and supermarket chains Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's. Other well-known names include Rolls-Royce, Unilever, easyJet, BT Group and Next. FTSE stands for Financial Times Stock Exchange. If a company's share price drops significantly it can slip outside of the FTSE 100 and into the larger and more UK-based FTSE 250 index. The inverse works for the FTSE 250 companies, the 101st to 250th most valuable firms on the London Stock Exchange. If their share price rises significantly they could move into the FTSE 100. It was not just the FTSE 100 that did well, the latest record is part of a broader gain for European stock markets."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  We all know Donald Trump loves a tariff. Not long ago he said it was his favourite word in the English language. But one thing that might perplex people somewhat is why he is quite so keen on imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada. After all, in his first term, his main focus when it came to trade was China. It was under Donald Trump that swingeing new tariffs were imposed on China and Vietnam (often seen as a backdoor conduit for Chinese goods). Canada and Mexico, on the other hand, got a brand new trade deal to take the place of the long-standing NAFTA agreement. Money blog: Wine could be more expensive to buy tomorrow So what changed? While the president has talked repeatedly about how the tariffs will deter Mexico and Canada from sending opioids into the US, a more compelling explanation comes when you look at the American trade data. There you see that since those tariffs were imposed in his first term, imports from China to the US have fallen quite considerably. Meanwhile, imports from Mexico and Canada have risen sharply, with Mexico now overtaking China as the biggest importer into the US. If there's one thing Donald Trump hates, about as much as he loves tariffs, it's trade deficits - where you import more goods from a country than you export. Economists see deficits as an inevitable function of being a modern developed economy; Trump sees them as a kind of punishment - a subsidy for foreign countries. Trump's odd way of looking at the world This is, to put it lightly, an odd way of looking at the world. While there are very legitimate concerns about the structure of the US economy, its inability to build its manufacturing sector and the impact of Chinese manufacturing overcapacity on the rest of the world, seeing all deficits as inherently bad is bizarre. Nonetheless, if you view the world that way, you won't like the look of the US trade position with Mexico. Look at those numbers and you see that the trade deficit has ballooned in recent years - and not just because of America sucking up lots of Mexican oil. The US is also importing far more cars from Mexico than it sends there. That is, to a large extent, a function of that free trade deal, which has encouraged car manufacturers (including some American manufacturers) to assemble their cars in Mexico. However, there are also suspicions that the Mexican deficit with the US is, to some extent, a function of the way the global trading system has shifted in the past half-decade.   ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Where once goods would flow directly from China to the US, there's evidence to suggest many of them are instead flowing, mostly in the form of components, to \"third countries\", including Mexico, and then being assembled into finished products and sent into the US. And this process might accelerate in the coming years. Read more:British businesses stop shipping to Northern IrelandMuslim charities still being debanked despite Farage furore Look at the number of cars flowing from China to Mexico in recent years and it's rising rapidly. All of which is to say, there are some intriguing dynamics in international trade which have raised eyebrows in the White House. What's going to happen? What would the impact of tariffs be? Well, most economic models suggest they would lift inflation and reduce economic growth. In short, they would be bad - especially if levied on nearly all goods. But, this being Donald Trump, there are still big questions about precisely how these tariffs would actually be applied. The past few weeks have been chaotic for the normally dull world of trade economics. The coming years will be more chaotic still."

The investment, announced last year in the Tories' spring budget, was dependent on a \"mutual agreement\" with the Treasury and third parties, it was said at the time. It will no longer go ahead because Labour ministers have offered less funding than their predecessors, the pharmaceutical giant said. An AstraZeneca spokesperson told Sky News: \"Following discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke. \"Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal.\" The money would have expanded an existing site in Speke and was hailed at the time as a \"vote of confidence\" in Liverpool and the UK's life science sector.

The spokesperson added: \"All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution. \"AstraZeneca remains closely engaged with the government's work to develop our new industrial strategy, and more broadly we continue to have a thriving life sciences sector, worth Â£108 billion to the economy and providing over 300,000 highly skilled jobs across the country.\" The decision is a blow to Rachel Reeves's renewed attempts to deliver economic growth. In a speech earlier this week which named AstraZeneca, the chancellor said life sciences would be key to boosting the economy. She announced plans to deliver an Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor, which she claimed would add up to Â£78bn to the public coffers. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: \"There's no vaccine for incompetence. In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\" The new plant at Speke was intended to enhance the UK's pandemic preparedness. Reports that it was under threat emerged shortly after Labour won the general election, when ministers warned of the need to make cuts to infrastructure projects to fill a Â£22bn \"black hole\" in the public finances. The confirmation comes after former health secretary Matt Hancock said that the UK needed to improve its own vaccine manufacturing capability as a \"critical\" part of preparing for a future pandemic. Mr Hancock told the COVID Inquiry earlier in January that Britain's vaccine manufacturing capacity was \"weak\". He added: \"Having that manufacture and fill and finish onshore, physically within the UK, is critical in the way that it simply isn't in normal times.\""

Instead of injecting Â£450m into the plant on Merseyside, a dispute with the new administration over the amount of government support has seen the project pulled, accompanied by a sharp rebuke. \"Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal,\" said the company, painting Labour as vaccine sceptics by comparison to their Conservative predecessors.   Coming two days after Rachel Reeves delivered a speech prioritising growth, including in the life sciences, it is a jab that might have made ministers and officials feel faint. The company is not disclosing figures but it is understood the deal agreed with the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt last March, and confirmed in a Treasury press release, could have seen up to Â£90m of state support go into the project.  In July, the new government told AstraZeneca it wanted to review the deal but, after months of delay, the drugs giant has received a lower offer that it clearly does not believe makes sense. It is a sign of its frustration felt within Britain's largest company that it has chosen to publicly contrast the new government with the last. AstraZeneca draws just 2% of its revenue from its home market, and can point to major recent investments in Canada, the US and Singapore that will not be mirrored here. In a statement the Treasury was unapologetic, saying \"a change in the make-up of the investment\" proposed by AZ led it to reduce the grant on offer, and that the deal failed to \"demonstrate value for the taxpayer\". Read More:Growth is fight PM and Reeves want to have - and can't loseReeves announces backing for third Heathrow runway AstraZeneca is the second multinational to blame the new government for a withdrawal of investment.

In that case, ministers insisted with some justification that deploying state support to prolong the life of an uncompetitive facility did not make sense.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A group of technology billionaires including the bosses of Google and Microsoft have triumphed in an auction of the Lords-based London Spirit cricket team in a deal which will set a record benchmark for the sale of a sporting franchise. Sky News can exclusively reveal that the consortium led by Nikesh Arora, the chief executive of Palo Alto Networks, and including Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, saw off fierce competition during a live auction conducted by the England and Wales Cricket Board on Friday afternoon. The deal dwarfs a Â£123m transaction struck on Thursday for the Oval Invincibles franchise by the ultra-rich Ambani family, and means the ECB will receive proceeds from London Spirit of about Â£145m. That will take the total proceeds to the ECB - for distribution throughout the sport - after three of the eight franchise sales to close to Â£250m. Money blog: Cheap supermarket tea beats Yorkshire The blockbuster price underscores the intensity of the bidding for the most prestigious name in the Hundred tournament, allied to Lords' enormous sporting heritage. One source said the deal represented a world record for the price it attached to London Spirit as a multiple of the asset's five-year forward profit projections. \n                  Afghan women demand cricket's governing body takes stand against Taliban\n                 \n                  Why are MPs calling for England to boycott Afghanistan cricket match?\n                 \n                  England cricket legend Sir Ian Botham falls into crocodile-infested waters - and is rescued by former rival Merv Hughes\n                 Other investors in the winning consortium are said to include Egon Durban, co-chief executive of Silver Lake, the west coast-based private equity backer of New Zealand Rugby and the RAC breakdown recovery service. The other bidders in the London Spirit process were a vehicle controlled by Todd Boehly, a shareholder in Chelsea Football Club; members of the Manchester United-owning Glazer family; and RPSG Group, the owner of the Indian Premier League team Lucknow Super Giants. RPSG Group and the tech billionaires are understood to have engaged in a bidding war for nearly three hours before the latter group won, according to insiders. The ECB's stake in Birmingham Phoenix was sold to the owners of Birmingham City Football Club, Knighthead Capital, on Thursday in a deal worth over Â£80m. Stakes in Northern Superchargers and Southern Brave, among others, will be auctioned next week. Under the ECB's plans, it intends to sell its 49% holding in each of the eight teams with the counties left to decide whether they wish to offload any of their 51% stakes. The price of London Spirit means the ECB's original financial projections will be blown out of the water, with the three franchises sold to date valued in aggregate at around Â£500m. Bidders in auctions with at least three participants are able to submit binding offers at 15-minute intervals, and in increments of at least Â£3m. Losing bidders in each franchise may be given the opportunity to participate in the remaining processes, although the mechanics of such a scenario were unclear on Wednesday. For franchises with only two shortlisted bidders, the auction will involve a straightforward sealed bid shootout. The proceeds will be distributed between the hosts, non-host counties and the grassroots game. A bigger-than-expected windfall from the process could offer a financial lifeline to a number of cash-strapped counties, with part of the proceeds likely to be used to pay down debt. Concerns have been raised, however, that windfalls from the Hundred auction will not deliver a meaningful improvement in counties' long-term financial sustainability. The outcome of the Hundred auction is also likely to intensify other searching questions about the future of cricket, as the Test format of the game struggles for international commercial relevance against shorter-length competition. The Hundred auction is being handled by bankers at Raine Group, the same firm which oversaw the sale of large stakes in both Manchester United and Chelsea in recent years. The ECB declined to comment."

The investment, announced last year in the Tories' spring budget, was dependent on a \"mutual agreement\" with the Treasury and third parties, it was said at the time. It will no longer go ahead because Labour ministers have offered less funding than their predecessors, the pharmaceutical giant said. An AstraZeneca spokesperson told Sky News: \"Following discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke. \"Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal.\" The money would have expanded an existing site in Speke and was hailed at the time as a \"vote of confidence\" in Liverpool and the UK's life science sector.

The spokesperson added: \"All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution. \"AstraZeneca remains closely engaged with the government's work to develop our new industrial strategy, and more broadly we continue to have a thriving life sciences sector, worth Â£108 billion to the economy and providing over 300,000 highly skilled jobs across the country.\" The decision is a blow to Rachel Reeves's renewed attempts to deliver economic growth. In a speech earlier this week which named AstraZeneca, the chancellor said life sciences would be key to boosting the economy. She announced plans to deliver an Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor, which she claimed would add up to Â£78bn to the public coffers. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: \"There's no vaccine for incompetence. In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\" The new plant at Speke was intended to enhance the UK's pandemic preparedness. Reports that it was under threat emerged shortly after Labour won the general election, when ministers warned of the need to make cuts to infrastructure projects to fill a Â£22bn \"black hole\" in the public finances. The confirmation comes after former health secretary Matt Hancock said that the UK needed to improve its own vaccine manufacturing capability as a \"critical\" part of preparing for a future pandemic. Mr Hancock told the COVID Inquiry earlier in January that Britain's vaccine manufacturing capacity was \"weak\". He added: \"Having that manufacture and fill and finish onshore, physically within the UK, is critical in the way that it simply isn't in normal times.\""

Instead of injecting Â£450m into the plant on Merseyside, a dispute with the new administration over the amount of government support has seen the project pulled, accompanied by a sharp rebuke. \"Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal,\" said the company, painting Labour as vaccine sceptics by comparison to their Conservative predecessors.   Coming two days after Rachel Reeves delivered a speech prioritising growth, including in the life sciences, it is a jab that might have made ministers and officials feel faint. The company is not disclosing figures but it is understood the deal agreed with the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt last March, and confirmed in a Treasury press release, could have seen up to Â£90m of state support go into the project.  In July, the new government told AstraZeneca it wanted to review the deal but, after months of delay, the drugs giant has received a lower offer that it clearly does not believe makes sense. It is a sign of its frustration felt within Britain's largest company that it has chosen to publicly contrast the new government with the last. AstraZeneca draws just 2% of its revenue from its home market, and can point to major recent investments in Canada, the US and Singapore that will not be mirrored here. In a statement the Treasury was unapologetic, saying \"a change in the make-up of the investment\" proposed by AZ led it to reduce the grant on offer, and that the deal failed to \"demonstrate value for the taxpayer\".

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n The prime minister has \"absolute confidence\" in his attorney general despite negative press briefings, Downing Street has said. Lord Hermer KC has been subject to a string of negative stories in recent weeks, including in The Times which reported concern from cabinet ministers that changes he made to legal advice had stymied legislation. Late last year, Lord Hermer bolstered guidance to government lawyers so that they must advise ministers that policies should be considered unlawful if \"no tenable argument\" could be made in the event they were challenged in court. According to The Times, this has resulted in cabinet ministers feeling frustrated that Lord Hermer was resisting policies even if there was a only a slim chance they faced defeat in the courts.  And a government source told Sky News' deputy political editor Sam Coates that departments were \"nervous the attorney general is actually making rulings on things\". \"This can complicate decision making,\" they added. \"We just want him as often as possible not to make definitive judgements.\" Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer had confidence in Lord Hermer, a Downing Street spokesperson replied: \"He has absolute confidence in him and I wouldn't accept that he is slowing down legislation.\" They added: \"Let us be clear about not engaging with the law as a government - failing to do so costs taxpayer money, blocks new infrastructure. \"Taking the law into account is important but we want to make sure the law isn't used to block things at any costs. We are looking to reduce attempts from three to one and take an axe to red tape and it is in everyone's interest that changes in law are effective whether it is attorney general, the prime minister or cabinet.\" Shortly after his appointment as attorney general following Labour's landslide election victory, Lord Hermer - who is the government's chief legal adviser - updated the guidance on legal risk to also say that ministers should only put forward as a last resort cases they are likely to lose. The change marks a departure from the approach of Lord Hermer's predecessor Suella Braverman, who argued government lawyers were \"too cautious in their advice\" and it had \"hampered ministerial policy objectives needlessly\". \"Whilst the government wins the majority of its cases in court, there is a clear trend of lawyers advising negatively, only to be proven wrong in court,\" she wrote in 2022. As well as concerns over the updated legal advice, questions have also been raised about how Lord Hermer's previous work as a barrister, including representing former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, could result in possible conflicts of interest in his current role. Lord Hermer attempted to address those concerns by revealing recently that he had recused himself from advising ministers on \"certain matters\" - although convention meant he was not able to give any details. The Labour frontbencher told peers in the House of Lords that there was a \"rigorous system\" in place for dealing with such instances and insisted his department \"will always err on the side of caution\". Nevertheless, the Conservatives have requested an investigation by Cabinet Secretary Sir Chris Wormald in relation to Lord Hermer, including on the \"representation of Gerry Adams in matters related to the Legacy Act\". The Labour government is currently in the process of repealing and replacing the Legacy Act, which blocks Mr Adams and others interned without trial in the 1970s from claiming compensation for unlawful detention. However, Belfast's high court ruled parts of it were against the European Convention on Human Rights.

Lord Hermer said last week that he represented Mr Adams on \"something unconnected\" to the Act and also represented the family of a young British soldier murdered by the IRA in the 1970s. However, it has been reported that the attorney general received a Â£30,000 fee for representing Mr Adams in a damages claim brought forward by victims of IRA bombings. Defending questions about Lord Hermer's fee in the Commons, solicitor general Lucy Rigby said: \"It is a central and well-understood aspect of the British legal system that she, I know, knows that barristers are required to accept instructions if they are available and qualified to do so. This is the well-known cab rank principle. \"She will also be very aware that, put simply, barristers are not their clients.\""

        "Content": "The shadow home secretary has doubled down on Kemi Badenoch's criticism of the Conservatives' record on immigration, arguing \"mistakes were made\". Chris Philp, a former Home Office minister, joined the Tory leader in criticising the previous government over immigration after former home secretary Dame Priti Patel refused to apologise for the points-based system she introduced. Speaking to Anna Jones on Sky News Breakfast, Mr Philp said: \"The truth is, as Kemi has said - and as I have said repeatedly - mistakes were made by the previous government. \"Kemi and I have been completely honest about that. We've told the truth. Mistakes were made.\" The row comes following analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing the UK population is set to grow by five million people in 10 years, despite death rates being projected to overtake birth rates in that time. All of the forecast population growth is due to migration. Dame Priti, who served as home secretary from 2019 to 2022, appeared on The Sun's Never Mind The Ballots earlier this week, where she was challenged about the fact immigration to the UK hit 1.2m per year following the introduction of her system in 2021. She said the Tories \"always said\" there would be more migration from the rest of the world after Brexit - although she admitted she did not anticipate the figure being so high. However, the now shadow foreign secretary defended the principle behind her points-based system, saying it marked the end of the freedom of movement and allowed the \"brightest and best\" to work in the UK. \"Brightest and the best coming to our country? People on skilled work routes and visas? It's legal migration,\" she said, \"It's legal. People who come here and work and contribute to our economy - brightest and best.\" Challenged again on the 1.2m number, Dame Priti said: \"What would you say to the Ukrainians who are in our country? What would you say to the BNOs [British Nationals Overseas]? What would you say also to people that came here from conflict?\" She also insisted the level of legal migration is from people coming on skilled visas, particularly to work in the health and social care sector, which was especially important during the pandemic. Mr Philp told Sky News that 1.2m people was \"far too high\" and it was now Conservative policy to have a \"hard, legally binding cap\" on the number of visas that would be issued - although he did not say what it would be. Read more:Real success on migration still resembles 'stop the boats' sloganKemi Badenoch is taking a perilous path on immigration Following the interview, Ms Badenoch released a statement disavowing Dame Priti's comments. A spokesman for the Tory leader said: \"While the last Conservative government may have tried to control numbers, we did not deliver.\" They added it was now Conservative policy to introduce a \"hard cap on numbers\" because immigration remains \"far too high\". Following the rebuke, Dame Priti issued her own statement in which she attempted to water down the defence she had made. She wrote on X: \"The immigration system in our country is not fit for purpose. As I said in the interview, I was not happy about the high numbers while the Conservatives were in government. \"Our party is now under new leadership and it is important we learn from our mistakes and how we can do things better.\""

        "Headline": "Michael Matheson was forced to step down as Scotland's health secretary last year amid a public outcry over a near Â£11,000 iPad data roaming bill. In a new interview, the MSP said his opponents had sought to take \"political advantage\" of the situation.",
        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The furore surrounding Michael Matheson's near Â£11,000 iPad data roaming bill was \"completely blown out of all proportion\", according to the shamed MSP. The SNP politician stepped down as Scotland's health secretary last year after questions were raised over the eye-watering invoice. The Falkirk West MSP had initially billed taxpayers before U-turning, claiming the device had only been used for parliamentary work during a family holiday to Morocco. It later emerged his teenage sons had been using the work iPad as a hotspot to stream football while on the trip. Mr Matheson was later suspended from the Scottish parliament and docked wages for breaching the MSP code of conduct. Mr Matheson, who was first elected as an MSP in 1999, was questioned about his ministerial career during an interview with the Institute for Government (IFG) think tank as part of its Ministers Reflect series. During the talk, held in October last year but published on Friday, he said his opponents had sought to take \"political advantage\" of the situation. \n                  Holyrood's winter fuel payment decision 'direct consequence' of Westminster move, court told\n                 \n                  Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon splits from husband\n                 \n                  Former first minister Humza Yousaf to step down as MSP in 2026\n                 Mr Matheson said: \"I think the thing that you need to realise is that when you become a minister, if you do make a mistake, you can end up in the eye of a political storm. \"The thing that acted as a big catalyst for me was that, as soon as the general election was called, everything was put on steroids. \"It became a massive issue because folk saw a political advantage they could get from it. It just got completely blown out of all proportion, in my view.\" Mr Matheson was the net zero, energy and transport secretary in Nicola Sturgeon's government at the time of the family holiday around Christmas in 2022. Ahead of the trip he failed to replace an outdated SIM card, which led to increased data use costs. Mr Matheson, who was later appointed health secretary in March 2023 under then first minister Humza Yousaf, told Holyrood he was unaware that his sons had used the iPad as a hotspot when he initially submitted the bill. He claimed he was told the truth by his wife after the story sparked a public outcry. Following his wife's admission, Mr Matheson initially failed to publicly mention his sons' involvement. Instead, he continued to insist the iPad was only used for parliamentary work and blamed the outdated SIM card for the excessive bill.  When questioned by journalists days after he knew the truth, he continued to deny the iPad was used for personal use until he made a statement to Holyrood. Mr Matheson quit as health secretary ahead of the conclusion of a probe by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), which ruled he had breached the MSP code of conduct. Read more from Sky News:Growth is a fight Starmer and Reeves want to have - and they can't afford to loseMajority of public support cap on political donations, poll finds When asked if there were any lessons to be learned for other ministers, he told the IFG: \"If I look back, the lesson I would say is recognising how unforgiving the political space is that you're operating in. \"In the end, it was my desire to try and avoid the press knowing about what my son had done. \"It was completely unforgiving, despite the fact that when you offer it up, then they say you're using it as a cover. Actually, no, I'm not, but I'm telling you that's what's happened. \"So, I think what I would say to ministers is that it is quite unforgiving at times when something like that happens, despite what your background is and how long you've been in government and how you've always tried to avoid getting the government into any difficult positions.\" He added: \"When you're a backbencher, if you do make an error, it's not the same. \"But when you're a minister and you're a senior minister, you're going to get chased down and you quite literally get chased down.\" Mr Matheson said a number of people reached out in support during the scandal. He also said the scrutiny had a \"significant impact\" on his family, which included taking his teenage sons out of school and his wife becoming \"unwell with stress\". He added: \"It's in the public record that our house got broken into.\" When questioned about Mr Matheson's latest comments, First Minister John Swinney said: \"The parliament's worked its way through all of these issues and it's come to its conclusions and those conclusions stand. \"We just have to consider that as the conclusion that parliament has arrived at.\" The Scottish Conservatives criticised Mr Matheson's remarks. MSP Rachael Hamilton, the party's deputy leader, said: \"Taxpayers will be outraged that Michael Matheson is trying to downplay the scandal that ultimately forced him to resign in disgrace. \"The public were rightly furious that the then SNP health secretary thought it acceptable to ask them to foot the bill for his [iPad] expenses. \"He then repeatedly lied to them and parliament and refused to say sorry for what he had done. \"No wonder Scots are so disillusioned with senior SNP figures at Holyrood when they continue to hold voters in such contempt.\""

        "Content": "\n          Social affairs and health reporter\n              @megbaynes\n A \"groundbreaking\" Â£1.65 million treatment has been approved for use on the NHS, offering patients with severe sickle cell disease some hope of a cure. It is believed around 1,700 people could be eligible after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) approved Casgevy for some patients with the genetic condition. Around 50 people a year will receive the treatment, NHS officials estimate. Professor Bob Klaber, director of strategy, research and innovation at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust - which led the UK arm of the clinical trials for exa-cel, said: \"Together with patients and industry partners, we are proud to be part of the groundbreaking research and international academic collaboration that has made this treatment possible. \"The treatment is an example of true medical innovation and will provide patients with no other options a potential cure for the painful, debilitating symptoms of their diseases. \"It also offers promising research avenues for other genetic diseases.\" For sickle cell patients like Lanre Ogundimu, the drug could be a game-changer. In 2018, she suffered a stroke, a pulmonary embolism and a blood transfusion reaction as a result of the disorder. She spent 30 days in hospital, six months in physiotherapy, more than 12 months in therapy and nine months not working. \"I felt weak all the time,\" she said. \"This was the lowest point in my life. It impacted my freedom and independence, my income, my career trajectory, and my ability to contribute towards society.\" Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of inherited conditions that affect the red blood cells - the most serious type is called sickle cell anaemia. The disorder causes red blood cells to take on a \"sickle\" shape, break and die early, which vastly reduces the amount of oxygen they can carry around the body. It is particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean family background. It is caused by a gene that affects how red blood cells develop - if both parents have the gene, there is a one in four chance of each child being born with the disease. Having the gene does not necessarily mean parents have the disease but are carriers of the sickle cell trait. The main symptoms are painful episodes (called sickle cell crises) which can last for days or weeks, an increased risk of serious infections, and anaemia, which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath. Currently, the only cure for sickle cell disease is a stem or bone marrow transplant - these are not done very often because of the risks involved. Mehmet Tunc Onur Sanli, 42, from London, was diagnosed with the disorder aged 11. He had surgery on his spleen when he was six and a hip replacement at 22. \"I also suffer from regular sickle cell crises - last year, I had to go to the hospital at midnight after waking up in severe pain, and overall, I had to visit the hospital five or six times due to crises,\" he said. \"The pain is the worst I have ever felt in my life - it's hard to put into words.\" While he says there is still \"a lot to consider\" with the new treatment, not having to go to hospital regularly \"would be a dream for me\". How does the treatment work? Casgevy - also known as exa-cel - earned its inventors the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2020. It works by editing the faulty gene in a patient's own stem cells. It is an option for patients when a stem cell transplant is suitable but no donor can be found. The treatment was first rejected by Nice in March last year - it said it needed further detail about its effectiveness. It also needed a commercial agreement for the drug, which has a list price of Â£1.65m. It is not known how much the NHS will pay Vertex for the treatment, as health officials reached a confidential agreement with the drug company.

The treatment will be offered at specialist NHS centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham. 'Absolutely transformative' NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the NHS would be funding the new treatment \"straight away\". \"This is a leap in the right direction for people with sickle cell disease - which can be an extremely debilitating and painful condition,\" she said, adding that it offered a hope of a cure for patients facing a severe form of the disease. \"[It] could be absolutely transformative - it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them.\" University student Funmi Dasaolu has experienced chronic fatigue and pain her entire life. The 31-year-old, from Oxfordshire, has been admitted to hospital many times due to the condition - in 2022 she was admitted to hospital seven times, and for the last five years has been receiving regular blood transfusions. \"Today is a momentous day for those living with or affected by sickle cell disorder,\" she said. \"After months of campaigning, I'm overjoyed and so very grateful exa-cel has been finally approved. \"It will be truly transformative for patients and offers us the chance of a life without this terrible condition. A chance to grow old, to fulfil our dreams and to live a pain-free life.\""

        "Content": "By Rachel McGrath, news reporter   The surviving members of Nirvana surprised fans by reuniting at a concert to raise money for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts. Thursday night's two-venue, five-hour extravaganza featured performances from plenty of California natives and stars with ties to the region but the Nirvana reunion was the biggest surprise of the evening. Band members Pat Smear, Krist Novoselic and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl performed with a series of guest female vocalists. Their set started with St Vincent as the frontwoman, before Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Joan Jett and Grohl's singer daughter Violet each joined them on stage. Eschewing some of Nirvana's best-known tracks, the supergroup instead made inspired choices and launched into Breed, School and Territorial Pissings. With Violet on stage, they closed their set with All Apologies.  The evening had been kicked off by Billie Eilish and Green Day. Prior to their performance, actor Billy Crystal welcomed the crowd at the Kia Forum, wearing the clothes he had on when he escaped the Pacific Palisades fire earlier this month. He had lived in the area for 46 years and spoke poignantly about losing his home.  An hour and a half later, acts began taking to the stage at the Intuit Dome too with the online broadcast switching seamlessly between the two venues. \n                  California wildfires: More than 30,000 flee as fire erupts north of Los Angeles\n                 \n                  Los Angeles must be better prepared for climate crises by 2028 Olympics, says IOC member Johan Eliasch\n                 \n                  LA wildfires: Family pay tribute to man who 'lived life to the fullest' after his death in Palisades fire\n                 California native Katy Perry waved the state's flag during hits including the anthemic Roar and California Gurls, while No Doubt - from nearby Orange County - performed tracks including I'm Just A Girl and Don't Speak. Dr Dre also made a unexpected appearance alongside Anderson .Paak and Sheila E, and covered Still DRE and the classic, California Love. Behind the performers, images of firefighters and the devastation wrought by the fires appeared on screen. Survivors also spoke about losing their homes and escaping the fires in between sets. Joni Mitchell, Pink, Rod Stewart, Stevie Nicks, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Olivia Rodrigo were also among those who performed. The task of closing the show fell to Lady Gaga, who performed a new song written especially for the occasion. \"It's just for tonight, it's just for you,\" she said of the track, written with her fiancÃ©, businessman Michael Polansky. \"Time is a healer.\" Gaga also powered through the Oscar-winning Shallow, from A Star is Born, and Always Remember Us This Way. More from Sky News:Marianne Faithfull dies aged 78Rihanna supports A$AP Rocky in court Former US vice president Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were among those attending the Intuit Dome concert. Mr Emhoff shared a picture of himself and his wife in their seats on Instagram, alongside the caption: \"Kamala and I are grateful to be at the FireAid concert tonight in our hometown of Los Angeles. \"It is a wonderful night that shows the strength and resilience of our city as we begin to recover and rebuild from the devastating wildfires.\" Audiences at home can donate online. Early in the concert, Crystal revealed that the band U2 contributed $1m (Â£804,829). The owner of the basketball team the Los Angeles Clippers, Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie, will match all donations made during the concert. All proceeds will go to those affected by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires earlier in the month. Some 29 people died in the fires, with thousands more homes and businesses destroyed."

Precisely how she will leave the show has not been announced. Her character is currently pregnant with Reiss Colwell's (Jonny Freeman) baby, unaware that he killed his ex-wife Debbie - a crime Sonia was later charged with.

        "Content": "Drill star Digga D has been jailed for almost four years for supplying 45kg of cannabis after he was arrested during an Instagram livestream.  The musician, whose real name is Rhys Herbert, pleaded guilty to two charges relating to the importation and supply of the Class B drug. Herbert, 24, from Notting Hill in London, was arrested on 21 February last year while livestreaming on Instagram. During a two-day trial of issue - known as a Newton hearing - in December, prosecutors said Herbert played a role in supplying up to 60kg of cannabis. He denied this. Appearing from prison via video link, Judge Simon Hirst told him he was \"satisfied\" the rapper had been in possession of 50.65kg of cannabis and had sold at least 45kg for profit. \"The level of the offending is so serious that there must be a sentence of imprisonment,\" he said, before jailing him for three years and 11 months. Herbert will have to serve half his sentence in custody. The prosecutor told the sentencing hearing Herbert had six convictions for 13 previous offences - including possession of a blade and violent disorder. Defending, James Scobie KC said: \"He does not have a team, this is very much a one-man band. \"The defendant has been away now since February of last year. There is a very much positive side, legitimate side, to this young man's life in respect of his work which is that of a performer and a writer to some degree of international notoriety and following. \"It is very, very sad and disappointing that he has had at the very least a year of his productive working life behind bars. \"He's not a danger to the public, he's actually a contributor to the public.\" A letter was read to the court from Herbert's mother, who said since being in jail he had been reading the Bible daily and was \"remorseful for what he had done\".

Gascon, who is the star of the largely Spanish-language Netflix musical, said in a statement via the streaming platform: \"As someone in a marginalised community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. \"All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\" Gascon has made history as the first transgender performer to be nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in the genre-defying musical. The most nominated in the Academy Awards race, Emilia Perez is up for 13 gongs, including supporting actress, original score, director, international feature film and best picture. It has already won four Golden Globes, including best motion picture - musical or comedy. The movie is directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard. Netflix will be hoping the controversy doesn't derail the film's chances of winning statuettes. Old posts from Gascon's Twitter account - some going as far back as 2016 - resurfaced this week. In them, she took aim at Muslims' dress, language and culture in her native Spain and suggested Islam should be banned. And less than a month after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in 2020 prompted a global reckoning with police brutality and racism, Gascon called Floyd a drug addict who \"very few people ever cared\" for.

        "Content": "Liam Payne will star in a new Netflix talent competition series, months after his death in Argentina. The former One Direction member will appear as a guest judge on Building The Band alongside former Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland. The show brings together singers to form bands in \"booths\" without seeing each other beforehand. It was announced in September - weeks before Payne died following a fall from a hotel balcony at the age of 31. Now Netflix have confirmed the show will be released this year, at an event sharing their 2025 slate across TV and film. Backstreet Boys star AJ Mclean will host the series and Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger will take on a mentor and judge role. Scherzinger was a judge on The X Factor when Payne auditioned in 2010 and helped to form boy band One Direction on the show. Building The Band was one of the last projects from the former One Direction star, along with the track Do No Wrong with North Carolina singer Sam Pounds. Pounds later delayed the release of the new music, saying he wanted Payne's family \"to mourn in peace and in prayer\". In November, Payne's funeral in Buckinghamshire was attended by singer Cheryl, the mother to his son Bear, as well as fellow One Direction stars Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Argentina is continuing to investigate the circumstances around Payne's death at the Casa Sur Hotel. Five people have been charged over his death, including the singer's friend Roger Nores, the hotel manager, and a receptionist - who were all accused of manslaughter. Two others, a hotel employee and a waiter, have been charged with supplying cocaine, Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office previously said in a statement.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       Will Smith has announced his first album in 20 years. The actor and rapper, 56, revealed his fifth solo studio album will be called Based On A True Story, and marked the announcement with the release of a new song and alongside rapper Big Sean and OBanga. Smith also shared a new track, called Beautiful Scars, accompanied by a music video inspired by 1999 blockbuster The Matrix - which he famously turned down the leading role in. The video sees Smith presented with a red pill and a blue pill - a plot point the sci-fi is famous for - with the blue pill allowing him to continue his career and forget about The Matrix offer, and the red one letting him go back to star as Neo, the part eventually taken by Keanu Reeves. In the lyrics, he reflects how mistakes make a person stronger and how \"beautiful scars\" sustained through life should be embraced. The actor has come under widespread scrutiny in recent years after slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022. Smith, who was presented with the best actor award for his performance in King Richard shortly after the incident, was subsequently banned from attending the Academy Awards for 10 years. The Hollywood star apologised to Rock and largely stayed out of the spotlight afterwards.

He also marked his rap comeback with a performance at the BET Awards in Los Angeles. While Smith has become synonymous with the big screen in the past few decades, it was through music that he initially rose to fame. He started out in the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince alongside Jeff Townes in the 1980s, and the pair won the first rap Grammy in 1989, for Parents Just Don't Understand. They went on to record five hip-hop albums together, with hit songs including Summertime and Boom! Shake The Room. Smith also moved to TV with comedy The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, in which Townes also had a recurring role. As a solo artist, Smith released number-one tracks including Getting' Jiggy Wit It and Wild Wild West, and won four Grammys."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n       A mountain in New Zealand is now legally recognised as a person after being granted all the rights and responsibilities of a human by the government. The new law offers extra protection for Mount Taranaki - now known as Taranaki Maunga, its Maori name - and means it has all the rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of a person. It is part of an agreement between New Zealand's government and the indigenous Maori tribes, which have long considered the 8,261ft mountain an ancestor. The mountain's legal personality has a name, Te Kahui Tupua, which the law views as \"a living and indivisible whole\". It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, \"incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements\". Four members of the local Maori iwi, or tribes, and four others appointed by the country's conservation minister, will make up a new entity that acts as \"the face and voice\" of the mountain, the law rules. The legal recognition also acknowledges the mountain's theft from the Maori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonised, and fulfils an agreement of reparation from the country's government to indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since. The legal rights essentially give the tribes more power to uphold the mountain's health and wellbeing in an era where it has become a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports. Despite the new bill, which passed unanimously through parliament, the mountain will remain a publicly accessible destination. \"The mountain has long been an honoured ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the politician responsible for the settlements between the government and Maori tribes, told parliament in a speech on Thursday. Read more:Elephants can't pursue release because they are not 'people', court rules'Mysterious balls' that washed up on Australian beaches contained faecal bacteria Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te Pati Maori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, said the law released the mountain from \"the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate\". It comes amid significant tension in the country over Maori rights, which led tens of thousands of people to march on parliament in November last year. Colonisers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took the mountain from the tribes after British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and renamed it Mount Egmont. In 1840, Maori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi - New Zealand's founding document - in which the crown promised Maori would retain rights to their land and resources. However, the crown breached its agreement. The mountain and land nearby was confiscated in 1865 to punish Maori for rebelling. Over the next century, hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management, while the Maori did not. Traditional Maori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted, and it wasn't until a protest movement by the tribes in the 1970s and '80s that their language, culture and rights began to be recognised in law. Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements - such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023. Mount Taranaki joins Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island, and the Whanganui River in being recognised as people under law."
