        "Content": " Hundreds of thousands of protesters filled Istanbul's streets on Sunday for a fifth night of protest against the arrest ofÂ the Turkish president's main rival. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, was detained on Wednesday and formally arrested and jailed pending trial over corruption charges earlier on Sunday. Police used pepper spray and fired rubber bullets into the crowd that gathered outside Istanbul's city hall. Reporting from Istanbul on Sunday evening, Sky News' special correspondent Alex Crawford described the protests as \"relatively peaceful\" but said they were \"the biggest protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade\". The huge demonstrations have continued despite a ban on gatherings in Istanbul imposed this week - but many protesters hid their faces with masks. Most protesters did not want to speak on camera as they were scared of being recognised, Crawford said, but they took to the streets because \"they feel their democracy is being eroded\". She said questions remained over how long authorities would allow these protests to continue - and whether they will escalate into a real crisis for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The protests intensified after Mr Imamoglu was charged on Sunday with running a criminal organisation, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging. A request to detain Mr Imamoglu on terror-related charges was denied. Following the ruling, he was transferred to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. Mr Imamoglu has labelled all of the claims \"unimaginable accusations and slanders\". Many view his detention as a political move to remove him from the 2028 presidential race - deepening concerns over the country's democracy and the rule of law.  The Turkish government denies Mr Imamoglu's arrest was politically motivated and says the courts are independent. Mr Erdogan has served as Turkey's president since his Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003. Its biggest opponent in the next election looks set to be the Republican People's Party (CHP), which this weekend began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Mr Imamoglu, their only presidential candidate. The party also set up solidarity boxes where non-members could show their support - and at the time of last night's protest, more than 13 million had done so, according to the CHP. In a post on social media, Mr Imamoglu praised the result, saying the people had told Mr Erdogan: \"Enough is enough.\" \"That ballot box will arrive and the nation will deliver a slap to the administration it will never forget,\" he added. More from Sky News:Pope returns homeCanadian PM calls snap election Mr Imamoglu - who could be prevented from running for president if he is convicted - was one of 48 people jailed pending trial this weekend. The others being held include a key aide and two Istanbul district mayors. While the protests have largely been peaceful, there has been some violence in Istanbul, as well as other cities including Ankara and Izmir. Clashes have seen police deploy water cannon, tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, some of whom threw stones and fireworks at riot officers. Turkey's interior minister said 323 people were detained on Saturday evening over disturbances at protests."

        "Content": " New Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has called a snap election against the backdrop of a trade war with the US and threats from Donald Trump to makeÂ Canada part of America. Mr Carney, who is the former governor of the Bank of England, announced on Sunday that there will be a five-week general election campaign before a vote on 28 April. His governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Mr Trump declared a trade war. The US leader has repeatedly said Canada should become the 51st state of the US and has also placed tariffs on exports to his country. His repeated attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in support for the Liberals. \"We're facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\" Mr Carney said after asking Canada's governor-general to dissolve parliament. \"Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. \"President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us, so America can own us. \"We will not let that happen. We're over the shock of the betrayal but we should never forget the lessons. \"We have to look out for ourselves.

Mr Trudeau, who announced he was resigning in January, had come under pressure after losing support before Mr Trump came to power. The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. While other parties are running, the Liberals and the Conservatives are the only two that have a chance to form a government.

Until his trade and annexation threats, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, 45, had been expected to claim a huge victory at the country's next election. \"I will insist the president recognises the independence and sovereignty of Canada,\" Mr Poilievre said as he launched his own campaign. \"I will insist he stops tariffing our nation.\" Mr Poilievre, a career politician and populist who says he will put \"Canada first\", said he does not respect \"the treatment that he has meted out to our country\"."

        "Content": " The chancellor has said she is \"confident\" 10,000 civil service jobs can be axed after numbers ballooned during the pandemic - as she seeks to cut more than Â£2bn from the budget. Rachel Reeves has told Sky News she is certain the government can deliver those cuts to \"back office jobs\" to free up resources for \"front line\" services. She is expected to unveil a raft of spending cuts during the spring statement on Wednesday - and has reportedly ruled out tax rises. The FDA union has said the government needs to be honest about the move, first reported by The Telegraph, and the \"impact it will have on public services\".  Reeves concedes cuts won't be pain-free Appearing on Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the chancellor was pushed repeatedly for a precise number of civil service jobs she wants to cut, and she eventually replied: \"I'm confident that we can reduce civil service numbers by 10,000. \"And during COVID, there were big increases in the number of people that were working in the civil service. \n                  Prove how many potholes you've fixed or lose cash, councils told\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves is coming out fighting as she prepares to unveil billions in cuts\n                 \n                  UK government borrowing and spending defies expectations, adding to tax rise or spending cut pressure\n                 \"That was the right thing to do to respond to those challenges. But it's not right that we just keep those numbers there forever.\" Ms Reeves said there are \"a number\" of civil service jobs that can be done by technology, while \"efficiencies\" can also be made by getting rid of quangos. Asked what roles she expects to no longer need, she said: \"It will be up for every department to set out those plans. \"But I would rather have people working on the front line in our schools and our hospitals and our police, rather than back office jobs.\" She said cuts will be made to things like travel budgets, spending on consultants, and also on communications. She conceded that the cuts will not be pain free, but says she would rather spend money to \"deliver better public services\". Civil service departments will first have to reduce administrative budgets by 10%, which is expected to save Â£1.5bn a year by 2028-29. The following year, the reduction should be 15%, the Cabinet Office will say - a saving of Â£2.2bn a year. The chancellor has also said she won't be putting up taxes on Wednesday, telling The Sun On Sunday: \"This is not a budget. We're not going to be doing tax raising.\" Ms Reeves added: \"We did have to put up some taxes on businesses and the wealthiest in the country in the budget [in the autumn]. \"We will not be doing that in the spring statement next week.\" The chancellor has repeatedly insisted she won't drop her fiscal rules which preclude borrowing to fund day-to-day spending. Civil service departments will receive instructions from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden in the coming week, The Telegraph reported. \"To deliver our Plan for Change we will reshape the state so it is fit for the future. We cannot stick to business as usual,\" a Cabinet Office source said. \"By cutting administrative costs we can target resources at frontline services - with more teachers in classrooms, extra hospital appointments and police back on the beat.\" The move comes after the government last week revealed welfare cuts it believes will save Â£5bn a year by the end of the decade. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ FDA general secretary Dave Penman said the union welcomed a move away from \"crude headcount targets\" but that the distinction between the back office and frontline is \"artificial\". \"Elected governments are free to decide the size of the civil service they want, but cuts of this scale and speed will inevitably have an impact on what the civil service will be able to deliver for ministers and the countryâ€¦ \"The budgets being cut will, for many departments, involve the majority of their staff and the Â£1.5bn savings mentioned equates to nearly 10% of the salary bill for the entire civil service.\" Ministers need to set out what areas of work they are prepared to stop as part of spending plans, he said. \"The idea that cuts of this scale can be delivered by cutting HR and comms teams is for the birds. This plan will require ministers to be honest with the public and their civil servants about the impact this will have on public services.\" Read more:Analysis: UK growth forecast set for major downgradeWhat could be announced in the spring statement?The spring statement - what you need to know Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, warned that \"a cheaper civil service is not the same as a better civil service\". \"Prospect has consistently warned government against adopting arbitrary targets for civil service headcount cuts which are more about saving money than about genuine civil service reform. \"The government say they will not fall into this trap again.

        "Content": " More than 50,000 people have now been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began, the territory's health ministry says. The Hamas-run authority does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but has previously said more than half of those killed in the conflict were women and children. On Sunday, Israeli strikes hit the surgery department at Nasser Hospital - the largest hospital in southern Gaza - killing five people. Palestinian medics and Hamas said one of the people killed was Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas's political bureau who was reportedly being treated at the hospital for wounds sustained in a previous attack. Israel's defence minister Israel Katz confirmed he was the target of the strike. Israel says Hamas systematically embeds in hospitals, schools and shelters, which the group denies. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said the hospital attack followed extensive intelligence and used precise munitions to minimise harm. Nasser Hospital had already been damaged by raids and strikes since the war began, with reports saying it has been overwhelmed by dead and wounded people. The strike on the hospital came after an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed top Hamas political leader Salah al Bardaweel. He was a member of the party's political bureau and Palestinian parliament and often gave media interviews. In a statement, Hamas said he was \"a beacon of political, media, and national activism\", and a \"symbol of honesty, steadfastness, and sacrifice\". However, the IDF called him a \"senior terrorist\", adding: \"This elimination further degrades Hamas' military and government capabilities.\" The strike, which took place on Khan Younis, also killed his wife - and several other Palestinians. At least 30 more Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah and Khan Younis on Sunday, Gaza health authorities said. The European Hospital and Kuwaiti Hospital said women and children were among those killed in the Khan Younis attack. Gaza's health ministry said 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. That includes 673 people killed since Israel's bombardment on Tuesday shattered the ceasefire.  Explosions through the night Explosions took place throughout the north, central, and southern Gaza Strip in the early hours of Sunday - with Israeli planes hitting several targets. On Sunday, the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate from part of Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. Ayda Abu Shaer, displaced from Rafah, was caught up in the shelling, and told the Associated Press: \"We died tonight. Tanks are shelling us, our tents and houses, and they are shooting at us. We never slept. In the morning, they told us to leave. They threw leaflets.\" \"All the way, they were shooting at us and dropping shells and rockets. We threw ourselves into the streets and fell, asking for mercy. Enough is enough. We are exhausted. Our sons and daughters are dead, and the children have been orphaned. \"We don't know what to do.\" 'No ambulances and no Red Cross' Hadeel Ghanim, also forced to leave Rafah, said: \"There is no ambulances and no Red Cross. People have been walking for hours, with them elderly people and children unable to move. \"We do not know where to go. We left without tents, without mattresses, without anything. We do not know where to go or what to do. For God's sake, save us.\"  The war began when Hamas militants carried out a cross-border raid into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing around 250 hostages. Israel responded by launching an air and ground offensive in Gaza. On Tuesday, Israel's military abandoned the ceasefire agreement that began on 19 January by resuming significant airstrikes on Gaza. Israel claims Hamas broke the ceasefire - something the group denies, in turn accusing Israel of violating the agreement that was initiated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. Speaking to Israel's ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely, Sky's Sophy Ridge on Thursday challenged the idea that Hamas broke the ceasefire, given the militant group released all the hostages that were agreed upon during the first phase. Mr Hotovely said: \"Hamas is not releasing hostages anymore. Israel has no other choice rather than putting pressure on a terror organisation.\" Read more from Sky News:Pope returns home to Vatican after hospital stayTurkish president's main rival jailed pending trial Hamas has spent weeks calling for serious talks on the ceasefire agreement's second phase, which calls for the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian political prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent ceasefire. But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying \"bridging\" proposals from US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Yet Mr Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday Hamas was responsible for renewed fighting after rejecting efforts to move forward with an \"acceptable deal\". \"This is on Hamas. The United States stands with the state of Israel,\" Mr Witkoff told Fox News. \"Hamas had every opportunity to demilitarise, to accept the bridging proposal.\" Talks were supposed to begin last month. It is unclear when - or if - they will now take place. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio about developments including efforts to release hostages and the resumption of fighting. Mr Rubio expressed the US's unwavering support for Israel and its policy, Mr Netanyahu's office said. 'Israel has no other choice' Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted the primary aim of the war is to destroy Hamas in its entirety. He has also said Israel's latest military assault hopes to force Hamas to give up the remaining hostages. It comes as the Israeli protesters took to the streets for a sixth day, angry at Mr Netanyahu's approach to getting the remaining hostages home, his attempt to remove the head of the Shin Bet domestic security service and now his cabinet's motion of no confidence in the attorney general. Mr Netanyahu's bid to sack Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar was a first in Israel's history, but was blocked by the country's top court pending an appeal. The attorney general has frequently clashed with the government over the legality of some of its policies and the agency had also been investigating corruption allegations linking Qatar with Netanyahu's office. Mr Netanyahu's cabinet approved a no-confidence motion against the attorney general on Sunday, in its latest move on officials deemed hostile to the government Protesters have argued that the right-wing government is undermining key state institutions. Families and supporters of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza have vented their anger at what many see as the government's abandonment of their loved ones."

        "Content": "\n          Communities correspondent\n              @LisaatSky\n  It was a remarkable appearance in so many ways - magical for the crowds outside the Gemelli hospital, and of course also for the Pope, who thrives on interaction with the faithful. Bear in mind this is an 88-year-old who has been fighting for his life and at one point during the last five weeks was in a critical condition with pneumonia in both lungs. Even the Pope's own doctors said his life was in danger, yet he's currently on a steady path to recovery and has now left hospital. But seeing the fragile pontiff on the balcony, while alert and giving the thumbs up, at one point he also looked uncomfortable and was struggling to breathe after just a few minutes before the crowd. As he was driven back to the Vatican in his white Fiat Papal car, he was dependent on the use of nasal cannulas to supply him with oxygen. This was the day it became clear the papacy will never be the same again. This is now a papacy which is less dynamic and more prophetic. The Pope's mind, we have consistently been told, is agile. During his stay in hospital, doctors said he \"had the mind of a 50-year-old\". So we can now expect a Pope who will lead spiritually but hardly in person - at least for the next two months. We can expect more balcony appearances from the Vatican in future. But his overseas visits will almost certainly be cancelled and his meetings limited. Pope Francis clearly still has a lot of recovering to do - but he has made it clear he wants this to continue from the Vatican as soon as possible."

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  Campaigners say a new 100% council tax premium on second homes in England will do little to ease the housing crisis, with one group describing it as a \"naked cash grab\". Exclusive Sky News data shows around 75% of councils in England will introduce the discretionary charge from April - essentially doubling the council tax on properties classed as second homes. England follows in the footsteps of Wales, which already charges a premium. Government data shows there are around 557,000 second homes in England. Hotspots such as Cornwall, Torbay, Norfolk and Somerset are introducing the tax - but there are many towns and inner-city areas such as Rochdale and Bristol, and London boroughs including Wandsworth, Camden and Hackney, also bringing it in. Sky News analysis shows the new charge, being introduced by more than 200 councils, could generate an extra Â£445m in revenue. Elliot Keck from the TaxPayers' Alliance says the premium is unfair. \"It's a very naked cash grab,\" he said. \"There's a simple principle of council tax that comes from when it was first introduced, which is that it's supposed to be linked to some extent on how much you use services.  \"If you have a second home in an area that you use for only a couple of months a year, you're actually using services much, much less than if that was someone's primary property. So, if anything, really you should actually be getting a discount on your council tax, not a premium.\" There are also concerns about potential loopholes. If a second home is put up for sale, provided by an employer, or undergoing major refurbishment, the owners may be exempt from paying the premium. Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, says the aim is to encourage councils to address the housing crisis in their areas - but admits it is not a silver bullet. \"No one is overstating the power of this - it is a nudge in the right direction,\" he said. \"It is one of a suite of tools that can be used. In and of itself it will not solve the housing crisis, but it is a step in the right direction if councils wish to use that to better manage their supply.\" 'Doubling tax isn't sufficient' Cornwall has long been the second home capital of England. Cath Hayes, from Redruth, co-founded First Not Second Homes - a campaign group against second homes in the county. \"In my opinion, doubling the council tax isn't sufficient,\" she said. \"I think it needs to be more than double - because it's not a deterrent, it is a tool among other things. If you can afford a house in Cornwall, you're doing well. If you can afford two houses - then it's not a deterrent.\" Jenna Jones, a local cafe chef who lives in a private rental in Trevone, North Cornwall, with her husband and five children, says they have had to move numerous times due to landlords selling up. \"It has been the most horrendous struggle of our life,\" she said. \"Before we found this letting here in Trevone I applied for over 23 properties in Cornwall.\" Stuck between a rock and a hard place The family pays nearly Â£2,000 a month in rent - but owning a property is out of reach. \"It has consumed our family life,\" Ms Jones says. \"And everybody else I work with locally - none of us are in a position where we can afford the going rents and nobody that I know that I work with can afford to buy. So we're really stuck between a rock and a hard place - and we really need a solution.\" And she does not believe the premium tax will help release housing stock. \"It's not going to make a difference. For many of the owners of second homes, a double council tax is maybe just like dropping a fiver out of their pocket.\" Read more from Sky News:'Migrant hub' plan will send alarm bells clangingBaby died because midwives failed to provide basic care In a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Sky News it is \"determined\" to fix \"the housing crisis we have inherited\".

Two Glasgow boys, aged 14 and 15, were arrested and charged that weekend in connection with the incident after a murder investigation was opened. On Sunday, Police Scotland said a third boy, aged 16, had been arrested and charged in connection with Amen's death. They said he would appear in court in due course, and that a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal, the public prosecutor. The two boys arrested and charged earlier appeared in court on 10 March. The 14-year-old boy was charged with murder, while both were accused of assault and carrying an offensive weapon in a public place. The teenagers made no plea to the charges.

        "Content": "Fraud experts are set to investigate suspicions thousands of students are fraudulently claiming hundreds of millions of pounds in student loans with no plans to study - or pay the money back. The Public Sector Fraud Authority has been directed by Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson to start work immediately to halt the \"growing threat\" and support investigations that are already under way. It follows a Sunday Times investigation which reports students with \"absolutely no academic intent\" are enrolling on degree courses in order to claim tens of thousands of pounds with no intention of repaying the money. For the 2025-26 academic year, students can apply for tuition fee and maintenance loans of up to Â£25,440. The money is only paid back once the student has left university and their income has reached a certain threshold, depending on the loan plan, starting at about Â£25,000 a year. The debt is written off if not paid within 40 years. Writing for the newspaper, Ms Phillipson said the allegations of potential fraud point to \"one of the biggest financial scandals universities have faced\". Most of the suspected incidents are believed to be at \"franchised\" universities - colleges paid to provide courses for established universities - and officials are concerned there is \"organised recruitment\" of Romanian nationals, the Sunday Times reported. The investigation into the system came after the Student Loans Company noticed suspicious applications involving fake documents, it said. 'Not enough care taken to join the dots' In her piece, Ms Phillipson said the \"revelations\" deal \"a hammer blow to the integrity of higher education\" in the UK and \"demand the firmest action\". The Student Loans Company has been working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the prevalence of some Romanian students at certain institutions, the education secretary said, \"but not enough care was taken to join the dots of wider abuse taking place across the system and to slam the door shut on widespread abuse\". Ms Phillipson said she will also bring forward new legislation \"at the first available opportunity\" to ensure the Office for Students \"has tough new powers to intervene quickly and robustly to protect public money\".  A Department for Education spokesperson said it would \"stop at nothing to protect public money\" and that any potential misuse of student loans \"is an insult to hard-working students striving for better opportunities\". It said the government's Plan for Change, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in December, \"will restore trust\" in the UK's universities. \"We have already taken clear action to crack down on rogue franchise operators to tackle fraud, and we'll go further,\" the spokesperson said. \"We will overhaul regulation so the Office for Students better protects taxpayers' money. In the meantime, we have asked the OfS to clamp down on franchising.\" Read more:Civil service to cut 10,000 jobsThe Plan for Change explained If misuse or fraud is uncovered, the government has \"powers to claw back payments - and we won't hesitate to use them\", the statement added. \"We will bring in tough new laws to ensure the OfS can quickly stop bad actors gaming the system once and for all.\" Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, said: \"The type of sharp practices alleged by this investigation are entirely unacceptable. They represent shocking misuse of public funding and take advantage of genuine students who are not getting the education they deserve.\""

But councils have also been warned they must provide data on the state of their roads.",
        "Content": "The government is telling local councils they must publish data on how many potholes they have fixed or risk losing their share of an extra Â£500m set aside for fixing roads.  From the middle of next month, local authorities across England will start to receive their allocation of the Â£1.6bn for fixing roads across the country. But in order to get the full amount, all councils must publish annual reports on how many potholes they've filled - or see a quarter of the additional Â£500m in funding the government has allocated this year withheld. By 30 June, all councils must publish reports detailing how much they are spending, how many potholes they have filled, what percentage of their roads are in what condition, and how they are minimising disruption. Meanwhile, the transport secretary is unveiling a funding package of Â£4.8bn for 2025-6 for National Highways to deliver critical road schemes and maintain motorways and major A-roads. This new money will mean \"pivotal\" road construction schemes can be pushed forward, the government said. This is a key part of Downing Street's drive to ensure the voting public sees and feels the difference the government is making in their local communities as they fight off a challenge from Reform UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The broken roads we inherited are not only risking lives but also cost working families, drivers and businesses hundreds - if not thousands of pounds - in avoidable vehicle repairs. \"British people are bored of seeing their politicians aimlessly pointing at potholes with no real plan to fix them. That ends with us. \"We've done our part by handing councils the cash and certainty they need - now it's up to them to get on with the job, put that money to use and prove they're delivering for their communities.\" Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: \"After years of neglect we're tackling the pothole plague, building vital roads and ensuring every penny is delivering results for the taxpayer.\" Responding to the announcement, the transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association said the cash will \"help start to address the previously ever-growing backlog of local road repairs\" which, he added, \"could take more than a decade to fix\". Councillor Adam Hug also called for the government to \"play its full part\" by using its Spending Review \"to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures\". The Conservatives have responded by claiming Labour \"want credit for handing councils a pothole sticking plaster\". Gareth Bacon, shadow transport secretary, continued: \"Labour are running on empty. They've got no plan for motorists, no grip on the problem, and no credibility. \"Voters shouldn't be fooled - Labour aren't fixing the roads, they're steering Britain into a ditch.\" Spending on roads and cuts in Whitehall The spending on roads across England comes as the chancellor is preparing to make billions of pounds of spending cuts at the spring statement on Wednesday. A turbulent economic climate since October means the Â£9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom (the amount she could increase spending or cut taxes without breaking her fiscal rules) has been wiped out. The government has confirmed it will force the civil service to slash Â£2bn a year from its budget by cutting administration costs by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips she is \"confident\" they can cut 10,000 jobs from \"back office\" roles to ensure resources can be spent on front-line services.  A total of Â£5bn is expected to be saved by making it more difficult to qualify for Pip, and also abolishing the work capability assessment in 2028, which determines whether someone on universal credit is fit to work. Quangos are also on the chopping block, with the prime minister having already announced NHS England is being abolished to both bring the health service back under more direct ministerial control, and also save money. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Money is being redirected towards defence, with the chancellor expected to announce Â£400m in spending on the government's new UK Defence Investment body to \"harness UK ingenuity and boost military technology\", The Mirror reports. And the full details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence are expected, after the prime minister said UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.  Speaking to Trevor Phillips, the chancellor said \"the world has changed\" as she laid the groundwork for the spring statement. \"We'll respond to the change and continue to meet our fiscal rule,\" she said. \"But we're also shaping the new world, whether that's in the defence and security realm, or indeed on the economy. More from Sky News:Reeves 'rejects' analysis on living standardsWhat could be in the spring statement? The chancellor highlighted that \"interest rates have been cut three times since the general election\", adding: \"That's a far cry from the 11% inflation and the interest rate hikes that we saw under the previous government.\" But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the government has not \"gripped the economy\", accusing ministers of having talked it down and having a negative impact on growth."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n  Citrusdal is a seemingly idyllic farming town named after the fruit it grows. Nestled in a valley at the base of the Western Cape's Cederberg mountains, it's home to rows and rows of orange and lemon trees. The tangerines in the orchards are still as green as the leaves. Harvest will come in July and August, then the fruit will be picked and boxed for export to the UK, Europe and the US. But as tensions heighten between the South African government and Trump's administration, this vital export may never land on US soil. South Africa is one of the biggest exporters in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a trade agreement providing Sub-Saharan countries with preferential access to US markets through tariff-free imports. AGOA is due for renewal at the end of September 2025 and is incredibly vulnerable to getting the axe from Mr Trump, as he imposes tariffs on his closest neighbours Canada and Mexico. Here in Citrusdal, alarms are sounding as market experts recommend South Africa withdraws from AGOA willingly to offset risk, rather than face the storm in September. Gerrit van der Merwe, chair of the Citrus Growers' Association and managing director of ALG Estates, says he hopes an adult in the room will make the right decision. \"We take a step back, that's a hit. Not just on the farmers but on all the community. If we are missing out on prosperity the slack will probably get picked up either by a citrus farmer in Peru or some farmer in Spain,\" says Gerrit. South Africa is the world's second-largest exporter of citrus after Spain. Though only 9% of South African citrus goes to the US, a complete withdrawal of tariff-free access could impact thousands of jobs. \"AGOA is probably responsible for 35,000 jobs in the citrus industry in South Africa but also indirectly responsible for 25,000 jobs in the US for truck driving, repacking, running cold rooms and that type of thing. We have a 35 to 45% unemployment rate in South Africa. We need wins,\" says Gerrit. A black labourer on the back of a tractor waves as he drives by. On the edges of the farm, workers from the Coloured community, a legally recognised racial group of historically underprivileged mixed South Africans, are on the back of wagons full of insect-infected oranges they cleared from the trees to keep them healthy. They are working land that was acquired during the founding years of the Dutch occupation of the Cape from the 17th century and passed down 13 generations to Gerrit and his family. The racialised legacy of land ownership was entrenched by apartheid rule during South Africa's mining boom and remains the reality here. White people make up 7% of the population but own more than half the land. A new land expropriation act signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa allows for the government to seize land in the public interest. The bill is yet to be enacted but has drawn the ire of Mr Trump, who responded with an executive order calling the actions egregious and hateful towards \"racially disfavoured landowners\" and offered asylum to Afrikaners. It is reported 67,000 farmers have shown interest in US asylum but Gerrit says that is not an option for the citrus growers in his association. \"I don't think anybody is taking it seriously. You will always have a fringe in any society of 5 or 10% that will take it up and will carry that flag but most of the people I deal with love South Africa and would like to stay,\" he says. \"We do feel a bit isolated about the fear-mongering because we don't see it on a daily basis. We are not that security conscious on a daily basis.\" He adds: \"I'm not exposed to the guys up north and I think that some people are in really tough situations.\" Read more:South Africans with HIV left in turmoilTrump threatens to stop SA funding Up north, Wannie Scribante proudly shows us the security set-up protecting his small private farm. His cameras have AI technology that spots the movement of people, and he shares stills of his black labourers as they work the edges of the farm. He hasn't had a single intrusion or theft since he set up the cameras three years ago but still feels threatened by squatters and the risk of land expropriation. \"I'm concerned that this has been pushed by a government that is not honest with us. Why do they write in expropriation without compensation? Then they tell me we're not going to do that? It is silly to spend so much time on it and do a law if you're not going to do that,\" says Wannie. Though Wannie does not believe the debunked claims of a white genocide being repeated by Elon Musk, he still appreciates the cover coming from the Oval Office after feeling ignored by the South African government. \"They say why don't you talk to us? I mean we are trying to and they don't listen. We don't even get appointments. Now, suddenly someone else says it and it opens up the conversation of our problems that we have.\" I ask him if white South African farmers are being used to push an agenda. \"Most probably, yes. \"I think President Trump has things he is not happy about - the expropriation law, targeting, things like that - but I don't think that is his biggest problem. I think his biggest problem is our government's friendliness with their enemies. \"He is more worried about our ties to Hamas, Iran and China.\""

Asked what roles she expects to no longer need, she said: \"It will be up for every department to set out those plans. \"But I would rather have people working on the front line in our schools and our hospitals and our police, rather than back office jobs.\" She said cuts will be made to things like travel budgets, spending on consultants, and also on communications. She conceded that the cuts will not be pain free, but says she would rather spend money to \"deliver better public services\". Civil service departments will first have to reduce administrative budgets by 10%, which is expected to save Â£1.5bn a year by 2028-29. The following year, the reduction should be 15%, the Cabinet Office will say - a saving of Â£2.2bn a year.

We're not going to be doing tax raising.\" Ms Reeves added: \"We did have to put up some taxes on businesses and the wealthiest in the country in the budget [in the autumn]. \"We will not be doing that in the spring statement next week.\" The chancellor has repeatedly insisted she won't drop her fiscal rules which preclude borrowing to fund day-to-day spending. Civil service departments will receive instructions from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden in the coming week, The Telegraph reported. \"To deliver our Plan for Change we will reshape the state so it is fit for the future.

He had been attending a warm-up event for the Notting Hill Carnival with friends. But the family fun day turned into tragedy when Rene was gunned down in front of hundreds of revellers. \"It's broken, shattered my life...

No school, nothing for five yearsâ€¦ and down to all of that, he ended up where he was, living the life he was living.\" \"They failed him and I need them to take responsibility for that,\" she adds.

Hotspots such as Cornwall, Torbay, Norfolk and Somerset are introducing the tax - but there are many towns and inner-city areas such as Rochdale and Bristol, and London boroughs including Wandsworth, Camden and Hackney, also bringing it in. Sky News analysis shows the new charge, being introduced by more than 200 councils, could generate an extra Â£445m in revenue. Elliot Keck from the TaxPayers' Alliance says the premium is unfair. \"It's a very naked cash grab,\" he said. \"There's a simple principle of council tax that comes from when it was first introduced, which is that it's supposed to be linked to some extent on how much you use services.  \"If you have a second home in an area that you use for only a couple of months a year, you're actually using services much, much less than if that was someone's primary property. So, if anything, really you should actually be getting a discount on your council tax, not a premium.\" There are also concerns about potential loopholes. If a second home is put up for sale, provided by an employer, or undergoing major refurbishment, the owners may be exempt from paying the premium. Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, says the aim is to encourage councils to address the housing crisis in their areas - but admits it is not a silver bullet. \"No one is overstating the power of this - it is a nudge in the right direction,\" he said. \"It is one of a suite of tools that can be used. In and of itself it will not solve the housing crisis, but it is a step in the right direction if councils wish to use that to better manage their supply.\" 'Doubling tax isn't sufficient' Cornwall has long been the second home capital of England. Cath Hayes, from Redruth, co-founded First Not Second Homes - a campaign group against second homes in the county. \"In my opinion, doubling the council tax isn't sufficient,\" she said. \"I think it needs to be more than double - because it's not a deterrent, it is a tool among other things. If you can afford a house in Cornwall, you're doing well. If you can afford two houses - then it's not a deterrent.\" Jenna Jones, a local cafe chef who lives in a private rental in Trevone, North Cornwall, with her husband and five children, says they have had to move numerous times due to landlords selling up. \"It has been the most horrendous struggle of our life,\" she said. \"Before we found this letting here in Trevone I applied for over 23 properties in Cornwall.\" Stuck between a rock and a hard place The family pays nearly Â£2,000 a month in rent - but owning a property is out of reach. \"It has consumed our family life,\" Ms Jones says. \"And everybody else I work with locally - none of us are in a position where we can afford the going rents and nobody that I know that I work with can afford to buy. So we're really stuck between a rock and a hard place - and we really need a solution.\" And she does not believe the premium tax will help release housing stock. \"It's not going to make a difference. For many of the owners of second homes, a double council tax is maybe just like dropping a fiver out of their pocket.\" Read more from Sky News:'Migrant hub' plan will send alarm bells clangingBaby died because midwives failed to provide basic care In a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Sky News it is \"determined\" to fix \"the housing crisis we have inherited\". Too many second homes in an area can drive up housing costs and \"damage public services\", it said. \"That is why local authorities will be able to apply a premium of up to 100% extra on the council tax bills of second homes to give local areas extra cash to address the impacts of second homes and protect their communities.\""

        "Headline": "The poorest households could be hit the hardest, with a predicted loss to disposable income double that of more well-off families.",
        "Content": " The chancellor says she \"rejects\" new analysis that suggests the average family could be Â£1,400 a year worse off by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme that living standards will \"increase during the course of this parliament\". She insisted there has already been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour came to power last year. The analysis, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), says frozen tax thresholds, rising mortgage and rent costs, and falling real earnings are all predicted to take their toll on living standards in Britain. For the poorest third, living standards are forecast to drop twice as much compared with middle and high earners. The charity believes the government will miss one of its stated \"milestones\" - to raise living standards across the UK before the next election. It says the Â£1,400 drop by April 2030 means a 3% fall in disposable income for the average family, while the lowest income households will be Â£900 per year worse off - a 6% fall.  The situation could be even bleaker for some, as the analysis doesn't account for the recently announced Â£5bn in cuts to disability benefits. Average earnings are also set to fall by Â£700 per year by 2030, according to the JRF. The charity - which conducts research into reducing poverty - says it came up with its prediction by modelling forecasts from the Bank of England and others. Chancellor 'confident we will see living standards increase' Asked by Trevor Phillips for her response to the findings, the chancellor said she \"rejects\" them. Ms Reeves argued living standards in the last parliament \"were the worst ever on record\", and said the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in October they are expected to increase, while wages are currently rising at twice the rate of inflation. \"I'm confident that we will see living standards increase during the course of this parliament,\" the chancellor insisted, adding there has been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour was elected. \"We've got to do more, absolutely, in terms of raising living standards. But this government has already got started in delivering our plan for change.\"  But the JRF says the government welfare cuts are \"wrong\" and counterproductive and wants the plan scrapped. It also urges a new \"minimum floor\" for Universal Credit to help address hardship, and believes the government should instead raise cash by increasing tax on wealth and investments. The analysis comes three days before the chancellor's spring statement in which more cuts are set to be announced in a bid to improve the country's finances. Some Â£2bn in cuts to the civil service are expected - but Ms Reeves says they will not affect front line services. She has also confirmed to The Sun On Sunday that she won't be announcing any new tax rises.

Growth is Labour's top priority, but the Bank of England recently halved its growth outlook for the UK economy this year to 0.75%. There are also worries next month's hike to employer national insurance and the minimum wage will create further drag on investment."

        "Content": "Sir Ed Davey has launched a furious attack on \"unpatriotic\" Nigel Farage for once saying he \"admires\" Vladimir Putin, claiming the Reform leader would \"turn our great country into little more than a Donald Trump tribute act\". In a speech at his party's spring conference, the Liberal Democrat leader accused Donald Trump of \"betraying Ukraine\" and \"selling outâ€¦ the security of Europe and the security of our United Kingdom\". He framed his party as the only one \"speaking up in defiance\" of the US president, and called on the government not to \"appease\" him. Politics Hub: Follow live updates The Lib Dem leader was speaking just weeks before the local elections on 1 May, when he is hoping to make further gains from the Conservative Party and stop Reform UK from making up any ground. 'Unforgivable' of Trump to 'betray Ukraine' In his lengthy speech to the party faithful, Sir Ed said this is \"a time of great peril for our continent, and for our country\". \"Because Donald Trump is not only betraying Ukraine,\" he said. \"It's not only their sovereignty he's selling out. It's our security. The security of Europe and the security of our United Kingdom. And that is unforgivable.\" He said Putin has \"fooled Donald Trump into thinking that his ambitions do not extend beyond parts of Ukraine\", and pointed to Russia's activities in countries such as Georgia, Moldova and Romania, accusing Russia of \"undermining their democracies and seeking to extend his grip further into Europe\". He expressed pride in the UK's response to Russia's invasion, and said he was \"proud that the prime minister brought Europe and Canada together here in Britain to chart a way forward, the day after those appalling scenes of Trump and Vance ambushing President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office\". Farage 'out of touch with British values' Sir Ed said one has to \"stand up\" to people like Mr Trump and Mr Putin, who are \"offend[ing] fundamental British values of decency, fair play, respect for national sovereignty and the rule of law\". But he said there is \"one lone holdout\" who \"simply doesn't seem to get it\" - and that is Nigel Farage, who \"thinks Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are great\" in a \"celebrity crush kind of way\". Referencing Mr Farage's comments from over a decade ago that Putin is the leader he most admires, Sir Ed said: \"How despicable. How completely out-of-touch with British values. With human values. How unpatriotic. How deeply un-British. \"And this from a man who thinks he can be our prime minister. Not on our watch.\" He went on to say that the Reform UK leader has \"nothing to say\" about the challenges facing the health service, noting that he has \"never uttered the word 'care' once in parliament\". He accused the insurgent right-wing party of peddling \"superficial, simplistic, snake-oil solutions\", and choosing to \"exploit\" the \"struggles and anxieties\" of the British people \"for their own selfish ends\". Badenoch has a 'sneering attitude' Sir Ed also hit out at the Conservative Party for \"chasing Reform's tail\". He pointed to Kemi Badenoch recently saying that a \"typical Liberal Democrat will be somebody who is good at fixing their church roof and people in the community like them\". \"I think she meant it as an insult. But I'll happily wear it as a badge of honour,\" he said. \"Because she's right. Liberal Democrats fix things.\" He went on to say that she has \"good reason\" not to like his party, noting that they took 60 seats off the Tories at the general election. \"But what I'm talking about is the sneering attitude of the leader of the Conservatives, the sneering attitude that says fixing church roofs is somehow beneath her. Even beneath politics altogether. \"That what happens in our communities is trivial and insignificant compared to debating the true meaning of conservatism on Twitter.\" Sir Ed added that the Tories have \"abandoned our communities\" and public services, which is \"why so many lifelong Conservative voters have turned to the Liberal Democrats\". 'Impose tariffs on Musk's Tesla cars' The Lib Dem leader also had a few notes for the Labour government, calling on ministers to impose import tariffs on Tesla cars in retaliation for any tariffs imposed on the UK by the Trump administration, in which Tesla boss Elon Musk is a key player. Sir Ed criticised the government for not ruling out changing or scrapping the tax on tech giants' UK profits in order to avoid tariffs, saying: \"Appeasement never works with bullies, and it doesn't work with Trump - as his tariffs on British steel already show.\" He also called on the government to go further in its efforts to support Ukraine, arguing that frozen Russian assets should be given in funding, and saying he wants to join a new European Rearmament Bank. On economic growth, Sir Ed called for \"a new deal with the EU, with a Customs Union at its heart - putting us on a path back to the single market\".  'This is a battle for the future' In closing, Sir Ed said his party's \"liberal belief in internationalism [...] offers the solution\" to the problems facing the UK, \"with Trump in the White House and Farage leading a Trump tribute act\". \"Our trademark community politics is the only way to defeat their cynical populism. The threat they pose is grave. The challenge before us is great. \"This is a battle of competing values. A battle of competing visions. A battle for the future. We didn't choose this fight. But friends, I know you are up for it. I know together we can win it.\""

But councils have also been warned they must provide data on the state of their roads.",
        "Content": "The government is telling local councils they must publish data on how many potholes they have fixed or risk losing their share of an extra Â£500m set aside for fixing roads.  From the middle of next month, local authorities across England will start to receive their allocation of the Â£1.6bn for fixing roads across the country. But in order to get the full amount, all councils must publish annual reports on how many potholes they've filled - or see a quarter of the additional Â£500m in funding the government has allocated this year withheld. By 30 June, all councils must publish reports detailing how much they are spending, how many potholes they have filled, what percentage of their roads are in what condition, and how they are minimising disruption. Meanwhile, the transport secretary is unveiling a funding package of Â£4.8bn for 2025-6 for National Highways to deliver critical road schemes and maintain motorways and major A-roads. This new money will mean \"pivotal\" road construction schemes can be pushed forward, the government said. This is a key part of Downing Street's drive to ensure the voting public sees and feels the difference the government is making in their local communities as they fight off a challenge from Reform UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The broken roads we inherited are not only risking lives but also cost working families, drivers and businesses hundreds - if not thousands of pounds - in avoidable vehicle repairs. \"British people are bored of seeing their politicians aimlessly pointing at potholes with no real plan to fix them. That ends with us. \"We've done our part by handing councils the cash and certainty they need - now it's up to them to get on with the job, put that money to use and prove they're delivering for their communities.\" Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: \"After years of neglect we're tackling the pothole plague, building vital roads and ensuring every penny is delivering results for the taxpayer.\" Responding to the announcement, the transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association said the cash will \"help start to address the previously ever-growing backlog of local road repairs\" which, he added, \"could take more than a decade to fix\". Councillor Adam Hug also called for the government to \"play its full part\" by using its Spending Review \"to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures\". The Conservatives have responded by claiming Labour \"want credit for handing councils a pothole sticking plaster\". Gareth Bacon, shadow transport secretary, continued: \"Labour are running on empty. They've got no plan for motorists, no grip on the problem, and no credibility. \"Voters shouldn't be fooled - Labour aren't fixing the roads, they're steering Britain into a ditch.\" Spending on roads and cuts in Whitehall The spending on roads across England comes as the chancellor is preparing to make billions of pounds of spending cuts at the spring statement on Wednesday. A turbulent economic climate since October means the Â£9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom (the amount she could increase spending or cut taxes without breaking her fiscal rules) has been wiped out. The government has confirmed it will force the civil service to slash Â£2bn a year from its budget by cutting administration costs by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips she is \"confident\" they can cut 10,000 jobs from \"back office\" roles to ensure resources can be spent on front-line services.  A total of Â£5bn is expected to be saved by making it more difficult to qualify for Pip, and also abolishing the work capability assessment in 2028, which determines whether someone on universal credit is fit to work.

Speaking to Trevor Phillips, the chancellor said \"the world has changed\" as she laid the groundwork for the spring statement. \"We'll respond to the change and continue to meet our fiscal rule,\" she said. \"But we're also shaping the new world, whether that's in the defence and security realm, or indeed on the economy.

The chancellor highlighted that \"interest rates have been cut three times since the general election\", adding: \"That's a far cry from the 11% inflation and the interest rate hikes that we saw under the previous government.\" But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the government has not \"gripped the economy\", accusing ministers of having talked it down and having a negative impact on growth."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n       Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has snubbed Sir Keir Starmer's plans for Ukraine. The prime minister has suggested a \"coalition of the willing\", made up of several European and NATO countries, could provide boots on the ground in Ukraine after a ceasefire. Mr Witkoff - who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine and Russia - dismissed Sir Keir's plans as a \"combination of a posture and a pose\" in an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson. He also accused the prime minister of adopting the \"simplistic\" notion that leaders \"have all got to be like Winston Churchill\". \"The Russians are going to march across Europe. I think that's preposterous. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.\" Mr Witkoff recently met with the Russian president in Moscow and told Carlson he \"liked\" Vladimir Putin. \"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy\", he said. \"I thought that he was straight up with me.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves defended the prime minister in an interview with Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC, after being shown the Carlson clip. She said: \"I think we can see the impact of our prime minister's diplomatic efforts, bringing together European leaders, and indeed leaders from other countries around the world. \"And also being in constant dialogue with President Trump, as well as Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who we welcomed to London a couple of weeks ago.\" The chancellor also said she was not \"put off\" by Mr Witkoff's comments. She added: \"We will need to make sure that if there is a ceasefire, it can be enforced and that's what our prime minister - along with allies around the world - is trying to secure.\" Sir Ed Davey, speaking in Harrogate on Sunday, was more direct in his criticism of Mr Witkoff's comments. The Liberal Democrat leader said: \"And Trump's so-called 'special' envoy might dismiss British leadership as pointless posturing, but we know what it really is. \"Britain leading in Europe again as we have done in the greatest moments of our nation's history.\" Read more on Sky News:Pope speaks in public for first time in five weeksChancellor says civil service can be cut by 10,000 peopleTurkish president Erdogan's main rival formally arrested Ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will begin on Monday in Saudi Arabia, and both nations are expected to hold indirect talks mediated by the US. The hope is that both sides will agree on pausing long-range attacks on energy facilities and civilian infrastructure.

        "Content": " Hundreds of thousands of protesters filled Istanbul's streets on Sunday for a fifth night of protest against the arrest ofÂ the Turkish president's main rival. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, was detained on Wednesday and formally arrested and jailed pending trial over corruption charges earlier on Sunday. Police used pepper spray and fired rubber bullets into the crowd that gathered outside Istanbul's city hall. Reporting from Istanbul on Sunday evening, Sky News' special correspondent Alex Crawford described the protests as \"relatively peaceful\" but said they were \"the biggest protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade\". The huge demonstrations have continued despite a ban on gatherings in Istanbul imposed this week - but many protesters hid their faces with masks. Most protesters did not want to speak on camera as they were scared of being recognised, Crawford said, but they took to the streets because \"they feel their democracy is being eroded\". She said questions remained over how long authorities would allow these protests to continue - and whether they will escalate into a real crisis for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The protests intensified after Mr Imamoglu was charged on Sunday with running a criminal organisation, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging. A request to detain Mr Imamoglu on terror-related charges was denied. Following the ruling, he was transferred to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. Mr Imamoglu has labelled all of the claims \"unimaginable accusations and slanders\". Many view his detention as a political move to remove him from the 2028 presidential race - deepening concerns over the country's democracy and the rule of law.  The Turkish government denies Mr Imamoglu's arrest was politically motivated and says the courts are independent. Mr Erdogan has served as Turkey's president since his Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003. Its biggest opponent in the next election looks set to be the Republican People's Party (CHP), which this weekend began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Mr Imamoglu, their only presidential candidate. The party also set up solidarity boxes where non-members could show their support - and at the time of last night's protest, more than 13 million had done so, according to the CHP. In a post on social media, Mr Imamoglu praised the result, saying the people had told Mr Erdogan: \"Enough is enough.\" \"That ballot box will arrive and the nation will deliver a slap to the administration it will never forget,\" he added. More from Sky News:Pope returns homeCanadian PM calls snap election Mr Imamoglu - who could be prevented from running for president if he is convicted - was one of 48 people jailed pending trial this weekend. The others being held include a key aide and two Istanbul district mayors. While the protests have largely been peaceful, there has been some violence in Istanbul, as well as other cities including Ankara and Izmir. Clashes have seen police deploy water cannon, tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, some of whom threw stones and fireworks at riot officers. Turkey's interior minister said 323 people were detained on Saturday evening over disturbances at protests."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n  Citrusdal is a seemingly idyllic farming town named after the fruit it grows. Nestled in a valley at the base of the Western Cape's Cederberg mountains, it's home to rows and rows of orange and lemon trees. The tangerines in the orchards are still as green as the leaves. Harvest will come in July and August, then the fruit will be picked and boxed for export to the UK, Europe and the US. But as tensions heighten between the South African government and Trump's administration, this vital export may never land on US soil. South Africa is one of the biggest exporters in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a trade agreement providing Sub-Saharan countries with preferential access to US markets through tariff-free imports. AGOA is due for renewal at the end of September 2025 and is incredibly vulnerable to getting the axe from Mr Trump, as he imposes tariffs on his closest neighbours Canada and Mexico. Here in Citrusdal, alarms are sounding as market experts recommend South Africa withdraws from AGOA willingly to offset risk, rather than face the storm in September. Gerrit van der Merwe, chair of the Citrus Growers' Association and managing director of ALG Estates, says he hopes an adult in the room will make the right decision. \"We take a step back, that's a hit. Not just on the farmers but on all the community. If we are missing out on prosperity the slack will probably get picked up either by a citrus farmer in Peru or some farmer in Spain,\" says Gerrit. South Africa is the world's second-largest exporter of citrus after Spain. Though only 9% of South African citrus goes to the US, a complete withdrawal of tariff-free access could impact thousands of jobs. \"AGOA is probably responsible for 35,000 jobs in the citrus industry in South Africa but also indirectly responsible for 25,000 jobs in the US for truck driving, repacking, running cold rooms and that type of thing. We have a 35 to 45% unemployment rate in South Africa. We need wins,\" says Gerrit. A black labourer on the back of a tractor waves as he drives by. On the edges of the farm, workers from the Coloured community, a legally recognised racial group of historically underprivileged mixed South Africans, are on the back of wagons full of insect-infected oranges they cleared from the trees to keep them healthy. They are working land that was acquired during the founding years of the Dutch occupation of the Cape from the 17th century and passed down 13 generations to Gerrit and his family. The racialised legacy of land ownership was entrenched by apartheid rule during South Africa's mining boom and remains the reality here. White people make up 7% of the population but own more than half the land. A new land expropriation act signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa allows for the government to seize land in the public interest. The bill is yet to be enacted but has drawn the ire of Mr Trump, who responded with an executive order calling the actions egregious and hateful towards \"racially disfavoured landowners\" and offered asylum to Afrikaners. It is reported 67,000 farmers have shown interest in US asylum but Gerrit says that is not an option for the citrus growers in his association. \"I don't think anybody is taking it seriously. You will always have a fringe in any society of 5 or 10% that will take it up and will carry that flag but most of the people I deal with love South Africa and would like to stay,\" he says. \"We do feel a bit isolated about the fear-mongering because we don't see it on a daily basis. We are not that security conscious on a daily basis.\" He adds: \"I'm not exposed to the guys up north and I think that some people are in really tough situations.\" Read more:South Africans with HIV left in turmoilTrump threatens to stop SA funding Up north, Wannie Scribante proudly shows us the security set-up protecting his small private farm. His cameras have AI technology that spots the movement of people, and he shares stills of his black labourers as they work the edges of the farm. He hasn't had a single intrusion or theft since he set up the cameras three years ago but still feels threatened by squatters and the risk of land expropriation. \"I'm concerned that this has been pushed by a government that is not honest with us. Why do they write in expropriation without compensation? Then they tell me we're not going to do that? It is silly to spend so much time on it and do a law if you're not going to do that,\" says Wannie. Though Wannie does not believe the debunked claims of a white genocide being repeated by Elon Musk, he still appreciates the cover coming from the Oval Office after feeling ignored by the South African government. \"They say why don't you talk to us? I mean we are trying to and they don't listen. We don't even get appointments. Now, suddenly someone else says it and it opens up the conversation of our problems that we have.\" I ask him if white South African farmers are being used to push an agenda. \"Most probably, yes. \"I think President Trump has things he is not happy about - the expropriation law, targeting, things like that - but I don't think that is his biggest problem. I think his biggest problem is our government's friendliness with their enemies. \"He is more worried about our ties to Hamas, Iran and China.\""

        "Content": " More than 50,000 people have now been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began, the territory's health ministry says. The Hamas-run authority does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but has previously said more than half of those killed in the conflict were women and children. On Sunday, Israeli strikes hit the surgery department at Nasser Hospital - the largest hospital in southern Gaza - killing five people. Palestinian medics and Hamas said one of the people killed was Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas's political bureau who was reportedly being treated at the hospital for wounds sustained in a previous attack. Israel's defence minister Israel Katz confirmed he was the target of the strike. Israel says Hamas systematically embeds in hospitals, schools and shelters, which the group denies. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said the hospital attack followed extensive intelligence and used precise munitions to minimise harm. Nasser Hospital had already been damaged by raids and strikes since the war began, with reports saying it has been overwhelmed by dead and wounded people. The strike on the hospital came after an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed top Hamas political leader Salah al Bardaweel. He was a member of the party's political bureau and Palestinian parliament and often gave media interviews. In a statement, Hamas said he was \"a beacon of political, media, and national activism\", and a \"symbol of honesty, steadfastness, and sacrifice\". However, the IDF called him a \"senior terrorist\", adding: \"This elimination further degrades Hamas' military and government capabilities.\" The strike, which took place on Khan Younis, also killed his wife - and several other Palestinians. At least 30 more Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah and Khan Younis on Sunday, Gaza health authorities said. The European Hospital and Kuwaiti Hospital said women and children were among those killed in the Khan Younis attack. Gaza's health ministry said 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. That includes 673 people killed since Israel's bombardment on Tuesday shattered the ceasefire.  Explosions through the night Explosions took place throughout the north, central, and southern Gaza Strip in the early hours of Sunday - with Israeli planes hitting several targets. On Sunday, the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate from part of Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. Ayda Abu Shaer, displaced from Rafah, was caught up in the shelling, and told the Associated Press: \"We died tonight. Tanks are shelling us, our tents and houses, and they are shooting at us. We never slept. In the morning, they told us to leave. They threw leaflets.\" \"All the way, they were shooting at us and dropping shells and rockets. We threw ourselves into the streets and fell, asking for mercy. Enough is enough. We are exhausted. Our sons and daughters are dead, and the children have been orphaned. \"We don't know what to do.\" 'No ambulances and no Red Cross' Hadeel Ghanim, also forced to leave Rafah, said: \"There is no ambulances and no Red Cross. People have been walking for hours, with them elderly people and children unable to move. \"We do not know where to go. We left without tents, without mattresses, without anything. We do not know where to go or what to do. For God's sake, save us.\"  The war began when Hamas militants carried out a cross-border raid into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing around 250 hostages. Israel responded by launching an air and ground offensive in Gaza. On Tuesday, Israel's military abandoned the ceasefire agreement that began on 19 January by resuming significant airstrikes on Gaza. Israel claims Hamas broke the ceasefire - something the group denies, in turn accusing Israel of violating the agreement that was initiated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. Speaking to Israel's ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely, Sky's Sophy Ridge on Thursday challenged the idea that Hamas broke the ceasefire, given the militant group released all the hostages that were agreed upon during the first phase. Mr Hotovely said: \"Hamas is not releasing hostages anymore. Israel has no other choice rather than putting pressure on a terror organisation.\" Read more from Sky News:Pope returns home to Vatican after hospital stayTurkish president's main rival jailed pending trial Hamas has spent weeks calling for serious talks on the ceasefire agreement's second phase, which calls for the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian political prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent ceasefire. But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying \"bridging\" proposals from US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Yet Mr Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday Hamas was responsible for renewed fighting after rejecting efforts to move forward with an \"acceptable deal\". \"This is on Hamas. The United States stands with the state of Israel,\" Mr Witkoff told Fox News. \"Hamas had every opportunity to demilitarise, to accept the bridging proposal.\" Talks were supposed to begin last month. It is unclear when - or if - they will now take place. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio about developments including efforts to release hostages and the resumption of fighting. Mr Rubio expressed the US's unwavering support for Israel and its policy, Mr Netanyahu's office said. 'Israel has no other choice' Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted the primary aim of the war is to destroy Hamas in its entirety. He has also said Israel's latest military assault hopes to force Hamas to give up the remaining hostages. It comes as the Israeli protesters took to the streets for a sixth day, angry at Mr Netanyahu's approach to getting the remaining hostages home, his attempt to remove the head of the Shin Bet domestic security service and now his cabinet's motion of no confidence in the attorney general. Mr Netanyahu's bid to sack Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar was a first in Israel's history, but was blocked by the country's top court pending an appeal. The attorney general has frequently clashed with the government over the legality of some of its policies and the agency had also been investigating corruption allegations linking Qatar with Netanyahu's office. Mr Netanyahu's cabinet approved a no-confidence motion against the attorney general on Sunday, in its latest move on officials deemed hostile to the government Protesters have argued that the right-wing government is undermining key state institutions. Families and supporters of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza have vented their anger at what many see as the government's abandonment of their loved ones."

        "Content": "\n          Communities correspondent\n              @LisaatSky\n  It was a remarkable appearance in so many ways - magical for the crowds outside the Gemelli hospital, and of course also for the Pope, who thrives on interaction with the faithful. Bear in mind this is an 88-year-old who has been fighting for his life and at one point during the last five weeks was in a critical condition with pneumonia in both lungs. Even the Pope's own doctors said his life was in danger, yet he's currently on a steady path to recovery and has now left hospital. But seeing the fragile pontiff on the balcony, while alert and giving the thumbs up, at one point he also looked uncomfortable and was struggling to breathe after just a few minutes before the crowd. As he was driven back to the Vatican in his white Fiat Papal car, he was dependent on the use of nasal cannulas to supply him with oxygen. This was the day it became clear the papacy will never be the same again. This is now a papacy which is less dynamic and more prophetic. The Pope's mind, we have consistently been told, is agile. During his stay in hospital, doctors said he \"had the mind of a 50-year-old\". So we can now expect a Pope who will lead spiritually but hardly in person - at least for the next two months. We can expect more balcony appearances from the Vatican in future. But his overseas visits will almost certainly be cancelled and his meetings limited. Pope Francis clearly still has a lot of recovering to do - but he has made it clear he wants this to continue from the Vatican as soon as possible."

Mr Witkoff - who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine and Russia - dismissed Sir Keir's plans as a \"combination of a posture and a pose\" in an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson.

        "Content": "The mayor of Istanbul and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main rival has been formally arrested and jailed pending trial over corruption charges. Ekrem Imamoglu was originally detained on Wednesday - sparking widespread protests across Turkey which have since intensified. Mr Imamoglu, a popular opposition figure with the Republican People's Party (CHP), was also detained over allegations of links to a terror organisation. In a statement, prosecutors said: \"The suspect Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested on charges of establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and rigging a tender.\" The Turkish government's interior ministry said it had formally removed Mr Imamoglu from the position of Istanbul mayor as a \"temporary measure\".  For a fourth night, demonstrators clashed with police as the 54-year-old faced further questioning. He denies any wrongdoing. Many view his detention as a political move to remove him from the 2028 presidential race - deepening concerns over Turkey's democracy and the rule of law. However, government officials reject accusations any legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist Turkey's courts operate independently. Police questioned Mr Imamoglu on Saturday as part of a terror investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. Around 90 other people were also questioned by prosecutors. Dozens are prominent figures and include two district mayors. Speaking after the court's decision, CHP leader Ozgur Ozel said: \"The only crime of Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been elected by 16 million Istanbulites three times, is to have defeated Recep Tayyip Erdogan and he has been arrested because he would win the next election.\" Ankara's mayor, Mansur Yavas - also from the CHP - criticised the lack of confidentiality surrounding Mr Imamoglu's proceedings, telling reporters: \"Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system. \"We learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been.\" Earlier on Saturday, Mr Erdogan said the government would not tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of links to corruption and extremist organisations. \"The days of going out into the streets, taking left-wing organisations, extremists, and vandals with you... are now behind us,\" he said. Saturday marked the fourth night of largely peaceful demonstrations. However, a group of protesters, trying to break through barricades to reach Istanbul's main square, threw flares, stones, and other objects at police who responded with pepper spray. Police used water cannons and tear gas on demonstrators in the capital, Ankara. Mr Imamoglu's arrest comes ahead of his expected nomination as the Republican People's Party's presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. The party's leader, Ozgur Ozel, said the primary, in which around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned. Mr Imamoglu was elected Istanbul's mayor in March 2019. This was a major blow to President Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party - which had controlled the city for 25 years. The president's party subsequently challenged the municipal election results, alleging irregularities in the result. A second election was called a few months later - which Mr Imamoglu also won. If convicted, Mr Imamoglu may be ruled out of the running race for the next election, and Turkey's government could appoint a trustee in his place. However, the CHP has said it would appeal against any rulings - and elect an acting mayor."

        "Content": "By Simone Baglivo, Europe producer in Rome  Pope Francis' discharge from the hospital where his life was twice in danger during a five-week stay marked an extraordinary day - even more than anyone expected. Early this morning, senior officials told Sky News the Pope refused a helicopter ride back to the Vatican. He preferred, instead, to travel in his white Fiat Papal car among the people. At least 3,000 people gathered outside the Gemelli hospital, which was placed under the highest security measures by police officers heavily deployed on the scene. At midday in Rome, the Pope finally appeared on a balcony. The faithful started clapping and chanting his name, while trying to jump on the fence behind our camera to get a better view. The pontiff's voice is still very ill - and due to his treatment and the low energy he has was supposed to offer maybe just a couple of words. Flowers left each day Instead, while on the terrace, he noticed among the huge crowd an elderly woman with a bouquet of yellow flowers. \"I see a woman with yellow flowers, brava,\" Francis said, before going back inside.  The woman is Carmela Mancuso, from Calabria in southern Italy, and she has been at the hospital every day since the pontiff arrived on 14 February. Each time, she left some flowers. Recently, she started leaving yellow flowers \"symbolising the light and recalling life\". Behind doors, an idea started to form in the Pope's head. He asked his security to collect the flowers from the woman. Unplanned stop Then, he immediately left the hospital, crossing a chaotic amount of people kept away from his car by dozens of police officers. Instead of going back to the Vatican as planned, he told his aides that he wanted to go to his favourite Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, on the opposite side of the city, to pray. He took with him the yellow flowers. So, the papal convoy was forced to do a quite extraordinary diversion on a busy Rome city centre road. When he reached the basilica, where he also said he would like to be buried (breaking a historic tradition of pope being buried at the Vatican), he gave the basilica's cardinal the yellow flowers and asked him to place them on the altar of the Virgin Salus Populi Romani. After that, the papal car finally started heading to his home in the Vatican - but not before another unplanned stop.

We managed to find her. \"I just told him welcome back home. He seemed very tired. I'll keep praying for him,\" Stefania told us. She and her dog Camilla live just in front of the Vatican. Entering his Vatican apartment on the second floor of Santa Marta, the Pope now knows he will face a two-month recovery, which will limit his activity. As he showed today, he's a Pope of surprises and spontaneity. This is why there are so many concerns about him adapting to a new papacy following medical advice."

        "Content": "\n          Sky News commentator\n              @adamboultonTABB\n Donald Trump has not been president for a hundred days - he will pass that marker at the end of April. Already the assessments are in: this is the most disruptive and transformative start ever to a presidential term. The United States government is being turned inside out by Elon Musk. The New York Times reports that Trump's \"expansive interpretation of presidential power\" is an attempt \"to consolidate power over courts, congress and more\". In other words, to defang the legislature and the judiciary, the two other, supposedly independent, branches of government established to act as checks and balances to presidential autarchy. On the international stage, the White House has, in practice, given the green light to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to up their assaults on Ukraine and Gaza, while cold shouldering NATO allies. These are big and controversial changes for which Trump claims a mandate after winning both the electoral college and the popular vote in last year's election.  His dramatic moves might be expected to stimulate as much passion among politicians as they are in the general public. \n                  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vows Donald Trump will not 'break us' as he calls snap election\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage would turn UK into a 'Trump tribute act', Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 63: Trump family, the constitution and president's karaoke contender\n                 Yet - perhaps because Trump is judged to be so powerful at this stage - his elected opponents at home and abroad are struggling to organise effectively against him. A two-party fight American politics is strictly a two-party fight. There are no significant third forces. Politicians are either Republican or Democrat. Outside election years when both parties have presidential nominees, there is no equivalent to a British leader of the opposition, fighting the president blow by blow. What opposition there is to an incumbent president is led from the US Congress.  Currently the Democrats are in an exceptionally weak position because they are in the minority in both the US Senate and the House of Representatives. They are routinely outvoted by the Republicans. This month, to the disgust of many Democrats, their party leadership in the Senate passed up on a rare chance to oppose the Trump administration. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and eight other Democratic senators sided with the Republicans to allow Trump's Budget Resolution to pass. Democrats, including Schumer, denounced the resolution because it contained massive cuts to government programmes such as housing, social security and healthcare. But Schumer justified his last-minute change of heart because the federal government would have shut down unless the bill passed. \"A shutdown would shut down all government agencies, and it would solely be up to Trump and DOGE (department of government efficiency) and Musk what to open again, because they could determine what was essential,\" he explained. \"So their goal of decimating the whole federal government, of cutting agency after agency after agency, would occur under a shutdown.\" Democrats in both Houses were furious. Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crocket said Schumer is \"absolutely wrong\". Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued that the Democrats had aided Trump and Musk's plan to destroy government so they can hand control over to their \"billionaire friends\". Jon Stewart, the star host of the Daily Show, said simply of Schumer \"you are a disgrace\". Read more:Trump signs order to dismantle US department of educationHow has Trump - the 'dealmaker' - done on foreign policy? TV comedians like Stewart and his former partners Stephen Colbert and John Oliver have become some of the most outspoken public critics of Trump. They viciously mock the Democratic establishment, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, for repeatedly insisting that the MAGA \"fever will break\". Meanwhile, Schumer protests that it will not be possible to do sensible deals in Congress until Trump's popularity rating drops to 40%. It could be a long wait. At the moment the president stands at around 48% approval while the Democrats are at a pitiful 27%. This is not a basis from which they can confidently expect to harvest in 2026, the backlash against the president's party which often occurs in mid-term elections. There is little coherence as senior Democrats mount their own freelance campaigns. Two prominent radicals from blue states, Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are outspoken about the violations of the Constitution which they believe the administration is perpetrating. Together they are embarking on a nationwide \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. They are joined in anger by the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who denounces \"villainous cruelty by a handful of idiots\". Sanders, 83, ran for the Democrat nomination in the past. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker have been talked about as possible future runners. Other Democrats worry that their values are too leftish and woke to win back the extra votes their party needs. This seems to be the view shared by other potential candidates for the 2028 nomination. Some are keeping a low profile. Pete Buttigieg has declined to run for the Senate and Kamala Harris says she will not announce any plans until the autumn. Two governors are emerging as early hopefuls: Gavin Newsom in California and Harris' former running mate, Tim Walz, in Minnesota. ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Newsom spotted Trump's dominance on social media and in the manosphere of podcasting. Newsom has adopted an \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" strategy and set up his own podcast series. His guest list is raising eyebrows for including Trump's outrider Steve Bannon and other prominent MAGA figures. When he finally got his invitation, centrist dad Walz wanted to know why Newsom is promoting \"bad guys\". So the Democrats in the US are arguing with each other and still looking for a way to take on Trump beyond hoping that his popularity will drop before he has terminally destroyed the democratic system.  Political leaders across the spectrum in Europe are privately aghast at what looks like the end of international politics as they have known it. But they do not want to provoke Trump's vindictive wrath by pointing out publicly that he is destroying America's role as the lynchpin of the Western alliance. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor in waiting, Friedrich Merz, have one key asset: Trump is overwhelmingly unpopular in their countries. This allows them to adopt a two-faced strategy - smilingly trying to salvage whatever they can from their existing links, while preparing to defend their countries with America as an unreliable ally and seemingly as an economic foe. No one has a plan to take on Trump directly. The best they have come up with is to hope he goes too far and destroys himself. In so many ways that is not a safe bet. Trump's first hundred days may yet be the least extraordinary of his term."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A new boxing format which promises to eliminate often-controversial human judging decisions is in talks to raise $50m from heavyweight investors amid a broader shake-up in the funding and marketing of combat sports. Sky News has learnt that STRIKR, which will use data-driven scoring by embedding sensors in combatants' mouthguards and deploying technology from partners including Hawk-Eye, is in detailed talks with a large number of prospective backers about its first major funding round. Sources said that scores of prospective investors were due to attend the first alpha test of STRIKR's technology in action at an event to be held at The Outernet, an entertainment venue in Central London, this week. People close to STRIKR's development said its proprietary technology could track the exact trajectory, speed and force of punches. This, they said, would open up huge betting market opportunities by enabling live in-play gambling, which they added would boost consumers' engagement with the sport. Among the architects of STRIKR are Greg Nugent, who oversaw the marketing of the London 2012 Olympic Games, and Michael Sutherland, former chief transformation officer at Real Madrid. Stephen Duval, founder of sports and entertainment corporate finance group 23Capital and creator of Superset Tennis and Superfighter, is also among STRIKR's co-founders. \n                  Politics latest: Chancellor Rachel Reeves tells Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips civil service can be cut by 10,000 people to 'deliver better public services'\n                 \n                  Civil service to axe 10,000 jobs, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says - as she eyes cutting Â£2bn in costs\n                 \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves 'rejects' analysis average family set to be Â£1,400 a year poorer by 2030\n                 Sources said the initial fundraising of about $50m would be followed by a larger capital-raising as the concept gained momentum. Oakwell Advisory, a sports-focused corporate finance firm, is advising STRIKR on its talks with investors. They added that STRIKR had the potential to \"revolutionise\" boxing in the same way that T20 had changed international cricket and that data-driven technology and smarter marketing had introduced Formula One motor racing to new audiences. STRIKR is understood to work by using artificial intelligence combined with technology from Hawk-Eye Innovations and Protecht to generate more than 3,000 points of data about each punch thrown by a boxer. By promising to eliminate the controversy which frequently accompanies the ringside verdicts of boxing judges, the new format is likely to claim that its advent will deliver a greater level of objectivity, integrity and transparency to one of the world's most popular sports. Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, Mr Duval said: \"STRIKR is a new format of boxing that uses world-class technology to generate real-time objective scoring. \"It will create a different approach to fighting, using a new format, enabled by new technology, to engage the existing audience and attract a new one, to the benefit of the market overall.\" Mr Duval declined to comment on the identity of the investors in discussions with STRIKR, although people close to the fundraising said it had already secured indicative commitments encompassing a sizeable chunk of the $50m target. The company also refused to be drawn on further details of commercial partnership discussions ahead of Monday's test event. STRIKR fights are expected to be free to watch, including on digital platforms such as YouTube, and will incorporate features such as personalised shopping and loyalty-based premium content. The arrival of STRIKR - which is expected to include its maiden competitive events in the UK and US next year - will come at a time when investor interest in combat sports has surged amid an influx of funding from sovereign funds and other prominent pools of capital. An official launch of the new format is said to be planned for May, with a series of exhibition events to showcase the technology later this year. TKO Group, which owns UFC and WWE, this month struck a deal with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to create a new international boxing league. The Saudi government has already sanctioned an enormous investment in the sport through the creation of the Riyadh Season to secure the hosting of some of boxing's most lucrative fights, including December's world heavyweight title rematch between Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury, which was won by the Ukrainian."

        "Content": " The chancellor has said she is \"confident\" 10,000 civil service jobs can be axed after numbers ballooned during the pandemic - as she seeks to cut more than Â£2bn from the budget. Rachel Reeves has told Sky News she is certain the government can deliver those cuts to \"back office jobs\" to free up resources for \"front line\" services. She is expected to unveil a raft of spending cuts during the spring statement on Wednesday - and has reportedly ruled out tax rises. The FDA union has said the government needs to be honest about the move, first reported by The Telegraph, and the \"impact it will have on public services\".  Reeves concedes cuts won't be pain-free Appearing on Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the chancellor was pushed repeatedly for a precise number of civil service jobs she wants to cut, and she eventually replied: \"I'm confident that we can reduce civil service numbers by 10,000. \"And during COVID, there were big increases in the number of people that were working in the civil service. \n                  Prove how many potholes you've fixed or lose cash, councils told\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves is coming out fighting as she prepares to unveil billions in cuts\n                 \n                  UK government borrowing and spending defies expectations, adding to tax rise or spending cut pressure\n                 \"That was the right thing to do to respond to those challenges. But it's not right that we just keep those numbers there forever.\" Ms Reeves said there are \"a number\" of civil service jobs that can be done by technology, while \"efficiencies\" can also be made by getting rid of quangos. Asked what roles she expects to no longer need, she said: \"It will be up for every department to set out those plans. \"But I would rather have people working on the front line in our schools and our hospitals and our police, rather than back office jobs.\" She said cuts will be made to things like travel budgets, spending on consultants, and also on communications. She conceded that the cuts will not be pain free, but says she would rather spend money to \"deliver better public services\". Civil service departments will first have to reduce administrative budgets by 10%, which is expected to save Â£1.5bn a year by 2028-29. The following year, the reduction should be 15%, the Cabinet Office will say - a saving of Â£2.2bn a year. The chancellor has also said she won't be putting up taxes on Wednesday, telling The Sun On Sunday: \"This is not a budget. We're not going to be doing tax raising.\" Ms Reeves added: \"We did have to put up some taxes on businesses and the wealthiest in the country in the budget [in the autumn]. \"We will not be doing that in the spring statement next week.\" The chancellor has repeatedly insisted she won't drop her fiscal rules which preclude borrowing to fund day-to-day spending. Civil service departments will receive instructions from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden in the coming week, The Telegraph reported. \"To deliver our Plan for Change we will reshape the state so it is fit for the future. We cannot stick to business as usual,\" a Cabinet Office source said. \"By cutting administrative costs we can target resources at frontline services - with more teachers in classrooms, extra hospital appointments and police back on the beat.\" The move comes after the government last week revealed welfare cuts it believes will save Â£5bn a year by the end of the decade. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ FDA general secretary Dave Penman said the union welcomed a move away from \"crude headcount targets\" but that the distinction between the back office and frontline is \"artificial\". \"Elected governments are free to decide the size of the civil service they want, but cuts of this scale and speed will inevitably have an impact on what the civil service will be able to deliver for ministers and the countryâ€¦ \"The budgets being cut will, for many departments, involve the majority of their staff and the Â£1.5bn savings mentioned equates to nearly 10% of the salary bill for the entire civil service.\" Ministers need to set out what areas of work they are prepared to stop as part of spending plans, he said. \"The idea that cuts of this scale can be delivered by cutting HR and comms teams is for the birds.

        "Content": " The chancellor says she \"rejects\" new analysis that suggests the average family could be Â£1,400 a year worse off by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme that living standards will \"increase during the course of this parliament\". She insisted there has already been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour came to power last year. The analysis, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), says frozen tax thresholds, rising mortgage and rent costs, and falling real earnings are all predicted to take their toll on living standards in Britain. For the poorest third, living standards are forecast to drop twice as much compared with middle and high earners. The charity believes the government will miss one of its stated \"milestones\" - to raise living standards across the UK before the next election. It says the Â£1,400 drop by April 2030 means a 3% fall in disposable income for the average family, while the lowest income households will be Â£900 per year worse off - a 6% fall.  The situation could be even bleaker for some, as the analysis doesn't account for the recently announced Â£5bn in cuts to disability benefits. Average earnings are also set to fall by Â£700 per year by 2030, according to the JRF. The charity - which conducts research into reducing poverty - says it came up with its prediction by modelling forecasts from the Bank of England and others. Chancellor 'confident we will see living standards increase' Asked by Trevor Phillips for her response to the findings, the chancellor said she \"rejects\" them. Ms Reeves argued living standards in the last parliament \"were the worst ever on record\", and said the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in October they are expected to increase, while wages are currently rising at twice the rate of inflation. \"I'm confident that we will see living standards increase during the course of this parliament,\" the chancellor insisted, adding there has been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour was elected. \"We've got to do more, absolutely, in terms of raising living standards. But this government has already got started in delivering our plan for change.\"  But the JRF says the government welfare cuts are \"wrong\" and counterproductive and wants the plan scrapped. It also urges a new \"minimum floor\" for Universal Credit to help address hardship, and believes the government should instead raise cash by increasing tax on wealth and investments. The analysis comes three days before the chancellor's spring statement in which more cuts are set to be announced in a bid to improve the country's finances. Some Â£2bn in cuts to the civil service are expected - but Ms Reeves says they will not affect front line services. She has also confirmed to The Sun On Sunday that she won't be announcing any new tax rises. Read more from Sky News:All the planned reforms to UK welfare systemCelebrities urge government to reverse 'shameful' cuts Her speech will be in response to the OBR, which on the same day will publish its own forecasts on the economy, the cost of living and government finances. Growth is Labour's top priority, but the Bank of England recently halved its growth outlook for the UK economy this year to 0.75%. There are also worries next month's hike to employer national insurance and the minimum wage will create further drag on investment."

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  Campaigners say a new 100% council tax premium on second homes in England will do little to ease the housing crisis, with one group describing it as a \"naked cash grab\". Exclusive Sky News data shows around 75% of councils in England will introduce the discretionary charge from April - essentially doubling the council tax on properties classed as second homes. England follows in the footsteps of Wales, which already charges a premium. Government data shows there are around 557,000 second homes in England. Hotspots such as Cornwall, Torbay, Norfolk and Somerset are introducing the tax - but there are many towns and inner-city areas such as Rochdale and Bristol, and London boroughs including Wandsworth, Camden and Hackney, also bringing it in. Sky News analysis shows the new charge, being introduced by more than 200 councils, could generate an extra Â£445m in revenue. Elliot Keck from the TaxPayers' Alliance says the premium is unfair. \"It's a very naked cash grab,\" he said. \"There's a simple principle of council tax that comes from when it was first introduced, which is that it's supposed to be linked to some extent on how much you use services.  \"If you have a second home in an area that you use for only a couple of months a year, you're actually using services much, much less than if that was someone's primary property. So, if anything, really you should actually be getting a discount on your council tax, not a premium.\" There are also concerns about potential loopholes. If a second home is put up for sale, provided by an employer, or undergoing major refurbishment, the owners may be exempt from paying the premium. Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, says the aim is to encourage councils to address the housing crisis in their areas - but admits it is not a silver bullet. \"No one is overstating the power of this - it is a nudge in the right direction,\" he said. \"It is one of a suite of tools that can be used. In and of itself it will not solve the housing crisis, but it is a step in the right direction if councils wish to use that to better manage their supply.\" 'Doubling tax isn't sufficient' Cornwall has long been the second home capital of England. Cath Hayes, from Redruth, co-founded First Not Second Homes - a campaign group against second homes in the county. \"In my opinion, doubling the council tax isn't sufficient,\" she said. \"I think it needs to be more than double - because it's not a deterrent, it is a tool among other things. If you can afford a house in Cornwall, you're doing well. If you can afford two houses - then it's not a deterrent.\" Jenna Jones, a local cafe chef who lives in a private rental in Trevone, North Cornwall, with her husband and five children, says they have had to move numerous times due to landlords selling up. \"It has been the most horrendous struggle of our life,\" she said. \"Before we found this letting here in Trevone I applied for over 23 properties in Cornwall.\" Stuck between a rock and a hard place The family pays nearly Â£2,000 a month in rent - but owning a property is out of reach. \"It has consumed our family life,\" Ms Jones says. \"And everybody else I work with locally - none of us are in a position where we can afford the going rents and nobody that I know that I work with can afford to buy. So we're really stuck between a rock and a hard place - and we really need a solution.\" And she does not believe the premium tax will help release housing stock. \"It's not going to make a difference. For many of the owners of second homes, a double council tax is maybe just like dropping a fiver out of their pocket.\" Read more from Sky News:'Migrant hub' plan will send alarm bells clangingBaby died because midwives failed to provide basic care In a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told Sky News it is \"determined\" to fix \"the housing crisis we have inherited\". Too many second homes in an area can drive up housing costs and \"damage public services\", it said. \"That is why local authorities will be able to apply a premium of up to 100% extra on the council tax bills of second homes to give local areas extra cash to address the impacts of second homes and protect their communities.\""

        "Content": " The chancellor has said she is \"confident\" 10,000 civil service jobs can be axed after numbers ballooned during the pandemic - as she seeks to cut more than Â£2bn from the budget. Rachel Reeves has told Sky News she is certain the government can deliver those cuts to \"back office jobs\" to free up resources for \"front line\" services. She is expected to unveil a raft of spending cuts during the spring statement on Wednesday - and has reportedly ruled out tax rises. The FDA union has said the government needs to be honest about the move, first reported by The Telegraph, and the \"impact it will have on public services\".  Reeves concedes cuts won't be pain-free Appearing on Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the chancellor was pushed repeatedly for a precise number of civil service jobs she wants to cut, and she eventually replied: \"I'm confident that we can reduce civil service numbers by 10,000. \"And during COVID, there were big increases in the number of people that were working in the civil service. \n                  Prove how many potholes you've fixed or lose cash, councils told\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves is coming out fighting as she prepares to unveil billions in cuts\n                 \n                  UK government borrowing and spending defies expectations, adding to tax rise or spending cut pressure\n                 \"That was the right thing to do to respond to those challenges. But it's not right that we just keep those numbers there forever.\" Ms Reeves said there are \"a number\" of civil service jobs that can be done by technology, while \"efficiencies\" can also be made by getting rid of quangos. Asked what roles she expects to no longer need, she said: \"It will be up for every department to set out those plans. \"But I would rather have people working on the front line in our schools and our hospitals and our police, rather than back office jobs.\" She said cuts will be made to things like travel budgets, spending on consultants, and also on communications. She conceded that the cuts will not be pain free, but says she would rather spend money to \"deliver better public services\". Civil service departments will first have to reduce administrative budgets by 10%, which is expected to save Â£1.5bn a year by 2028-29. The following year, the reduction should be 15%, the Cabinet Office will say - a saving of Â£2.2bn a year. The chancellor has also said she won't be putting up taxes on Wednesday, telling The Sun On Sunday: \"This is not a budget. We're not going to be doing tax raising.\" Ms Reeves added: \"We did have to put up some taxes on businesses and the wealthiest in the country in the budget [in the autumn]. \"We will not be doing that in the spring statement next week.\" The chancellor has repeatedly insisted she won't drop her fiscal rules which preclude borrowing to fund day-to-day spending. Civil service departments will receive instructions from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden in the coming week, The Telegraph reported. \"To deliver our Plan for Change we will reshape the state so it is fit for the future. We cannot stick to business as usual,\" a Cabinet Office source said. \"By cutting administrative costs we can target resources at frontline services - with more teachers in classrooms, extra hospital appointments and police back on the beat.\" The move comes after the government last week revealed welfare cuts it believes will save Â£5bn a year by the end of the decade. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ FDA general secretary Dave Penman said the union welcomed a move away from \"crude headcount targets\" but that the distinction between the back office and frontline is \"artificial\". \"Elected governments are free to decide the size of the civil service they want, but cuts of this scale and speed will inevitably have an impact on what the civil service will be able to deliver for ministers and the countryâ€¦ \"The budgets being cut will, for many departments, involve the majority of their staff and the Â£1.5bn savings mentioned equates to nearly 10% of the salary bill for the entire civil service.\" Ministers need to set out what areas of work they are prepared to stop as part of spending plans, he said. \"The idea that cuts of this scale can be delivered by cutting HR and comms teams is for the birds. This plan will require ministers to be honest with the public and their civil servants about the impact this will have on public services.\" Read more:Analysis: UK growth forecast set for major downgradeWhat could be announced in the spring statement?The spring statement - what you need to know Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, warned that \"a cheaper civil service is not the same as a better civil service\". \"Prospect has consistently warned government against adopting arbitrary targets for civil service headcount cuts which are more about saving money than about genuine civil service reform. \"The government say they will not fall into this trap again.

        "Content": "The government is telling local councils they must publish data on how many potholes they have fixed or risk losing their share of an extra Â£500m set aside for fixing roads.  From the middle of next month, local authorities across England will start to receive their allocation of the Â£1.6bn for fixing roads across the country. But in order to get the full amount, all councils must publish annual reports on how many potholes they've filled - or see a quarter of the additional Â£500m in funding the government has allocated this year withheld. By 30 June, all councils must publish reports detailing how much they are spending, how many potholes they have filled, what percentage of their roads are in what condition, and how they are minimising disruption. Meanwhile, the transport secretary is unveiling a funding package of Â£4.8bn for 2025-6 for National Highways to deliver critical road schemes and maintain motorways and major A-roads. This new money will mean \"pivotal\" road construction schemes can be pushed forward, the government said. This is a key part of Downing Street's drive to ensure the voting public sees and feels the difference the government is making in their local communities as they fight off a challenge from Reform UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The broken roads we inherited are not only risking lives but also cost working families, drivers and businesses hundreds - if not thousands of pounds - in avoidable vehicle repairs. \"British people are bored of seeing their politicians aimlessly pointing at potholes with no real plan to fix them. That ends with us. \"We've done our part by handing councils the cash and certainty they need - now it's up to them to get on with the job, put that money to use and prove they're delivering for their communities.\" Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: \"After years of neglect we're tackling the pothole plague, building vital roads and ensuring every penny is delivering results for the taxpayer.\" Responding to the announcement, the transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association said the cash will \"help start to address the previously ever-growing backlog of local road repairs\" which, he added, \"could take more than a decade to fix\". Councillor Adam Hug also called for the government to \"play its full part\" by using its Spending Review \"to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures\". The Conservatives have responded by claiming Labour \"want credit for handing councils a pothole sticking plaster\". Gareth Bacon, shadow transport secretary, continued: \"Labour are running on empty. They've got no plan for motorists, no grip on the problem, and no credibility. \"Voters shouldn't be fooled - Labour aren't fixing the roads, they're steering Britain into a ditch.\" Spending on roads and cuts in Whitehall The spending on roads across England comes as the chancellor is preparing to make billions of pounds of spending cuts at the spring statement on Wednesday. A turbulent economic climate since October means the Â£9.9bn gap in her fiscal headroom (the amount she could increase spending or cut taxes without breaking her fiscal rules) has been wiped out. The government has confirmed it will force the civil service to slash Â£2bn a year from its budget by cutting administration costs by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips she is \"confident\" they can cut 10,000 jobs from \"back office\" roles to ensure resources can be spent on front-line services.  A total of Â£5bn is expected to be saved by making it more difficult to qualify for Pip, and also abolishing the work capability assessment in 2028, which determines whether someone on universal credit is fit to work. Quangos are also on the chopping block, with the prime minister having already announced NHS England is being abolished to both bring the health service back under more direct ministerial control, and also save money. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Money is being redirected towards defence, with the chancellor expected to announce Â£400m in spending on the government's new UK Defence Investment body to \"harness UK ingenuity and boost military technology\", The Mirror reports. And the full details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence are expected, after the prime minister said UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.  Speaking to Trevor Phillips, the chancellor said \"the world has changed\" as she laid the groundwork for the spring statement. \"We'll respond to the change and continue to meet our fiscal rule,\" she said. \"But we're also shaping the new world, whether that's in the defence and security realm, or indeed on the economy. More from Sky News:Reeves 'rejects' analysis on living standardsWhat could be in the spring statement? The chancellor highlighted that \"interest rates have been cut three times since the general election\", adding: \"That's a far cry from the 11% inflation and the interest rate hikes that we saw under the previous government.\" But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the government has not \"gripped the economy\", accusing ministers of having talked it down and having a negative impact on growth."

        "Content": "Fraud experts are set to investigate suspicions thousands of students are fraudulently claiming hundreds of millions of pounds in student loans with no plans to study - or pay the money back. The Public Sector Fraud Authority has been directed by Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson to start work immediately to halt the \"growing threat\" and support investigations that are already under way. It follows a Sunday Times investigation which reports students with \"absolutely no academic intent\" are enrolling on degree courses in order to claim tens of thousands of pounds with no intention of repaying the money. For the 2025-26 academic year, students can apply for tuition fee and maintenance loans of up to Â£25,440. The money is only paid back once the student has left university and their income has reached a certain threshold, depending on the loan plan, starting at about Â£25,000 a year. The debt is written off if not paid within 40 years. Writing for the newspaper, Ms Phillipson said the allegations of potential fraud point to \"one of the biggest financial scandals universities have faced\". Most of the suspected incidents are believed to be at \"franchised\" universities - colleges paid to provide courses for established universities - and officials are concerned there is \"organised recruitment\" of Romanian nationals, the Sunday Times reported. The investigation into the system came after the Student Loans Company noticed suspicious applications involving fake documents, it said. 'Not enough care taken to join the dots' In her piece, Ms Phillipson said the \"revelations\" deal \"a hammer blow to the integrity of higher education\" in the UK and \"demand the firmest action\". The Student Loans Company has been working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the prevalence of some Romanian students at certain institutions, the education secretary said, \"but not enough care was taken to join the dots of wider abuse taking place across the system and to slam the door shut on widespread abuse\". Ms Phillipson said she will also bring forward new legislation \"at the first available opportunity\" to ensure the Office for Students \"has tough new powers to intervene quickly and robustly to protect public money\".  A Department for Education spokesperson said it would \"stop at nothing to protect public money\" and that any potential misuse of student loans \"is an insult to hard-working students striving for better opportunities\". It said the government's Plan for Change, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in December, \"will restore trust\" in the UK's universities. \"We have already taken clear action to crack down on rogue franchise operators to tackle fraud, and we'll go further,\" the spokesperson said. \"We will overhaul regulation so the Office for Students better protects taxpayers' money. In the meantime, we have asked the OfS to clamp down on franchising.\" Read more:Civil service to cut 10,000 jobsThe Plan for Change explained If misuse or fraud is uncovered, the government has \"powers to claw back payments - and we won't hesitate to use them\", the statement added. \"We will bring in tough new laws to ensure the OfS can quickly stop bad actors gaming the system once and for all.\" Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, said: \"The type of sharp practices alleged by this investigation are entirely unacceptable. They represent shocking misuse of public funding and take advantage of genuine students who are not getting the education they deserve.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n  In recent months, the chancellor has become a lightning rod for criticism.  She been accused of ushering in a new era of austerity and channelling George Osborne with governments cuts to welfare, winter fuel and international aid. She's been described as a new Liz Truss, with her focus on growth and tearing up regulation. She's been urged to hike taxes for the wealthy by left-wing Labour MPs. She's been under pressure to loosen her self-imposed fiscal rules - even Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, has called on her to allow more government borrowing. As for the Tories, they claim she's facing a crisis of her own making after trash-talking the economy and damaging business confidence by hiking national insurance on employers. But if the pressure is taking its toll on Rachel Reeves, it didn't show this morning.  She breezed into the Sky News Westminster studio for her interview on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips and positively beamed when he asked about the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) preparing to slash its growth forecasts, reportedly by as much as half, and the severity of the country's financial situation. She insisted the \"world has changed\" since her October budget and said the government is responding through greater investment in defence and security. The chancellor has clearly decided to come out fighting. She's wedded to her fiscal rules, she's sticking to her promise not to cut taxes, and determinedly standing by the decisions she took in the October budget. \"I promised at the general election to bring stability back to the economy - and as a result of that stability, interest rates have been cut three times since the general election,\" she said. \"That's only been possible because we put our public finances on a firm footing, and we've also put our public services on a firm footing.\" There was no real acknowledgement that cuts in interest rates have now stalled and economic growth is flatlining.  She brushed off the prospect of a more negative outlook by deferring again and again to the as-yet-unpublished OBR forecast. \"I know that we need to go further and faster in delivering economic growth and seeing public services improve - but there are no shortcuts here,\" she said. \"It's not possible within just a few months to reverse more than a decade of economic stagnation, but we are making the changes that are necessary to bring money into the economy.\" It's clearly part of the chancellor's job to talk up the economy they're responsible for. But the strategy here was to show no hint of weakness. The spring statement is already done and dusted as it had to be submitted to the OBR last week for its forecasts to be prepared and printed. So there's no way back now on the likely cuts to come. ðŸ‘‰ Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ We're expecting the chancellor to set out savings of around Â£10bn, including the Â£5bn of welfare savings announced last week. Today she confirmed the civil service will be forced to cut Â£2bn a year by slashing administration costs by the end of the decade - although the savings will be used to protect frontline services from cutbacks. She told me people who were describing the event as an emergency budget - which implies tax changes - are going to look \"very silly\" when they hear what she's got to say on Wednesday. That's a dig at shadow chancellor Mel Stride and the Tories, who've been doing their best to make the \"emergency budget\" moniker stick. Read more:Spring statement - what you need to knowBenefits system changes explained You'd think they might want to avoid reminding people of the last emergency budget, which was Jeremy Hunt's effort to clean up the shrapnel left behind by Liz Truss's mini budget implosion.

        "Content": " The chancellor says she \"rejects\" new analysis that suggests the average family could be Â£1,400 a year worse off by the end of the decade. Rachel Reeves told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme that living standards will \"increase during the course of this parliament\". She insisted there has already been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour came to power last year. The analysis, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), says frozen tax thresholds, rising mortgage and rent costs, and falling real earnings are all predicted to take their toll on living standards in Britain. For the poorest third, living standards are forecast to drop twice as much compared with middle and high earners. The charity believes the government will miss one of its stated \"milestones\" - to raise living standards across the UK before the next election. It says the Â£1,400 drop by April 2030 means a 3% fall in disposable income for the average family, while the lowest income households will be Â£900 per year worse off - a 6% fall.  The situation could be even bleaker for some, as the analysis doesn't account for the recently announced Â£5bn in cuts to disability benefits. Average earnings are also set to fall by Â£700 per year by 2030, according to the JRF. The charity - which conducts research into reducing poverty - says it came up with its prediction by modelling forecasts from the Bank of England and others. Chancellor 'confident we will see living standards increase' Asked by Trevor Phillips for her response to the findings, the chancellor said she \"rejects\" them. Ms Reeves argued living standards in the last parliament \"were the worst ever on record\", and said the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in October they are expected to increase, while wages are currently rising at twice the rate of inflation. \"I'm confident that we will see living standards increase during the course of this parliament,\" the chancellor insisted, adding there has been a \"sustained increase\" since Labour was elected. \"We've got to do more, absolutely, in terms of raising living standards. But this government has already got started in delivering our plan for change.\"  But the JRF says the government welfare cuts are \"wrong\" and counterproductive and wants the plan scrapped. It also urges a new \"minimum floor\" for Universal Credit to help address hardship, and believes the government should instead raise cash by increasing tax on wealth and investments. The analysis comes three days before the chancellor's spring statement in which more cuts are set to be announced in a bid to improve the country's finances. Some Â£2bn in cuts to the civil service are expected - but Ms Reeves says they will not affect front line services. She has also confirmed to The Sun On Sunday that she won't be announcing any new tax rises.

Growth is Labour's top priority, but the Bank of England recently halved its growth outlook for the UK economy this year to 0.75%. There are also worries next month's hike to employer national insurance and the minimum wage will create further drag on investment."

        "Content": "Sir Ed Davey has launched a furious attack on \"unpatriotic\" Nigel Farage for once saying he \"admires\" Vladimir Putin, claiming the Reform leader would \"turn our great country into little more than a Donald Trump tribute act\". In a speech at his party's spring conference, the Liberal Democrat leader accused Donald Trump of \"betraying Ukraine\" and \"selling outâ€¦ the security of Europe and the security of our United Kingdom\". He framed his party as the only one \"speaking up in defiance\" of the US president, and called on the government not to \"appease\" him. Politics Hub: Follow live updates The Lib Dem leader was speaking just weeks before the local elections on 1 May, when he is hoping to make further gains from the Conservative Party and stop Reform UK from making up any ground. 'Unforgivable' of Trump to 'betray Ukraine' In his lengthy speech to the party faithful, Sir Ed said this is \"a time of great peril for our continent, and for our country\". \"Because Donald Trump is not only betraying Ukraine,\" he said. \"It's not only their sovereignty he's selling out. It's our security. The security of Europe and the security of our United Kingdom. And that is unforgivable.\" He said Putin has \"fooled Donald Trump into thinking that his ambitions do not extend beyond parts of Ukraine\", and pointed to Russia's activities in countries such as Georgia, Moldova and Romania, accusing Russia of \"undermining their democracies and seeking to extend his grip further into Europe\". He expressed pride in the UK's response to Russia's invasion, and said he was \"proud that the prime minister brought Europe and Canada together here in Britain to chart a way forward, the day after those appalling scenes of Trump and Vance ambushing President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office\". Farage 'out of touch with British values' Sir Ed said one has to \"stand up\" to people like Mr Trump and Mr Putin, who are \"offend[ing] fundamental British values of decency, fair play, respect for national sovereignty and the rule of law\". But he said there is \"one lone holdout\" who \"simply doesn't seem to get it\" - and that is Nigel Farage, who \"thinks Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are great\" in a \"celebrity crush kind of way\". Referencing Mr Farage's comments from over a decade ago that Putin is the leader he most admires, Sir Ed said: \"How despicable. How completely out-of-touch with British values. With human values. How unpatriotic. How deeply un-British. \"And this from a man who thinks he can be our prime minister. Not on our watch.\" He went on to say that the Reform UK leader has \"nothing to say\" about the challenges facing the health service, noting that he has \"never uttered the word 'care' once in parliament\". He accused the insurgent right-wing party of peddling \"superficial, simplistic, snake-oil solutions\", and choosing to \"exploit\" the \"struggles and anxieties\" of the British people \"for their own selfish ends\". Badenoch has a 'sneering attitude' Sir Ed also hit out at the Conservative Party for \"chasing Reform's tail\". He pointed to Kemi Badenoch recently saying that a \"typical Liberal Democrat will be somebody who is good at fixing their church roof and people in the community like them\". \"I think she meant it as an insult. But I'll happily wear it as a badge of honour,\" he said. \"Because she's right. Liberal Democrats fix things.\" He went on to say that she has \"good reason\" not to like his party, noting that they took 60 seats off the Tories at the general election. \"But what I'm talking about is the sneering attitude of the leader of the Conservatives, the sneering attitude that says fixing church roofs is somehow beneath her. Even beneath politics altogether. \"That what happens in our communities is trivial and insignificant compared to debating the true meaning of conservatism on Twitter.\" Sir Ed added that the Tories have \"abandoned our communities\" and public services, which is \"why so many lifelong Conservative voters have turned to the Liberal Democrats\". 'Impose tariffs on Musk's Tesla cars' The Lib Dem leader also had a few notes for the Labour government, calling on ministers to impose import tariffs on Tesla cars in retaliation for any tariffs imposed on the UK by the Trump administration, in which Tesla boss Elon Musk is a key player. Sir Ed criticised the government for not ruling out changing or scrapping the tax on tech giants' UK profits in order to avoid tariffs, saying: \"Appeasement never works with bullies, and it doesn't work with Trump - as his tariffs on British steel already show.\" He also called on the government to go further in its efforts to support Ukraine, arguing that frozen Russian assets should be given in funding, and saying he wants to join a new European Rearmament Bank. On economic growth, Sir Ed called for \"a new deal with the EU, with a Customs Union at its heart - putting us on a path back to the single market\".  'This is a battle for the future' In closing, Sir Ed said his party's \"liberal belief in internationalism [...] offers the solution\" to the problems facing the UK, \"with Trump in the White House and Farage leading a Trump tribute act\". \"Our trademark community politics is the only way to defeat their cynical populism. The threat they pose is grave. The challenge before us is great. \"This is a battle of competing values. A battle of competing visions. A battle for the future. We didn't choose this fight. But friends, I know you are up for it. I know together we can win it.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       Bonnets at the ready, with 2025 marking two and a half centuries since Jane Austen's birth, does \"bad lad\" Mr Darcy still do it for Gen Z? From erotic audio books to one-woman comedy shows, an Austen invasion is under way this year with various reinterpretations of her work being offered up from those savvy enough to spot a marketing opportunity. Many promise their own modern twists on classics like Pride & Prejudice but does Austen's work really need updating to appeal to modern tastes? Nichi Hodgson - whose book The Curious History Of Dating: From Jane Austen To Tinder compares Regency romance to now - understands how the \"rituals of the era\" can sometimes be \"a stumbling block for people that want to read the stories\". \"But if you do read the books it really is about the emotions and characters,\" she insists. \"Mr Darcyâ€¦ at the beginning, he's kind of a bad lad. The key tenants of the connectionâ€¦ wanting to kiss all night, you know, that's still appealing to people.\" Of course, what you won't find in Austen's classics are any explicit sex scenes. \n                  Jack Fincham: Love Island star wins appeal against prison sentence for dangerous dog offences\n                 \n                  Snow White: Little people feel 'erased' by Disney's use of CGI instead of real actors\n                 \n                  Celebrities urge government to reverse 'shameful' welfare cuts\n                 As Hodgson explains: \"People didn't really have sex before marriage, it was completely frowned upon. \"Skip forward to the Victorian era and actually one-in-three working class brides were already pregnant on their wedding dayâ€¦ but in Jane Austen's era, it wasn't the done thing.\" But for modern readers who prefer taking a story that's a little spicier to bed, audio erotica platform Bloom Stories has just released its version of Pride & Prejudice. Listeners get to hear 14 hours of their steamy reimagining of Austen's iconic love story. Hannah Albertshauser, Bloom Stories' chief executive, admits they \"created it because people have been daydreaming about Mr Darcy for generations\". \"Sexual desire undoubtedly existed in Austen's time, but it was rarely expressed openly in literature. \"With this adaptation, we wanted to celebrate sexual empowerment by giving voice to the desires that were once left unsaid and of course, highlight female agency and pleasure.\" The fact that people are still reimagining Austen's work today is arguably testament to her solid plotsâ€¦ but is it patronising to assume younger readers would only pick up Pride & Prejudice with a sexier rewrite? Australian playwright Matthew Semple says the original is \"absolutely a story for and of and by young people\". \"Jane Austen wasn't much older than many Gen Z's today when she wrote it.\" Transferring to London from a sellout run in Australia, his show Plied And Prejudice plays the classic novel for laughs. Five actors scramble to play twenty characters in a chaotic retelling of Elizabeth Bennet and Mister Darcy's love story. \"After we opened it in Brisbaneâ€¦we had to add about a month's worth of shows because it just popped off,\" he says. And while there's plenty for his audiences to find funny, \"a lot of the cultural aspects\", he insists, are still as relevant today when it comes to \"the way we view gender politics\". Read more from Sky News: Celebrities urge government to reverse 'shameful' welfare cuts'I was a totally crap pop star': KT Tunstall's musical reinvention Young stand-up comedian Rosalie Minnitt agrees: \"We're still all wrestling with this idea of love that came from that period of history.\" Minnitt is currently on tour with her Austen-inspired one-woman show after her character Lady Clementine proved to be one of the stand-out hits at the Edinburgh Fringe. \"We're in quite an interesting space with genders, men and women not really understanding each other, people struggling with dating, and it feels as though the show has taken on a really interesting new energy,\" she admits. While the world of dating has changed wildly from Austen's times, Minnit - whose show is all about her character's hunt for \"the one\" - believes plus Ã§a change. \"So much of her work was about poking fun at the world she lived inâ€¦ being let down by men, being pressured by your mum, these are all things that I think that modern women are still dealing with.\" Plied And Prejudice runs at The Vaults, Waterloo until 27 April. Rosalie Minnitt: Clementine is touring the UK including at London's Soho Theatre on 9 and 10 May. Nichi Hodgson's book The Curious History Of Dating: From Jane Austen To Tinder is available to order online."
