        "Content": " Several boats from a large aid flotilla trying to reach Gaza have been boarded by Israeli authorities - with campaigner Greta Thunberg among those removed. The Global Sumud Flotilla is made up of more than 40 civilian boats with an estimated 500 people onboard, and is trying to break Israel's sea blockade. But the attempt appears to have been thwarted - at least for now - by about 20 Israeli ships. Israel's foreign ministry said \"several vessels\" had been \"safely stopped\", with passengers being taken to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" a spokesperson added. A video showed Thunberg sitting on deck while being handed a water bottle and raincoat. It's so far unclear how many boats have been intercepted. \n                  Trump's declared war on drug cartels.

Greg Stoker, a US veteran who's involved, said water cannon had been used on some of the boats.  The flotilla, which set off from Barcelona and was scheduled to arrive this morning, had been flanked by NATO warships for part of the journey. The attempt has received a lot of attention, with Nelson Mandela's grandson, a former Barcelona mayor and several European legislators taking part. Israel said the mission was violating a lawful blockade and is only intended to provoke. The country also claimed it had offered a way to deliver any aid peacefully through safe channels. Organisers said the night-time interception was the second time the flotilla had been approached on Wednesday, after \"warships\" earlier encircled two of its boats. Last week, drones also reportedly dropped stun grenades and itching powder on some vessels. Israel didn't comment, but has said it will use any means to stop the boats getting to Gaza. Protests have broken out in Italy and Turkey over the treatment of the flotilla. Italy's largest union has called a general strike tomorrow, saying the \"attack on civilian vessels carrying Italian citizens represents an extremely serious matter\". Turkey's foreign ministry called Israel's interception an \"attack\" and \"an act of terror\" that endangered lives of those on board. Gaza has been dealing with severe food shortages due to the ongoing war. Agencies such as the UN accused Israel of deliberately slowing the delivery of supplies - something it denies. However, the aid being carried by the flotilla is said to only be a symbolic amount of food and medicine. An aid boat carrying Thunberg was also intercepted near Gaza in June, with the Swede deported alongside others. Israel put in it sea blockade when Hamas took control of the territory in 2007 and there have been several attempts to break it since then. Some of those involved in the latest campaign have said they will start a hunger strike if they're detained.

Hamas said it would study the plan and consult with other factions, but didn't give an indication of when it would deliver its verdict. Mr Trump said on Tuesday he would give the group \"three or four days\" to respond."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  A company linked to Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone breached a government contract of nearly £122m to supply surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the High Court has ruled. The £121.9m sum, the price of the gowns, must now be repaid by the company, PPE Medpro. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) brought the case, saying it provided 25 million \"faulty\", non-sterile gowns. Money latest: Citroen C3 drivers told to stop using cars immediately On Wednesday, the High Court ruled the gowns did not comply with the requirement of having a validated process to demonstrate sterility, and it was not possible for the DHSC to have sold them and recoup the loss. The company, a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, businessman Doug Barrowman, was awarded the government contract after she recommended it to ministers. As well as wanting to recover the costs of the deal, the government wanted to recoup the costs of transporting and storing the items, which it said amounted to an additional £8.6m, though the High Court denied the latter request, saying the loss was not proved at trial. PPE Medpro's counterclaim that the DHSC should have advised it on how to comply with the contract also failed. 'VIP lane' Both Baroness Mone and Mr Barrowman denied wrongdoing, and neither gave evidence at the trial in June. She had initially denied involvement in the company or the process through which it was handed the government contract. However, it was later revealed that Baroness Mone was the \"source of referral\" for the firm getting a place on the so-called \"VIP lane\" for offers of personal protective equipment for the NHS. Yesterday, Baroness Mone, a businesswoman who was made a life peer in 2015 following her work as an \"entrepreneurship tsar\" during David Cameron's premiership, accused the government of making her and her husband a \"poster couple for the PPE scandal\", in a lengthy online tirade. The response In response to the ruling, Baroness Mone said it was \"shocking but all too predictable\". Mr Barrowman said it was \"a travesty of justice\" and the judge gave the DHSC \"an establishment win despite the mountain of evidence in court against such a judgment\". \"Her judgment bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month-long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile,\" he said. \"This judgment is a whitewash of the facts and shows that justice was being seen to be done, where the outcome was always certain for the DHSC and the government. This case was simply too big for the government to lose.\" Ahead of the ruling on Tuesday, PPE Medpro said it intended to appoint an administrator. A spokesman for Mr Barrowman has told Sky News, \"the DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators [over the £121.9m sum that is owed], but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage\". The news has been welcomed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. \"We want our money back. We are getting our money back. And it will go where it belongs - in our schools, NHS and communities,\" Ms Reeves said. \"Profiting and corruption during the pandemic cost lives,\" the families group said. \"Those responsible must be held to account.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  On its face, the Department of Health and Social Care v PPE Medpro Limited was not a case about Michelle Mone, or VIP fast lanes, or the politics and profiteering of the pandemic years. Rather, as the DHSC's barrister made clear on the first morning of the first day of hearings, it was about 25 million surgical gowns sold to the NHS for £122m. Were they, or were they not, appropriately certified as sterile, and thus fit for use? The answer, unequivocally according to Lady Justice Cockerill's judgment, was no, leaving PPE Medpro in breach of contract, and liable to repay just short of £122m. This case was always going to be about more than dusty contract law however. By targeting the company founded and controlled by Doug Barrowman, the husband of Baroness Mone, the DHSC was taking on the couple who encapsulated the COVID PPE scandal.  Her public profile as the media-friendly lingerie entrepreneur ennobled by David Cameron, blithely sharing snaps from the Lady M yacht while the country endured lockdown, and her husband's repeated hollow denials, made them the faces of that failure. PPE Medpro won more than £200m of contracts only after Baroness Mone used her political contacts, including Michael Gove, to introduce the firm to the government's VIP 'fast lane' and short-circuit normal procurement rules. She did so on the same day in May 2020 that her husband Doug Barrowman incorporated the company, and then lobbied hard over the next six months to see the deal completed. The judge described her as PPE Medpro's \"big gun\", deployed when civil servants were perceived to be holding up the deal. When challenged the pair then lied for more than two years about their links to the company, only admitting their role after dogged reporting by The Guardian revealed not just her role in lobbying on its behalf, but the extraction of more than £65m in profit. When challenged in a BBC interview and a self-funded documentary, Mone said that while she regretted not admitting her role, lying to journalists was not a crime. The couple's response to the ruling was in keeping with their approach throughout. The day before the judgment PPE Medpro filed to enter administration, with accounts showing assets of just £666,000, ensuring that any discussion about repayment will be with the administrator, not Mr Barrowman. Read more from Sky News:Starmer says he will take 'no more lectures' from FarageEnergy price cap warning as latest rise takes effect Baroness Mone meanwhile took to social media to claim the couple had been \"scapegoated and vilified\" for wider failings, and shared correspondence in which they offered to settle the case for £23m. After the judgment was delivered the baroness called it \"an Establishment win\", while Mr Barrowman, whose company offered no factual evidence in court and was not called as a witness, called it a \"travesty of justice\".  Labour ministers, led by the chancellor, praised the court's independence even as they celebrated a judgment which, if nothing else, may remind voters of the chaos of the Boris Johnson years. Getting the money back, the central point of the legal exercise, will be harder than stirring bad memories. The DHSC has appointed lawyers to try and help it \"recover every penny\" but it is unclear how that can be achieved given Medpro's administration. It could choose to pursue Mr Barrowman, who boasted of huge wealth earned in fintech and lived a lifestyle to match, but it is unclear how, and whether he still has the means. The National Crime Agency has frozen £75m of the couple's assets as part of its ongoing investigation, and the couple are reported to have sold homes and other assets in recent years. Asked if they might repay the profits earned, or at least the £23m offered in settlement, Mr Barrowan's spokesman told Sky News: \"The DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators, but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage.\""

A post on her institute's Instagram page said she died peacefully in her sleep on Wednesday morning while in Los Angeles for a speaking tour. \"Dr Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionised science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" said the post. Naturalist Chris Packham told Sky News that Dame Jane was a \"remarkable woman\" and in many ways \"she died on the job\" after spending much of her life campaigning on conservation issues. Greenpeace remembered her as \"one of the true conservation giants of our time\" who inspired \"millions\". The United Nations said she left an \"extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature\". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex described her as \"a visionary humanitarian, scientist, friend to the planet, and friend to us\". \n                  Mother pleads Scotland to deport 'brainwashed' daughter living with 'cult' back to Texas\n                 \n                  'A disaster for living standards': We now have just £1 more of disposable income than in 2019\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 They said: \"Her commitment to changing lives extends beyond what the world saw, and also to what we personally felt. She held our son, Archie, when he was first born, and showered love and care to those who were privileged to know her. She will be deeply missed.\" Others paying tribute on social media include former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Melinda Gates and Michael Bloomberg. Dame Jane began her research at 26, observing chimpanzees in east Africa and revealing their capability to engage in complex social behaviours. She gave chimps names instead of numbers, observed their distinct personalities and their use of tools - previously thought to be exclusive to humans. The London-born expert appeared in numerous National Geographic programmes, wrote more than 30 books, and also appeared in The Simpsons. Her work laid a path for other female primatologists and conservationists, including Dian Fossey (portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the Hollywood movie Gorillas In The Mist). Later in her career, Dame Jane shifted more towards climate advocacy after seeing habitats diminishing and spoke to Sky News about the issue in June. \"[Chimpanzees] are our closing living relatives - we share 98.7% of our DNA with them - but wildlife across Africa is disappearing,\" she said.  She was made a dame in 2003 and earlier this year was awarded the prestigious US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Moving to Bournemouth as a child, she described how she always dreamed of working with wild animals - a passion stoked by the gift of a toy gorilla and reading books such as Tarzan and Dr Dolittle. Dame Jane got her wish in 1957 when she saved enough money for a boat trip to Kenya. It was there that she met famed anthropologist and palaeontologist Dr Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey, an encounter that set up her long career. Dame Jane established the Gombe Stream chimpanzee reserve in present-day Tanzania, discovering that chimps also ate meat, fought fierce wars, and - perhaps most importantly - made tools. \"She sat on the forest floor in Tanzania as part of that group of chimpanzees,\" Chris Packham told Sky News. \"She knew them all as individuals. She knew their personalities. She watched them grow and mature and watch those personalities change. She was able to record things which had probably been glimpsed before but certainly never documented in the way that she was able to do so.\" Greenpeace's co-executive director in the UK, Will McCallum, said: \"She was one of the true conservation giants of our time. \"We were lucky enough to host her at the Greenpeace Glastonbury field last year, where she charmed the audience with her vast knowledge of our primate cousins' lives. \"Not only did her pioneering research transform our understanding of chimpanzees and their habitat, but she became a tireless advocate for the protection of wildlife and forests, inspiring millions to act.\" Dame Jane lived in the jungle for years, marrying wildlife cameraman and collaborator Hugo van Lawick. However, she realised she needed to take up a vocal role as a conservationist in order to protect the primates. Her institute launched in 1977 and she ended up travelling extensively to press her cause. She was still doing those world tours up until her death. She was also one of the few people to earn a PhD without having an undergraduate degree, earning the doctorate from Cambridge in 1966. \"It never ceases to amaze me that there's this person who travels around and does all these things,\" she told the New York Times during a 2014 trip to Burundi and back to Gombe. \"And it's me. It doesn't seem like me at all.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n As we sat down to begin our annual conference interview shortly after the prime minister had delivered his speech to party members, I asked Sir Keir Starmer how he was feeling? \"Good,\" he said, \"it was a speech I needed to give\". He was right to feel buoyed. After 15 months of being battered about in government, with ever-worsening polls, open challenges to his leadership and endless private grumbling from within his own government, the PM answered his critics in a speech that showed both his emotion and intent as he pitted his vision of Britain against that of Nigel Farage. It was a dividing line that united his party behind him as he set up the battle at the next election between Labour and Reform, between, in his words, \"decency or division, renewal or decline\".   He also marched directly into societal wars with a rallying cry that was met with rapturous applause in the hall as he savaged racists who graffitied a Chinese takeaway and criticised people seeking to sow \"fear and discord across our country\". This was a PM that found his voice and identified his enemy in Farage as he sharpened his attacks and asked the public to pick a side.  In our interview, he continued the argument, describing Farage's plan to deport people who currently have indefinite leave to remain in the UK as \"racist\". \"I think that's a very dangerous place for us to go as a country, and it goes against everything that I believe in,\" he told me. But Starmer was keen to play the ball, not the man, as he told me he didn't think Farage was a racist and stressed that he didn't think Reform voters were racist either. \"They're concerned about things like our borders,\" he said. \"They're frustrated about the pace of change. So I'm not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.\" His careful delineation reflects some nervousness at the top of his party that his attacks on Farage's racist immigration policy is risky if those millions of Britons thinking of voting for Reform feel they are being judged as racist themselves. Read more:Starmer 'responsible' if anything happens to Farage, Reform sayPM's speech a successful moment - but it ignored a big issue  One cabinet minister, acknowledging the risk, said they thought it was \"net positive\" because it gives the party a purpose and an argument to take the fight to Reform, not around competence - Labour have hardly proved themselves on that front yet - but around values. But this is where the prime minister also got a bit stuck in our sit-down. 👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 Happily calling out Farage's plan to deport people with indefinite leave to remain if they hit stringent income and language requirements, as a racist policy, he wouldn't tackle Donald Trump over his overtly racist attack on Sir Sadiq Khan when he suggested the London mayor, who is a Muslim, was driving London to Sharia law. He called it nonsense, but when pressed about whether it was racist - which Khan has explicitly said it is - the prime minister told me he was \"not going to start down the road of discussing whether things said by others are racist or not\" - having moments earlier overtly criticised Farage for having a \"racist policy\". When I pointed this out to him, he didn't really have anywhere left to go in what was an awkward exchange. That he wouldn't call out Trump speaks to the bigger challenge he faces than taking on Farage - delivering the \"renewal\" he says Britain so badly needs. What Starmer did powerfully in one of the strongest speeches I've ever seen him deliver was offer clear analysis of the journey that brought Britain to the place it is now, and the alternative directions the country could go next. But what is far, far harder than the diagnosis is the treatment. He won't call out Trump because he needs the US president to go easy on tariffs, to work with Europe on Ukraine, to support the recently announced tech partnership, which Number 10 said could deliver £150bn of investment into the UK economy in the coming decade. He might feel unable to criticise Trump, but the PM is borrowing the battle lines from the US, mirroring here what Joe Biden tried to do in the US ahead of the 2022 mid-term elections. The then US president delivered a speech called the \"battle for the soul of the nation\" as he cast Trump and his allies as a threat to the country and to democracy, and the Democrats as the defenders of America's core values. Of course, it turned out that President Biden wasn't the man to take on Trump, and paved the way to his victory by leaving it too late for another leader to take up the fight. Starmer's team feels more confident after this week that the PM has seen off similar fears around him - for the time being at least. But the fundamentals are still so difficult, with a challenging budget ahead and then a crucial set of elections in England, Scotland and Wales next May which could prove - to quote one Starmer detractor - \"a massive moment of change\". For now, a PM and a party pointing towards a common enemy, but Starmer's battle is only just beginning. And, as for the journey, it's a very, very long road ahead."

        "Content": " Reform UK has accused Sir Keir Starmer of \"inciting violence\" against Nigel Farage in his speech to the Labour Party conference on Tuesday, and said the prime minister will be \"responsible\" if anything happens to him. Speaking to Sky News Breakfast, the party's policy chief said the prime minister \"knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box\", so has instead tried to \"demonise him\". Sir Keir has denied the accusation that he risked inciting violence or inflaming tensions with his speech. Tap here for the latest political news The accusation comes after Sir Keir warned that the next four years will be \"a fight for the soul of our country\" against Reform UK in his keynote speech setting out his vision of \"national renewal\" for Britain. Zia Yusuf, Reform UK's head of policy, told presenter Wilfred Frost that over the last two days, the prime minister has \"embarked on a campaign with his cabinet to incite violence\" against Mr Farage. Pulling out specific quotes from Sir Keir's hour-long speech to his party conference, Yusuf said: \"The prime minister knows exactly what he's doing. He knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box. We've seen the most extraordinary campaign over 48 hours to demonise Nigel, and he is absolutely inciting violence against him.\" \n                  Starmer is right to be buoyed after conference - but he has a very long road ahead\n                 \n                  Public 'sick of us going about Nigel Farage all the time', says Labour deputy leadership frontrunner\n                 \n                  Farage isn't racist, says PM - as he's challenged over Trump's 'Sharia law' comment\n                 He went on to say that there are \"millions of people in this country who, if anything was to happen to Nigel Farage, will hold the prime minister squarely responsible for his actions\".  Sir Keir was asked about the claim of inciting violence, and if he risked inflaming tensions with his speech in an interview with GB News, and he replied: \"No, not at all.\" More broadly, senior cabinet minister Pat McFadden told Frost earlier: \"I think a lot of Reform's protesting about this is because what they don't want to talk about is the policy they announced last week.\" That was in reference to Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain, which could see legal immigrants to Britain deported because they do not meet new requirements the party proposes to bring in. Mr McFadden described the policy proposal as \"deeply un-British\" and \"a mistake\" from the party.  PM calls on party to 'fight Reform' In his interview with Sky News, Mr Yusuf highlighted a number of sections of Sir Keir's conference speech on Tuesday. Sir Keir called for his party to \"fight Reform with everything that this movement has\", and said that he himself will \"fight with every breath I have, fight for working people, fight for the tolerant, decent, respectful Britain that I know\". The prime minister also said the country must \"go into that battle armed, not just with words and condemnation, but with action\". And on Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain and deport \"people who've lived here for generations\", Sir Keir said: \"If you say they should now be deported, then mark my words - we will fight you with everything we have because you are the enemy of national renewal.\" Read more:Indefinite leave to remain: What is it and what do Reform and Labour say about it?

Mr Farage told the BBC in September last year that he was given a close protection detail by the state following the summer riots, which he said was \"when so many commentators tried to put the blame on me\".

The prime minister will reveal the plan for asylum policy changes at the European Political Community (EPC) summit in Copenhagen on Thursday, where he will co-chair a meeting of leaders looking at different approaches to tackling illegal migration. Sir Keir will tell the EPC, a forum of 44 countries formed after Russia invaded Ukraine, that refugees will not have the automatic right to family reunion. On 1 September, the government suspended the family reunion route as ministers figured out a new asylum policy, which will be unveiled later this autumn.  The route allowed people granted asylum to sponsor their immediate family to join them as a way of reuniting families separated by conflict and persecution. They did not need to meet the income or English language requirements typically required for other UK family visa routes.  Sir Keir is set to announce a new partnership with Denmark, backed by up to £3m, to tackle the causes of migration in Western Balkan countries, including by encouraging people to stay in the region and take up jobs there. He will discuss the changes with the other leaders and talk about other ways European countries can work together to tackle illegal migration. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, earlier this week, told the Labour conference gaining indefinite leave to remain (ILR) - which gives people the right to settle, work and study in the UK - will take longer than the current five years to gain.

That is the tolerant and fair approach to migration that our communities are built on, but the current system is not fit for purpose. \"That is why we're making fundamental changes to what those granted asylum are afforded in the UK. Settlement must be earned by contributing to our country, not by paying a people smuggler to cross the channel in a boat. \"The UK will continue to play its role in welcoming genuine refugees fleeing persecution.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n  A company linked to Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone breached a government contract of nearly £122m to supply surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the High Court has ruled. The £121.9m sum, the price of the gowns, must now be repaid by the company, PPE Medpro. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) brought the case, saying it provided 25 million \"faulty\", non-sterile gowns. Money latest: Citroen C3 drivers told to stop using cars immediately On Wednesday, the High Court ruled the gowns did not comply with the requirement of having a validated process to demonstrate sterility, and it was not possible for the DHSC to have sold them and recoup the loss. The company, a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, businessman Doug Barrowman, was awarded the government contract after she recommended it to ministers. As well as wanting to recover the costs of the deal, the government wanted to recoup the costs of transporting and storing the items, which it said amounted to an additional £8.6m, though the High Court denied the latter request, saying the loss was not proved at trial. PPE Medpro's counterclaim that the DHSC should have advised it on how to comply with the contract also failed. 'VIP lane' Both Baroness Mone and Mr Barrowman denied wrongdoing, and neither gave evidence at the trial in June. She had initially denied involvement in the company or the process through which it was handed the government contract. However, it was later revealed that Baroness Mone was the \"source of referral\" for the firm getting a place on the so-called \"VIP lane\" for offers of personal protective equipment for the NHS. Yesterday, Baroness Mone, a businesswoman who was made a life peer in 2015 following her work as an \"entrepreneurship tsar\" during David Cameron's premiership, accused the government of making her and her husband a \"poster couple for the PPE scandal\", in a lengthy online tirade. The response In response to the ruling, Baroness Mone said it was \"shocking but all too predictable\". Mr Barrowman said it was \"a travesty of justice\" and the judge gave the DHSC \"an establishment win despite the mountain of evidence in court against such a judgment\". \"Her judgment bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month-long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile,\" he said. \"This judgment is a whitewash of the facts and shows that justice was being seen to be done, where the outcome was always certain for the DHSC and the government. This case was simply too big for the government to lose.\" Ahead of the ruling on Tuesday, PPE Medpro said it intended to appoint an administrator. A spokesman for Mr Barrowman has told Sky News, \"the DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators [over the £121.9m sum that is owed], but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage\". The news has been welcomed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. \"We want our money back. We are getting our money back. And it will go where it belongs - in our schools, NHS and communities,\" Ms Reeves said. \"Profiting and corruption during the pandemic cost lives,\" the families group said. \"Those responsible must be held to account.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  On its face, the Department of Health and Social Care v PPE Medpro Limited was not a case about Michelle Mone, or VIP fast lanes, or the politics and profiteering of the pandemic years. Rather, as the DHSC's barrister made clear on the first morning of the first day of hearings, it was about 25 million surgical gowns sold to the NHS for £122m. Were they, or were they not, appropriately certified as sterile, and thus fit for use? The answer, unequivocally according to Lady Justice Cockerill's judgment, was no, leaving PPE Medpro in breach of contract, and liable to repay just short of £122m. This case was always going to be about more than dusty contract law however. By targeting the company founded and controlled by Doug Barrowman, the husband of Baroness Mone, the DHSC was taking on the couple who encapsulated the COVID PPE scandal.  Her public profile as the media-friendly lingerie entrepreneur ennobled by David Cameron, blithely sharing snaps from the Lady M yacht while the country endured lockdown, and her husband's repeated hollow denials, made them the faces of that failure. PPE Medpro won more than £200m of contracts only after Baroness Mone used her political contacts, including Michael Gove, to introduce the firm to the government's VIP 'fast lane' and short-circuit normal procurement rules. She did so on the same day in May 2020 that her husband Doug Barrowman incorporated the company, and then lobbied hard over the next six months to see the deal completed. The judge described her as PPE Medpro's \"big gun\", deployed when civil servants were perceived to be holding up the deal. When challenged the pair then lied for more than two years about their links to the company, only admitting their role after dogged reporting by The Guardian revealed not just her role in lobbying on its behalf, but the extraction of more than £65m in profit. When challenged in a BBC interview and a self-funded documentary, Mone said that while she regretted not admitting her role, lying to journalists was not a crime. The couple's response to the ruling was in keeping with their approach throughout. The day before the judgment PPE Medpro filed to enter administration, with accounts showing assets of just £666,000, ensuring that any discussion about repayment will be with the administrator, not Mr Barrowman. Read more from Sky News:Starmer says he will take 'no more lectures' from FarageEnergy price cap warning as latest rise takes effect Baroness Mone meanwhile took to social media to claim the couple had been \"scapegoated and vilified\" for wider failings, and shared correspondence in which they offered to settle the case for £23m. After the judgment was delivered the baroness called it \"an Establishment win\", while Mr Barrowman, whose company offered no factual evidence in court and was not called as a witness, called it a \"travesty of justice\".  Labour ministers, led by the chancellor, praised the court's independence even as they celebrated a judgment which, if nothing else, may remind voters of the chaos of the Boris Johnson years. Getting the money back, the central point of the legal exercise, will be harder than stirring bad memories. The DHSC has appointed lawyers to try and help it \"recover every penny\" but it is unclear how that can be achieved given Medpro's administration. It could choose to pursue Mr Barrowman, who boasted of huge wealth earned in fintech and lived a lifestyle to match, but it is unclear how, and whether he still has the means. The National Crime Agency has frozen £75m of the couple's assets as part of its ongoing investigation, and the couple are reported to have sold homes and other assets in recent years. Asked if they might repay the profits earned, or at least the £23m offered in settlement, Mr Barrowan's spokesman told Sky News: \"The DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators, but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage.\""

A post on her institute's Instagram page said she died peacefully in her sleep on Wednesday morning while in Los Angeles for a speaking tour. \"Dr Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionised science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" said the post. Naturalist Chris Packham told Sky News that Dame Jane was a \"remarkable woman\" and in many ways \"she died on the job\" after spending much of her life campaigning on conservation issues. Greenpeace remembered her as \"one of the true conservation giants of our time\" who inspired \"millions\". The United Nations said she left an \"extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature\". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex described her as \"a visionary humanitarian, scientist, friend to the planet, and friend to us\". \n                  Mother pleads Scotland to deport 'brainwashed' daughter living with 'cult' back to Texas\n                 \n                  'A disaster for living standards': We now have just £1 more of disposable income than in 2019\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 They said: \"Her commitment to changing lives extends beyond what the world saw, and also to what we personally felt. She held our son, Archie, when he was first born, and showered love and care to those who were privileged to know her. She will be deeply missed.\" Others paying tribute on social media include former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Melinda Gates and Michael Bloomberg. Dame Jane began her research at 26, observing chimpanzees in east Africa and revealing their capability to engage in complex social behaviours. She gave chimps names instead of numbers, observed their distinct personalities and their use of tools - previously thought to be exclusive to humans. The London-born expert appeared in numerous National Geographic programmes, wrote more than 30 books, and also appeared in The Simpsons. Her work laid a path for other female primatologists and conservationists, including Dian Fossey (portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the Hollywood movie Gorillas In The Mist). Later in her career, Dame Jane shifted more towards climate advocacy after seeing habitats diminishing and spoke to Sky News about the issue in June. \"[Chimpanzees] are our closing living relatives - we share 98.7% of our DNA with them - but wildlife across Africa is disappearing,\" she said.  She was made a dame in 2003 and earlier this year was awarded the prestigious US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Moving to Bournemouth as a child, she described how she always dreamed of working with wild animals - a passion stoked by the gift of a toy gorilla and reading books such as Tarzan and Dr Dolittle. Dame Jane got her wish in 1957 when she saved enough money for a boat trip to Kenya. It was there that she met famed anthropologist and palaeontologist Dr Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey, an encounter that set up her long career. Dame Jane established the Gombe Stream chimpanzee reserve in present-day Tanzania, discovering that chimps also ate meat, fought fierce wars, and - perhaps most importantly - made tools. \"She sat on the forest floor in Tanzania as part of that group of chimpanzees,\" Chris Packham told Sky News. \"She knew them all as individuals. She knew their personalities. She watched them grow and mature and watch those personalities change. She was able to record things which had probably been glimpsed before but certainly never documented in the way that she was able to do so.\" Greenpeace's co-executive director in the UK, Will McCallum, said: \"She was one of the true conservation giants of our time. \"We were lucky enough to host her at the Greenpeace Glastonbury field last year, where she charmed the audience with her vast knowledge of our primate cousins' lives. \"Not only did her pioneering research transform our understanding of chimpanzees and their habitat, but she became a tireless advocate for the protection of wildlife and forests, inspiring millions to act.\" Dame Jane lived in the jungle for years, marrying wildlife cameraman and collaborator Hugo van Lawick. However, she realised she needed to take up a vocal role as a conservationist in order to protect the primates. Her institute launched in 1977 and she ended up travelling extensively to press her cause. She was still doing those world tours up until her death. She was also one of the few people to earn a PhD without having an undergraduate degree, earning the doctorate from Cambridge in 1966. \"It never ceases to amaze me that there's this person who travels around and does all these things,\" she told the New York Times during a 2014 trip to Burundi and back to Gombe. \"And it's me. It doesn't seem like me at all.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n As we sat down to begin our annual conference interview shortly after the prime minister had delivered his speech to party members, I asked Sir Keir Starmer how he was feeling? \"Good,\" he said, \"it was a speech I needed to give\". He was right to feel buoyed. After 15 months of being battered about in government, with ever-worsening polls, open challenges to his leadership and endless private grumbling from within his own government, the PM answered his critics in a speech that showed both his emotion and intent as he pitted his vision of Britain against that of Nigel Farage. It was a dividing line that united his party behind him as he set up the battle at the next election between Labour and Reform, between, in his words, \"decency or division, renewal or decline\".   He also marched directly into societal wars with a rallying cry that was met with rapturous applause in the hall as he savaged racists who graffitied a Chinese takeaway and criticised people seeking to sow \"fear and discord across our country\". This was a PM that found his voice and identified his enemy in Farage as he sharpened his attacks and asked the public to pick a side.  In our interview, he continued the argument, describing Farage's plan to deport people who currently have indefinite leave to remain in the UK as \"racist\". \"I think that's a very dangerous place for us to go as a country, and it goes against everything that I believe in,\" he told me. But Starmer was keen to play the ball, not the man, as he told me he didn't think Farage was a racist and stressed that he didn't think Reform voters were racist either. \"They're concerned about things like our borders,\" he said. \"They're frustrated about the pace of change. So I'm not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.\" His careful delineation reflects some nervousness at the top of his party that his attacks on Farage's racist immigration policy is risky if those millions of Britons thinking of voting for Reform feel they are being judged as racist themselves. Read more:Starmer 'responsible' if anything happens to Farage, Reform sayPM's speech a successful moment - but it ignored a big issue  One cabinet minister, acknowledging the risk, said they thought it was \"net positive\" because it gives the party a purpose and an argument to take the fight to Reform, not around competence - Labour have hardly proved themselves on that front yet - but around values. But this is where the prime minister also got a bit stuck in our sit-down. 👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 Happily calling out Farage's plan to deport people with indefinite leave to remain if they hit stringent income and language requirements, as a racist policy, he wouldn't tackle Donald Trump over his overtly racist attack on Sir Sadiq Khan when he suggested the London mayor, who is a Muslim, was driving London to Sharia law. He called it nonsense, but when pressed about whether it was racist - which Khan has explicitly said it is - the prime minister told me he was \"not going to start down the road of discussing whether things said by others are racist or not\" - having moments earlier overtly criticised Farage for having a \"racist policy\". When I pointed this out to him, he didn't really have anywhere left to go in what was an awkward exchange. That he wouldn't call out Trump speaks to the bigger challenge he faces than taking on Farage - delivering the \"renewal\" he says Britain so badly needs. What Starmer did powerfully in one of the strongest speeches I've ever seen him deliver was offer clear analysis of the journey that brought Britain to the place it is now, and the alternative directions the country could go next. But what is far, far harder than the diagnosis is the treatment. He won't call out Trump because he needs the US president to go easy on tariffs, to work with Europe on Ukraine, to support the recently announced tech partnership, which Number 10 said could deliver £150bn of investment into the UK economy in the coming decade. He might feel unable to criticise Trump, but the PM is borrowing the battle lines from the US, mirroring here what Joe Biden tried to do in the US ahead of the 2022 mid-term elections. The then US president delivered a speech called the \"battle for the soul of the nation\" as he cast Trump and his allies as a threat to the country and to democracy, and the Democrats as the defenders of America's core values. Of course, it turned out that President Biden wasn't the man to take on Trump, and paved the way to his victory by leaving it too late for another leader to take up the fight. Starmer's team feels more confident after this week that the PM has seen off similar fears around him - for the time being at least. But the fundamentals are still so difficult, with a challenging budget ahead and then a crucial set of elections in England, Scotland and Wales next May which could prove - to quote one Starmer detractor - \"a massive moment of change\". For now, a PM and a party pointing towards a common enemy, but Starmer's battle is only just beginning. And, as for the journey, it's a very, very long road ahead."

        "Content": " Reform UK has accused Sir Keir Starmer of \"inciting violence\" against Nigel Farage in his speech to the Labour Party conference on Tuesday, and said the prime minister will be \"responsible\" if anything happens to him. Speaking to Sky News Breakfast, the party's policy chief said the prime minister \"knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box\", so has instead tried to \"demonise him\". Sir Keir has denied the accusation that he risked inciting violence or inflaming tensions with his speech. Tap here for the latest political news The accusation comes after Sir Keir warned that the next four years will be \"a fight for the soul of our country\" against Reform UK in his keynote speech setting out his vision of \"national renewal\" for Britain. Zia Yusuf, Reform UK's head of policy, told presenter Wilfred Frost that over the last two days, the prime minister has \"embarked on a campaign with his cabinet to incite violence\" against Mr Farage. Pulling out specific quotes from Sir Keir's hour-long speech to his party conference, Yusuf said: \"The prime minister knows exactly what he's doing. He knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box. We've seen the most extraordinary campaign over 48 hours to demonise Nigel, and he is absolutely inciting violence against him.\" \n                  Starmer is right to be buoyed after conference - but he has a very long road ahead\n                 \n                  Public 'sick of us going about Nigel Farage all the time', says Labour deputy leadership frontrunner\n                 \n                  Farage isn't racist, says PM - as he's challenged over Trump's 'Sharia law' comment\n                 He went on to say that there are \"millions of people in this country who, if anything was to happen to Nigel Farage, will hold the prime minister squarely responsible for his actions\".  Sir Keir was asked about the claim of inciting violence, and if he risked inflaming tensions with his speech in an interview with GB News, and he replied: \"No, not at all.\" More broadly, senior cabinet minister Pat McFadden told Frost earlier: \"I think a lot of Reform's protesting about this is because what they don't want to talk about is the policy they announced last week.\" That was in reference to Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain, which could see legal immigrants to Britain deported because they do not meet new requirements the party proposes to bring in. Mr McFadden described the policy proposal as \"deeply un-British\" and \"a mistake\" from the party.  PM calls on party to 'fight Reform' In his interview with Sky News, Mr Yusuf highlighted a number of sections of Sir Keir's conference speech on Tuesday. Sir Keir called for his party to \"fight Reform with everything that this movement has\", and said that he himself will \"fight with every breath I have, fight for working people, fight for the tolerant, decent, respectful Britain that I know\". The prime minister also said the country must \"go into that battle armed, not just with words and condemnation, but with action\". And on Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain and deport \"people who've lived here for generations\", Sir Keir said: \"If you say they should now be deported, then mark my words - we will fight you with everything we have because you are the enemy of national renewal.\" Read more:Indefinite leave to remain: What is it and what do Reform and Labour say about it?  He also described \"the politics of grievance\", which he attributed to Reform UK and Mr Farage, as \"the biggest threat we face because it attacks who we are\". \"Using that language,\" Mr Yusuf said, \"He knows exactly what he's doing.\"  Farage's 'security detail cut' Mr Yusuf also claimed that \"the authorities cut the size of Nigel's security by 75%\" two weeks ago, which he said occurred around the time of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and party donors had \"stepped in to ensure, thankfully, that Nigel is well protected\". Mr Farage told the BBC in September last year that he was given a close protection detail by the state following the summer riots, which he said was \"when so many commentators tried to put the blame on me\". A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Decisions on MP security are made independently of ministers.\"  A spokesperson for the House of Commons has declined to comment on the claim that Mr Farage's security detail has been cut, saying in a statement: \"The ability of members and their staff to perform their parliamentary duties safely, both on and off the estate, is fundamental to our democracy. \"Any assessment of an individual MP's security arrangements or advice is subject to a rigorous risk-based assessment, conducted by security professionals and with input from a range of professional authorities. \"Whilst these are naturally kept under continuous review, we do not comment on specific details so as not to compromise the safety of MPs, parliamentary staff or members of the public.\" The Metropolitan Police, the Labour Party, and Downing Street have been contacted for comment."

The prime minister will reveal the plan for asylum policy changes at the European Political Community (EPC) summit in Copenhagen on Thursday, where he will co-chair a meeting of leaders looking at different approaches to tackling illegal migration. Sir Keir will tell the EPC, a forum of 44 countries formed after Russia invaded Ukraine, that refugees will not have the automatic right to family reunion. On 1 September, the government suspended the family reunion route as ministers figured out a new asylum policy, which will be unveiled later this autumn.  The route allowed people granted asylum to sponsor their immediate family to join them as a way of reuniting families separated by conflict and persecution. They did not need to meet the income or English language requirements typically required for other UK family visa routes.  Sir Keir is set to announce a new partnership with Denmark, backed by up to £3m, to tackle the causes of migration in Western Balkan countries, including by encouraging people to stay in the region and take up jobs there. He will discuss the changes with the other leaders and talk about other ways European countries can work together to tackle illegal migration. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, earlier this week, told the Labour conference gaining indefinite leave to remain (ILR) - which gives people the right to settle, work and study in the UK - will take longer than the current five years to gain.

That is the tolerant and fair approach to migration that our communities are built on, but the current system is not fit for purpose. \"That is why we're making fundamental changes to what those granted asylum are afforded in the UK. Settlement must be earned by contributing to our country, not by paying a people smuggler to cross the channel in a boat. \"The UK will continue to play its role in welcoming genuine refugees fleeing persecution. But we must also address the pull factors driving dangerous and illegal small boats crossings. There will be no golden ticket to settling in the UK, people will have to earn it.\""

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n  Britain's top cop has warned racist, sexist and violent police officers that he will drive them out of their jobs. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley described the behaviour depicted in an undercover TV documentary as \"reprehensible and completely unacceptable\". Nine officers at the UK's busiest police station could be sacked in an investigation into the programme’s allegations of racism, misogyny, excessive force on prisoners and inappropriate behaviour. One officer, a police constable, is also being investigated for the potential criminal offence of perverting the course of justice. The officers, from Charing Cross police station near Trafalgar Square in central London, have been suspended by the Met. They are the subject of a gross misconduct investigation by the watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Two others, a former Met officer and a civilian staff worker, are also facing the same disciplinary charge, which could lead to their dismissal. \n                  Murder investigation after patient, 85, dies following assault at Charing Cross Hospital\n                 \n                  Grenfell Tower deconstruction begins amid fears the work will lead to more flashbacks for community\n                 \n                  Murder investigation under way after north London stabbing\n                 Sir Mark said: “Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways, let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime. \"For that, I am truly sorry. “It's my expectation that for those involved, where there is incontrovertible evidence of racism, misogyny, anti-Muslim sentiment or bragging about excessive use of force, they will be put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and on a path to likely dismissal. We stand ready to work with the IOPC to make this happen.\" 'Crisis meeting with team leaders' The commissioner is said to have called a crisis meeting with his force’s ‘'team leaders', the chief inspectors and superintendents responsible for instilling discipline in more junior ranks. Another serving officer featured in the programme has been told they are no longer being investigated because it was thought their behaviour did not breach professional standards. The force, the UK's biggest, was told of the allegations three weeks ago after the BBC's Panorama presented film and audio compiled by an undercover reporter who got a job as a civilian worker in the station’s custody suite. The programme aired on BBC One on Wednesday night. 'Excessive use of force and discriminatory comments' The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour. The incidents are alleged to have happened on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025. IOPC investigators have not seen the TV film, but studied hours of CCTV footage from the custody suite, where prisoners are processed and held temporarily in cells, before announcing their gross misconduct investigation. IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: \"Having advised the individuals they are under investigation, we will now be securing initial accounts from them. We are treating this matter extremely seriously and have a team of investigators carrying out enquiries. \"Given the volume of CCTV footage and the number of individuals involved, it will take time to obtain and review all of the evidence; however, we want to reassure the public that we are working hard to progress enquiries as quickly as possible. \"We have identified and are contacting members of the public involved to inform them of our investigation and explain our role and we will be speaking to them in due course.\" The IOPC said it had appealed to Met police officers and staff for any information about bad conduct at the Charing Cross custody suite. Ms Rowe said: \"Since our investigation began, we have made several attempts to secure evidence from the BBC Panorama programme makers, which will be crucial to our enquiries.\" Sir Mark has been on a mission to root out badly behaving officers since he took the job three years ago. He said he has been open about the \"systemic, cultural, leadership and regulatory failings that have allowed misogyny, racism and a lack of public service ethos to put down deep roots\". \"We are partway into conducting what is already the biggest corruption clear-out in British policing history. We are relentlessly arresting and sacking officers and staff with 11 forced out each week – more than triple the rate of the previous weak approaches that left this toxic legacy behind.\" Read more on Sky News:Met considers Freemasonry changeMet chief on 'shameful' race issuesVape spiking investigation launched Three years ago, the IOPC issued wide-ranging recommendations to the Met to change policing practices after a series of investigations found evidence of bullying, discrimination and offensive social media messages, predominantly among officers at Charing Cross. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said of the latest allegations: \"The disturbing scenes in this footage are sickening. \"It is right that the Metropolitan Police have condemned this, and we fully support their pledge to root out those unfit to serve the public. I know this is a top priority for the commissioner. \"We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used.\" "

Aedes aegypti, also known as the Egyptian mosquito, and Aedes albopictus, also known as the (Asian) tiger or forest mosquito, are known vectors of several diseases including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika and dirofilariasis. The species were detected in surveillance traps set by the UK Health Security Agency, a peer-reviewed study on invasive mosquito surveillance in the UK has revealed. Egyptian mosquito eggs were detected in a freight storage facility near London's Heathrow Airport in September 2023 - and tiger mosquitoes were seen in August 2024 - for the first time since 2019 - at a motorway service station in Kent. The findings were reported in the study - by the UKHSA and the Centre for Climate and Health Security. Historically, both species were limited to subtropical and tropical regions, however, the tiger mosquito has now established populations across parts of southern and central Europe, demonstrating its ability to survive in temperate climates. \n                  Torrential rain after Typhoon Bualoi leaves at least 26 dead in Vietnam amid flooding and landslides\n                 \n                  China does targets differently to the West - and it may be just what the world needs\n                 \n                  New homes may be forced to fit water-saving showers and toilets \n                 Rising temperatures and milder winters may increase northward incursions of invasive species, putting new populations at risk of disease transmission. The authors said: \"While there is currently no evidence that Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti are widely established in the UK, without timely action, the UK faces the risk of invasive mosquito populations becoming established... proactive measures enhance resilience against emerging vector borne disease risks.\" Alongside active surveillance at ports and land transport sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the UKHSA also has traps on the Kent marshes - seen as a prime site for any mosquitoes taking up residence because it's warm and wet. Sky News' science correspondent Thomas Moore joined mosquito hunters at a marsh in North Kent in September 2023.  The UKHSA also runs the Mosquito Recording Scheme (MRS). The citizen-science project receives and identifies mosquitoes submitted by members of the public, including in response to nuisance biting incidents. The aim of the scheme is to detect unusual or invasive species, provide a log of reportable incidents of nuisance mosquito biting, and gain insight into the seasonality of incidents. Between 2005 and 2021, 286 reports of mosquitoes were submitted to the MRS, all of which were native UK species.

The Global Sumud Flotilla is made up of more than 40 civilian boats with an estimated 500 people onboard, and is trying to break Israel's sea blockade. But the attempt appears to have been thwarted - at least for now - by about 20 Israeli ships. Israel's foreign ministry said \"several vessels\" had been \"safely stopped\", with passengers being taken to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" a spokesperson added.

Greg Stoker, a US veteran who's involved, said water cannon had been used on some of the boats.  The flotilla, which set off from Barcelona and was scheduled to arrive this morning, had been flanked by NATO warships for part of the journey. The attempt has received a lot of attention, with Nelson Mandela's grandson, a former Barcelona mayor and several European legislators taking part. Israel said the mission was violating a lawful blockade and is only intended to provoke. The country also claimed it had offered a way to deliver any aid peacefully through safe channels. Organisers said the night-time interception was the second time the flotilla had been approached on Wednesday, after \"warships\" earlier encircled two of its boats. Last week, drones also reportedly dropped stun grenades and itching powder on some vessels. Israel didn't comment, but has said it will use any means to stop the boats getting to Gaza. Protests have broken out in Italy and Turkey over the treatment of the flotilla. Italy's largest union has called a general strike tomorrow, saying the \"attack on civilian vessels carrying Italian citizens represents an extremely serious matter\". Turkey's foreign ministry called Israel's interception an \"attack\" and \"an act of terror\" that endangered lives of those on board. Gaza has been dealing with severe food shortages due to the ongoing war. Agencies such as the UN accused Israel of deliberately slowing the delivery of supplies - something it denies. However, the aid being carried by the flotilla is said to only be a symbolic amount of food and medicine. An aid boat carrying Thunberg was also intercepted near Gaza in June, with the Swede deported alongside others. Israel put in it sea blockade when Hamas took control of the territory in 2007 and there have been several attempts to break it since then. Some of those involved in the latest campaign have said they will start a hunger strike if they're detained.

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @CordeliaSkyNews\n  At Kabul International Airport, there are dozens of confused looking families. Many are holding flowers, waiting and hoping their loved ones will touch down. Others came here hoping to take-off but are now sitting bewildered in the hot sun. After the Taliban imposed a nationwide shutdown of the internet, no one knows if any flights are still operating and no one can use their phones to find out. \"I am waiting for my brother from Australia,\" one man tells me, \"but I don't know if he's coming\". Beyond the gates, the runway is full of grounded planes. After hours of waiting on Tuesday, no international flights took off or arrived at Kabul Airport, despite some airlines scheduling departures. The Taliban caught many in the country off-guard with their shutdown - reportedly even some of their own ministers. Initially, there appeared to be no official indication of how long the shutdown might last or an explanation for why it was imposed. On Wednesday, there was confusion about the official explanation for what was happening. In the morning, the Associated Press news agency reported that the Taliban government had rejected reports of a nationwide internet ban, saying old fibre optic cables are worn out and are being replaced. This report was later withdrawn, AP saying it was based on a statement which did not, in fact, come from the Taliban. Reuters reported that three companies had restored their mobile phone services, according to residents, with internet services also returning in Kandahar and Herat, a local news service said. At Kabul airport, people worried the internet shutdown could be indefinite. Others speculated about rumours it was to do with security protocols and the movement of officials in the country. No one knows, and the TV and radio stations they get their news from have not been providing the latest information. The banks are open but no one can get out money. An employee at the bank in our hotel in Kabul told us they haven't been able to open their operating systems since Tuesday morning and that Western Union isn't accessible either. That's hugely significant in a country where many are reliant on money sent back by relatives abroad and banks are already struggling with sanctions. No one can call the police, no one can call an ambulance, and hospitals and medical services are wrestling with how to adjust too. It follows more than a week of temporary connectivity issues in some parts of the country, with the northern region of Balkh among the first to be affected by a ban on fibre optic internet. Read more: Internet ban 'extinguishing the only light that still reaches us' In the last 10 days, we have been travelling across Afghanistan. People in Nangarhar, Kunar, Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat all expressed concern about possible impending blackouts, and we personally experienced a slowdown in connectivity in these places. But nothing as widespread or sustained as this shutdown which is nationwide. Two weeks ago, the Taliban's provincial government spokesman Haji Attaullah Zaid said leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had imposed a \"complete ban\" on cable internet access in Balkh. \"This measure was taken to prevent immorality, and an alternative will be built within the country for necessities,\" Mr Zaid said.  It was said to be connected to concerns around pornography - but this was never officially stated by the Taliban. We have tried to reach the government for comment via satellite phone but with no success. The blackout has disrupted phone services. In countries with limited telecom infrastructure, phone networks are often routed through fibre-optic systems which have now been disabled. The lack of connectivity has raised immediate concern in the aid community. Amnesty International called it \"reckless\" and said the shutdown would have \"far-reaching consequences for the delivery of aid, access to healthcare and girls' education\". After the Taliban banned school for girls over the age of 12, many in the country have been secretly studying online. Read more from Sky News:US government shuts downEurovision rebellion emergency vote  Everyone we've spoken to seems dumbfounded. During the previous temporary blackouts, the Taliban did warn more was to come. But no one appears to have anticipated this - not ordinary citizens, not foreign officials here in Kabul, not big business, not the airlines or the hospitals. It is an indication of how quickly this country can turn and the power the Taliban has to disrupt and reshape its future. Internationally, many are raising concerns that this is an attempt by the Taliban at widespread censorship and further restriction of girls' education. Whatever the intention of their move, it has created an extreme scenario: no one in this country can currently contact anyone - for an emergency, for a family member, or for guidance - creating a major information vacuum."

        "Content": " At least 69 people have been killed in a powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake that rocked the central Philippines. The centre of the quake, which knocked out power lines and sent people running out into the streets, was about 12 miles northeast of Bogo, a coastal city of about 90,000 people on the island of Cebu. Civil defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters that the city's hospital has been \"overwhelmed,\" and that the number of dead remains \"fluid\". Earlier, authorities said at least 14 residents in Bogo had died. Another official said more than 150 people were injured. The tremor was set off by movement in a local fault at a depth of three miles at around 10pm (3pm in the UK) on Tuesday. Gemma Villamor, head of the local disaster office, said earlier that in the town of Medellin, near Bogo, at least 12 residents died when the ceilings and walls of their homes collapsed, with some asleep at the time. And in nearby San Remigio, vice mayor Alfie Reynes added that five people - including three coastguard members, a firefighter, and a child - were killed by collapsing walls while fleeing a basketball game. He later told DZMM Radio: \"It is raining heavily and there is no electricity so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there's a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake.\" Read more from Sky News:US government shuts down after last-ditch votes failTrump gives Hamas peace deal deadlinePrincess Anne makes surprise Ukraine visit Businesses and landmark buildings have suffered damage, including an old Catholic church in the town of Daanbantayan, and roads have shown deep cracks. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology briefly issued a tsunami warning for Cebu and nearby provinces, but later lifted it after no unusual waves were detected. The quake struck while Cebu and surrounding areas were still recovering from a severe storm that hit the central region days earlier, killing at least 27 people mainly from drownings and fallen trees, cutting power across cities, and forcing evacuations. The Philippines, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It also faces around 20 typhoons and storms annually, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone nations."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n  The opening of Munich's world-famous Oktoberfest has been delayed today following a bomb threat and an explosion at a home in the city. The bomb threat to the popular beer festival was received in the form of a letter from a suspect who police have linked to a fire at a house in the north of the city. When authorities searched the property, they found it was rigged with explosives. Police have urged people to leave the Oktoberfest area while they sweep the fairgrounds for explosive devices. It comes after officers were called to a fire at a home in the Lerchenau area at around 4.40am. In an update on X, Munich Police said \"loud banging noises were heard\" when they arrived at the scene. Bomb disposal experts were later called in after officers discovered explosive traps in the burning building. The initial theory from authorities is that the house was deliberately set on fire as part of a family dispute. One person was found injured with gunshot wounds at a nearby lake, according to the German newspaper Bild. A spokesperson told Sky News they couldn't currently confirm this information, but clarified that the injured man has since died. Another person, who police say is not believed to pose any danger to the public, is missing. Huge crowds have flocked to Munich for the annual Oktoberfest beer festival, which began on 20 September and runs until 5 October. Police said the opening of the festival grounds on Wednesday had been delayed while an investigation is ongoing. \"Due to an unspecified threat of explosives in connection with the explosion in northern Munich, the Theresienwiese will remain closed until 5pm,\" a police statement said. \"Possible connections to other locations in Munich are being examined, including the Theresienwiese. \"For this reason, the opening of the festival grounds has been delayed.\" Theresienwiese is where the Oktoberfest takes place. Millions of people attend the beer and folk festival, with 300,000 visitors reported in one day on Saturday."

Four days of protests, mostly led by Moroccan youths, have been held against what has been called the government's misplaced priorities. Protesters claim officials have been pouring money into investments related to the 2030 FIFA World Cup, while neglecting social services like health and education. Morocco's interior ministry said the nationwide protests had left 263 police officers injured, while 23 civilians had also been hurt. There had been 409 arrests, prompting officials to warn that anyone found breaking the law would be treated \"rigorously and firmly\". Damage had also been caused to 142 police vehicles and 20 private cars, the ministry said. In the eastern city of Oujda, a man who was hit by a police vehicle was in a stable condition in hospital, reported the state news agency, Map. Pictures have shown protesters clashing with riot police and throwing rocks, while vehicles have been set ablaze as violence spread to other towns and cities, including Rabat and Casablanca. The street demonstrations have been described as some of the country's biggest in years and continued after dozens of peaceful protesters were arrested at the weekend. Local media said officers had also detained people while they were being interviewed for TV networks. Violence broke out in several cities on Tuesday, especially where there are fewer jobs available and a lack of social services, reported local media. The leaderless Gen Z 212 movement, as the protesters have called themselves, has stoked anger about conditions in hospitals and schools amid outrage over the government's priorities. \"The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan but a serious demand,\" the movement's organisers wrote on Discord. They also cited King Mohammed VI and implored protesters to remain peaceful, while criticising \"repressive security approaches\".

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  On its face, the Department of Health and Social Care v PPE Medpro Limited was not a case about Michelle Mone, or VIP fast lanes, or the politics and profiteering of the pandemic years. Rather, as the DHSC's barrister made clear on the first morning of the first day of hearings, it was about 25 million surgical gowns sold to the NHS for £122m. Were they, or were they not, appropriately certified as sterile, and thus fit for use? The answer, unequivocally according to Lady Justice Cockerill's judgment, was no, leaving PPE Medpro in breach of contract, and liable to repay just short of £122m. This case was always going to be about more than dusty contract law however. By targeting the company founded and controlled by Doug Barrowman, the husband of Baroness Mone, the DHSC was taking on the couple who encapsulated the COVID PPE scandal.  Her public profile as the media-friendly lingerie entrepreneur ennobled by David Cameron, blithely sharing snaps from the Lady M yacht while the country endured lockdown, and her husband's repeated hollow denials, made them the faces of that failure. PPE Medpro won more than £200m of contracts only after Baroness Mone used her political contacts, including Michael Gove, to introduce the firm to the government's VIP 'fast lane' and short-circuit normal procurement rules. She did so on the same day in May 2020 that her husband Doug Barrowman incorporated the company, and then lobbied hard over the next six months to see the deal completed. The judge described her as PPE Medpro's \"big gun\", deployed when civil servants were perceived to be holding up the deal. When challenged the pair then lied for more than two years about their links to the company, only admitting their role after dogged reporting by The Guardian revealed not just her role in lobbying on its behalf, but the extraction of more than £65m in profit. When challenged in a BBC interview and a self-funded documentary, Mone said that while she regretted not admitting her role, lying to journalists was not a crime. The couple's response to the ruling was in keeping with their approach throughout. The day before the judgment PPE Medpro filed to enter administration, with accounts showing assets of just £666,000, ensuring that any discussion about repayment will be with the administrator, not Mr Barrowman. Read more from Sky News:Starmer says he will take 'no more lectures' from FarageEnergy price cap warning as latest rise takes effect Baroness Mone meanwhile took to social media to claim the couple had been \"scapegoated and vilified\" for wider failings, and shared correspondence in which they offered to settle the case for £23m. After the judgment was delivered the baroness called it \"an Establishment win\", while Mr Barrowman, whose company offered no factual evidence in court and was not called as a witness, called it a \"travesty of justice\".  Labour ministers, led by the chancellor, praised the court's independence even as they celebrated a judgment which, if nothing else, may remind voters of the chaos of the Boris Johnson years. Getting the money back, the central point of the legal exercise, will be harder than stirring bad memories. The DHSC has appointed lawyers to try and help it \"recover every penny\" but it is unclear how that can be achieved given Medpro's administration. It could choose to pursue Mr Barrowman, who boasted of huge wealth earned in fintech and lived a lifestyle to match, but it is unclear how, and whether he still has the means. The National Crime Agency has frozen £75m of the couple's assets as part of its ongoing investigation, and the couple are reported to have sold homes and other assets in recent years. Asked if they might repay the profits earned, or at least the £23m offered in settlement, Mr Barrowan's spokesman told Sky News: \"The DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators, but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage.\""

The £121.9m sum, the price of the gowns, must now be repaid by the company, PPE Medpro. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) brought the case, saying it provided 25 million \"faulty\", non-sterile gowns. Money latest: Citroen C3 drivers told to stop using cars immediately On Wednesday, the High Court ruled the gowns did not comply with the requirement of having a validated process to demonstrate sterility, and it was not possible for the DHSC to have sold them and recoup the loss. The company, a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, businessman Doug Barrowman, was awarded the government contract after she recommended it to ministers. As well as wanting to recover the costs of the deal, the government wanted to recoup the costs of transporting and storing the items, which it said amounted to an additional £8.6m, though the High Court denied the latter request, saying the loss was not proved at trial. PPE Medpro's counterclaim that the DHSC should have advised it on how to comply with the contract also failed. 'VIP lane' Both Baroness Mone and Mr Barrowman denied wrongdoing, and neither gave evidence at the trial in June. She had initially denied involvement in the company or the process through which it was handed the government contract. However, it was later revealed that Baroness Mone was the \"source of referral\" for the firm getting a place on the so-called \"VIP lane\" for offers of personal protective equipment for the NHS. Yesterday, Baroness Mone, a businesswoman who was made a life peer in 2015 following her work as an \"entrepreneurship tsar\" during David Cameron's premiership, accused the government of making her and her husband a \"poster couple for the PPE scandal\", in a lengthy online tirade. The response In response to the ruling, Baroness Mone said it was \"shocking but all too predictable\". Mr Barrowman said it was \"a travesty of justice\" and the judge gave the DHSC \"an establishment win despite the mountain of evidence in court against such a judgment\". \"Her judgment bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month-long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile,\" he said. \"This judgment is a whitewash of the facts and shows that justice was being seen to be done, where the outcome was always certain for the DHSC and the government. This case was simply too big for the government to lose.\" Ahead of the ruling on Tuesday, PPE Medpro said it intended to appoint an administrator. A spokesman for Mr Barrowman has told Sky News, \"the DHSC would have to negotiate with the administrators [over the £121.9m sum that is owed], but the backers of PPE Medpro have always tried to negotiate with DHSC and they're happy to engage\". The news has been welcomed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. \"We want our money back. We are getting our money back. And it will go where it belongs - in our schools, NHS and communities,\" Ms Reeves said. \"Profiting and corruption during the pandemic cost lives,\" the families group said. \"Those responsible must be held to account.\""

Sky News has learnt that 885 Capital, an investment firm founded by Sudeep Ramnani and Jai Mahtani, is part of a consortium which has agreed to inject funding into R360 - which will encompass both men's and women's professional competitions. Among the other early backers are Martin Gilbert, the City grandee who chairs Revolut, and Albachiara, an advisory and investment business which specialises in sectors including sport. The size of the capital injection into R360 to date is unclear, although rugby insiders believe it will need to raise tens of millions of pounds to finance its early years, owing to the cost of player recruitment and marketing. R360 has been dubbed a divisive concept by critics because it wants to tempt leading players such as England's Fin Smith and Henry Slade from their current clubs into a new franchise league, consisting of 12 teams based in major cities around the world. The new format has been developed by Mike Tindall, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup-winning team. Mr Tindall is reported to have informed players this week that funding had been secured but without disclosing the names of R360's backers. English players who participate in the breakaway tournament could be prevented by the Rugby Football Union from playing for the national team, according to reports. News of R360's backers comes just days after England's women's team won the World Cup at Twickenham after beating Canada 35-13. R360's board is understood to have reversed a decision to sell individual team franchises despite having received substantial investor interest. The preference for a centrally owned model, according to insiders, would allow R360 to have greater control over team and 'product' quality during the early years of the competition. It emerged on Wednesday that funding for the new venture had been secured until 2028, when it is forecast to become profitable. The funding of R360 has been organised by Oakvale Capital, a specialist sports and gaming corporate finance advisor. A spokesperson for R360 said: \"We're not in a position to comment on investment partners in order to respect confidentiality. \"However, what we can say is we're truly excited to launch our global league next year, which has been designed to showcase the best rugby players in the world, capture the imagination of fans and grow our sport in the years ahead.\" 885 Capital did not respond to a request for comment."

Funeral Partners, which was founded in 2007 by Philip Greenfield, oversees more than 20,000 funeral services annually. It now trades from more than 280 branches across the UK, competing with the likes of the Co-op's Funeralcare arm. If completed, it would represent a return to the industry for Duke Street, which previously owned Laurel Funerals. It sold that business to Dignity and Funeral Partners, meaning it would effectively be reacquiring a number of assets it used to own. \n                  'A disaster for living standards': We now have just £1 more of disposable income than in 2019\n                 \n                  PPE Medpro: Can firm linked to Tory peer afford to pay back govt after PPE contract breach?\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 News of the talks comes days after it emerged that Pure Cremation had kicked off talks with potential buyers about a deal which could be valued in the region of £700m.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n As we sat down to begin our annual conference interview shortly after the prime minister had delivered his speech to party members, I asked Sir Keir Starmer how he was feeling? \"Good,\" he said, \"it was a speech I needed to give\". He was right to feel buoyed. After 15 months of being battered about in government, with ever-worsening polls, open challenges to his leadership and endless private grumbling from within his own government, the PM answered his critics in a speech that showed both his emotion and intent as he pitted his vision of Britain against that of Nigel Farage. It was a dividing line that united his party behind him as he set up the battle at the next election between Labour and Reform, between, in his words, \"decency or division, renewal or decline\".   He also marched directly into societal wars with a rallying cry that was met with rapturous applause in the hall as he savaged racists who graffitied a Chinese takeaway and criticised people seeking to sow \"fear and discord across our country\". This was a PM that found his voice and identified his enemy in Farage as he sharpened his attacks and asked the public to pick a side.  In our interview, he continued the argument, describing Farage's plan to deport people who currently have indefinite leave to remain in the UK as \"racist\". \"I think that's a very dangerous place for us to go as a country, and it goes against everything that I believe in,\" he told me. But Starmer was keen to play the ball, not the man, as he told me he didn't think Farage was a racist and stressed that he didn't think Reform voters were racist either. \"They're concerned about things like our borders,\" he said. \"They're frustrated about the pace of change. So I'm not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.\" His careful delineation reflects some nervousness at the top of his party that his attacks on Farage's racist immigration policy is risky if those millions of Britons thinking of voting for Reform feel they are being judged as racist themselves. Read more:Starmer 'responsible' if anything happens to Farage, Reform sayPM's speech a successful moment - but it ignored a big issue  One cabinet minister, acknowledging the risk, said they thought it was \"net positive\" because it gives the party a purpose and an argument to take the fight to Reform, not around competence - Labour have hardly proved themselves on that front yet - but around values. But this is where the prime minister also got a bit stuck in our sit-down. 👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 Happily calling out Farage's plan to deport people with indefinite leave to remain if they hit stringent income and language requirements, as a racist policy, he wouldn't tackle Donald Trump over his overtly racist attack on Sir Sadiq Khan when he suggested the London mayor, who is a Muslim, was driving London to Sharia law. He called it nonsense, but when pressed about whether it was racist - which Khan has explicitly said it is - the prime minister told me he was \"not going to start down the road of discussing whether things said by others are racist or not\" - having moments earlier overtly criticised Farage for having a \"racist policy\". When I pointed this out to him, he didn't really have anywhere left to go in what was an awkward exchange. That he wouldn't call out Trump speaks to the bigger challenge he faces than taking on Farage - delivering the \"renewal\" he says Britain so badly needs. What Starmer did powerfully in one of the strongest speeches I've ever seen him deliver was offer clear analysis of the journey that brought Britain to the place it is now, and the alternative directions the country could go next. But what is far, far harder than the diagnosis is the treatment. He won't call out Trump because he needs the US president to go easy on tariffs, to work with Europe on Ukraine, to support the recently announced tech partnership, which Number 10 said could deliver £150bn of investment into the UK economy in the coming decade. He might feel unable to criticise Trump, but the PM is borrowing the battle lines from the US, mirroring here what Joe Biden tried to do in the US ahead of the 2022 mid-term elections. The then US president delivered a speech called the \"battle for the soul of the nation\" as he cast Trump and his allies as a threat to the country and to democracy, and the Democrats as the defenders of America's core values. Of course, it turned out that President Biden wasn't the man to take on Trump, and paved the way to his victory by leaving it too late for another leader to take up the fight. Starmer's team feels more confident after this week that the PM has seen off similar fears around him - for the time being at least. But the fundamentals are still so difficult, with a challenging budget ahead and then a crucial set of elections in England, Scotland and Wales next May which could prove - to quote one Starmer detractor - \"a massive moment of change\". For now, a PM and a party pointing towards a common enemy, but Starmer's battle is only just beginning. And, as for the journey, it's a very, very long road ahead."

Sir Keir will tell the EPC, a forum of 44 countries formed after Russia invaded Ukraine, that refugees will not have the automatic right to family reunion. On 1 September, the government suspended the family reunion route as ministers figured out a new asylum policy, which will be unveiled later this autumn.  The route allowed people granted asylum to sponsor their immediate family to join them as a way of reuniting families separated by conflict and persecution. They did not need to meet the income or English language requirements typically required for other UK family visa routes.  Sir Keir is set to announce a new partnership with Denmark, backed by up to £3m, to tackle the causes of migration in Western Balkan countries, including by encouraging people to stay in the region and take up jobs there.

That is the tolerant and fair approach to migration that our communities are built on, but the current system is not fit for purpose. \"That is why we're making fundamental changes to what those granted asylum are afforded in the UK. Settlement must be earned by contributing to our country, not by paying a people smuggler to cross the channel in a boat. \"The UK will continue to play its role in welcoming genuine refugees fleeing persecution.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Dozens of MPs have told the prime minister it is \"more urgent than ever\" to create a Ukraine-style family visa for Gazans with family in the UK. At the end of June, 67 MPs and peers wrote to Sir Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper, who was home secretary at the time, to create a \"Gaza Family Scheme\" to \"reunite [Palestinians] with their loved ones in the UK until it is safe to return\". They said it could be based on the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allowed Ukrainian nationals from 2022 to February 2024 to join family members in the UK to live, work and study for up to three years.   However, the group told Sky News they have not received a reply in the three months since their request, so Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who coordinated the letter, has sent another letter to the prime minister and current Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, calling for an urgent update on whether the government will create a Gaza family visa scheme. The new letter, seen exclusively by Sky News and sent on 1 October, said a scheme \"is more urgent than ever\" to \"help the family members of British citizens and residents currently trapped in Gaza\". \n                  Will Trump's Gaza plan leave eternal peace in the Middle East? \n                 \n                  Praise and fury for Trump's Gaza peace deal - but Hamas's first reaction is telling\n                 \n                  What we know about the Gaza peace plan – and what Sky News correspondents make of it\n                 It says 65,419 people are now reported to have been killed and 167,160 injured, while critical infrastructure has been destroyed and medics, rescue workers, teachers and journalists have been killed. \"British citizens and residents with family members in Gaza are understandably terrified that their relatives will be killed,\" the letter says. Israel has been engaging in a military takeover of Gaza City, and on Wednesday its defence minister, Israel Katz, said anyone who remains in the city will be \"considered terrorists and terror supporters\". On 1 September, the British government temporarily suspended new applications for a scheme allowing refugees to bring family members to the UK, which includes people from Gaza. Ms de Cordova, a former shadow cabinet member, told Sky News: \"We are now facing a genocide in Gaza - as concluded by the UN - with an ever-rising death toll, an unyielding manmade famine and family members of British citizens trapped in a war zone. \"That's why I've written again to the government, pressing them to create a Gaza family visa scheme. \"A family visa scheme would give people a route out of Gaza, allow them to be reunited with family in the UK and give them the chance at a fresh start. \"Just last month, the government took the important measure of recognising Palestinian statehood. A family visa scheme would be a practical next step that would help bring people to safety and help us - as a nation - live up to our highest values on the global stage.\"  Ghassan Ghaben, spokesman for the Gaza Families Reunited campaign, said the lack of a scheme \"continues to tear Palestinian families apart\". He said the suspension of the refugee family reunion route is a \"devastating step backwards\" as it was \"one of the only safe routes left for spouses and children to join their immediate family members in the UK\". \"The UK government must uphold the right to family unity and allow Palestinians in the UK to reunite with their loved ones in Gaza,\" Mr Ghaben said. \"More widely, it must urgently take concrete action to stop Israel's continued starvation, displacement, and killing of Palestinians in Gaza. \"Recognising a Palestinian state without taking concrete steps to uphold Palestinian basic human rights, including family unity, is nothing short of hypocrisy.\" 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 The current wave of violence began on 7 October, 2023, when Hamas-led militants carried out an attack inside Israel that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw around 250 people taken hostage. Israel claims its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages - it believes around 20 of the captives are still alive. Israel has repeatedly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and claims they are justified as a means of self-defence. It says it does not target civilians. The number of people killed in Gaza, reported by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, does not differentiate between civilians and fighters - but its officials say more than half of those killed are women and children. A government spokesperson told Sky News: \"Bringing individuals out of Gaza is an extremely complex and delicate operation. \"Our focus must be on supporting those whom we are in a position to help. We have therefore taken the difficult decision to prioritise extending exceptional direct support to certain groups of individuals whom we can be confident in our ability to try to help leave Gaza.\""

        "Content": " Reform UK has accused Sir Keir Starmer of \"inciting violence\" against Nigel Farage in his speech to the Labour Party conference on Tuesday, and said the prime minister will be \"responsible\" if anything happens to him. Speaking to Sky News Breakfast, the party's policy chief said the prime minister \"knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box\", so has instead tried to \"demonise him\". Sir Keir has denied the accusation that he risked inciting violence or inflaming tensions with his speech. Tap here for the latest political news The accusation comes after Sir Keir warned that the next four years will be \"a fight for the soul of our country\" against Reform UK in his keynote speech setting out his vision of \"national renewal\" for Britain. Zia Yusuf, Reform UK's head of policy, told presenter Wilfred Frost that over the last two days, the prime minister has \"embarked on a campaign with his cabinet to incite violence\" against Mr Farage. Pulling out specific quotes from Sir Keir's hour-long speech to his party conference, Yusuf said: \"The prime minister knows exactly what he's doing. He knows he cannot beat Nigel at the ballot box. We've seen the most extraordinary campaign over 48 hours to demonise Nigel, and he is absolutely inciting violence against him.\" \n                  Starmer is right to be buoyed after conference - but he has a very long road ahead\n                 \n                  Public 'sick of us going about Nigel Farage all the time', says Labour deputy leadership frontrunner\n                 \n                  Farage isn't racist, says PM - as he's challenged over Trump's 'Sharia law' comment\n                 He went on to say that there are \"millions of people in this country who, if anything was to happen to Nigel Farage, will hold the prime minister squarely responsible for his actions\".  Sir Keir was asked about the claim of inciting violence, and if he risked inflaming tensions with his speech in an interview with GB News, and he replied: \"No, not at all.\" More broadly, senior cabinet minister Pat McFadden told Frost earlier: \"I think a lot of Reform's protesting about this is because what they don't want to talk about is the policy they announced last week.\" That was in reference to Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain, which could see legal immigrants to Britain deported because they do not meet new requirements the party proposes to bring in. Mr McFadden described the policy proposal as \"deeply un-British\" and \"a mistake\" from the party.  PM calls on party to 'fight Reform' In his interview with Sky News, Mr Yusuf highlighted a number of sections of Sir Keir's conference speech on Tuesday. Sir Keir called for his party to \"fight Reform with everything that this movement has\", and said that he himself will \"fight with every breath I have, fight for working people, fight for the tolerant, decent, respectful Britain that I know\". The prime minister also said the country must \"go into that battle armed, not just with words and condemnation, but with action\". And on Reform UK's pledge to end indefinite leave to remain and deport \"people who've lived here for generations\", Sir Keir said: \"If you say they should now be deported, then mark my words - we will fight you with everything we have because you are the enemy of national renewal.\" Read more:Indefinite leave to remain: What is it and what do Reform and Labour say about it?  He also described \"the politics of grievance\", which he attributed to Reform UK and Mr Farage, as \"the biggest threat we face because it attacks who we are\". \"Using that language,\" Mr Yusuf said, \"He knows exactly what he's doing.\"  Farage's 'security detail cut' Mr Yusuf also claimed that \"the authorities cut the size of Nigel's security by 75%\" two weeks ago, which he said occurred around the time of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and party donors had \"stepped in to ensure, thankfully, that Nigel is well protected\". Mr Farage told the BBC in September last year that he was given a close protection detail by the state following the summer riots, which he said was \"when so many commentators tried to put the blame on me\". A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Decisions on MP security are made independently of ministers.\"  A spokesperson for the House of Commons has declined to comment on the claim that Mr Farage's security detail has been cut, saying in a statement: \"The ability of members and their staff to perform their parliamentary duties safely, both on and off the estate, is fundamental to our democracy. \"Any assessment of an individual MP's security arrangements or advice is subject to a rigorous risk-based assessment, conducted by security professionals and with input from a range of professional authorities. \"Whilst these are naturally kept under continuous review, we do not comment on specific details so as not to compromise the safety of MPs, parliamentary staff or members of the public.\" The Metropolitan Police, the Labour Party, and Downing Street have been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Ed Miliband has vowed to \"ban fracking\" for good, as he drew yet another dividing line with Reform during his speech at the Labour Party conference. The energy secretary promised to \"send this bunch of frackers packing\", after Richard Tice and Nigel Farage of Reform UK both backed the method for retrieving underground shale gas as a way to boost the economy. Hydraulic fracking has been suspended since a pause - a moratorium - was introduced in 2019, following concerns over minor earthquakes and public anger. Its unpopularity with the British public has not budged since then, with twice as many people still opposing it as supporting it, according to YouGov polling. Liz Truss did temporarily lift the moratorium during her time as prime minister in 2022, but it was quickly reinstated by her successor, Rishi Sunak. Mr Miliband said in his speech: \"Fracking will not take a penny off bills. It will not create long-term sustainable jobs. \"It will trash our climate commitments. And it is dangerous and deeply harmful to our natural environment.\" \n                  Energy price cap warning as latest rise takes effect\n                 \n                  Energy group Ovo plots sale of stake in software arm Kaluza\n                 \n                  Energy bill payers to back 'super-battery' projects\n                 He added: \"Let's ban fracking and vow to send this bunch of frackers packing too.\"  The move was welcomed by climate campaigners. Asad Rehmen, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: \"By providing a clear vision for our energy future based on helping people, not on ignoring the science, the energy secretary has sent an important message that the government is listening to communities.\" But they urged the government to close a loophole which, in theory, allows fracking of small volumes of gas via a method called \"proppant squeeze\". Greenpeace said ministers were \"right to focus on renewable energy as our best chance to create jobs, boost our energy independence and protect households from the turbulence of gas markets\". Labour has been building out the UK's renewable and nuclear energy at speed, pledging to generate 95% of Britain's electricity from green sources by 2030. But it has not yet confirmed the future of some oil and gas fields in the North Sea. It pledged to end licences for new fields, but allowed some wriggle room for those already in the process, such as the Rosebank oilfield, whose application was resubmitted last month. Supporters say this could help some sustain some jobs in oil and gas as the sector rapidly declines overall. In his speech, Mr Miliband also promised to double the number of clean energy jobs, from 430,000 to 830,000 by 2030. Many of these will be naturally destined for the east coast: former industrial heartlands where Reform's support is also currently strongest. The details will be set out in a new Clean Energy Jobs Plan due in the next few weeks. His department expects the clean energy boom will require 25,000 more engineers and researchers, 26,000 more welders and electricians, and 36,000 more construction workers. \"However, the speech was policy-light, meaning many questions remain about Labour's plans over the next year,\" said Niamh O Regan, senior researcher at the Social Market Foundation. \"To really ensure Britain becomes a 'clean energy superpower', measures like a decision on decoupling electricity from gas, a long-term plan for heat decarbonisation and answers to the future for oil and gas workers as their industries are phased out are needed.\""

A post on her institute's Instagram page said she died peacefully in her sleep on Wednesday morning while in Los Angeles for a speaking tour. \"Dr Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionised science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" said the post. Naturalist Chris Packham told Sky News that Dame Jane was a \"remarkable woman\" and in many ways \"she died on the job\" after spending much of her life campaigning on conservation issues. Greenpeace remembered her as \"one of the true conservation giants of our time\" who inspired \"millions\". The United Nations said she left an \"extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature\". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex described her as \"a visionary humanitarian, scientist, friend to the planet, and friend to us\". \n                  Mother pleads Scotland to deport 'brainwashed' daughter living with 'cult' back to Texas\n                 \n                  'A disaster for living standards': We now have just £1 more of disposable income than in 2019\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 They said: \"Her commitment to changing lives extends beyond what the world saw, and also to what we personally felt. She held our son, Archie, when he was first born, and showered love and care to those who were privileged to know her. She will be deeply missed.\" Others paying tribute on social media include former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Melinda Gates and Michael Bloomberg. Dame Jane began her research at 26, observing chimpanzees in east Africa and revealing their capability to engage in complex social behaviours. She gave chimps names instead of numbers, observed their distinct personalities and their use of tools - previously thought to be exclusive to humans. The London-born expert appeared in numerous National Geographic programmes, wrote more than 30 books, and also appeared in The Simpsons. Her work laid a path for other female primatologists and conservationists, including Dian Fossey (portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the Hollywood movie Gorillas In The Mist). Later in her career, Dame Jane shifted more towards climate advocacy after seeing habitats diminishing and spoke to Sky News about the issue in June. \"[Chimpanzees] are our closing living relatives - we share 98.7% of our DNA with them - but wildlife across Africa is disappearing,\" she said.  She was made a dame in 2003 and earlier this year was awarded the prestigious US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Moving to Bournemouth as a child, she described how she always dreamed of working with wild animals - a passion stoked by the gift of a toy gorilla and reading books such as Tarzan and Dr Dolittle. Dame Jane got her wish in 1957 when she saved enough money for a boat trip to Kenya. It was there that she met famed anthropologist and palaeontologist Dr Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey, an encounter that set up her long career. Dame Jane established the Gombe Stream chimpanzee reserve in present-day Tanzania, discovering that chimps also ate meat, fought fierce wars, and - perhaps most importantly - made tools. \"She sat on the forest floor in Tanzania as part of that group of chimpanzees,\" Chris Packham told Sky News. \"She knew them all as individuals. She knew their personalities. She watched them grow and mature and watch those personalities change. She was able to record things which had probably been glimpsed before but certainly never documented in the way that she was able to do so.\" Greenpeace's co-executive director in the UK, Will McCallum, said: \"She was one of the true conservation giants of our time. \"We were lucky enough to host her at the Greenpeace Glastonbury field last year, where she charmed the audience with her vast knowledge of our primate cousins' lives. \"Not only did her pioneering research transform our understanding of chimpanzees and their habitat, but she became a tireless advocate for the protection of wildlife and forests, inspiring millions to act.\" Dame Jane lived in the jungle for years, marrying wildlife cameraman and collaborator Hugo van Lawick. However, she realised she needed to take up a vocal role as a conservationist in order to protect the primates. Her institute launched in 1977 and she ended up travelling extensively to press her cause. She was still doing those world tours up until her death. She was also one of the few people to earn a PhD without having an undergraduate degree, earning the doctorate from Cambridge in 1966. \"It never ceases to amaze me that there's this person who travels around and does all these things,\" she told the New York Times during a 2014 trip to Burundi and back to Gombe. \"And it's me. It doesn't seem like me at all.\""

        "Content": "Two species of disease-carrying mosquitoes have been found in the UK - and are spreading as the climate warms, scientists have warned.  Aedes aegypti, also known as the Egyptian mosquito, and Aedes albopictus, also known as the (Asian) tiger or forest mosquito, are known vectors of several diseases including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika and dirofilariasis. The species were detected in surveillance traps set by the UK Health Security Agency, a peer-reviewed study on invasive mosquito surveillance in the UK has revealed. Egyptian mosquito eggs were detected in a freight storage facility near London's Heathrow Airport in September 2023 - and tiger mosquitoes were seen in August 2024 - for the first time since 2019 - at a motorway service station in Kent. The findings were reported in the study - by the UKHSA and the Centre for Climate and Health Security. Historically, both species were limited to subtropical and tropical regions, however, the tiger mosquito has now established populations across parts of southern and central Europe, demonstrating its ability to survive in temperate climates. \n                  Torrential rain after Typhoon Bualoi leaves at least 26 dead in Vietnam amid flooding and landslides\n                 \n                  China does targets differently to the West - and it may be just what the world needs\n                 \n                  New homes may be forced to fit water-saving showers and toilets \n                 Rising temperatures and milder winters may increase northward incursions of invasive species, putting new populations at risk of disease transmission. The authors said: \"While there is currently no evidence that Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti are widely established in the UK, without timely action, the UK faces the risk of invasive mosquito populations becoming established... proactive measures enhance resilience against emerging vector borne disease risks.\" Alongside active surveillance at ports and land transport sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the UKHSA also has traps on the Kent marshes - seen as a prime site for any mosquitoes taking up residence because it's warm and wet. Sky News' science correspondent Thomas Moore joined mosquito hunters at a marsh in North Kent in September 2023.  The UKHSA also runs the Mosquito Recording Scheme (MRS). The citizen-science project receives and identifies mosquitoes submitted by members of the public, including in response to nuisance biting incidents. The aim of the scheme is to detect unusual or invasive species, provide a log of reportable incidents of nuisance mosquito biting, and gain insight into the seasonality of incidents. Between 2005 and 2021, 286 reports of mosquitoes were submitted to the MRS, all of which were native UK species.

        "Content": "All GP surgeries in England are required to offer online appointment bookings from today. Practices must keep their websites and app services available from at least 8am to 6.30pm, Monday through Friday, for non-urgent appointments, medication queries and admin requests. Many surgeries are already offering online bookings and consultations, but services are typically less effective in working-class areas. The Department of Health and Social Care says there is a lack of consistency, as some surgeries that offer online services are choosing to switch the function off during busier periods. The British Medical Association (BMA) has argued safeguards have not been put in place, nor have extra staff been brought in to manage what it anticipates will be a \"barrage of online requests.\" The BMA has said GPs are considering a range of actions after voting to enter a dispute with the government over the plan. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has urged the BMA to embrace the plan, saying the union's resistance is \"a real disservice to so many GPs\" who have already introduced the service. 'As easy as booking a takeaway' The minister said the government will help practices that need assistance to implement the plan, \"but we've got to modernise\". Mr Streeting told the Labour Party conference: \"Many GPs already offer this service because they've changed with the times. \"Why shouldn't be booking a GP appointment be as easy as booking a delivery, a taxi, or a takeaway? And our policy comes alongside a billion pounds of extra funding for general practice and 2,000 extra GPs. \"Yet the BMA threatens to oppose it in 2025. Well, I'll give you this warning; if we give in to the forces of conservatism, they will turn the NHS into a museum of 20th century healthcare.\" Read more from Sky News:Starmer will take 'no more lectures' from FarageStreeting says Labour 'need Angela Rayner back' The measure is part of the broader government pledge to transform the NHS. Sir Keir Starmer has revealed plans to establish a nationwide \"online hospital\" by 2027, enabling patients to receive treatment and care from home. The government said the initiative could provide up to 8.5 million additional NHS appointments within its first three years. Available via the NHS app, it will allow patients to schedule in-person procedures at local hospitals, surgical hubs or diagnostic centres, reducing delays."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Ed Miliband has vowed to \"ban fracking\" for good, as he drew yet another dividing line with Reform during his speech at the Labour Party conference. The energy secretary promised to \"send this bunch of frackers packing\", after Richard Tice and Nigel Farage of Reform UK both backed the method for retrieving underground shale gas as a way to boost the economy. Hydraulic fracking has been suspended since a pause - a moratorium - was introduced in 2019, following concerns over minor earthquakes and public anger. Its unpopularity with the British public has not budged since then, with twice as many people still opposing it as supporting it, according to YouGov polling. Liz Truss did temporarily lift the moratorium during her time as prime minister in 2022, but it was quickly reinstated by her successor, Rishi Sunak. Mr Miliband said in his speech: \"Fracking will not take a penny off bills. It will not create long-term sustainable jobs. \"It will trash our climate commitments. And it is dangerous and deeply harmful to our natural environment.\" \n                  Energy price cap warning as latest rise takes effect\n                 \n                  Energy group Ovo plots sale of stake in software arm Kaluza\n                 \n                  Energy bill payers to back 'super-battery' projects\n                 He added: \"Let's ban fracking and vow to send this bunch of frackers packing too.\"  The move was welcomed by climate campaigners. Asad Rehmen, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: \"By providing a clear vision for our energy future based on helping people, not on ignoring the science, the energy secretary has sent an important message that the government is listening to communities.\" But they urged the government to close a loophole which, in theory, allows fracking of small volumes of gas via a method called \"proppant squeeze\". Greenpeace said ministers were \"right to focus on renewable energy as our best chance to create jobs, boost our energy independence and protect households from the turbulence of gas markets\". Labour has been building out the UK's renewable and nuclear energy at speed, pledging to generate 95% of Britain's electricity from green sources by 2030. But it has not yet confirmed the future of some oil and gas fields in the North Sea. It pledged to end licences for new fields, but allowed some wriggle room for those already in the process, such as the Rosebank oilfield, whose application was resubmitted last month. Supporters say this could help some sustain some jobs in oil and gas as the sector rapidly declines overall. In his speech, Mr Miliband also promised to double the number of clean energy jobs, from 430,000 to 830,000 by 2030. Many of these will be naturally destined for the east coast: former industrial heartlands where Reform's support is also currently strongest. The details will be set out in a new Clean Energy Jobs Plan due in the next few weeks. His department expects the clean energy boom will require 25,000 more engineers and researchers, 26,000 more welders and electricians, and 36,000 more construction workers. \"However, the speech was policy-light, meaning many questions remain about Labour's plans over the next year,\" said Niamh O Regan, senior researcher at the Social Market Foundation. \"To really ensure Britain becomes a 'clean energy superpower', measures like a decision on decoupling electricity from gas, a long-term plan for heat decarbonisation and answers to the future for oil and gas workers as their industries are phased out are needed.\""

Thompson, best known for his 1971 novel Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, died aged 67 on 20 February 2005. The original investigation concluded the death was from an allegedly self-inflicted gunshot wound and was suicide. In a statement on Tuesday, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Anita Thompson had requested a case review into her husband's death, and that it is being carried out to provide an independent perspective on the investigation. While Sheriff Michael Buglione said there is no new evidence suggesting foul play, \"we understand the profound impact Hunter S Thompson had on this community and beyond\". He added: \"By bringing in an outside agency for a fresh look, we hope to provide a definitive and transparent review that may offer peace of mind to his family and the public.\" The CBI added its review would take \"an unspecified amount of time\". \n                  Colorado: Six found dead at dairy farm after 'toxic gas incident'\n                 \n                  James Craig: Dentist in Colorado poisoned wife's protein shakes with cyanide, murder trial hears \n                 \n                  Mohamed Soliman: Colorado attack suspect's wife and children detained by immigration officials\n                 Born in 1937, Thompson was regarded as a pioneer in the 1960s New Journalism movement, and wrote the 1967 book Hell's Angels about the notorious motorcycle gang after spending more than a year living and riding with them.
