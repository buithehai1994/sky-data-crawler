        "Content": " Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn over edits the organisation made last year to one of his speeches. The organisation has been engulfed in a crisis, forced to apologise on Monday after two of its most senior figures, including the director-general, resigned on Sunday night. The defamation claim centres around a BBC Panorama documentary, which aired October 2024 and showed an edited speech made by Mr Trump before the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in which he appeared to tell his supporters he was going to walk with them to the US Capitol and \"fight like hell\". In a letter dated 9 November, Florida-based lawyer Alejandro Brito set the BBC a deadline of 10pm UK time on Friday to respond, outlining three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president He told the BBC it needed to \"comply\" or face being sued for $1bn. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\" 'Error of judgement' On Monday, BBC chairman Samir Shah, one of the most senior figures still standing, apologised for the \"error of judgement\" in editing the video. In a letter to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of MPs, Mr Shah said Mr Trump's speech was edited in a way that gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action\". \"The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" he added.  Director-general and head of BBC News resign Concerns about the edited speech first came to light in a leaked memo from Michael Prescott, a former journalist and independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board. As a result, BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness announced their resignations on Sunday evening, saying in emails to staff that mistakes had been made. Mr Davie will address an all-staff meeting on Tuesday. While on her way into the Broadcasting House on Monday morning, Ms Turness defended the corporation, rejecting accusations of institutional bias.  Downing St stands by BBC - but chancellor says 'lessons to be learned' A spokesperson for the prime minister told reporters on Monday that the BBC wasn't corrupt or institutionally biased. Instead, they said it had a \"vital role\" to play in the modern age, but needed to ensure it acted \"to maintain trust and correct mistakes quickly when they occur\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves also stood by the corporation, but said that \"lessons do need to be learned\". 'Nothing but an apology' Veteran broadcaster and former BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby told Sky News, however, that the organisation owed the US president nothing more than an apology.  But former legal correspondent for the BBC Joshua Rozenberg also told Sky News that he believed the corporation would \"very likely\" consider settling with Trump.

        "Content": "Rachel Reeves has signalled she is going to break her manifesto tax pledges at the budget - and has given her strongest indication yet she will lift the two-child benefit cap. The chancellor said the world has changed in the year since the last budget, when she reiterated Labour's manifesto promise not to raise national insurance, VAT, or income tax on \"working people\". Politics Hub: Follow latest updates \"It would, of course, be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending,\" she told BBC 5Live. \"I have been very clear that we are looking at both taxes and spending,\" she added. Ms Reeves also gave her strongest indication yet she will lift the two-child benefit cap at the budget on 26 November, saying it is not right a child is \"penalised because they are in a bigger family\". She blamed poor productivity and growth over the last few years on the previous government \"always taking the easy option to cut investment in rail and road projects, in energy projects and digital infrastructure\". She said she promised during the election campaign to \"bring stability back to our economy\". 'I'll always do what's right for UK' \"What I can promise now is I will always do what I think is right for our country, not the easy choice, but the thing that I think is necessary,\" she added. The chancellor blamed the UK's lack of growth under her tenure on global conflicts, trade, and tariffs. In a dig at Donald Trump, who has imposed wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world, she said: \"I don't think anyone could have foreseen when this government was elected last year that we were going to see these big increases in global tariffs and barriers to trade. \"And I have to be chancellor in the world as it is not necessarily the world as I would like it to be. But I have to respond to those challenges, and that's the responsible thing to do.\" Read more:What tax rises will Reeves announce?  'Children should not be penalised' The government has, so far, resisted lifting the two-child benefit cap, which means a family can only claim child benefits for the first two children. But, it is a contentious subject within Labour, with seven of its MPs suspended two weeks after the election for voting to scrap it, while others are aware it will cost £2.8bn to do so. Former Labour prime minister and chancellor Gordon Brown has been pushing for Ms Reeves, who says he is her hero, to lift it. She said she saw Mr Brown at Remembrance Sunday, where they \"had a good chat\" - and they speak regularly.  Ms Reeves added Mr Brown and Sir Tony Blair were big heroes of hers because they did so much to lift children out of poverty - the reason she went into politics. Pushed on whether she would lift the cap, she said: \"I don't think that it's right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own. So we will take action on child poverty.\" Mr Brown earlier told Sky News' Mornings with Ridge and Frost he was \"confident\" of a two-child benefit cap change at the budget. The latest YouGov polling found 59% of the public are in favour of keeping the cap in place, and only 26% thought it should be abolished. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Rachel Reeves has borrowed, spent and taxed like there's no tomorrow - and she's coming back for more because she doesn't have a plan or the strength to stand up to Labour's backbenchers, who are now calling the shots.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n The biggest climate meeting of the year opened in Brazil on Monday aiming to bring countries together, amid a difficult global backdrop of backlash to climate policies in Europe and an absent United States. Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned of those who \"sow hatred, spread fear, and attack institutions, science, and universities\". \"It is time to impose a new defeat on denialists,\" he told countries gathered for COP30 in the Amazonian city of Belem. Read more: Britons still buying green tech despite attacks  It was a veiled attack on the likes of US President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a \"hoax\", and emboldened populist parties in Europe and the UK that are attacking climate policies and questioning science. UN climate chief Simon Stiell told negotiators on Monday: \"Your job is to fight this climate crisis together.\" Outwardly, countries were unphased that the US president is skipping the talks on climate change - despite being the largest historical emitter. After all, the other 194 countries are still signed up, Brazil pointed out yesterday. But Mr Trump's shadow still hangs over the summit, and some diplomats who want more action on fossil fuels privately expressed nervousness that his team could still stand in the way. Last month, he successfully sank a proposed shipping levy after threatening sanctions and visa restrictions on those who backed it. Germany's environment state secretary Jochen Flasbarth was asked whether Mr Trump might try the same tactics at COP30. \"I don't think so. But we'll have to wait and see,\" he replied. He said a broader conference like this was less likely to worry the US president than the shipping levy, which would have been legally binding.  Fossil fuels versus clean energy COP30 host nation Brazil, itself a major oil producer, says it wants to use the summit to map out how to end dependence on oil, coal and gas. Two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, countries set a vague target to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels - but there's been little progress since. As the US seeks to lock countries into using its oil and gas for longer, China is forging ahead, building most of the solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles of the future, while still chugging coal itself. The president of this year's conference, Andre Correa do Lago, said: \"Emerging countries are appearing in this COP with a different role. China is coming with solutions for everyone.\" UN climate chief Mr Stiell also talked up China's renewable power push. \"Clean energy is the trend of our time, President Xi of China said.\" German minister Mr Flasbarth said he had been to China, which is currently the world's largest polluter, three times in the last few months.  Although China's leader Xi Jinping also stayed at home, officials sent in his place talked up climate policies. But 19 US states still have net zero targets, and Democratic politicians are arriving in Belem this week to nail their colours to the climate mast. California senator Josh Becker said in a briefing: \"Donald Trump does not speak for all Americans.\" He added: \"Yes, I think he will try to influence the talks. But we're going to continue to move forward.\" Read more:Why US may soon have real energy emergencyTrump urged to involve US in climate change fightCOP's potential for change limited by those absentAre climate summits saving the world - or just hot air? 'Symbol of devastation' Unamay Gordon, principal director of climate change for the Jamaican government, said: \"I know that the subnational governments from the US will be here on the ground as well, and accountability has to come at all levels.\" Jamaica is still picking up the pieces from the deadly Hurricane Melissa that slammed into its coastlines two weeks ago, which was intensified by climate change.  Ms Gordon said the country has become \"the world's symbol of climate devastation\". An alliance of island countries, including Jamaica, will use COP30 to try to force countries to respond to a recent warning that the world is due to warm by levels that could push their lands underwater. The summit is also hoped to launch various initiatives to protect and fund indigenous peoples, who are finally being recognised and rewarded for being the best guardians of their land."

        "Content": "For many people learning to drive, the journey to receiving a licence can be long and arduous.  For some, however, it is longer than others. Figures released by the AA Driving School today reveal one learner has spent £2,944 taking their theory test 128 times without success. Another passed the exam only at the 75th attempt, which cost them more than £1,700 in total. Each attempt at the theory test - which must be passed before a practical exam can be booked - costs £23. It evaluates knowledge and understanding of road rules and safe driving practices through multiple-choice questions and ability to assess danger via hazard perception videos. For those who do pass, the practical test presents a further obstacle. Last year, the record number of attempts taken before passing was 21. That would have cost between £1,302 and £1,575, depending on when the person took the tests. Two people have taken the practical test 37 times without passing, spending up to £2,220 each. Read more:Trump threatens to sue BBCReeves all but confirms tax hikes The figures were obtained following a freedom of information request to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). According to the body, pass rates for the theory and practical tests in the 2024/25 financial year were 44.9% and 48.7% respectively. Emma Bush, managing director at AA Driving School, said revision was the \"the key to success\" in the theory test. She added: \"It is easy to underestimate the level of knowledge required to pass the theory test.\" Earlier this year, driving test waiting times in Britain reached a record high. Driving instructors have told Sky News that it has become almost impossible to book a driving test on the government website due to bots on the system. Individuals and companies use bots to block-book driving test slots and then resell them at a profit. While not illegal, this is a violation of the DVSA's terms of use. Recent data shows the agency has closed over 800 business accounts for misuse of its booking service in the past two years."

        "Content": "Scientists have discovered a new medicine that they say offers hope of substantially slowing the progress of motor neurone disease (MND). The drug, named M102, works by protecting nerve cells damaged by MND. Preclinical studies of the drug conducted with mice show improvement in movement and nerve function. Researchers are now hopeful the drug can be tested on humans with the neurological condition, for which there is currently no cure. MND causes the messages from motor neurones - the nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscle - to gradually stop. This leads to muscles becoming weak and stiff and gradually reduces the ability of patients to walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. There are around 5,000 people in the UK with MND. Those who develop the condition usually die within two to five years following the onset of symptoms. Last year, rugby league star Rob Burrow died aged 41 after being diagnosed with the condition in 2019. Following a decorated sporting career in which he represented Leeds Rhinos, England and Great Britain, he raised millions of pounds for charities doing research into the degenerative brain and nerve disease. MND left him unable to speak and confined him to a wheelchair. But he increased the public prominence of MND in the UK. After his death, Tanya Curry, the chief executive of the MND Association, said Burrow \"made a huge amount of difference\". She said: \"Not only for donations and financial influence for the organisation, but actually in the campaigning arena.\" \"It's a rare disease, but actually something that people understand now. So, he has done so much for the community and we are honestly so grateful for that.\" Former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir died in 2022 at the age of 52 after a lengthy battle with MND.  Last month, England's 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Lewis Moody announced he had been diagnosed with the disease. The 47-year-old former England captain said it had been \"incredibly hard to process and a huge shock to me and my family\". Moody won 71 caps for England and also five for the British and Irish Lions, and was a seven-time title winner with Leicester.

Professor Dame Pamela Shaw, director of Sitran and lead investigator of the study, said: \"MND is one of the cruellest diseases, robbing people of their mobility and independence often at an alarming speed. \"We are now at a point where scientific understanding is finally catching up. \"Our discovery of M102 gives real hope that we can substantially slow the progression of this disease. \"The preclinical studies not only showed improvement in movement, gait, and nerve function in mouse models, but it also protected motor neurones grown in the laboratory from damage caused by MND patient cells.\" Dr Richard Mead, senior lecturer in translational neuroscience at Sitran, said researchers could now move closer to a treatment that can \"truly make a difference\"."

Ms Sultana has sole control of a company holding over £800,000 of Your Party donations following an internal fallout. Her spokesperson told Sky News £600k would be transferred over in three tranches starting with £200k from Wednesday, and the rest \"once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full\". But a Your Party source told Sky News she should transfer the full £800k worth of donations now. Politics Live: Another migrant deported to France returns to UK on small boat It follows a major row over finances behind the scenes of the new left-wing party, which Ms Sultana co-launched with Jeremy Corbyn in July. At the time, a company called MOU Operations was used to collect donations, with the idea this would be transferred over to Your Party once it was formally registered with the Electoral Commission. \n                  Rachel Reeves signals she will break tax pledges - and gives strongest indication she will lift two-child cap\n                 \n                  UK's Prevent counter-terrorism strategy 'is no longer keeping the country safe', commission warns \n                 \n                  Politics latest: Chancellor Rachel Reeves all but admits she will break Labour's manifesto commitments on tax\n                 The registration happened on 30 September, but no transfer of funds has been made - despite Ms Sultana stepping in to take ownership of MOU last month after its previous three directors quit. It is understood MOU is also holding around £500k in fees collected as part of Ms Sultana's unauthorised membership launch, which caused a major row in September and is now being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office. The Your Party source told Sky News that Ms Sultana has been told Your Party can't accept that money due to legal risks and accused her of trying to \"offload\" it.  How did we get here? Ms Sultana agreed to take over MOU to break a standoff between Your Party and the company's previous three directors - former Labour MP Beth Winter, former Labour mayor Jamie Driscoll and former South African politician Andrew Feinstein. The trio set up MOU in April to assist with a new left-wing party centred around Mr Corbyn but resigned on 29 October, claiming the role of holding donations had been \"thrust upon\" them and raising concerns about a \"lack of appropriate governance\" within Your Party. The former directors said they wanted Your Party to take full control of MOU because of worries around liabilities but five of the six founding MPs refused. Ms Sultana said her stepping in would \"bring the chapter to a close\" and \"these resources will now be used for Your Party, as was always intended\". Her allies have dismissed \"hostile briefings\" suggesting she is deliberately withholding the money, insisting she has been conducting \"due diligence\" before sending it over. Sky News understands Ms Sultana has been seeking Your Party's constitution and financial scheme as registered with the Electoral Commission, to help her understand the party's governing structures. A source close to her claims there has been an unwillingness to share the documents from within Your Party, so she has requested them from the elections watchdog directly. It is not clear who wrote the documents and who is controlling access to them - or why one of the party's founders should not be able to see them. 'Low trust environment' However one Your Party source described operating in a \"low trust environment\" since the membership fiasco, despite public efforts to patch things up, Senior Your Party figures have accused Ms Sultana of deliberately withholding MOU's funds for political leverage. Organisers expressed frustration at operating on a \"shoestring\" ahead of the founding conference at the end of this month.  A spokesperson for Ms Sultana said: \"Zarah did not choose to become the sole director of MOU Operations Limited, but was prepared to take on this responsibility to ensure funds are transferred as quickly as possible and preparations for the founding conference can progress. \"As sole director, she is legally responsible for ensuring the company's costs, liabilities and expenses are settled, and this process may take some time. To ensure funds are available for the founding conference, she will transfer £600k in tranches over the next couple of weeks. The first £200k is scheduled to be sent 12 November. \"All remaining funds will be transferred once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full.\" A Your Party spokesperson said: \"We are completely focused on putting together a successful founding conference for our members, so they can democratically decide Your Party's structures and programme, and Britain can get the socialist alternative it so badly needs. Hundreds of volunteers are working tirelessly on a shoestring budget to make this a reality, a testament to the grassroots power of our mass movement.\""

A group of 75 politicians has described their captivity at the Sea Life London Aquarium - a stone's throw from the Houses of Parliament - as \"un-British\". The aquarium, in the County Hall building on the South bank, opposite the London Eye, first launched its exhibit of gentoo penguins in May 2011, and campaigners are arguing they \"have now endured 14 years\" in a small space with a pool just 2.1m (7ft) deep.

        "Content": "By Siobhan Robbins, Europe correspondent and Liv Stroud, Germany producer  The doctor accused of driving a car into a crowded German Christmas market has apologised to the family of a nine-year-old boy who was killed. The suspect, named Taleb A in line with German privacy laws, is accused of murdering five women aged between 45 and 75 years old and a nine-year-old boy during the attack, which lasted just over a minute on 20 December 2024. The 51-year-old Saudi-born defendant is also charged with attempting to murder 338 people and injuring 309 during the attack in Magdeburg, which is 150km (93 miles) southwest of Berlin. Prosecutors claim that during the rampage, which began at 7.02pm, Taleb A's rented BMW reached speeds of up to 29mph (48kph) as it crashed into crowds enjoying the festivities on the final Friday before Christmas. On the first day of the trial, the defendant blinked back tears during his 90-minute testimony as he talked about Andre Gleissner, the child he's accused of mowing down. Taleb A said he remembers having a vision of a child as he was driving through the market. He wept in the bulletproof glass box, built for his security in the specially-erected courtroom, and apologised to Andre's parents. \n                  Doctor goes on trial accused of killing six in Christmas market attack in Germany\n                 \n                  Protesters in Germany demand removal of Madeleine McCann suspect\n                 \n                  Jerome Boateng faces backlash over Bayern Munich return after conviction for assaulting ex-girlfriend\n                 The boy's father was present for the first day of the trial after travelling from southern Germany, according to German media. Earlier in the day, prosecutors spent more than two hours reading out the charges, which included horrific details of the injuries caused to both survivors and victims. The suspect was seen repeatedly blowing his nose as the court heard descriptions of the aftermath of the attack, including survivors being left with brain injuries and a pregnant woman giving birth prematurely. Dressed in a blue T-shirt and black top, former psychiatrist Taleb A stated his testimony of the evening would take \"hours if not days\". He began his defence by talking about French philosopher Voltaire and criticising \"left-wing media\". During his initial opening, he jumped between topics, reeling off wide-ranging allegations against the Berlin police, the former German interior minister Nancy Faeser, and even former chancellor Angela Merkel. He also rejected an assessment by a forensic expert that he is a narcissist. \"I don't want other foreigners to be disadvantaged because of what I did,\" the defendant told the court, as he switched between displays of remorse and discussions of political conspiracy. Some of the plaintiffs turned their bodies away from the defendant as he made his speech. Others sat with their heads in their hands, refusing to look at Taleb A, as he ranted about the \"left-right wing\" divide, migration and refugee organisations. At the time of his arrest, officials said he was an \"untypical\" attacker with the then interior minister alleging he was Islamophobic. A refugee from Saudi Arabia, Taleb A described himself as an \"ex-Muslim\". His social media pages, which he posted on in the hours leading up to the attack, promoted anti-Islam views - and claimed Germany was allowing the \"Islamisation of Europe\". He also showed support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AFD), suggesting they were both fighting to protect Germany.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn over edits the organisation made last year to one of his speeches. The organisation has been engulfed in a crisis, forced to apologise on Monday after two of its most senior figures, including the director-general, resigned on Sunday night. The defamation claim centres around a BBC Panorama documentary, which aired October 2024 and showed an edited speech made by Mr Trump before the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in which he appeared to tell his supporters he was going to walk with them to the US Capitol and \"fight like hell\". In a letter dated 9 November, Florida-based lawyer Alejandro Brito set the BBC a deadline of 10pm UK time on Friday to respond, outlining three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president He told the BBC it needed to \"comply\" or face being sued for $1bn. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\" 'Error of judgement' On Monday, BBC chairman Samir Shah, one of the most senior figures still standing, apologised for the \"error of judgement\" in editing the video. In a letter to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of MPs, Mr Shah said Mr Trump's speech was edited in a way that gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action\". \"The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" he added.  Director-general and head of BBC News resign Concerns about the edited speech first came to light in a leaked memo from Michael Prescott, a former journalist and independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board. As a result, BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness announced their resignations on Sunday evening, saying in emails to staff that mistakes had been made. Mr Davie will address an all-staff meeting on Tuesday. While on her way into the Broadcasting House on Monday morning, Ms Turness defended the corporation, rejecting accusations of institutional bias.  Downing St stands by BBC - but chancellor says 'lessons to be learned' A spokesperson for the prime minister told reporters on Monday that the BBC wasn't corrupt or institutionally biased. Instead, they said it had a \"vital role\" to play in the modern age, but needed to ensure it acted \"to maintain trust and correct mistakes quickly when they occur\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves also stood by the corporation, but said that \"lessons do need to be learned\". 'Nothing but an apology' Veteran broadcaster and former BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby told Sky News, however, that the organisation owed the US president nothing more than an apology.  But former legal correspondent for the BBC Joshua Rozenberg also told Sky News that he believed the corporation would \"very likely\" consider settling with Trump.

        "Content": "Rachel Reeves has signalled she is going to break her manifesto tax pledges at the budget - and has given her strongest indication yet she will lift the two-child benefit cap. The chancellor said the world has changed in the year since the last budget, when she reiterated Labour's manifesto promise not to raise national insurance, VAT, or income tax on \"working people\". Politics Hub: Follow latest updates \"It would, of course, be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending,\" she told BBC 5Live. \"I have been very clear that we are looking at both taxes and spending,\" she added. Ms Reeves also gave her strongest indication yet she will lift the two-child benefit cap at the budget on 26 November, saying it is not right a child is \"penalised because they are in a bigger family\". She blamed poor productivity and growth over the last few years on the previous government \"always taking the easy option to cut investment in rail and road projects, in energy projects and digital infrastructure\". She said she promised during the election campaign to \"bring stability back to our economy\". 'I'll always do what's right for UK' \"What I can promise now is I will always do what I think is right for our country, not the easy choice, but the thing that I think is necessary,\" she added. The chancellor blamed the UK's lack of growth under her tenure on global conflicts, trade, and tariffs. In a dig at Donald Trump, who has imposed wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world, she said: \"I don't think anyone could have foreseen when this government was elected last year that we were going to see these big increases in global tariffs and barriers to trade. \"And I have to be chancellor in the world as it is not necessarily the world as I would like it to be. But I have to respond to those challenges, and that's the responsible thing to do.\" Read more:What tax rises will Reeves announce?  'Children should not be penalised' The government has, so far, resisted lifting the two-child benefit cap, which means a family can only claim child benefits for the first two children. But, it is a contentious subject within Labour, with seven of its MPs suspended two weeks after the election for voting to scrap it, while others are aware it will cost £2.8bn to do so. Former Labour prime minister and chancellor Gordon Brown has been pushing for Ms Reeves, who says he is her hero, to lift it. She said she saw Mr Brown at Remembrance Sunday, where they \"had a good chat\" - and they speak regularly.  Ms Reeves added Mr Brown and Sir Tony Blair were big heroes of hers because they did so much to lift children out of poverty - the reason she went into politics. Pushed on whether she would lift the cap, she said: \"I don't think that it's right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own. So we will take action on child poverty.\" Mr Brown earlier told Sky News' Mornings with Ridge and Frost he was \"confident\" of a two-child benefit cap change at the budget. The latest YouGov polling found 59% of the public are in favour of keeping the cap in place, and only 26% thought it should be abolished. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Rachel Reeves has borrowed, spent and taxed like there's no tomorrow - and she's coming back for more because she doesn't have a plan or the strength to stand up to Labour's backbenchers, who are now calling the shots.\""

        "Content": "For many people learning to drive, the journey to receiving a licence can be long and arduous.  For some, however, it is longer than others. Figures released by the AA Driving School today reveal one learner has spent £2,944 taking their theory test 128 times without success. Another passed the exam only at the 75th attempt, which cost them more than £1,700 in total. Each attempt at the theory test - which must be passed before a practical exam can be booked - costs £23. It evaluates knowledge and understanding of road rules and safe driving practices through multiple-choice questions and ability to assess danger via hazard perception videos. For those who do pass, the practical test presents a further obstacle. Last year, the record number of attempts taken before passing was 21. That would have cost between £1,302 and £1,575, depending on when the person took the tests. Two people have taken the practical test 37 times without passing, spending up to £2,220 each. Read more:Trump threatens to sue BBCReeves all but confirms tax hikes The figures were obtained following a freedom of information request to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). According to the body, pass rates for the theory and practical tests in the 2024/25 financial year were 44.9% and 48.7% respectively. Emma Bush, managing director at AA Driving School, said revision was the \"the key to success\" in the theory test. She added: \"It is easy to underestimate the level of knowledge required to pass the theory test.\" Earlier this year, driving test waiting times in Britain reached a record high. Driving instructors have told Sky News that it has become almost impossible to book a driving test on the government website due to bots on the system. Individuals and companies use bots to block-book driving test slots and then resell them at a profit. While not illegal, this is a violation of the DVSA's terms of use. Recent data shows the agency has closed over 800 business accounts for misuse of its booking service in the past two years."

        "Content": "Scientists have discovered a new medicine that they say offers hope of substantially slowing the progress of motor neurone disease (MND). The drug, named M102, works by protecting nerve cells damaged by MND. Preclinical studies of the drug conducted with mice show improvement in movement and nerve function. Researchers are now hopeful the drug can be tested on humans with the neurological condition, for which there is currently no cure. MND causes the messages from motor neurones - the nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscle - to gradually stop. This leads to muscles becoming weak and stiff and gradually reduces the ability of patients to walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. There are around 5,000 people in the UK with MND. Those who develop the condition usually die within two to five years following the onset of symptoms. Last year, rugby league star Rob Burrow died aged 41 after being diagnosed with the condition in 2019. Following a decorated sporting career in which he represented Leeds Rhinos, England and Great Britain, he raised millions of pounds for charities doing research into the degenerative brain and nerve disease. MND left him unable to speak and confined him to a wheelchair. But he increased the public prominence of MND in the UK. After his death, Tanya Curry, the chief executive of the MND Association, said Burrow \"made a huge amount of difference\". She said: \"Not only for donations and financial influence for the organisation, but actually in the campaigning arena.\" \"It's a rare disease, but actually something that people understand now. So, he has done so much for the community and we are honestly so grateful for that.\" Former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir died in 2022 at the age of 52 after a lengthy battle with MND.  Last month, England's 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Lewis Moody announced he had been diagnosed with the disease. The 47-year-old former England captain said it had been \"incredibly hard to process and a huge shock to me and my family\". Moody won 71 caps for England and also five for the British and Irish Lions, and was a seven-time title winner with Leicester. Read more:How is MND linked to sport?Test could spot signs of MND earlier M102 was developed by scientists at the University of Sheffield's Institute for Translational Neuroscience (Sitran) working alongside in collaboration with Aclipse Therapeutics, a US biotech company. Professor Dame Pamela Shaw, director of Sitran and lead investigator of the study, said: \"MND is one of the cruellest diseases, robbing people of their mobility and independence often at an alarming speed. \"We are now at a point where scientific understanding is finally catching up. \"Our discovery of M102 gives real hope that we can substantially slow the progression of this disease. \"The preclinical studies not only showed improvement in movement, gait, and nerve function in mouse models, but it also protected motor neurones grown in the laboratory from damage caused by MND patient cells.\" Dr Richard Mead, senior lecturer in translational neuroscience at Sitran, said researchers could now move closer to a treatment that can \"truly make a difference\"."

Ms Sultana has sole control of a company holding over £800,000 of Your Party donations following an internal fallout. Her spokesperson told Sky News £600k would be transferred over in three tranches starting with £200k from Wednesday, and the rest \"once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full\". But a Your Party source told Sky News she should transfer the full £800k worth of donations now. Politics Live: Another migrant deported to France returns to UK on small boat It follows a major row over finances behind the scenes of the new left-wing party, which Ms Sultana co-launched with Jeremy Corbyn in July. At the time, a company called MOU Operations was used to collect donations, with the idea this would be transferred over to Your Party once it was formally registered with the Electoral Commission. \n                  Rachel Reeves signals she will break tax pledges - and gives strongest indication she will lift two-child cap\n                 \n                  UK's Prevent counter-terrorism strategy 'is no longer keeping the country safe', commission warns \n                 \n                  Politics latest: Chancellor Rachel Reeves all but admits she will break Labour's manifesto commitments on tax\n                 The registration happened on 30 September, but no transfer of funds has been made - despite Ms Sultana stepping in to take ownership of MOU last month after its previous three directors quit. It is understood MOU is also holding around £500k in fees collected as part of Ms Sultana's unauthorised membership launch, which caused a major row in September and is now being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office. The Your Party source told Sky News that Ms Sultana has been told Your Party can't accept that money due to legal risks and accused her of trying to \"offload\" it.  How did we get here? Ms Sultana agreed to take over MOU to break a standoff between Your Party and the company's previous three directors - former Labour MP Beth Winter, former Labour mayor Jamie Driscoll and former South African politician Andrew Feinstein. The trio set up MOU in April to assist with a new left-wing party centred around Mr Corbyn but resigned on 29 October, claiming the role of holding donations had been \"thrust upon\" them and raising concerns about a \"lack of appropriate governance\" within Your Party. The former directors said they wanted Your Party to take full control of MOU because of worries around liabilities but five of the six founding MPs refused. Ms Sultana said her stepping in would \"bring the chapter to a close\" and \"these resources will now be used for Your Party, as was always intended\". Her allies have dismissed \"hostile briefings\" suggesting she is deliberately withholding the money, insisting she has been conducting \"due diligence\" before sending it over. Sky News understands Ms Sultana has been seeking Your Party's constitution and financial scheme as registered with the Electoral Commission, to help her understand the party's governing structures. A source close to her claims there has been an unwillingness to share the documents from within Your Party, so she has requested them from the elections watchdog directly. It is not clear who wrote the documents and who is controlling access to them - or why one of the party's founders should not be able to see them. 'Low trust environment' However one Your Party source described operating in a \"low trust environment\" since the membership fiasco, despite public efforts to patch things up, Senior Your Party figures have accused Ms Sultana of deliberately withholding MOU's funds for political leverage. Organisers expressed frustration at operating on a \"shoestring\" ahead of the founding conference at the end of this month.  A spokesperson for Ms Sultana said: \"Zarah did not choose to become the sole director of MOU Operations Limited, but was prepared to take on this responsibility to ensure funds are transferred as quickly as possible and preparations for the founding conference can progress. \"As sole director, she is legally responsible for ensuring the company's costs, liabilities and expenses are settled, and this process may take some time. To ensure funds are available for the founding conference, she will transfer £600k in tranches over the next couple of weeks. The first £200k is scheduled to be sent 12 November. \"All remaining funds will be transferred once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full.\" A Your Party spokesperson said: \"We are completely focused on putting together a successful founding conference for our members, so they can democratically decide Your Party's structures and programme, and Britain can get the socialist alternative it so badly needs. Hundreds of volunteers are working tirelessly on a shoestring budget to make this a reality, a testament to the grassroots power of our mass movement.\""

        "Content": "Princess Beatrice has made her first public charity appearance in the UK since her father, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, was stripped of his prince title. Beatrice was joined by TV weather presenter Laura Tobin in London at the laboratories of Borne, which funds research into how to prevent premature births. The pair toured the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where Beatrice gave birth to her youngest child Athena several weeks prematurely in January. She described the work of Borne as \"incredibly close and personal to me following the early arrival of my second daughter\". Athena weighed 4lb 5oz when she was born, while Tobin, an ambassador for the charity, gave birth to her daughter Charlotte three months early in 2017, weighing just 2lb 8oz. Beatrice's father Andrew is set to move from Royal Lodge in Windsor to the King's private Sandringham estate in Norfolk after he was banished from the Royal Family. The King took action on 6 November by stripping his younger brother of his birthright to be a prince and his dukedom over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

On Monday, Beatrice and Tobin met scientists and clinicians leading Borne's research, including projects investigating the causes of preterm labour, the role of inflammation in pregnancy and the development of new treatments to help prevent babies from being born too early. In a statement released to coincide with the visit, Beatrice, who became patron of Borne shortly after Athena was born, said: \"The work that Borne is undertaking is something that is incredibly close and personal to me following the early arrival of my second daughter. \"Today's visit was not only insightful but has given me so much hope for pregnant mothers in the UK that this topic is being taken incredibly seriously. \"As a patron of Borne, I am so grateful for the scientists and clinicians who took the time today to show me the advances they are making to reduce the risks to expectant mums and babies.\" Read more from Sky News:Congress summons Andrew over EpsteinGhislaine Maxwell 'appeals to Trump'How does Sandringham feel about Andrew?

Complications from prematurity remain the leading cause of neonatal death and lifelong disability, but less than 2% of medical research funding is dedicated to pregnancy and childbirth, it added. Beatrice and her sister Princess Eugenie remain princesses despite their father's new status."

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n Murder victim Muriel McKay, whose body was never found, has finally been officially declared dead 56 years after she was kidnapped for ransom. The ruling by a High Court judge will allow her family to pursue a new search for her remains - in the garden of an East London tailor's shop where the Kray twin gangsters had their suits made. Muriel's family believe her body was buried in the yard in Bethnal Green after it was dug up and moved from where her killers, brothers Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein, first hid her on their farm in Hertfordshire in 1969. The garden was behind a tailor's shop run by Percy Chaplin, whose customers included Arthur Hosein and Ronnie and Reggie Kray, who lived nearby. After Mr Chaplin died three years ago, his daughter Hayley Frais revealed her father's long-held suspicion that a criminal associate of the Hosein brothers buried the decomposing body behind his shop. The site is now occupied by a bookies and a block of flats and two leaseholders have refused the family permission to scan the yard. The judge, Chief Master Karen Shuman, issued a declaration that Muriel was presumed dead and granted her family letters of administration \"for the limited purpose of continuing the search for her body so that her remains can be laid to rest\".

We are very happy we now have the papers in place to get an injunction to allow us to scan the garden. Her son, Mark Dyer, Muriel's grandson, said: \"I hope we don't need to go to court again for an injunction, and that the leaseholders will now just let us do the scan to see if my grandmother's remains are there. \"All we want for now is four or five hours to do a non-invasive scan to let us know if it might be worth digging. And if we dig later, we will happily restore the site and plant it up with flowers.\" Muriel, 55, was the wife of Alick McKay, the deputy to newspaper mogul Rupert Murdoch when she was kidnapped by the Hosein brothers from her home in Wimbledon just after Christmas. They mistook Muriel for Murdoch's wife Anna and demanded a million pounds for her safe return. A phone box that stood outside the tailor's shop was one of the boxes used by the killers to receive instructions for picking up the ransom money. The Hosein brothers were arrested and convicted at the Old Bailey of Muriel's murder, one of the first murder trials without evidence of the victim's body, without ever revealing Muriel's fate. It was two years ago that Nizamodeen Hosein, freed from jail and living back in his native Trinidad, finally admitted that Muriel had collapsed and died from a heart attack while they held her at their farm. Earlier searches for her body at the farm were unsuccessful."

Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, met the Israeli prime minister in Jerusalem on Monday to discuss the progress and future of the ceasefire, according to an Israeli government official. During the last ceasefire agreement in January, International mediators were unable to bring the two parties back to the negotiating table to discuss the withdrawal of troops and the future governance of Gaza at the time. Mr Kushner, who was key in developing the White House plan to wind down the fighting in Gaza, is facing a similar challenge now, as it is unclear where Hamas and Israel stand on these key issues. \"Details are continuously being worked out about phase two, as we are still in phase one,\" the spokesperson for the Israeli government said after Mr Kushner met with Mr Netanyahu. The first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, which began on 10 October, has focused on stopping the fighting, releasing all hostages, and boosting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

The militant group also returned the remains of 24 hostages, with four bodies left to return under the terms of the ceasefire. The latest remains were released by Hamas on Sunday and have been identified as Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier killed in Gaza in 2014. He died two hours after a ceasefire took effect in that year's war between Israel and Hamas, and his family has campaigned to bring his body home for 11 years. His remains had been the only ones left in Gaza predating the current war between Israel and Hamas. For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has released the remains of 15 Palestinians, handing over 315 bodies so far.

The suspect, named Taleb A in line with German privacy laws, is accused of murdering five women aged between 45 and 75 years old and a nine-year-old boy during the attack, which lasted just over a minute on 20 December 2024. The 51-year-old Saudi-born defendant is also charged with attempting to murder 338 people and injuring 309 during the attack in Magdeburg, which is 150km (93 miles) southwest of Berlin. Prosecutors claim that during the rampage, which began at 7.02pm, Taleb A's rented BMW reached speeds of up to 29mph (48kph) as it crashed into crowds enjoying the festivities on the final Friday before Christmas. On the first day of the trial, the defendant blinked back tears during his 90-minute testimony as he talked about Andre Gleissner, the child he's accused of mowing down. Taleb A said he remembers having a vision of a child as he was driving through the market.

The suspect was seen repeatedly blowing his nose as the court heard descriptions of the aftermath of the attack, including survivors being left with brain injuries and a pregnant woman giving birth prematurely. Dressed in a blue T-shirt and black top, former psychiatrist Taleb A stated his testimony of the evening would take \"hours if not days\".

He also rejected an assessment by a forensic expert that he is a narcissist. \"I don't want other foreigners to be disadvantaged because of what I did,\" the defendant told the court, as he switched between displays of remorse and discussions of political conspiracy. Some of the plaintiffs turned their bodies away from the defendant as he made his speech. Others sat with their heads in their hands, refusing to look at Taleb A, as he ranted about the \"left-right wing\" divide, migration and refugee organisations. At the time of his arrest, officials said he was an \"untypical\" attacker with the then interior minister alleging he was Islamophobic. A refugee from Saudi Arabia, Taleb A described himself as an \"ex-Muslim\". His social media pages, which he posted on in the hours leading up to the attack, promoted anti-Islam views - and claimed Germany was allowing the \"Islamisation of Europe\". He also showed support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AFD), suggesting they were both fighting to protect Germany.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n The biggest climate meeting of the year opened in Brazil on Monday aiming to bring countries together, amid a difficult global backdrop of backlash to climate policies in Europe and an absent United States. Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned of those who \"sow hatred, spread fear, and attack institutions, science, and universities\". \"It is time to impose a new defeat on denialists,\" he told countries gathered for COP30 in the Amazonian city of Belem. Read more: Britons still buying green tech despite attacks  It was a veiled attack on the likes of US President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a \"hoax\", and emboldened populist parties in Europe and the UK that are attacking climate policies and questioning science. UN climate chief Simon Stiell told negotiators on Monday: \"Your job is to fight this climate crisis together.\" Outwardly, countries were unphased that the US president is skipping the talks on climate change - despite being the largest historical emitter. After all, the other 194 countries are still signed up, Brazil pointed out yesterday. But Mr Trump's shadow still hangs over the summit, and some diplomats who want more action on fossil fuels privately expressed nervousness that his team could still stand in the way. Last month, he successfully sank a proposed shipping levy after threatening sanctions and visa restrictions on those who backed it. Germany's environment state secretary Jochen Flasbarth was asked whether Mr Trump might try the same tactics at COP30. \"I don't think so. But we'll have to wait and see,\" he replied. He said a broader conference like this was less likely to worry the US president than the shipping levy, which would have been legally binding.  Fossil fuels versus clean energy COP30 host nation Brazil, itself a major oil producer, says it wants to use the summit to map out how to end dependence on oil, coal and gas. Two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, countries set a vague target to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels - but there's been little progress since. As the US seeks to lock countries into using its oil and gas for longer, China is forging ahead, building most of the solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles of the future, while still chugging coal itself. The president of this year's conference, Andre Correa do Lago, said: \"Emerging countries are appearing in this COP with a different role. China is coming with solutions for everyone.\" UN climate chief Mr Stiell also talked up China's renewable power push. \"Clean energy is the trend of our time, President Xi of China said.\" German minister Mr Flasbarth said he had been to China, which is currently the world's largest polluter, three times in the last few months.  Although China's leader Xi Jinping also stayed at home, officials sent in his place talked up climate policies. But 19 US states still have net zero targets, and Democratic politicians are arriving in Belem this week to nail their colours to the climate mast. California senator Josh Becker said in a briefing: \"Donald Trump does not speak for all Americans.\" He added: \"Yes, I think he will try to influence the talks. But we're going to continue to move forward.\" Read more:Why US may soon have real energy emergencyTrump urged to involve US in climate change fightCOP's potential for change limited by those absentAre climate summits saving the world - or just hot air? 'Symbol of devastation' Unamay Gordon, principal director of climate change for the Jamaican government, said: \"I know that the subnational governments from the US will be here on the ground as well, and accountability has to come at all levels.\" Jamaica is still picking up the pieces from the deadly Hurricane Melissa that slammed into its coastlines two weeks ago, which was intensified by climate change.  Ms Gordon said the country has become \"the world's symbol of climate devastation\". An alliance of island countries, including Jamaica, will use COP30 to try to force countries to respond to a recent warning that the world is due to warm by levels that could push their lands underwater. The summit is also hoped to launch various initiatives to protect and fund indigenous peoples, who are finally being recognised and rewarded for being the best guardians of their land."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n  A Gen Z uprising has pushed Madagascar's former leader Andry Rajoelina, not only out of office but out of the country. In his place is Colonel Michael Randrianirina, who was sworn in as president of the island nation last month after his military unit joined the protesters. Sky News' Africa correspondent Yousra Elbagir sits down with the new leader.  The first question I ask Colonel Randrianirina, as he sits in an ornate mahogany chair in his military fatigues, is how it feels to be in the palace as president. He sighs and sinks deeper into the chair. He looks humbled and struggles to find the words. \"How do I put it?\" he says. \"I am happy and it is also a great honour to have come to this palace to be able to help and support the Malagasy people in deep poverty.\" As commander of an elite non-combatant military unit, Corps d'Administration des Personnels et des Services de l'Armée de Terre (CAPSAT), the colonel rode a wave of Gen Z protests to the palace. On 11 October, he shared a video on social media instructing officers to disobey shoot-to-kill orders and support the movement. \n                  Madagascar's president has left the country, says opposition leader\n                 \n                  Madagascar president says coup under way as soldiers join protesters\n                 \n                  Thousands of endangered tortoises rescued from floods in Madagascar after Cyclone Dikeledi\n                 At least 22 protesters have been killed and more than 100 injured after denouncing the power cuts and water shortages that have come to signify government corruption in the impoverished island nation. Why did he share the pivotal video? He says: \"I am a military officer but I am also part of the people and I will return to the people. When you feel sorry for what the people are suffering from... they have been poor for so long and wealth has been looted - but you still shoot them and kill them. That was not why I entered the military of Madagascar, to kill people.\" Soon after his speech, soldiers allowed the young protesters rejecting then president Andry Rajoelina to occupy Place du 13 Mai Square on Independence Avenue in the heart of Antananarivo, the island nation's capital.  Colonel Randrianirina paraded through a crowd and addressed them from the hatch of an armoured vehicle. \"The president of the nation has to leave… If that does not happen,\" he threatened, \"we will see\". After Mr Rajoelina fled Madagascar on 13 October, the National Assembly voted to impeach him for \"desertion of duty\". Three days later, Colonel Randrianirina stood in fatigues in front of the palace. With officers by his side, he announced their seizure of power and the dissolution of the constitution and all government institutions outside of the National Assembly. Shortly after, the African Union suspended Madagascar's membership on account of the military takeover. In the palace as president, he insists that this is not a military coup. \"It is support for the people and the country and for us to not be prone to civil war - between the people - between the military officers and your needs, so you adjust helping to support the people to avoid this. \"We were not conducting any coup at all, it was the president [Rajoelina] himself who decided to leave the country.\" United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned \"the unconstitutional change of government in Madagascar\" and called for \"the return to constitutional order and the rule of law,\" when reports of a military takeover first circulated on 16 October. The day we met the new president, he had just been congratulated by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Colonel Randrianirina is promising elections in 18 to 24 months, after what he calls a \"refoundation and recovery\" of the country - a process he admits might take a long time. Observers are concerned that elections will be postponed and the new president will become another strongman, but Gen Z organisers are holding on to faith that this hard-earned outcome is worth it. 'We were living under a dictatorship' I asked a group of five young organisers if they have concerns that the president will become another dictator, just like previous Malagasy rulers who ascended to power off the back of a popular uprising. Ousted president Mr Rajoelina came into power after protests in 2009 that also ended in a CAPSAT-supported coup. University student Ratsirarisoa Nomena told us: \"The new president is not a dictator... he is listening to the people and he is validated by the people. \"We as students also validated him - he is not a dictator because the motivation of the army is from the people for the people. \"We were living under dictatorship. There was no freedom of expression and it was very hard to fight for that in Madagascar. We had to face being injured and losing our lives and the lives of our fellow students. Malagasy citizens who fought with us lost their lives too. This is what we went through - to me, we are halfway to victory.\" Their president is aware of their support and does not credit Gen Z alone for his place in the palace. \"Generation Z are part of the reason [I am here] but the full Malagasy people really wanted change at the time we are speaking,\" Mr Randrianirina told me. \"The Malagasy people have been suffering for so long and deprived of fundamental rights - no access to water supply and electricity, facing insecurity. \"Malagasy people, including the Gen Z, government officials and trade unions really wanted change so it is the whole Malagasy people that supported me to this point.\" Read more from Sky News:Ex-jihadist Syrian president to meet TrumpTwo dead as Super Typhoon hits PhilippinesUK deploying specialist RAF team to defend Belgium from 'rogue' drones Across Africa, young people are showing their disapproval of the old guard. Gen Z protesters have made their mark in Tanzania, Kenya, Cameroon, Morocco, Mozambique and Nigeria in 2025 alone - denouncing disputed elections and the corruption impacting their futures. Is the Gen Z coup of Madagascar a warning for old leaders on a young continent? \"I don't know what to say about the other countries, but I know my own country,\" Mr Randrianirina says. \"If tomorrow the people of Madagascar hate me, then I will leave this palace.\""

        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @alexrossiSKY\n  It is a moment few could have imagined just a few years ago but the Syrian president, Ahmed al Sharaa, has arrived in Washington for a landmark series of meetings, which will culminate in a face-to-face with Donald Trump at the White House. His journey to this point is a remarkable story, and it's a tale of how one man went from being a jihadist battlefield commander to a statesman on the global stage - now being welcomed by the world's most powerful nation. Mr Sharaa became leader of Syria after the fall of the Bashar al Assad regime in December last year. Before that he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al Jolani. During Syria's brutal civil war, he was the leader of the Nusra Front - a designated terror organisation, the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. Back then, the thought of him setting foot on US soil and meeting a US president would have been unthinkable. There was a $10m reward for information leading to his capture. So what is going on? Why is diplomacy being turned on its head? After 14 years of conflict which started during the so-called Arab Spring, Syria is in a mess. Mr Sharaa - as the head of the transitional government - is seen by the US as having the greatest chance of holding the country together and stopping it from falling back into civil war and failed state territory. But to do that, Syria has to emerge from its pariah status and that's what the US is gambling on and why it's inclined to offer its support and a warm embrace. By endorsing Mr Sharaa, it is hoping he will shed his past and emerge as a leader for everyone and unite the country. Holding him close also means it's less likely that Iran and Russia will again be able to gain a strong strategic foothold in the country. So, a man who was once an enemy of the US is now being feted as a potential ally. There are big questions, though. He has rejected his extremist background, saying he did what he did because of the circumstances of the civil war. But since he took power, there have been sectarian clashes. In July, fighting broke out between Druze armed groups and Bedouin tribal fighters in Sweida. It was a sign of just how fragile the country remains and also raises concerns about his ability to be a leader for everyone.  Read more:Two dead as Super Typhoon hits PhilippinesUK deploying specialist RAF team to defend Belgium from 'rogue' drones Nonetheless, Mr Sharaa is viewed as the best chance of stabilising Syria and by extension an important part of the Middle East. Get Syria right, the logic goes, and the rest of the jigsaw will be easier to put and hold together. The visit to Washington is highly significant and historic. It's the first-ever official visit by a Syrian head of state since the country's independence in 1946.  The meeting with Donald Trump is, though, the really big deal. The two men met in Riyadh in May but in the meeting later today they will discuss lifting sanctions - crucial to Syria's post-war reconstruction - how Syria can help in the fight against Islamic State, and a possible pathway to normalisation of relations with Israel. The optics will be fascinating as the US continues to engage with a former militant with jihadi links. It's a risk, but if successful, it could reshape Syria's role in the region from US enemy to strong regional ally."

But the White House has been coy about whether other representatives like negotiators will attend. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Sky News: \"The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his common sense energy agenda - which is focused on utilising the liquid gold under our feet to strengthen our grid stability and drive down costs for American families and businesses. \"President Trump will not jeopardise our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n It's been three decades of COP talks - and as most of the climate metrics get worse, questions about whether the summits are working have become impossible to ignore. This year, approximately 40,000 people are flying in to Belém in Brazil for COP30 - back in the country that hosted the landmark Rio Earth Summit in 1992. At the time, it was the biggest gathering of world leaders ever. It spawned a slew of treaties and documents that committed countries to growing economies in ways that also protected the environment: a blueprint for a brighter, greener future - or so they thought. That included the world's first-ever global climate treaty, the UNFCCC, which underpins the COP process and promised to \"protect the climate system for present and future generations\". \"There was, I think, a general atmosphere of hope that this was the start of a process which could make a real difference,\" said Michael Howard, Britain's then environment secretary who attended Rio 1992, and later Conservative party leader. But despite 29 rounds of COP negotiations, the natural world that Rio pledged to protect is gasping for air. Same stage, hotter planet Annual greenhouse gas emissions are now a staggering 65% higher than they were in 1990. And the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased at the highest rate on record last year. In France in 2015, some 20 COPs after the Rio Earth Summit, leaders struck the Paris Agreement - a landmark pact to limit warming ideally to 1.5C above levels in pre-industrial times. But today, just 10 years later, global average temperatures are already approximately 1.4C warmer, snapping at the heels of the Paris goal. Ban Ki-moon, who was head of the United Nations when the world signed the Paris Agreement, told Sky News it was a \"moment of triumph\". But the \"problem is that after the agreement, the member states' vision\" in putting it into practice has been very different. \"Some countries were very active, some countries didn't pay much attention.\" Those higher temperatures are fanning the flames of extreme weather, like Hurricane Melissa that killed and destroyed in the Caribbean just two weeks before COP30 starts today. In 2024, that kind of climate damage cost £1trn globally, according to BloombergNEF. It said the \"primary reason\" for the rising costs is an \"increase in intensity and frequency of events\". What the Paris Agreement and COP have achieved But that's not to say COPs haven't achieved anything. They have. Defenders of \"the process\" point out that - before the 2015 Paris Agreement - warming was on course for about 4C by the end of the century. Now, it's roughly 2.8C. That's still bad. It could collapse parts of the Amazon rainforest that is hosting this year's COP30 - but it's progress. The Paris pact also stimulated a growth spurt in renewable energy, which this year provided more electricity than coal for the first time ever. And it triggered a wave of net zero targets, which now cover at least 77% of global GDP - albeit of varying degrees of quality. \"That is an absolute transformation,\" the UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News before COP30. The \"reason we need\" the COP summits is because it brings together 195 countries across the world, he said. \"How are you going to do this without working together? You can't go it alone to tackle the climate crisis.\" Deforestation is slowing - so still raging, but at a slower pace. And the amount of planet-warming gas we emit in proportion to the amount we grow our economies is falling - in other words, we are emitting less per pound or dollar of GDP. But Ian Hall, climate professor at Cardiff University, said these \"limited signs of progress\" are \"modest compared to the scale and speed of change needed\". He added: \"Urgent, systemic action is essential to avoid the worst impacts.\" If the world warms by around 2.8C as expected, scientists expect most of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets would melt, bits of the Amazon would turn into savannas, and millions of people would migrate from their homelands that have become too hot, too fierce or flooded for good.  \"On the islands, we get all of it,\" said Surangel Whipps Jr, president of tiny island nation Palau in the west Pacific. \"We're just waiting for the next storm. We're waiting for the next sea level rise to destroy our crops. We're waiting for the drought... This is the reality that we live in.\" Laurie Laybourn, executive director of the Strategic Climate Risks Initiative, said the COPs need to start focusing more on how to cope with this kind of \"escalating danger\". \"That means greater attention on making societies more resilient, otherwise climate-induced chaos could derail them from decarbonising, which will make climate change worse, meaning more chaos and more derailment.\" Read more:Why COP30 is so controversial2025 set to be among hottest ever Bombshell letter confronts image problem A bombshell letter during last year's COP in Azerbaijan - signed by climate heavyweights including former UN chief Ban Ki-moon - warned the conference was \"no longer fit for purpose\". It landed days after host president Ilham Aliyev had boasted about his country's abundant gas being \"a gift from God\". The signatories said the summits had become co-opted by fossil fuel interests and bogged down by a slow progress and unwieldy size. Johan Rockstrom, a prominent climate scientist who signed that letter, told Sky News it's time to switch from \"beautiful statements\" that \"nobody delivers upon\" to holding each other accountable for what's already been promised.  Others are giving up on COP altogether. Dr Jennifer Allan, senior lecturer in global environmental politics at Cardiff University, has \"defended COPs in the past, and still think they can do good\". But now she feels \"complicit in the myth\" that COP can save the world, and in the \"carbon footprint that accompanies these huge MegaCOPs\". \"The same arguments go round and round, masked beneath legal technicalities. It all feels very disconnected from the real world.\" Conscious of COP's image problem, UN climate chief Simon Stiell has asked a crack squad to work out how to reform the process, but while still keeping all countries on side.  The loudest defenders The COP summits were designed in a wildly different era of the 1990s, a spell of relative peace and cooperation, like at the Rio Earth Summit, like the integration of countries after the fall of the Soviet Union. Today there are more conflicts - 184 in 2024 compared with 118 in 1992 - fuelling a rise in defence spending. Meanwhile the impacts of climate change the world was too slow to curb are hitting hard and costing a fortune. Questions about whether multilateralism can survive this dog not just the COP talks but the entire United Nations. Those involved in COP seem to be circling round the idea that there is no more need for beautifully worded statements - like on \"transitioning away from fossil fuels\" at COP28 in Dubai - but just to get on with delivering what's already been promised. But that will make it harder to communicate COP30 as a success. COP30 CEO Ana Toni seemed unphased yesterday. She told journalists that 194 countries are coming - and that shows multilateralism is alive and well. It is the countries most endangered by a changing climate that defend the process the loudest. They say it's one of the few forums where they have an equal seat at the table with major economies like China, Brazil and Russia. Palauan president Mr Whipps said: \"It is very costly, and it's very far to come to these events. But if we don't come, there's nobody out there to defend the most vulnerable.\" He gives the example of Palau's big sister in the Pacific, Australia, which was pressured by the COP process to up its emissions-cutting target from 26% to 43% by 2030. \"That's why we feel it's important for us that our voice be heard.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn over edits the organisation made last year to one of his speeches. The organisation has been engulfed in a crisis, forced to apologise on Monday after two of its most senior figures, including the director-general, resigned on Sunday night. The defamation claim centres around a BBC Panorama documentary, which aired October 2024 and showed an edited speech made by Mr Trump before the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in which he appeared to tell his supporters he was going to walk with them to the US Capitol and \"fight like hell\". In a letter dated 9 November, Florida-based lawyer Alejandro Brito set the BBC a deadline of 10pm UK time on Friday to respond, outlining three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president He told the BBC it needed to \"comply\" or face being sued for $1bn. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\" 'Error of judgement' On Monday, BBC chairman Samir Shah, one of the most senior figures still standing, apologised for the \"error of judgement\" in editing the video. In a letter to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of MPs, Mr Shah said Mr Trump's speech was edited in a way that gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action\". \"The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" he added.  Director-general and head of BBC News resign Concerns about the edited speech first came to light in a leaked memo from Michael Prescott, a former journalist and independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board. As a result, BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness announced their resignations on Sunday evening, saying in emails to staff that mistakes had been made. Mr Davie will address an all-staff meeting on Tuesday. While on her way into the Broadcasting House on Monday morning, Ms Turness defended the corporation, rejecting accusations of institutional bias.  Downing St stands by BBC - but chancellor says 'lessons to be learned' A spokesperson for the prime minister told reporters on Monday that the BBC wasn't corrupt or institutionally biased. Instead, they said it had a \"vital role\" to play in the modern age, but needed to ensure it acted \"to maintain trust and correct mistakes quickly when they occur\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves also stood by the corporation, but said that \"lessons do need to be learned\". 'Nothing but an apology' Veteran broadcaster and former BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby told Sky News, however, that the organisation owed the US president nothing more than an apology.  But former legal correspondent for the BBC Joshua Rozenberg also told Sky News that he believed the corporation would \"very likely\" consider settling with Trump.

Monday's meeting came after Syria launched raids against Islamic State cells.

The bill would prohibit federal agencies from firing employees until 30 January, a win for federal worker unions and their allies. It comes as at least 300,000 employees are expected to leave the government by the end of this year due to Mr Trump's downsizing effort. What is a government shutdown? A shutdown of the federal government means that all non-essential functions of government are frozen. This will affect everything from social security to air travel to national park access. Federal agencies are dependent on funding being approved by Congress to allow the president to sign budget legislation for the fiscal year ahead. If they can't approve funding (because of political differences - and America is of course bitterly divided) then those agencies are forced to shut down. This means that workers cannot go to work and are not paid."

It did not take long for the White House to react - and that's unsurprising given that the resignations were driven, on the face of it at least, by the BBC's splicing together of that Trump speech from January 2021. It was clear on Friday that the White House was keen to weigh in on the BBC row, with the White House press secretary using an interview with The Daily Telegraph to criticise the BBC. \"This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom,\" Karoline Leavitt told the newspaper. BBC chairman expected to apologise to MPs - follow latest After last night's resignations, Mr Trump posted a lengthy statement on Truth Social. \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught \"doctoring\" my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th,\" he wrote. \"Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\" It was the Telegraph that leaked the internal memo last week, in which it was revealed that a BBC Panorama report - aired just before the election last year - had spliced together two parts of a long Trump speech which he made on 6 January 2021. That was the day of the storming of the Capitol building in Washington by Trump supporters who believed the 2020 election had been stolen by Joe Biden. Mr Trump gave a speech that day. In a Panorama report broadcast just before the US election last year, the BBC aired a clip from the speech.  The following is the transcript of that clip. \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol and I'll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\" The clip was presented as one sentence - one thought. However, it was actually two distinct parts of the speech spliced together, reordered and covered with pictures of the crowd to hide the join - known as the edit point or cut. Had the Panorama production team not edited the clip, this is what viewers would have heard. The sections used by Panorama are in bold for clarity. \"After this, we're going to walk down - and I'll be there with you - we're gonna walk down, we're gonna walk down anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave congressmen and women, and we probably not gonna be cheering so much for some of them. Because you're never going to take back our country with weakness you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing, and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated. I know that everyone will soon be marching down to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" The \"fight like hell\" line came about an hour later - right at the end of the speech. Here it is in full. Again, the section used by Panorama are in bold for clarity. \"And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can't have happened. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavours have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country. And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come. So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol. The Democrats are hopeless, they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America.\" The riot at the Capitol building unfolded that afternoon. Read more:'Teflon Tim' has finally come unstuckIn full: The BBC resignation lettersPast controversies faced by Tim Davie  The president and his team have always claimed the \"fight like hell\" comment was purely rhetorical, and they have dismissed accusations that Mr Trump encouraged the unrest. Trump's alleged role in the unrest and his broader efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election were the subject of a federal criminal case. The president was indicted on four felony counts. The case was dismissed by federal prosecutors following his 2024 election victory because of a long-standing policy that prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents. But in a final report released last January, federal prosecutor Jack Smith said he believed there was enough evidence to convict Mr Trump in a trial had it happened. There is a legitimate and enduring debate over Mr Trump's role in the events of 6 January. But that does not in any way explain or excuse the BBC's decision to splice together and reorder two distinct parts of the president's speech."

The president's former chief of staff Mark Meadows was also pardoned, alongside conservative attorneys Sidney Powell and John Eastman, a Justice Department official revealed. Ed Martin, the government's pardon attorney, posted a signed proclamation of the \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardon on social media. The pardon explicitly does not extend to Mr Trump, according to the proclamation. Presidential pardons only apply to federal crimes, and none of those pardoned were charged in federal cases. But pardons can be pre-emptive, taking effect before legal proceedings have started. Mr Trump has long disputed the results of the 2020 presidential race, which saw Joe Biden elected president. But the move underscores President Donald Trump's continued efforts to promote the idea that the 2020 election was stolen from him even though courts around the country and U.S. officials found no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. Mr Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, was prominent among those resisting the result, making multiple false fraud allegations in a bid to overturn the outcome.

Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, revealed her intentions in an email with the subject \"commutation application\" sent to her lawyer Leaf Saffian, and reviewed by Sky's US partner NBC News. \"I am struggling to keep it all together as it is big and there are so many attachments,\" Maxwell wrote in the email. Now President Trump is facing pressure to rule out an early release for the 63-year-old, who was sentenced in 2022 for sex trafficking. Maxwell recruited young girls for her former boyfriend, billionaire paedophile Epstein, during the 1990s and early 2000s. In a letter to the president, representative Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded answers over Maxwell's planned appeal to Mr Trump. He also hit out at perks she's reportedly receiving while in prison. \"You should not grant any form of clemency to this convicted and unrepentant sex offender,\" Mr Raskin wrote. \"Your administration should not be providing her with room service, with puppies to play with, with federal law enforcement officials waiting on her every need, or with any special treatment or institutional privilege at all.\" Where is Maxwell behind bars? Maxwell was moved from a low-security facility in Florida to Federal Prison Camp, Bryan, in August. The latter, in Texas, is an all-female institution where inmates convicted of non-violent or white-collar crimes sleep in dormitory-style quarters.

Within days of arriving, Maxwell gushed in emails about her new surroundings. \"The food is legions better, the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite,\" she wrote in one email seen by NBC News. She added: \"I am much much happier here and more importantly safe.\" 'Concierge-style' treatment A whistleblower told Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee she was getting \"concierge-style\" treatment at the camp, with customised meals, after-hours access to exercise facilities, and time to play with a puppy. A top official at the camp complained he is \"sick of having to be Maxwell's bitch\", according to the whistleblower, who has not been identified. Mr Raskin has now requested that Mr Blanche appear for a public congressional hearing to discuss the revelations. NBC News has reached out to Maxwell's lawyer for comment. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration \"does not comment on potential clemency requests. As President Trump has stated, pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something he has thought about\". Maxwell was convicted on five sex trafficking-related counts in 2021. She appealed the conviction but the Supreme Court rejected her challenge in early October. 👉 Tap here to follow Trump100 wherever you get your podcasts👈 Asked at the time if he would pardon her, Mr Trump said: \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it.\" He added: \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider, I don't know anything about it.\" Meanwhile, the Trump administration has granted a \"full, complete, and unconditional pardon\" to dozens of individuals, including his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Epstein killed himself in a New York City jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has urged Donald Trump to return to global efforts to fight climate change. The White House has claimed \"climate goals\" are \"killing other countries and would have killed America\" without Mr Trump's intervention. Speaking to Sky News before the COP30 climate talks, which start today in Brazil, Mr Ban said: \"The climate crisis does not care where you are living, [whether in] United States or China or European countries. \"If we live together, we all live. If we die, we all die together.\" He called it \"deeply regrettable\" that the US - which is the \"most powerful, most resourceful, and most influential country\" - is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time. The landmark pact, struck at COP21 in 2015, is the world's most significant and only legally binding climate treaty. It aims to limit warming to 1.5C-2C above pre-industrial levels, and obliges countries to produce climate plans every five years detailing how they will deliver on their share of the bargain. \n                  COP30: Climate summit kicks off with plea to work together - despite Trump-shaped hole\n                 \n                  COP30: Are climate summits saving the world - or just hot air?\n                 \n                  COP's potential for change limited not by who turned up, but by the elephants not in the room\n                 Yesterday, the COP30 host team of Brazilians said 108 have now been submitted - meaning more than a third are still missing. Mr Ban, who was UN chief at the time of the Paris talks, said rich Western states, not just America, need to step up. \"They must show their strongest possible leadership and the number one priority. This is only one earth we have. We don't have any other place to move.\" The former UN chief now heads up the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens, which works with decision-makers to implement the Paris Agreement and UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The US is the world's biggest economy and the second-largest climate polluter after China.

That's my honest appeal to the United States president.\" President Trump is not sending any \"high-level\" officials to COP30. But the White House has been coy about whether other representatives like negotiators will attend. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Sky News: \"The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his common sense energy agenda - which is focused on utilising the liquid gold under our feet to strengthen our grid stability and drive down costs for American families and businesses. \"President Trump will not jeopardise our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.\""

The world's largest spirits maker, which counts Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky among its stable of brands, said he would assume the role in January. The search for a new boss began in July when Debra Crew was effectively ousted after two years in charge. Money latest: BA partnership with Musk's Starlink The company's share price fell 40% during her tenure as the industry grappled a drastic decline in the number of people drinking at home following the COVID pandemic and, more recently, the US trade war. A planned fightback by Ms Crew was seen by investors as failing to go far enough.

Diageo's market positions have fared better than rivals during the downturn but its shares are still hovering around lows not seen for a decade. Only last week, the company downgraded its sales and profit outlook for next year. Diageo chair John Manzoni told investors: \"The Board unanimously felt that Dave has both the extensive CEO experience, and the proven leadership skills in building and marketing world-leading brands, that is right for Diageo at this time.\" Sir Dave said of the task facing him: \"Diageo is a world leading business with a portfolio of very strong brands, and I am delighted to be joining the team. \"The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities. I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value.\" Diageo shares were 7% up on news of the appointment. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, responded: \"Lewis brings deep experience in consumer brands from his time leading Tesco and decades at Unilever, though he lacks direct exposure to the spirits industry. \"Investors may welcome his strong marketing pedigree, but any major strategic reset will take time, leaving near-term focus on navigating tough trading conditions.\"  "

The two-child benefit cap has proved a major sticking point for Labour since they won a landslide election victory last year.

Feelings around it remain strong in the party, but it would mean finding billions of pounds when the chancellor is already scrambling for savings - and the policy is generally popular with the public. The latest YouGov polling found 59% of the public are in favour of keeping the cap in place, and only 26% thought it should be abolished."

It comes as at least 300,000 employees are expected to leave the government by the end of this year due to Mr Trump's downsizing effort. What is a government shutdown? A shutdown of the federal government means that all non-essential functions of government are frozen. This will affect everything from social security to air travel to national park access. Federal agencies are dependent on funding being approved by Congress to allow the president to sign budget legislation for the fiscal year ahead. If they can't approve funding (because of political differences - and America is of course bitterly divided) then those agencies are forced to shut down. This means that workers cannot go to work and are not paid."

        "Headline": "Ms Sultana has sole control of Your Party donations - the party she set up with Jeremy Corbyn in July. She has agreed to transfer £600k in tranches - but party sources say they want the full amount. ",
        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Donations being held by Zarah Sultana will be transferred over to Your Party in tranches from this week, Sky News has been told, but the party stand-off remains. Ms Sultana has sole control of a company holding over £800,000 of Your Party donations following an internal fallout. Her spokesperson told Sky News £600k would be transferred over in three tranches starting with £200k from Wednesday, and the rest \"once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full\". But a Your Party source told Sky News she should transfer the full £800k worth of donations now. Politics Live: Another migrant deported to France returns to UK on small boat It follows a major row over finances behind the scenes of the new left-wing party, which Ms Sultana co-launched with Jeremy Corbyn in July. At the time, a company called MOU Operations was used to collect donations, with the idea this would be transferred over to Your Party once it was formally registered with the Electoral Commission. \n                  Rachel Reeves signals she will break tax pledges - and gives strongest indication she will lift two-child cap\n                 \n                  UK's Prevent counter-terrorism strategy 'is no longer keeping the country safe', commission warns \n                 \n                  Politics latest: Chancellor Rachel Reeves all but admits she will break Labour's manifesto commitments on tax\n                 The registration happened on 30 September, but no transfer of funds has been made - despite Ms Sultana stepping in to take ownership of MOU last month after its previous three directors quit. It is understood MOU is also holding around £500k in fees collected as part of Ms Sultana's unauthorised membership launch, which caused a major row in September and is now being investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office. The Your Party source told Sky News that Ms Sultana has been told Your Party can't accept that money due to legal risks and accused her of trying to \"offload\" it.  How did we get here? Ms Sultana agreed to take over MOU to break a standoff between Your Party and the company's previous three directors - former Labour MP Beth Winter, former Labour mayor Jamie Driscoll and former South African politician Andrew Feinstein. The trio set up MOU in April to assist with a new left-wing party centred around Mr Corbyn but resigned on 29 October, claiming the role of holding donations had been \"thrust upon\" them and raising concerns about a \"lack of appropriate governance\" within Your Party. The former directors said they wanted Your Party to take full control of MOU because of worries around liabilities but five of the six founding MPs refused. Ms Sultana said her stepping in would \"bring the chapter to a close\" and \"these resources will now be used for Your Party, as was always intended\". Her allies have dismissed \"hostile briefings\" suggesting she is deliberately withholding the money, insisting she has been conducting \"due diligence\" before sending it over. Sky News understands Ms Sultana has been seeking Your Party's constitution and financial scheme as registered with the Electoral Commission, to help her understand the party's governing structures. A source close to her claims there has been an unwillingness to share the documents from within Your Party, so she has requested them from the elections watchdog directly. It is not clear who wrote the documents and who is controlling access to them - or why one of the party's founders should not be able to see them. 'Low trust environment' However one Your Party source described operating in a \"low trust environment\" since the membership fiasco, despite public efforts to patch things up, Senior Your Party figures have accused Ms Sultana of deliberately withholding MOU's funds for political leverage. Organisers expressed frustration at operating on a \"shoestring\" ahead of the founding conference at the end of this month.  A spokesperson for Ms Sultana said: \"Zarah did not choose to become the sole director of MOU Operations Limited, but was prepared to take on this responsibility to ensure funds are transferred as quickly as possible and preparations for the founding conference can progress. \"As sole director, she is legally responsible for ensuring the company's costs, liabilities and expenses are settled, and this process may take some time. To ensure funds are available for the founding conference, she will transfer £600k in tranches over the next couple of weeks. The first £200k is scheduled to be sent 12 November. \"All remaining funds will be transferred once the company's costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full.\" A Your Party spokesperson said: \"We are completely focused on putting together a successful founding conference for our members, so they can democratically decide Your Party's structures and programme, and Britain can get the socialist alternative it so badly needs. Hundreds of volunteers are working tirelessly on a shoestring budget to make this a reality, a testament to the grassroots power of our mass movement.\""

        "Content": "MPs have joined a campaign calling for 15 penguins \"trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air\" in central London to be released. A group of 75 politicians has described their captivity at the Sea Life London Aquarium - a stone's throw from the Houses of Parliament - as \"un-British\". The aquarium, in the County Hall building on the South bank, opposite the London Eye, first launched its exhibit of gentoo penguins in May 2011, and campaigners are arguing they \"have now endured 14 years\" in a small space with a pool just 2.1m (7ft) deep. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds has been asked to \"consider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioural, ecological and physiological needs\". David Taylor - the Labour MP for Hemel Hempstead - coordinated the letter and said the campaign \"won't stop until these penguins get the life they deserve\". He added: \"No animal should live like that, with their rights appearing to be traded for hard cash.\" Pressure has been building in recent weeks on Merlin Entertainments, the company that owns the aquarium, as well as attractions including Alton Towers and Madame Tussauds. \n                  Murder victim Muriel McKay officially declared dead more than 50 years after she was kidnapped\n                 \n                  Areece Lloyd-Hall sentenced for New Year's Eve murder of 16-year-old Harry Pitman\n                 \n                  London crime crackdown as over 140 people arrested including phone thieves and upskirter\n                 Environmentalist Feargal Sharkey recently challenged its chief executive Fiona Eastwood to \"swap places with the penguins\", in an \"old council building\", for a month. \"It's idiotic. It's a nonsense, and it's got to stop,\" he warned. Meanwhile, naturalist Chris Packham - who attended a protest outside the aquarium last month - described it as a \"blight on the reputation of London's attractions\". A petition launched by the Freedom for Animals campaign group has now received more than 37,000 signatures - with Born Free saying at least two of the birds have never seen the sky. But a spokesperson for Merlin's conversation team said the current enclosure represents the penguins' natural habitat - and is on the ground floor rather than the basement. A statement added: \"We know that many people care deeply about the gentoo penguins at Sea Life London Aquarium - we do too. \"We have an incredible team of conservationists, animal welfare specialists, and aquarists who are with the penguins every day, making sure they're healthy and thriving. \"And we don't do this alone - we work with some of the best penguin experts in the world, including vets and specialists in penguin behaviour and habitat design.\" Read more from Sky News:Trump threatens to sue BBC for $1bnWorst areas for uninsured driving revealed Merlin went on to say that \"Penguin Point\" was built to replicate their natural environment, with climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air. \"These are things that can't easily be replicated outdoors and releasing them into the wild simply isn't a safe option for these penguins, who have always lived in human care.\" The company added that the penguins' care is a \"complex issue\" and every decision about their welfare is taken seriously. \"We're open. We're listening. And we've always done what's right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That's a commitment we stand by.\" A DEFRA spokesperson didn't address the Sea Life London Aquarium specifically, but said: \"This government is committed to the highest standards of animal welfare. \"We recently launched an overhaul of welfare standards in zoos to strengthen protections and ensure all animals - including gentoo penguins - are cared for in line with best practice.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n Amid serious concerns over the editorial mistakes made by the BBC, the downfall of its leaders has been greeted with undisguised glee by many on the right of British politics. So far, the only British political leader prepared to mount an outspoken defence of the BBC is Sir Ed Davey. The Liberal Democrat argues that seeing the White House take credit for Mr Davie's downfall - and attacking the BBC - \"should worry us all\". He's called on the PM and all British political leaders to stand united in \"telling Trump to keep his hands off it\". Given the diplomatic contortions Sir Keir Starmer has gone through to develop close relations with the current president, this seems entirely unlikely. But for a prime minister already juggling an overflowing in-tray of problems, controversy over the national broadcaster as the government prepares to enter negotiations about renewing its charter for the next decade is another political tripwire in waiting. Former prime minister Liz Truss was quick off the mark to retweet gloating posts from Donald Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt with clapping emojis. Ms Truss argued not just for the abolition of the licence fee, but for the end of nationalised broadcasting altogether. Her former cabinet colleague Suella Braverman has also called for the licence fee to be scrapped. It's an idea long advocated by Nadine Dorries during her time as culture secretary. The recent Reform convert is particularly pessimistic about the BBC's future - telling me she believes its \"core bias\" has worsened in recent years. \"I'm afraid the resignation of Tim Davie will change nothing,\" she said. \"Under this Labour government overseeing the new appointment... it will probably get worse.\"  All three politicians were close allies of Boris Johnson, who has been instrumental this week in piling the pressure on the BBC. He dramatically threatened in the Daily Mail to boycott the licence fee until Tim Davie explained what happened with the Trump Panorama documentary - or resigned. The official Conservative Party line is slightly more restrained. Read more:Analysis: 'Teflon Tim' has come unstuckThe past controversies faced by DavieRead their resignation letters in full Shadow culture secretary Nigel Huddleston told Sky News \"we want them to be successful\" - but he and his boss Kemi Badenoch are calling for wide-ranging editorial reforms to end what they describe as \"institutional bias\". Their list calls for changes to BBC Arabic, its coverage of the US and Middle East, and \"basic matters of biology\", by which they mean its stories on trans issues.  The irony of demanding editorial changes from a supposedly independent organisation dealing with allegations of bias has been lost in the furore. Similarly, Nigel Farage is calling for the government to appoint a new director-general from the private sector who has \"a record of coming in and turning companies and cultures around\". As part of its editorial independence, the appointment of the BBC's next editor-in-chief is meant to be entirely down to its own independent board - and out of the hands of ministers. The government's own response to the scandal has therefore been relatively muted. In a statement, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy thanked Mr Davie for his long service to public service broadcasting - and paid tribute to the BBC as \"one of our most important national institutions\". Before the news of the resignations broke, she had been expressing her \"complete confidence\" in how the BBC's leadership were dealing with the \"serious allegations\" described in the leaked memo from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee. The departure of Mr Davie and the CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness just hours later seemed to be something of a shock. A more detailed government response is sure to come when parliament returns from recess on Monday. The Culture Media and Sport Committee of MPs - which has played an active role in the scandal by writing to the BBC chairman and demanding answers - is due to receive its response on Monday, which is expected to include an apology for the Panorama edits. Its chair Dame Caroline Dinenage described Mr Davie's resignation as \"regrettable\" but said that \"restoring trust in the corporation must come first\"."

Nonetheless, the latest statistics show that 349 people made the journey in five boats on Sunday, bringing the total for the year so far to 39,075. The arrivals have already passed the number for the whole of 2024 (36,816) and 2023 (29,437), but the number is 2% below the total at this point in 2022 (39,929)."

The Reform UK leader revealed he had a phone call with the US president on Friday in which Mr Trump said \"is this how you treat your best ally?\" Politics latest: Farage says ministers 'only listen to big business' BBC director-general Tim Davie and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, announced they had resigned on Sunday evening over questions about bias after a BBC Panorama special spliced Mr Trump's 6 January 2021 speech so it appeared he had encouraged supporters to storm Capitol Hill. In a post on his Truth Social social media platform after their resignations, Mr Trump accused Mr Davie and the \"top people in the BBC\" of being \"very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election\". Mr Trump's lawyers have demanded the BBC retracts the \"false\" statements about him in the documentary or face legal action for $1bn (£760m) in damages. Mr Farage told Sky News that people should \"put yourself in Trump's shoes\" as he questioned how they would feel if they were the person making sure the UK had security guarantees, and you had been \"stitched up on the eve of a national election\". \"What the BBC did was election interference,\" Mr Farage said. \"If you put yourself into Trump's shoes, he made his feelings to me in no uncertain terms - in no unquotable terms.\" He said he could not reveal what words Mr Trump used \"before the watershed\", adding the president was \"very, very unhappy\". The Reform leader said the BBC has been \"institutionally biased for decades\" - just moments after Ms Turness arrived at the BBC's central London headquarters and admitted \"mistakes are made\" but said there is \"no institutional bias\". BBC latest: Outgoing BBC News boss rejects 'institutional bias' Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has echoed Mr Farage's assertions, saying that she too believed the BBC was \"institutionally biased\". She told reporters on Monday: \"I think this isn't just about the latest doctoring of a documentary about Donald Trump. It's about the way the BBC has continually covered issues of sex and gender. \"A lot of women out there believe that the BBC is institutionally biased against them. A lot of Jewish people believe that the BBC is institutionally biased against them, and so those are the people that I'm speaking out for.\" Ms Badenoch went on to say that the \"complaining\" about Mr Trump's reaction was a \"distraction\". \"I believe that the BBC is an institution that we need to treasure in our country, but the only way that we will be able to look after this institution is if it starts to have a little bit of humility and look at its own mistakes rather than have contempt and sneer at all of the people who are pointing out those mistakes,\" she continued. She added: \"We need to remember it is paid for by license fee payers. If the BBC is sued by President Trump or anyone else, it is license fee payers who actually pay that cost. So we need to start by looking after them first.\"  BBC chair Samir Shah sent a letter to parliament's culture, media and sport committee on Monday accepting the way Mr Trump's speech was edited \"did give the impression of a direct call for violent action\" and apologised \"for that error of judgement\". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has urged Mr Farage, Kemi Badenoch and Sir Keir Starmer to condemn Mr Trump's attack on the BBC, calling it a \"serious threat to our national interest\". In an open letter to the three leaders, he said: \"It should not be up to foreign powers to dictate where the British people get their news from. \"We must stand united to defend our democracy from foreign interference like this - even when it comes from a crucial ally.\" Read more:The BBC controversies faced by Tim Davie during his time in charge Earlier, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, Dame Caroline Dinenage, told Mornings with Ridge and Frost it is \"really regrettable\" Mr Davie had to step down but she thought \"he was right to do so\". Dame Caroline said the BBC was \"very slow to react\" to a leaked report by Michael Prescott, an independent adviser to the BBC's editorial guidelines and standards board. The dossier, sent to the BBC board and leaked to The Daily Telegraph, accused the Panorama special on Donald Trump, released a week before the 2024 US election, of being \"neither balanced nor impartial - it seemed to be taking a distinctly anti-Trump stance\". Mr Prescott also raised bias concerns about the BBC's coverage of trans issues and the war in Gaza. Dame Caroline accused the BBC of failing to take his report seriously \"until it was too late\". She said the situation \"has to influence the BBC charter decisions\". The BBC's Royal Charter outlines the corporation's mission, public purposes and governance, along with specific obligations and how it is funded. It is up for renewal in 2027, with the government currently carrying out a review to determine the BBC's future, including its funding model and mission."

        "Content": "Scientists have discovered a new medicine that they say offers hope of substantially slowing the progress of motor neurone disease (MND). The drug, named M102, works by protecting nerve cells damaged by MND. Preclinical studies of the drug conducted with mice show improvement in movement and nerve function. Researchers are now hopeful the drug can be tested on humans with the neurological condition, for which there is currently no cure. MND causes the messages from motor neurones - the nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscle - to gradually stop. This leads to muscles becoming weak and stiff and gradually reduces the ability of patients to walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. There are around 5,000 people in the UK with MND. Those who develop the condition usually die within two to five years following the onset of symptoms. Last year, rugby league star Rob Burrow died aged 41 after being diagnosed with the condition in 2019. Following a decorated sporting career in which he represented Leeds Rhinos, England and Great Britain, he raised millions of pounds for charities doing research into the degenerative brain and nerve disease. MND left him unable to speak and confined him to a wheelchair. But he increased the public prominence of MND in the UK. After his death, Tanya Curry, the chief executive of the MND Association, said Burrow \"made a huge amount of difference\". She said: \"Not only for donations and financial influence for the organisation, but actually in the campaigning arena.\" \"It's a rare disease, but actually something that people understand now. So, he has done so much for the community and we are honestly so grateful for that.\" Former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir died in 2022 at the age of 52 after a lengthy battle with MND.  Last month, England's 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Lewis Moody announced he had been diagnosed with the disease. The 47-year-old former England captain said it had been \"incredibly hard to process and a huge shock to me and my family\".

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n The biggest climate meeting of the year opened in Brazil on Monday aiming to bring countries together, amid a difficult global backdrop of backlash to climate policies in Europe and an absent United States. Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned of those who \"sow hatred, spread fear, and attack institutions, science, and universities\". \"It is time to impose a new defeat on denialists,\" he told countries gathered for COP30 in the Amazonian city of Belem. Read more: Britons still buying green tech despite attacks  It was a veiled attack on the likes of US President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a \"hoax\", and emboldened populist parties in Europe and the UK that are attacking climate policies and questioning science. UN climate chief Simon Stiell told negotiators on Monday: \"Your job is to fight this climate crisis together.\" Outwardly, countries were unphased that the US president is skipping the talks on climate change - despite being the largest historical emitter. After all, the other 194 countries are still signed up, Brazil pointed out yesterday. But Mr Trump's shadow still hangs over the summit, and some diplomats who want more action on fossil fuels privately expressed nervousness that his team could still stand in the way. Last month, he successfully sank a proposed shipping levy after threatening sanctions and visa restrictions on those who backed it. Germany's environment state secretary Jochen Flasbarth was asked whether Mr Trump might try the same tactics at COP30. \"I don't think so. But we'll have to wait and see,\" he replied. He said a broader conference like this was less likely to worry the US president than the shipping levy, which would have been legally binding.  Fossil fuels versus clean energy COP30 host nation Brazil, itself a major oil producer, says it wants to use the summit to map out how to end dependence on oil, coal and gas. Two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, countries set a vague target to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels - but there's been little progress since. As the US seeks to lock countries into using its oil and gas for longer, China is forging ahead, building most of the solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles of the future, while still chugging coal itself. The president of this year's conference, Andre Correa do Lago, said: \"Emerging countries are appearing in this COP with a different role. China is coming with solutions for everyone.\" UN climate chief Mr Stiell also talked up China's renewable power push. \"Clean energy is the trend of our time, President Xi of China said.\" German minister Mr Flasbarth said he had been to China, which is currently the world's largest polluter, three times in the last few months.  Although China's leader Xi Jinping also stayed at home, officials sent in his place talked up climate policies. But 19 US states still have net zero targets, and Democratic politicians are arriving in Belem this week to nail their colours to the climate mast. California senator Josh Becker said in a briefing: \"Donald Trump does not speak for all Americans.\" He added: \"Yes, I think he will try to influence the talks. But we're going to continue to move forward.\" Read more:Why US may soon have real energy emergencyTrump urged to involve US in climate change fightCOP's potential for change limited by those absentAre climate summits saving the world - or just hot air? 'Symbol of devastation' Unamay Gordon, principal director of climate change for the Jamaican government, said: \"I know that the subnational governments from the US will be here on the ground as well, and accountability has to come at all levels.\" Jamaica is still picking up the pieces from the deadly Hurricane Melissa that slammed into its coastlines two weeks ago, which was intensified by climate change.  Ms Gordon said the country has become \"the world's symbol of climate devastation\". An alliance of island countries, including Jamaica, will use COP30 to try to force countries to respond to a recent warning that the world is due to warm by levels that could push their lands underwater. The summit is also hoped to launch various initiatives to protect and fund indigenous peoples, who are finally being recognised and rewarded for being the best guardians of their land."

Speaking to Sky News before the COP30 climate talks, which start today in Brazil, Mr Ban said: \"The climate crisis does not care where you are living, [whether in] United States or China or European countries. \"If we live together, we all live. If we die, we all die together.\" He called it \"deeply regrettable\" that the US - which is the \"most powerful, most resourceful, and most influential country\" - is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time. The landmark pact, struck at COP21 in 2015, is the world's most significant and only legally binding climate treaty. It aims to limit warming to 1.5C-2C above pre-industrial levels, and obliges countries to produce climate plans every five years detailing how they will deliver on their share of the bargain. \n                  COP30: Climate summit kicks off with plea to work together - despite Trump-shaped hole\n                 \n                  COP30: Are climate summits saving the world - or just hot air?\n                 \n                  COP's potential for change limited not by who turned up, but by the elephants not in the room\n                 Yesterday, the COP30 host team of Brazilians said 108 have now been submitted - meaning more than a third are still missing. Mr Ban, who was UN chief at the time of the Paris talks, said rich Western states, not just America, need to step up. \"They must show their strongest possible leadership and the number one priority. This is only one earth we have. We don't have any other place to move.\" The former UN chief now heads up the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens, which works with decision-makers to implement the Paris Agreement and UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

But the White House has been coy about whether other representatives like negotiators will attend. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Sky News: \"The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his common sense energy agenda - which is focused on utilising the liquid gold under our feet to strengthen our grid stability and drive down costs for American families and businesses. \"President Trump will not jeopardise our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n It's been three decades of COP talks - and as most of the climate metrics get worse, questions about whether the summits are working have become impossible to ignore. This year, approximately 40,000 people are flying in to Belém in Brazil for COP30 - back in the country that hosted the landmark Rio Earth Summit in 1992. At the time, it was the biggest gathering of world leaders ever. It spawned a slew of treaties and documents that committed countries to growing economies in ways that also protected the environment: a blueprint for a brighter, greener future - or so they thought. That included the world's first-ever global climate treaty, the UNFCCC, which underpins the COP process and promised to \"protect the climate system for present and future generations\". \"There was, I think, a general atmosphere of hope that this was the start of a process which could make a real difference,\" said Michael Howard, Britain's then environment secretary who attended Rio 1992, and later Conservative party leader. But despite 29 rounds of COP negotiations, the natural world that Rio pledged to protect is gasping for air. Same stage, hotter planet Annual greenhouse gas emissions are now a staggering 65% higher than they were in 1990. And the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased at the highest rate on record last year. In France in 2015, some 20 COPs after the Rio Earth Summit, leaders struck the Paris Agreement - a landmark pact to limit warming ideally to 1.5C above levels in pre-industrial times. But today, just 10 years later, global average temperatures are already approximately 1.4C warmer, snapping at the heels of the Paris goal. Ban Ki-moon, who was head of the United Nations when the world signed the Paris Agreement, told Sky News it was a \"moment of triumph\". But the \"problem is that after the agreement, the member states' vision\" in putting it into practice has been very different. \"Some countries were very active, some countries didn't pay much attention.\" Those higher temperatures are fanning the flames of extreme weather, like Hurricane Melissa that killed and destroyed in the Caribbean just two weeks before COP30 starts today. In 2024, that kind of climate damage cost £1trn globally, according to BloombergNEF. It said the \"primary reason\" for the rising costs is an \"increase in intensity and frequency of events\". What the Paris Agreement and COP have achieved But that's not to say COPs haven't achieved anything. They have. Defenders of \"the process\" point out that - before the 2015 Paris Agreement - warming was on course for about 4C by the end of the century. Now, it's roughly 2.8C. That's still bad. It could collapse parts of the Amazon rainforest that is hosting this year's COP30 - but it's progress. The Paris pact also stimulated a growth spurt in renewable energy, which this year provided more electricity than coal for the first time ever. And it triggered a wave of net zero targets, which now cover at least 77% of global GDP - albeit of varying degrees of quality. \"That is an absolute transformation,\" the UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News before COP30. The \"reason we need\" the COP summits is because it brings together 195 countries across the world, he said. \"How are you going to do this without working together? You can't go it alone to tackle the climate crisis.\" Deforestation is slowing - so still raging, but at a slower pace. And the amount of planet-warming gas we emit in proportion to the amount we grow our economies is falling - in other words, we are emitting less per pound or dollar of GDP. But Ian Hall, climate professor at Cardiff University, said these \"limited signs of progress\" are \"modest compared to the scale and speed of change needed\". He added: \"Urgent, systemic action is essential to avoid the worst impacts.\" If the world warms by around 2.8C as expected, scientists expect most of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets would melt, bits of the Amazon would turn into savannas, and millions of people would migrate from their homelands that have become too hot, too fierce or flooded for good.  \"On the islands, we get all of it,\" said Surangel Whipps Jr, president of tiny island nation Palau in the west Pacific. \"We're just waiting for the next storm. We're waiting for the next sea level rise to destroy our crops. We're waiting for the drought... This is the reality that we live in.\" Laurie Laybourn, executive director of the Strategic Climate Risks Initiative, said the COPs need to start focusing more on how to cope with this kind of \"escalating danger\". \"That means greater attention on making societies more resilient, otherwise climate-induced chaos could derail them from decarbonising, which will make climate change worse, meaning more chaos and more derailment.\" Read more:Why COP30 is so controversial2025 set to be among hottest ever Bombshell letter confronts image problem A bombshell letter during last year's COP in Azerbaijan - signed by climate heavyweights including former UN chief Ban Ki-moon - warned the conference was \"no longer fit for purpose\". It landed days after host president Ilham Aliyev had boasted about his country's abundant gas being \"a gift from God\". The signatories said the summits had become co-opted by fossil fuel interests and bogged down by a slow progress and unwieldy size. Johan Rockstrom, a prominent climate scientist who signed that letter, told Sky News it's time to switch from \"beautiful statements\" that \"nobody delivers upon\" to holding each other accountable for what's already been promised.  Others are giving up on COP altogether. Dr Jennifer Allan, senior lecturer in global environmental politics at Cardiff University, has \"defended COPs in the past, and still think they can do good\". But now she feels \"complicit in the myth\" that COP can save the world, and in the \"carbon footprint that accompanies these huge MegaCOPs\". \"The same arguments go round and round, masked beneath legal technicalities. It all feels very disconnected from the real world.\" Conscious of COP's image problem, UN climate chief Simon Stiell has asked a crack squad to work out how to reform the process, but while still keeping all countries on side.  The loudest defenders The COP summits were designed in a wildly different era of the 1990s, a spell of relative peace and cooperation, like at the Rio Earth Summit, like the integration of countries after the fall of the Soviet Union. Today there are more conflicts - 184 in 2024 compared with 118 in 1992 - fuelling a rise in defence spending. Meanwhile the impacts of climate change the world was too slow to curb are hitting hard and costing a fortune. Questions about whether multilateralism can survive this dog not just the COP talks but the entire United Nations. Those involved in COP seem to be circling round the idea that there is no more need for beautifully worded statements - like on \"transitioning away from fossil fuels\" at COP28 in Dubai - but just to get on with delivering what's already been promised. But that will make it harder to communicate COP30 as a success. COP30 CEO Ana Toni seemed unphased yesterday. She told journalists that 194 countries are coming - and that shows multilateralism is alive and well. It is the countries most endangered by a changing climate that defend the process the loudest. They say it's one of the few forums where they have an equal seat at the table with major economies like China, Brazil and Russia. Palauan president Mr Whipps said: \"It is very costly, and it's very far to come to these events. But if we don't come, there's nobody out there to defend the most vulnerable.\" He gives the example of Palau's big sister in the Pacific, Australia, which was pressured by the COP process to up its emissions-cutting target from 26% to 43% by 2030. \"That's why we feel it's important for us that our voice be heard.\""

The organisation has been engulfed in a crisis, forced to apologise on Monday after two of its most senior figures, including the director-general, resigned on Sunday night. The defamation claim centres around a BBC Panorama documentary, which aired October 2024 and showed an edited speech made by Mr Trump before the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in which he appeared to tell his supporters he was going to walk with them to the US Capitol and \"fight like hell\". In a letter dated 9 November, Florida-based lawyer Alejandro Brito set the BBC a deadline of 10pm UK time on Friday to respond, outlining three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president He told the BBC it needed to \"comply\" or face being sued for $1bn. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\" 'Error of judgement' On Monday, BBC chairman Samir Shah, one of the most senior figures still standing, apologised for the \"error of judgement\" in editing the video. In a letter to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of MPs, Mr Shah said Mr Trump's speech was edited in a way that gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action\". \"The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" he added.  Director-general and head of BBC News resign Concerns about the edited speech first came to light in a leaked memo from Michael Prescott, a former journalist and independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board. As a result, BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness announced their resignations on Sunday evening, saying in emails to staff that mistakes had been made. Mr Davie will address an all-staff meeting on Tuesday. While on her way into the Broadcasting House on Monday morning, Ms Turness defended the corporation, rejecting accusations of institutional bias.  Downing St stands by BBC - but chancellor says 'lessons to be learned' A spokesperson for the prime minister told reporters on Monday that the BBC wasn't corrupt or institutionally biased. Instead, they said it had a \"vital role\" to play in the modern age, but needed to ensure it acted \"to maintain trust and correct mistakes quickly when they occur\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves also stood by the corporation, but said that \"lessons do need to be learned\". 'Nothing but an apology' Veteran broadcaster and former BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby told Sky News, however, that the organisation owed the US president nothing more than an apology.  But former legal correspondent for the BBC Joshua Rozenberg also told Sky News that he believed the corporation would \"very likely\" consider settling with Trump.

Following a backlash, both BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief executive Deborah Turness have both stepped down from their roles. Mr Trump is also understood to have threatened the corporation with legal action over the editing together of two pieces of video from his speech on 6 January 2021 in the BBC's flagship late-night news programme Panorama. While the original programme received no complaints, Mr Shah confirmed in his letter that over 500 complaints had been received since a memo from former independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board, Michael Prescott, was leaked to The Daily Telegraph.  BBC resignations as Trump 'threatens to sue' - follow latest In his memo, Mr Prescott detailed what he called \"worrying systemic issues with the BBC's coverage\", also discussing other coverage, including trans issues, and the war in Gaza. Mr Prescott specifically mentioned Ms Turness and deputy director of BBC News, Jonathan Munro in his memo, calling them \"defensive\". An apology - by denial of a cover-up In his four-page letter of response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Mr Shah said following \"deliberation\", the board \"accept that the way Mr Trump's speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action\", calling it an \"error of judgement\". He also noted that some coverage of the memo leak, implied a list of stories and issues had been \"uncovered\", which the BBC had sought to \"bury\". Mr Shah said that interpretation was \"simply not true\" and urged for a \"sense of perspective\" to be maintained when considering the \"thousands of hours of outstanding journalism\" the BBC produces each year.  Changes in leadership The BBC chair also said the view that the BBC \"has done nothing to tackle these problems\" is \"simply not true\". Mr Shah admitted there were occasions \"when the BBC gets things wrong\" or \"reporting requires more context or explanation\". Read more:Who is Michael Prescott?Trump reacts to BBC resignations - and doesn't hold back Raising the point that the information relied on by Mr Prescott for his memo was the very research commissioned by the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC), he said the memo \"did not present a full picture of the discussions, decisions and actions that were taken\". Mr Shah detailed changes in leadership across the BBC Arabic team, as well as changes in World Service and BBC News - all of which he said would help tackle the issues raised.  So what is being done? At the end of the letter Mr Shah committed to three actions: • \"The board will commit to revisiting each and every item set out in Michael Prescott's note and take further action where appropriate. We will be transparent about the conclusions we reach, and the actions taken.\" • \"Where we have put in measures already, in response to the original EGSC research, we will repeat those internal reviews to check the changes made are making material improvements to the output.\" • \"Where we have already accepted that items fall short of our editorial standards, we will ensure that amendments to the relevant online stories are made where this was deemed appropriate.\" Mr Shah concluded by saying the BBC would \"champion impartiality\", which he said was \"more necessary now than ever before\", calling it the \"sacred job of the BBC\"."

The Reform UK leader revealed he had a phone call with the US president on Friday in which Mr Trump said \"is this how you treat your best ally?\" Politics latest: Farage says ministers 'only listen to big business' BBC director-general Tim Davie and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, announced they had resigned on Sunday evening over questions about bias after a BBC Panorama special spliced Mr Trump's 6 January 2021 speech so it appeared he had encouraged supporters to storm Capitol Hill. In a post on his Truth Social social media platform after their resignations, Mr Trump accused Mr Davie and the \"top people in the BBC\" of being \"very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election\". Mr Trump's lawyers have demanded the BBC retracts the \"false\" statements about him in the documentary or face legal action for $1bn (£760m) in damages. Mr Farage told Sky News that people should \"put yourself in Trump's shoes\" as he questioned how they would feel if they were the person making sure the UK had security guarantees, and you had been \"stitched up on the eve of a national election\". \"What the BBC did was election interference,\" Mr Farage said. \"If you put yourself into Trump's shoes, he made his feelings to me in no uncertain terms - in no unquotable terms.\" He said he could not reveal what words Mr Trump used \"before the watershed\", adding the president was \"very, very unhappy\".

BBC latest: Outgoing BBC News boss rejects 'institutional bias' Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has echoed Mr Farage's assertions, saying that she too believed the BBC was \"institutionally biased\". She told reporters on Monday: \"I think this isn't just about the latest doctoring of a documentary about Donald Trump. It's about the way the BBC has continually covered issues of sex and gender. \"A lot of women out there believe that the BBC is institutionally biased against them. A lot of Jewish people believe that the BBC is institutionally biased against them, and so those are the people that I'm speaking out for.\" Ms Badenoch went on to say that the \"complaining\" about Mr Trump's reaction was a \"distraction\". \"I believe that the BBC is an institution that we need to treasure in our country, but the only way that we will be able to look after this institution is if it starts to have a little bit of humility and look at its own mistakes rather than have contempt and sneer at all of the people who are pointing out those mistakes,\" she continued. She added: \"We need to remember it is paid for by license fee payers. If the BBC is sued by President Trump or anyone else, it is license fee payers who actually pay that cost. So we need to start by looking after them first.\"  BBC chair Samir Shah sent a letter to parliament's culture, media and sport committee on Monday accepting the way Mr Trump's speech was edited \"did give the impression of a direct call for violent action\" and apologised \"for that error of judgement\". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has urged Mr Farage, Kemi Badenoch and Sir Keir Starmer to condemn Mr Trump's attack on the BBC, calling it a \"serious threat to our national interest\". In an open letter to the three leaders, he said: \"It should not be up to foreign powers to dictate where the British people get their news from. \"We must stand united to defend our democracy from foreign interference like this - even when it comes from a crucial ally.\" Read more:The BBC controversies faced by Tim Davie during his time in charge Earlier, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, Dame Caroline Dinenage, told Mornings with Ridge and Frost it is \"really regrettable\" Mr Davie had to step down but she thought \"he was right to do so\". Dame Caroline said the BBC was \"very slow to react\" to a leaked report by Michael Prescott, an independent adviser to the BBC's editorial guidelines and standards board. The dossier, sent to the BBC board and leaked to The Daily Telegraph, accused the Panorama special on Donald Trump, released a week before the 2024 US election, of being \"neither balanced nor impartial - it seemed to be taking a distinctly anti-Trump stance\". Mr Prescott also raised bias concerns about the BBC's coverage of trans issues and the war in Gaza. Dame Caroline accused the BBC of failing to take his report seriously \"until it was too late\". She said the situation \"has to influence the BBC charter decisions\". The BBC's Royal Charter outlines the corporation's mission, public purposes and governance, along with specific obligations and how it is funded. It is up for renewal in 2027, with the government currently carrying out a review to determine the BBC's future, including its funding model and mission."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n After Tim Davie's resignation announcement only a day ago, talk is turning to who could replace him and take on the highest-profile role in British broadcasting. The BBC's director-general position is a crucial role, serving effectively as both the corporation's chief executive and its editor-in-chief across television, radio and online. Davie, who has worked for the BBC for 20 years and been in charge for the past five, is not stepping down immediately. He said in his departure note to staff that he is \"working through exact timings with the board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months\". It is still early days, but here are some of the names being discussed as contenders for the role. Charlotte Moore Chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, a British independent TV and film production company owned by Sony, Charlotte Moore was chief content officer at the BBC for five years before leaving in the summer. \n                  Trump threatens to sue BBC for $1bn over speech edit\n                 \n                  Trump's lawyer threatens BBC with $1bn lawsuit - read the letter in full\n                 \n                  BBC chair Samir Shah's letter to MPs - key points\n                 She was among those shortlisted when Davie got the job in 2020 and is known as the mastermind behind the commissioning of The Great British Bake Off. In March 2023, she was awarded the Royal Television Society Judges Award in recognition of her leadership \"through one of the most momentous years in [the BBC's] history and having done so with an exceptional combination of steadfast level-headedness, confidence and creative flair\". \"The BBC is an extraordinary place to work,\" she said in a statement when her move to Left Bank was announced. \"There's nowhere quite like it that backs risk-taking, innovation and homegrown creativity with such commitment.\" James Harding A former editor of the Times and director of BBC News, James Harding is the co-founder and editor of slow news venture Tortoise Media, which bought The Observer newspaper in December 2024. Harding called for the BBC to be \"put beyond the reach of politicians\" in an interview with Sky News before giving the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival in the summer. Establishing the independence of the BBC is critical \"if we want to build confidence in shared facts and respect for the truth\", he said. Jay Hunt Jay Hunt is Apple TV+'s creative director for Europe and was appointed chair of the British Film Institute in 2024. She has previously worked as chief creative officer for Channel 4, director of programmes at Channel 5 and controller of BBC One. Channel 4 was named Channel of the Year at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in 2014 and 2016 under her leadership, and she was known for buying the rights to The Great British Bake Off from the BBC. At Apple, she has overseen commissioning for award-winning shows such as Bad Sisters and Slow Horses. Alex Mahon After almost eight years as chief executive of Channel 4 - the first woman in the broadcaster's history to take the helm - Alex Mahon left the role earlier this year to lead live entertainment group Superstruct Entertainment. Superstruct owns and operates more than 80 music festivals across 10 countries in Europe and Australia, including Boardmasters in Cornwall and Mighty Hoopla. Mahon's move allowed her to earn a more lucrative remuneration package than the one on offer to her at Channel 4, Sky News City editor Mark Kleinman reported at the time. Dawn Airey, Channel 4 interim chair, described her as a \"great figure in British television\" and said she had been \"one of the most impactful CEOs\" since the founding of Channel 4 in 1982. She was the recipient of Variety's 2020 International Achievement in Television Award and has been honoured with an International Royal Industrial Fellowship. Dame Carolyn McCall Dame Carolyn McCall has led ITV since she joined the channel in 2018, having served as chief executive of easyJet for seven years and chief executive of the Guardian Media Group for four years. She was made a dame in 2016 for services to the aviation industry and an OBE before that in 2008 for services to women in business. She has led ITV plc's \"significant transformation in the competitive digital media landscape since joining in 2018, successfully evolving it from a linear organisation to a strong linear and digital media, entertainment, and global production business\", her biography for the broadcaster states. McCall is in the preliminary stages of talks with Sky, the owner of Sky News, over the possible sale of ITV's media and entertainment division. Sir Trevor Phillips Another name that has been suggested by a few commentators is Sky News's Sir Trevor Phillips, who presents Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips each weekend. A businessman and journalist, Phillips has won Royal Television Society journalism awards three times. He is also a Times columnist and was shortlisted for Comment Writer of the Year in 2020. Phillips, who was knighted in 2022 for services to equality and human rights, was previously head of current affairs for London Weekend TV (where he worked alongside BBC chair Samir Shah), chair of the London Assembly, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and president of the John Lewis Partnership Council. His name has been mentioned as a possible contender on political website Guido Fawkes, as well as by Rod Liddle on Times Radio and journalist Stephen Pollard in a column for The Spectator, headlined: \"Is this the man who can save the BBC?\" Senior BBC staff Could the BBC look internally? One name that has been mentioned is Jonathan Munro, who, since joining the BBC in 2014, has led news coverage \"through every major story over the last decade\", his biography for the broadcaster states, from Brexit to UK general elections, and the death of the Queen to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. He became global director of BBC News in September 2024, and is also director of the BBC World Service and deputy chief executive of BBC News and Current Affairs.

She has only been in the role for a few months, having previously held the position of director of unscripted content. During the pandemic, she was acting controller of BBC One. In other circumstances, BBC News chief executive Deborah Turness perhaps could have been a possible candidate to replace Davie, but she announced her resignation alongside his on Sunday night.  As Davie said, he is looking to pass on the baton in the coming months. His successor will be appointed by the BBC Board, which is responsible for ensuring the broadcaster delivers its mission and public purposes."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n Michael Prescott's leaked memo raising concerns over BBC impartiality has brought down two of its top bosses. US President Donald Trump has swiftly weighed in to brand the corporation \"corrupt\" and \"dishonest\". With the BBC now in crisis, who is the man who started it all? Michael Prescott An ex-journalist, Michael Prescott was an independent adviser to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board for three years before leaving in June. Studying at Oxford, he worked for 17 years as a journalist, with a decade spent working at the Sunday Times, initially as chief political correspondent before rising to political editor. No stranger to showbiz, he has previously advised high-net-worth individuals and Hollywood stars on sensitive disputes and had a regular spot on Michael Parkinson's weekly Radio 2 show, Parkinson's Sunday Supplement, giving the newspaper review. \n                  Eight people who could replace Tim Davie as BBC director-general\n                 \n                  Trump threatens to sue BBC for $1bn over speech edit\n                 \n                  Trump's lawyer threatens BBC with $1bn lawsuit - read the letter in full\n                 BBC chairman expected to apologise to MPs - follow latest Mr Prescott has also worked in a series of corporate advisory roles - as corporate affairs director for BT, where he helped launch BT Sport and was part of the telecoms company's merger with EE. Ahead of that, he was managing director of corporate communications and public affairs at global PR company Weber Shandwick, where he advised organisations including Virgin Media, Balfour Beatty, British Nuclear Fuels, MasterCard, IKEA, air traffic control body NATS and numerous universities. He currently holds roles at Hanover Communications, an international communications and PR agency.  Mr Prescott is also a member of the government's Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, offering independent advice to the Prime Minister, among others. What did his memo say? The memo, sent in the summer by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC's editorial standards committee, highlighted the edit of a Donald Trump speech as well as other concerns about impartiality. The concerns regard clips spliced together from sections of a speech made by the US president on 6 January 2021, featured in the Panorama programme Trump: A Second Chance? It made it appear that Mr Trump told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to \"fight like hell\", although the quotes were made during separate parts of the speech. Mr Prescott has said he wrote a memo in \"despair at inaction by the BBC Executive when issues come to light\". He went on: \"On no other occasion in my professional life have I witnessed what I did at the BBC with regard to how management dealt with (or failed to deal with) serious recurrent problems.\" Read more: Tim Davie and Deborah Turness's resignation letters in full His memo also raised concerns about other areas of BBC output - including coverage of trans issues, and the war in Gaza. This memo was later leaked to The Telegraph, leading to the crisis at the top of the BBC, resulting in two resignations. Who else is involved? Tim Davie Ex-BBC boss Tim Davie had earned himself the nickname Teflon Tim due to his staying power through numerous controversies. But now it seems he's seen one controversy too far. Previously vice-president for marketing and franchise for drinks giant PepsiCo Europe, he was made CBE in 2018 for services to international trade. Joining the BBC in 2005, he rose to the top position of director-general in 15 years.  Controversies he previously weathered include former Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker's 2023 brief suspension, Gregg Wallace's sacking and Bob Vylan's 2025 Glastonbury set. Earlier this year, the breaching of the BBC's Broadcasting Code over documentary Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone dented the corporation's reputation further, followed by the edit of Donald Trump's 6 January 2021 speech in flagship show Panorama - which has offered the decisive blow.  Deborah Turness A linguist, Deborah Turness studied in Surrey, followed by a postgraduate diploma in journalism in France, at the University of Bordeaux. She became chief executive of BBC news and current affairs in September 2022, previously working as CEO of ITN. Before that was president of NBC News International, the global arm of American news network NBC News. Prior to joining NBC News, she was editor of ITV News, where she was their first female editor and the youngest ever editor of ITV News.  What has Donald Trump got to do with it? Mr Davie's and Ms Turness's resignations come off the back of internal concerns over the edit of a Donald Trump speech in an episode of the BBC's Panorama programme. The concerns regard clips spliced together of the US president's speech on January 6, 2021. That was the day of the storming of the Capitol building in Washington by Trump supporters who believed the 2020 election had been stolen by Joe Biden. The edit was part of the documentary Trump: A Second Chance?, which was broadcast by the BBC before last year's US elections. Responding to the resignations, Mr Trump posted a lengthy statement on Truth Social. \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught \"doctoring\" my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th,\" he wrote. \"Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\""

        "Content": "Former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood has been granted conditional bail during a court appearance to face charges of rape and sexual assault. The 68-year-old is accused of offences against seven women, including three indecent assaults at the BBC studios in the 1990s. Westwood, wearing a dark grey shirt, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address as he appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. The former BBC DJ, who returned to the UK from Nigeria last week, was not required to enter pleas to any of the charges at this stage. He has attended five police interviews voluntarily since the investigation into the alleged offences began, the court heard. Westwood has previously denied all allegations of sexual misconduct made against him. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring granted bail on the condition that he does not contact prosecution witnesses, and set his next court appearance at Southwark Crown Court for 8 December. The charges Westwood is charged with four counts of rape, nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. These include an allegation of rape against a woman at a hotel in London in 1996, one count of rape from the early 2000s at an address in London, and two counts of rape at an address in London in the 2010s. He is further accused of four indecent assaults in London in the 1980s, three indecent assaults at the BBC in the 1990s, and two indecent assaults in the early 2000s. The former DJ is also alleged to have sexually assaulted a woman at a nightclub in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 2010, and faces a second sexual assault charge against a woman at a music festival in London in the 2010s. Westwood began his broadcasting career in local radio before joining Capital Radio in the late 1980s. He moved to the BBC in 1994, working on Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra for almost 20 years. After leaving the BBC in 2013, he then joined Capital Xtra, hosting a regular Saturday show where he was referred to as \"The Big Dawg\", before he left the company in 2022."
