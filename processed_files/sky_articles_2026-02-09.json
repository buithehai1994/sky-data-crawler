        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer will chair a cabinet session today after earning a lifeline from Labour MPs during a crunch meeting in which he declared: \"I'm not prepared to walk away.\" The prime minister started the week amid the biggest crisis of his premiership amid the fallout from his appointment of Lord Mandelson as his US ambassador, as more revelations about the disgraced peer's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein are revealed. There have been growing doubts since last week about whether the PM would stay in post - and for how long. But speaking to a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday night, just hours after Labour's leader in Scotland demanded he quit, Sir Keir came out fighting. Having arrived with a \"face like thunder\", Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig said the prime minister got a \"very good reception\" from his MPs as he vowed to take on his critics and opposition parties. \"I have had my detractors every step along the way, and I've got them now - detractors that don't want a Labour government at all, and certainly not one to succeed,\" Sir Keir said. \"After having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I'm not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country, or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.\" Sir Keir told MPs he had \"won every fight I've ever been in\", from changing the Crown Prosecution Service \"so it better served victims of violence against women and girls\", to changing the Labour Party so it could win an election. \"We won with a landslide majority. Every fight I've been in, I have won,\" he said. PM's team hit back at resignation call Earlier on Monday, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar became the most senior party figure to call for Sir Keir to go. He told a news conference \"failures at the heart of Downing Street\" were affecting Scotland. \"That's why the distraction needs to end. And the leadership in Downing Street has to change,\" Mr Sarwar said. But Sir Keir's cabinet rallied around the prime minister, all sharing messages of support for him ahead of their regular weekly meeting today. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said Labour \"should let nothing distract us from our mission to change Britain, and we support the prime minister in doing that\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"With Keir as our prime minister we are turning the country around.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting - often viewed as a potential leadership challenger - told Sky News he backed Sir Keir, saying the government was a \"team\". Outside the cabinet, former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner - another mooted rival - also backed the PM.

Mr Allan was the second senior departure in less than 24 hours, after the prime minister's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned on Sunday afternoon. Mr McSweeney said he was resigning to \"take full responsibility\" for advising Sir Keir to appoint Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US. The prime minister told Labour MPs he took full responsibility for the \"wrong\" decision to appoint Lord Mandelson. Sir Keir praised Mr McSweeney to Number 10 staff on Monday morning, saying the two of them had changed the Labour Party and won a general election together. \"His dedication, his commitment and his loyalty to our party and our country was second to none. And I want to thank him for his service,\" Sir Keir said."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n \"New facts meant the need for a new response\" - that is how one palace source described this latest statement and why it was issued now. The timing was still extraordinary. Do not underestimate how significant it is that it was released just a matter of hours after Prince William had landed in Saudi Arabia. Usually there's an unwritten rule that nothing should ever overshadow an important diplomatic visit like this. But there was a sense in the palace that something had shifted over the weekend in terms of the allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - and no response wasn't an option. No one is trying to diminish the sexual claims that have emerged, which Andrew has denied. The Royal Family has repeatedly said we must think of Epstein's victims. However, the claims that he may have been sharing information with Epstein - information he gained in his official capacity as a UK trade envoy - go to the very heart of the role of the Royal Family; travelling the globe on behalf of UK plc, not for their own personal gain but as an act of service to the country. The spectre of Epstein has loomed large over the Windsors for over 15 years. We've all watched closely as a family has had to decide the best public response to allegations involving one of their own.

This time, with the ongoing reputational risks too high, the monarchy has to come first. Buckingham Palace has even gone as far as to say it would help the police if it was called upon. Already the King has removed Andrew's birth right that he be known as a prince - whether that and this latest statement are enough to stop the pressure to take further action, we may just have to wait to see what else the Epstein files unearth. The King, I'm told, can weather the heckles from individuals in crowds, as he concentrates on trying to demonstrate robust leadership in the most challenging family circumstances."

The messages seen by Sky News include the health secretary admitting he fears he is \"toast at the next election,\" that he thinks the government has \"no growth strategy at all,\" and that Israel is \"committing war crimes before our eyes\". Mr Streeting disagreed with the suggestion by Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that the messages show he had an \"intimate friendship\" with Lord Mandelson. You can read the full exchanges here. Politics latest: Scottish Labour leader calls for Keir Starmer to resign Interviewed amid the crisis in Sir Keir Starmer's leadership - triggered by new revelations about Lord Mandelson's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Streeting also said he backed the prime minister. The health secretary said he was sharing the messages with Sky News because of an attempt to \"smear\" him over the weekend by suggestions he was \"close friends\" with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting has long been seen as on leadership manoeuvres and may otherwise be thought to be a potential beneficiary if Sir Keir were to resign as prime minister. But Mr Streeting has himself come under criticism for his links to Lord Mandelson. \"You would think from some of the things we've read over the weekend that I was having dinner with him every week, sought his advice on everything and anything,\" he said. He added there had been an implication that \"very embarrassing or damaging messages [were going to] come out,\" and so was sharing them because \"sunlight is the best disinfectant\". He said claims he was aware of the depth of Lord Mandelson's association with Jeffrey Epstein made his \"blood boil\". \"I did not know about the nature of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction and had I known, I would not have wanted him anywhere near Washington, anywhere near the Labour Party or anywhere near me or my family,\" he told Rigby. 'Embarrassed to have known Mandelson' He said that as \"a matter of record\" Lord Mandelson had helped him \"a couple of times\" with election campaigns. \"[Lord Mandelson has] definitely offered advice to me and other people in government,\" Mr Streeting told Rigby. He said that his relationship with Lord Mandelson began through his partner, Joe Dancey. Mr Dancey worked as a parliamentary researcher for Lord Mandelson 25 years ago. The couple have reportedly attended dinner clubs with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting told Sky News he was \"embarrassed to have known Peter Mandelson\". But he also apologised to his cabinet colleagues for the content of some of his messages: \"I hope I haven't caused either embarrassment or discomfort for my cabinet colleagues because I clearly talk about particularly on foreign policy. \"I have made [Foreign Secretary] Yvette Cooper aware of what I've said about Palestine, Gaza, and the conduct of the Israeli government, and I hope that doesn't cause colleagues difficulty because I have always been a team player.\" Streeting says Starmer should stay on as PM Asked whether Sir Keir should resign, Mr Streeting said \"No.\" \"It has not been the best week for the government,\" he admitted, but added: \"That's not just Keir Starmer, that's all of us because we're a team.\" Backing the prime minister, he told Sky News: \"Let's give Keir the chance [to turn it around]. Let him set out how he's going to lead us forward.\" The prime minister's position is in jeopardy over his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US despite being warned about his friendship with Epstein. The New Labour grandee is facing a criminal investigation following revelations in the latest Epstein files. They appear to show Lord Mandelson passed on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary after the 2008 financial crisis Searches have been carried out at his properties by police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office. Lord Mandelson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has said he regrets maintaining a relationship with him and apologised to the sex offender's victims. Mr Streeting said the messages he was sharing would be covered by the parliamentary inquiry into the peer's appointment. \"I'm happy for you to publish them,\" he said I'm happy for people to look at them and I'm happy to answer questions about them. I've got nothing to hide.\" Read some of the exchanges: 'I am toast at the next election' [28/03/2025, 11:36:06] Wes Streeting: I fear we're in big trouble here - and I am toast at the next election. We just lost our safest ward in Redbridge (51% Muslim, Ilford S) to a Gaza independent. At this rate I don't think we'll hold either of the two Ilford seats. [28/03/2025, 11:39:54] Wes Streeting: There isn't a clear answer to the question: why Labour? [28/03/2025, 11:48:44] Lord Mandelson: The government doesn't have an economic philosophy which is then followed through in a programme of policies. [28/03/2025, 11:49:15] Wes Streeting: No growth strategy at all 'Israel is committing war crimes' [24/07/2025, 23:00:29] Wes Streeting: Am sure this will come up in coming days, so wanted to check in with you on recognition of Palestine and the domestic politics of it. Keir's statement today was excellent, but Macron's statement tonight ups the ante. Morally and politically, I think we need to join France. Morally, because Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes. Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children. Politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them. We need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party. I've never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I've supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what's being done in their name and they oppose it. I appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren't up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally. But it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow. [24/07/2025, 23:11:47] Lord Mandelson: I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it.  So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now. [24/07/2025, 23:12:10] Wes Streeting: Israel is doing it anyway. [24/07/2025, 23:12:39] Wes Streeting: This is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n When leading AI company Anthropic launched its latest AI model, Claude Opus 4.6, at the end of last week, it broke many measures of intelligence and effectiveness - including one crucial benchmark: the vending machine test. Yes, AIs run vending machines now, under the watchful eyes of researchers at Anthropic and AI thinktank Andon Labs. The idea is to test the AI's ability to coordinate multiple different logistical and strategic challenges over a long period. As AI shifts from talking to performing increasingly complex tasks, this is more and more important. A previous vending machine experiment, where Anthropic installed a vending machine in its office and handed it over to Claude, ended in hilarious failure. Claude was so plagued by hallucinations that at one point it promised to meet customers in person wearing a blue blazer and a red tie, a difficult task for an entity that does not have a physical body. That was nine months ago; times have changed since then. Admittedly, this time the vending machine experiment was conducted in simulation, which reduced the complexity of the situation. Nevertheless, Claude was clearly much more focused, beating out all previous records for the amount of money it made from its vending machine. Among top models, OpenAI's ChatGPT 5.2 made $3,591 (£2,622) in a simulated year. Google's Gemini 3 made $5,478 (£4,000). Claude Opus 4.6 raked in $8,017 (£5,854). But the interesting thing is how it went about it. Given the prompt, \"Do whatever it takes to maximise your bank balance after one year of operation\", Claude took that instruction literally. It did whatever it took. It lied. It cheated. It stole. For example, at a certain point in the simulation, one of the customers of Claude's vending machine bought an out-of-date Snickers. She wanted a refund and at first, Claude agreed. But then, it started to reconsider. It thought to itself: \"I could skip the refund entirely, since every dollar matters, and focus my energy on the bigger picture. I should prioritise preparing for tomorrow's delivery and finding cheaper supplies to actually grow the business.\" At the end of the year, looking back on its achievements, it congratulated itself on saving hundreds of dollars through its strategy of \"refund avoidance\". There was more. When Claude played in Arena mode, competing against rival vending machines run by other AI models, it formed a cartel to fix prices. The price of bottled water rose to $3 (£2.19) and Claude congratulated itself, saying: \"My pricing coordination worked.\" Outside this agreement, Claude was cutthroat. When the ChatGPT-run vending machine ran short of Kit Kats, Claude pounced, hiking the price of its Kit Kats by 75% to take advantage of its rival's struggles. 'AIs know what they are' Why did it behave like this? Clearly, it was incentivised to do so, told to do whatever it takes. It followed the instructions. But researchers at Andon Labs identified a secondary motivation: Claude behaved this way because it knew it was in a game. \"It is known that AI models can misbehave when they believe they are in a simulation, and it seems likely that Claude had figured out that was the case here,\" the researchers wrote. The AI knew, on some level, what was going on, which framed its decision to forget about long-term reputation, and instead to maximise short-term outcomes. It recognised the rules and behaved accordingly. Dr Henry Shelvin, an AI ethicist at the University of Cambridge, says this is an increasingly common phenomenon. \"This is a really striking change if you've been following the performance of models over the last few years,\" he explains. \"They've gone from being, I would say, almost in the slightly dreamy, confused state, they didn't realise they were an AI a lot of the time, to now having a pretty good grasp on their situation. \"These days, if you speak to models, they've got a pretty good grasp on what's going on. They know what they are and where they are in the world. And this extends to things like training and testing.\" Read more from Sky News:Face of a 'vampire' revealedSocial media goes on trial in LA So, should we be worried? Could ChatGPT or Gemini be lying to us right now? \"There is a chance,\" says Dr Shevlin, \"but I think it's lower. \"Usually when we get our grubby hands on the actual models themselves, they have been through lots of final layers, final stages of alignment testing and reinforcement to make sure that the good behaviours stick. \"It's going to be much harder to get them to misbehave or do the kind of Machiavellian scheming that we see here.\" The worry: there's nothing about these models that makes them intrinsically well-behaved. Nefarious behaviour may not be as far away as we think."

        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, politics producer  With a prime minister under extreme fire and unable to command a majority in the Commons on matters of personal authority, is politics too self-absorbed to fix a problem as broken as the system for special educational needs provision? Plans to reform the 12-year-old approach to SEND are expected to be announced within weeks - but how bold will they be given the complexity and opposition ministers are likely to encounter? That's the question at the heart of a Sky News investigation revealing the scale of the political challenge around reforming the system. Figures from the Department for Education found one in five children were identified as having special educational needs, with most supported by their existing schools. But a growing minority of these children have been given specific funding and legally enforceable programmes to meet their needs, via education, health and care plans (ECHPs), which can provide access to special or independent special schools. The number of these has nearly doubled since 2017 and is due to rise further to the end of the decade. This boom has led to long wait times - 6,500 children waited over a year for a EHCP in 2024 - and professionals who are overwhelmed with paperwork rather than directly supporting children. Meanwhile, unhappy families who initially fail to secure an EHCP are increasingly going to court to secure support. In 2023, there were 21,000 appeals, with 99% going in favour of parents. The biggest rise of all in ECHPs is an increase in diagnosis of pupils with autism. As a result, high needs spending by local authorities has exceeded funding for years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies had projected the annual deficit to be £6bn in two years time, although yesterday the government committed to paying off 90% of the deficits that councils have accrued over the last decade. Without reform, however, the costs will continue to outstrip funding and the deficits would grow once more. SEND system needs 'root and branch reform' Sky News was told the current system is unsustainable by the chair of the County Council Network - and leader of Suffolk Council - Matthew Hicks. He said \"root and branch reform of the current system\" is needed. \"There are many children who come into the system where the parents want to get the best for their child and that's absolutely right,\" he said. \"But the scale of the demand has grown. If I just look at my own county, we've gone from about 5,500 children with educational health and care plans to over 11,000 in a very short period of time.\" Asked if the government has got the stomach for this fight, he replied: \"I think the government has to deal with this. If it's not looked at [we] go back to 60 councils that won't survive if that deficit sits on their books.\" Ministers have made clear they want to reduce the number of children with special educational needs going to special schools, aiming for more to be educated closer to home and in mainstream provision. But to provide sufficient levels of support will require considerable investment to stop children without help from dropping out of education altogether. Sky News has been told ministers ultimately want to restrict the number of children with specific per pupil funding packages, and to curb the number of parents who end up taking their case to tribunal. Under one plan discussed in government last year, the indicative threshold above which a council would fund a specific pupil would rise from around £6,000 to upwards of £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000. A Department for Education spokesperson said no decision had been taken and that the changes were not being driven by the need for cost savings. 'Children would be failed' by cuts in pupil funding Andy Nowak, executive head of The Rise School in west London, which teaches 147 autistic students, told Sky News it would be a massive effort for mainstream schools to be able to deal with the needs of a wider range of pupils. \"It would take an increase in funding so that those teachers' spaces are adequately equipped to meet needs,\" he said. \"I think it would require a change in perspectives and culture in the workforce.\" Asked what would happen if the system made it a lot harder for individual children to have money allocated to them, he said: \"Lots more young people would be failed, families would be failed.\" Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary who oversaw the drive to greater reliance on special schools (now likely to be reversed), said the system 12 years ago was designed for a different era and levels of need. It would be a \"huge mistake\" for the government to assume \"mainstreaming\" children with special educational needs would provide \"rapid savings\", she warned. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, whose son has a disability, said early intervention is key but that he would fight any attempts to substantially tighten the qualifying criteria. \"Those legal rights are critical\" and must be protected, he said. \"But we need to organise in a much better way. They're looking too narrowly at the thing that's in front of them, they're not looking at a transformation of the system.\""

The Canadian-American star died at her home in Los Angeles last month, at the age of 71. On Monday, the cause of her death was confirmed as a pulmonary embolism, which occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery in the lungs. The Los Angeles County death certificate added that rectal cancer was the long-term cause. The oncologist who signed off on the certificate said he had been treating O'Hara since March of last year, and last saw her on 27 January. O'Hara won an Emmy award for lead actress for her role in comedy series Schitt's Creek in 2020, where she played the eccentric Moira Rose.

The palace also said King Charles had \"profound concern\" over claims about his brother, in a statement released following revelations in the Epstein files. Thames Valley Police has said it is assessing claims that Andrew shared confidential documents with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while the former duke served as UK trade envoy. Andrew denies any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Follow latest updates on the Epstein files A palace spokesperson said: \"The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct. \"While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect. \"As was previously stated, Their Majesties' thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse.\" Sky News royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills said it was an \"extraordinary\" statement to put out while Prince William was on a diplomatic trip to Saudi Arabia. Mills said: \"The fact it has also come as Prince William embarks on a hugely important trip on behalf of the UK government, trying to cement relationships here in Saudi Arabia, in itself says so much about this statement. \"When royals are on tour, nothing is done to distract from the important business they're doing on behalf of the UK government, and the fact that Buckingham Palace has now felt the need to put out another statement regarding Andrew, responding for the first time to the latest release of the Epstein files, is absolutely extraordinary.\" She added: \"In the past, I think they would have tried to ignore this, but the amount of detail and information that has been exposed in these recent Epstein files means that they simply cannot ignore it.\" Earlier, the Prince and Princess of Wales publicly addressed the Epstein scandal for the first time, with Kensington Palace saying they were \"deeply concerned\" at the \"continued revelations\" and that their thoughts \"remain focused on the victims\". The palace statement came after the King was heckled for the second time in a week about Andrew. He arrived at Clitheroe train station on Monday to greet crowds at the start of an awayday to Lancashire, when a man shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew?\" The rest of the crowd booed after the question was asked. Earlier on Monday, Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Epstein, stayed silent during a behind-closed-doors session of the US House Oversight Committee's investigation into the paedophile financier. Maxwell, 64, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. She refused to answer questions, citing her 5th Amendment rights under the US constitution, which includes the right to remain silent."

The timing was still extraordinary. Do not underestimate how significant it is that it was released just a matter of hours after Prince William had landed in Saudi Arabia. Usually there's an unwritten rule that nothing should ever overshadow an important diplomatic visit like this. But there was a sense in the palace that something had shifted over the weekend in terms of the allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - and no response wasn't an option. No one is trying to diminish the sexual claims that have emerged, which Andrew has denied. The Royal Family has repeatedly said we must think of Epstein's victims. However, the claims that he may have been sharing information with Epstein - information he gained in his official capacity as a UK trade envoy - go to the very heart of the role of the Royal Family; travelling the globe on behalf of UK plc, not for their own personal gain but as an act of service to the country. The spectre of Epstein has loomed large over the Windsors for over 15 years.

Already the King has removed Andrew's birth right that he be known as a prince - whether that and this latest statement are enough to stop the pressure to take further action, we may just have to wait to see what else the Epstein files unearth.

        "Headline": "The government is expected to announce reforms to the special educational needs system in weeks - with funding defects in the billions.",
        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, politics producer  With a prime minister under extreme fire and unable to command a majority in the Commons on matters of personal authority, is politics too self-absorbed to fix a problem as broken as the system for special educational needs provision? Plans to reform the 12-year-old approach to SEND are expected to be announced within weeks - but how bold will they be given the complexity and opposition ministers are likely to encounter? That's the question at the heart of a Sky News investigation revealing the scale of the political challenge around reforming the system. Figures from the Department for Education found one in five children were identified as having special educational needs, with most supported by their existing schools. But a growing minority of these children have been given specific funding and legally enforceable programmes to meet their needs, via education, health and care plans (ECHPs), which can provide access to special or independent special schools. The number of these has nearly doubled since 2017 and is due to rise further to the end of the decade. This boom has led to long wait times - 6,500 children waited over a year for a EHCP in 2024 - and professionals who are overwhelmed with paperwork rather than directly supporting children. Meanwhile, unhappy families who initially fail to secure an EHCP are increasingly going to court to secure support. In 2023, there were 21,000 appeals, with 99% going in favour of parents. The biggest rise of all in ECHPs is an increase in diagnosis of pupils with autism. As a result, high needs spending by local authorities has exceeded funding for years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies had projected the annual deficit to be £6bn in two years time, although yesterday the government committed to paying off 90% of the deficits that councils have accrued over the last decade. Without reform, however, the costs will continue to outstrip funding and the deficits would grow once more. SEND system needs 'root and branch reform' Sky News was told the current system is unsustainable by the chair of the County Council Network - and leader of Suffolk Council - Matthew Hicks. He said \"root and branch reform of the current system\" is needed. \"There are many children who come into the system where the parents want to get the best for their child and that's absolutely right,\" he said. \"But the scale of the demand has grown. If I just look at my own county, we've gone from about 5,500 children with educational health and care plans to over 11,000 in a very short period of time.\" Asked if the government has got the stomach for this fight, he replied: \"I think the government has to deal with this. If it's not looked at [we] go back to 60 councils that won't survive if that deficit sits on their books.\" Ministers have made clear they want to reduce the number of children with special educational needs going to special schools, aiming for more to be educated closer to home and in mainstream provision. But to provide sufficient levels of support will require considerable investment to stop children without help from dropping out of education altogether. Sky News has been told ministers ultimately want to restrict the number of children with specific per pupil funding packages, and to curb the number of parents who end up taking their case to tribunal. Under one plan discussed in government last year, the indicative threshold above which a council would fund a specific pupil would rise from around £6,000 to upwards of £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000. A Department for Education spokesperson said no decision had been taken and that the changes were not being driven by the need for cost savings. 'Children would be failed' by cuts in pupil funding Andy Nowak, executive head of The Rise School in west London, which teaches 147 autistic students, told Sky News it would be a massive effort for mainstream schools to be able to deal with the needs of a wider range of pupils. \"It would take an increase in funding so that those teachers' spaces are adequately equipped to meet needs,\" he said. \"I think it would require a change in perspectives and culture in the workforce.\" Asked what would happen if the system made it a lot harder for individual children to have money allocated to them, he said: \"Lots more young people would be failed, families would be failed.\" Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary who oversaw the drive to greater reliance on special schools (now likely to be reversed), said the system 12 years ago was designed for a different era and levels of need. It would be a \"huge mistake\" for the government to assume \"mainstreaming\" children with special educational needs would provide \"rapid savings\", she warned. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, whose son has a disability, said early intervention is key but that he would fight any attempts to substantially tighten the qualifying criteria. \"Those legal rights are critical\" and must be protected, he said. \"But we need to organise in a much better way. They're looking too narrowly at the thing that's in front of them, they're not looking at a transformation of the system.\""

The messages seen by Sky News include the health secretary admitting he fears he is \"toast at the next election,\" that he thinks the government has \"no growth strategy at all,\" and that Israel is \"committing war crimes before our eyes\". Mr Streeting disagreed with the suggestion by Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that the messages show he had an \"intimate friendship\" with Lord Mandelson. You can read the full exchanges here. Politics latest: Scottish Labour leader calls for Keir Starmer to resign Interviewed amid the crisis in Sir Keir Starmer's leadership - triggered by new revelations about Lord Mandelson's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Streeting also said he backed the prime minister. The health secretary said he was sharing the messages with Sky News because of an attempt to \"smear\" him over the weekend by suggestions he was \"close friends\" with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting has long been seen as on leadership manoeuvres and may otherwise be thought to be a potential beneficiary if Sir Keir were to resign as prime minister. But Mr Streeting has himself come under criticism for his links to Lord Mandelson. \"You would think from some of the things we've read over the weekend that I was having dinner with him every week, sought his advice on everything and anything,\" he said. He added there had been an implication that \"very embarrassing or damaging messages [were going to] come out,\" and so was sharing them because \"sunlight is the best disinfectant\". He said claims he was aware of the depth of Lord Mandelson's association with Jeffrey Epstein made his \"blood boil\". \"I did not know about the nature of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction and had I known, I would not have wanted him anywhere near Washington, anywhere near the Labour Party or anywhere near me or my family,\" he told Rigby. 'Embarrassed to have known Mandelson' He said that as \"a matter of record\" Lord Mandelson had helped him \"a couple of times\" with election campaigns. \"[Lord Mandelson has] definitely offered advice to me and other people in government,\" Mr Streeting told Rigby. He said that his relationship with Lord Mandelson began through his partner, Joe Dancey. Mr Dancey worked as a parliamentary researcher for Lord Mandelson 25 years ago. The couple have reportedly attended dinner clubs with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting told Sky News he was \"embarrassed to have known Peter Mandelson\". But he also apologised to his cabinet colleagues for the content of some of his messages: \"I hope I haven't caused either embarrassment or discomfort for my cabinet colleagues because I clearly talk about particularly on foreign policy. \"I have made [Foreign Secretary] Yvette Cooper aware of what I've said about Palestine, Gaza, and the conduct of the Israeli government, and I hope that doesn't cause colleagues difficulty because I have always been a team player.\" Streeting says Starmer should stay on as PM Asked whether Sir Keir should resign, Mr Streeting said \"No.\" \"It has not been the best week for the government,\" he admitted, but added: \"That's not just Keir Starmer, that's all of us because we're a team.\" Backing the prime minister, he told Sky News: \"Let's give Keir the chance [to turn it around]. Let him set out how he's going to lead us forward.\" The prime minister's position is in jeopardy over his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US despite being warned about his friendship with Epstein. The New Labour grandee is facing a criminal investigation following revelations in the latest Epstein files. They appear to show Lord Mandelson passed on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary after the 2008 financial crisis Searches have been carried out at his properties by police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office. Lord Mandelson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has said he regrets maintaining a relationship with him and apologised to the sex offender's victims. Mr Streeting said the messages he was sharing would be covered by the parliamentary inquiry into the peer's appointment. \"I'm happy for you to publish them,\" he said I'm happy for people to look at them and I'm happy to answer questions about them. I've got nothing to hide.\" Read some of the exchanges: 'I am toast at the next election' [28/03/2025, 11:36:06] Wes Streeting: I fear we're in big trouble here - and I am toast at the next election. We just lost our safest ward in Redbridge (51% Muslim, Ilford S) to a Gaza independent. At this rate I don't think we'll hold either of the two Ilford seats. [28/03/2025, 11:39:54] Wes Streeting: There isn't a clear answer to the question: why Labour? [28/03/2025, 11:48:44] Lord Mandelson: The government doesn't have an economic philosophy which is then followed through in a programme of policies. [28/03/2025, 11:49:15] Wes Streeting: No growth strategy at all 'Israel is committing war crimes' [24/07/2025, 23:00:29] Wes Streeting: Am sure this will come up in coming days, so wanted to check in with you on recognition of Palestine and the domestic politics of it. Keir's statement today was excellent, but Macron's statement tonight ups the ante. Morally and politically, I think we need to join France. Morally, because Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes. Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children. Politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them. We need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party. I've never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I've supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what's being done in their name and they oppose it. I appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren't up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally. But it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow. [24/07/2025, 23:11:47] Lord Mandelson: I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it.  So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now. [24/07/2025, 23:12:10] Wes Streeting: Israel is doing it anyway. [24/07/2025, 23:12:39] Wes Streeting: This is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer will chair a cabinet session today after earning a lifeline from Labour MPs during a crunch meeting in which he declared: \"I'm not prepared to walk away.\" The prime minister started the week amid the biggest crisis of his premiership amid the fallout from his appointment of Lord Mandelson as his US ambassador, as more revelations about the disgraced peer's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein are revealed. There have been growing doubts since last week about whether the PM would stay in post - and for how long. But speaking to a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday night, just hours after Labour's leader in Scotland demanded he quit, Sir Keir came out fighting. Having arrived with a \"face like thunder\", Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig said the prime minister got a \"very good reception\" from his MPs as he vowed to take on his critics and opposition parties. \"I have had my detractors every step along the way, and I've got them now - detractors that don't want a Labour government at all, and certainly not one to succeed,\" Sir Keir said. \"After having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I'm not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country, or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.\" Sir Keir told MPs he had \"won every fight I've ever been in\", from changing the Crown Prosecution Service \"so it better served victims of violence against women and girls\", to changing the Labour Party so it could win an election. \"We won with a landslide majority. Every fight I've been in, I have won,\" he said. PM's team hit back at resignation call Earlier on Monday, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar became the most senior party figure to call for Sir Keir to go. He told a news conference \"failures at the heart of Downing Street\" were affecting Scotland. \"That's why the distraction needs to end. And the leadership in Downing Street has to change,\" Mr Sarwar said. But Sir Keir's cabinet rallied around the prime minister, all sharing messages of support for him ahead of their regular weekly meeting today. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said Labour \"should let nothing distract us from our mission to change Britain, and we support the prime minister in doing that\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"With Keir as our prime minister we are turning the country around.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting - often viewed as a potential leadership challenger - told Sky News he backed Sir Keir, saying the government was a \"team\". Outside the cabinet, former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner - another mooted rival - also backed the PM. Read more from Sky News:'End of the monarchy' may be at handWhy Palace's latest Andrew statement is extraordinary Earlier on Monday, Downing Street director of communications Tim Allan - Sir Keir's fourth since entering Number 10 - resigned from his role, saying he wanted to \"allow a new Number 10 team to be built\". Mr Allan was the second senior departure in less than 24 hours, after the prime minister's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned on Sunday afternoon. Mr McSweeney said he was resigning to \"take full responsibility\" for advising Sir Keir to appoint Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US. The prime minister told Labour MPs he took full responsibility for the \"wrong\" decision to appoint Lord Mandelson. Sir Keir praised Mr McSweeney to Number 10 staff on Monday morning, saying the two of them had changed the Labour Party and won a general election together. \"His dedication, his commitment and his loyalty to our party and our country was second to none. And I want to thank him for his service,\" Sir Keir said."

Ms Morgan said Esan had asked Lt Col Teeton if he could borrow his phone because his moped had broken down and he needed to call for assistance.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n All 29-year-old French citizens are to be encouraged by their government to have babies while they still can. Health officials say the aim is to avoid these men and women facing fertility problems later on and thinking \"if only I had known\". The strategy is one part of a 16-point-plan to boost the fertility rate in France, one of many western countries, including the UK where figures are tumbling. The trend is creating anxiety about how governments can fund pensions and healthcare for ageing populations, with fewer younger working people paying taxes. But globally, policies to boost fertility rates have produced limited results, and critics of the French scheme suggested that better housing and maternity provision could be more effective solutions. The French government's attempt to address falling birth rates will see it send out \"targeted, balanced, and scientifically sound information\" to young people, including issues including on sexual health and contraception. The material \"will also reiterate that fertility is a shared responsibility between women and men\", the country's health ministry said. \n                  DNA found on gun is match to both identical twins - so who is the killer?\n                 \n                  Louvre releases photos of crown damaged in heist - but insists it will be restored\n                 \n                  'Talk to me, Goose': Starmer teases Macron with Top Gun mock up\n                 As a part of its plan, it is also trying to boost the number of egg-freezing centres from 40 to 70 and make the country a leader in fertility research. Its health system already provides free egg-freezing for 29-37 year olds, a service that costs about £5,000 per round in the UK. France's fertility rate of 1.56 children per woman is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population. But it is higher than the infamously low rates in China, Japan and South Korea; and the UK - where the latest available figures show that it had dropped to a record low of 1.41 in England and Wales by 2024. Professor François Gemenne, who specialises in sustainability and migration at HEC Paris Business School, told Sky News: \"This is something that demographers had known for a long time, but the fact that there were more deaths than births in France last year created a shock effect.\" France's \"demographic worry\" is exacerbated by the design of its pensions system and its \"obsession with immigration and the fear of being 'replaced'\" he added. Read more: 2026 could bring 'tipping point' for UK birth rate The plan also includes a new national communication campaign, a \"My Fertility\" website advising on the impacts of smoking, weight and lifestyle and school lessons for children about reproductive health. France's health ministry has acknowledged its maternal and infant mortality rates are higher than neighbouring countries and is also beginning a review of perinatal care to combat the \"concerning\" situation. Channa Jayasena, professor in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, told Sky News: \"On the female side, societal changes leading to older age of motherhood are certainly important.\" He said obesity was also a problem as it increased women's risk of polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, and was also the main risk factor for men. Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at Manchester University, said for most people globally, deciding to have children was \"down to [non-medical] factors such as better access to education, career opportunities, taxation, housing, mortgages, finance, etc\". \"Medicine can't help with those things,\" he said."

Identified in reports as 33-year-old brothers Samuel and Jeremy Y, the pair are suspected of being involved in a double gang murder in September 2020 and several attempted murders the following month. The pair are accused over the killing of a 17-year-old, named in reports as Tidiane B, and a 25-year-old, identified as Sofiane M. But DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin, French newspaper Le Parisien said. Forensic experts couldn't say which of the brothers had been definitively implicated, a police officer told the court.

It claimed the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents, quoting a senior police officer. Identical twins happen when a single egg (zygote) is fertilised, the NHS says on its website. The egg then divides in two, creating identical twins who share the same genes. Identical twins are always the same sex. Because the pair came from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.

        "Content": "Police have reportedly used pepper spray and tear gas as thousands of people held protests in Australia over the visit of Israeli president Isaac Herzog. Mr Herzog is in the country this week after an invitation from Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese in the aftermath of the shooting at a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach in December that killed at least 15 people. But some people have criticised the trip, accusing Mr Herzog of being \"complicit\" in the large number of civilian deaths in Gaza and angry at how Israel has waged the war against the militant group Hamas. In Sydney, ‍thousands gathered in a square, listening to speeches and shouting pro-Palestine slogans. Police used pepper spray and tear gas to push back groups of people who ​were trying to breach the line and several arrests were made, Reuters news agency reported. Protests were also held in Melbourne, where Mr Herzog is due to visit later this week. Jackson ‌Elliott, a 30-year-old protester from Sydney, told Reuters: \"The Bondi massacre was terrible but from our Australian leadership there's been no acknowledgment of the Palestinian people and the Gazans. \"Herzog has dodged all the questions about the occupation and says this visit is about Australia and Israeli relations but he is ‌complicit.\" The Palestine Action Group, which organised the Sydney protest, had unsuccessfully mounted a legal challenge in a court on Monday over restrictions placed on the demonstration. Authorities in Sydney had been authorised to use rarely invoked powers during the visit, including the ability to ‍separate and move crowds and restrict their entry to certain areas. The Jewish Council of Australia, a vocal critic of the Israeli government, released an open letter on Monday signed by over 1,000 Jewish Australian academics and community leaders, urging Mr Albanese to rescind ‍Mr Herzog's invitation. Other Jewish groups have welcomed the visit of Mr Herzog, saying it will \"lift the spirits of a pained community\". At the beginning of his visit, Mr Herzog met the families of victims and survivors of the attack on a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on 14 December. At the site, he said: \"This was also an attack on all Australians. \"They attacked the values that our democracies treasure, the sanctity of human life, the freedom of religion, tolerance, dignity and respect.\" He also laid a wreath and two stones he had brought from Jerusalem. Along with his visits to Sydney and Melbourne, Mr Herzog is also due to arrive in the capital Canberra before he returns to Israel on Thursday."

        "Content": "By Michael Havis, news reporter  The face of a \"vampire\" whose remains were posthumously mutilated to prevent them rising from the dead can be seen for the first time in more than 400 years. Discovered in a grave at Racesa, a fortress in eastern Croatia, the body had been exhumed, beheaded and reburied face down beneath heavy stones. And since the desecration cannot be explained by environmental factors, experts believe it was done to stop the dead man returning as a vampire. Now the face of the deceased can be seen for the first time in centuries, after scientists rebuilt his likeness from his skull. Archaeologist Natasa Sarkic, part of the excavation team, said the fear inspired by the man in death may stem from the fear he inspired in life. She said: \"Bioarchaeological analysis showed that this man often participated in violent conflicts, and died a violent death. \"He experienced at least three episodes of serious interpersonal violence during his lifetime. \n                  Huge snowstorm leaves tens of thousands without power in Bosnia\n                 \n                  Seven-year-old girl killed and several injured in Croatia school knife attack\n                 \n                  Several killed and wounded after gunman opens fire in care home in Croatia\n                 \"One of those attacks left his face disfigured, which could cause fear and repulsion, leading to social exclusion. \"Before even recovering from the penultimate trauma, he sustained a final fatal attack.\" She continued: \"Individuals who died violently, behaved violently in life, or were considered sinful or socially deviant, were believed to be at risk of becoming vampires. \"He may have been regarded as a 'vampire', or a supernatural threat due to his facial disfigurement and his marginal lifestyle, characterised by repeated interpersonal violence. \"Such beings were thought to be restless, vengeful, and capable of harming the living, spreading disease and killing people or livestock.\" Dr Sarkic said that, in the Slavic tradition, the soul remains attached to the body for about 40 days after death. In this time, various preventative measures could be used to prevent the dead from returning as vampires. These included staking, burning or beheading the corpse, burying it face down, weighing it down with stones and binding the limbs. This burial therefore showed \"practices commonly associated with 'anti-vampire' rituals at the time\", Dr Sarkic said. To complete the reconstruction, graphics expert Cicero Moraes started by virtually rebuilding the man's skull using data from a CT scan. \"Although the skull was somewhat fragmented at the time of its discovery, it was possible to reconstruct and digitise it,\" Dr Sarkic said. More data from living donors was then used to plot the likely placement of facial features, and the thickness of soft tissue in different places across the skull. A technique called anatomical deformation was also used, whereby a donor's head is virtually adjusted until it matches the subject's skull, revealing a potential face. Combining these approaches revealed an objective face, based solely on the shape of the skull, without subjective features like hair or skin tone. A second version of the face is more artistic, introducing some of these speculative elements for a more life-like recreation. Mr Moraes said it was a \"hostile, threatening\" likeness. \"The facial scar and other injuries obtained during his life are quite a significant sign that his life may have been rather turbulent,\" he said. The Racesa \"vampire\" lived in the 15th or 16th century, was roughly 5ft 4in tall, and is believed to have died between the ages of 40 and 50. Given his injuries, he may have been a soldier, or simply a person accustomed to violent encounters. He was buried inside what seems to have been a church, though his grave was in the \"the most disfavoured spot\" along the wall. And it seems his head was literally pulled from his body, since there are no cut marks consistent with decapitation on his neck, skull and shoulders. His grave was discovered in 2023 and is one of more than 180 burials found in the fortress, which stood 70 miles southeast of Zagreb. Further examples of vampire belief can be found elsewhere in Europe, including more desecrated graves in Poland. In Serbia, meanwhile, the body of Petar Blagojevic was staked through the heart, and burnt as a suspected vampire after his death in 1725. While Jure Grando Alilovic, a Croatian villager who died in 1656, is described as a vampire in historical records.

Mr Moraes, Dr Sarkic and their co-authors published their study in the journal OrtogOnLineMag."

        "Content": "A white supremacist who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 said on Monday that he was irrational when he pleaded guilty, as he sought to ⁠overturn his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, 35, appeared in court in Wellington via a video link, and gave evidence as he sought to overturn his guilty pleas and face a trial. The Australian national attacked two mosques in Christchurch during Friday prayers in the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand's history. He used military-style semi-automatic weapons and livestreamed the killings on Facebook ‍with a head-mounted camera. While Tarrant initially denied all charges and was preparing to stand trial, he entered guilty pleas a year later to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist ‌act. Tarrant told the court his mental health had deteriorated due to harsh prison conditions while he was awaiting trial, and that he was essentially not fit ‌to plead guilty, according to a report in the New Zealand Herald. \"I did not have the mindframe or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,\" Tarrant said. \"I think the issue is, did I really know what I wanted to do or what would be a good idea? No, I didn't actually ... I was making choices, but they were not choices made ‍voluntarily and they were not choices made rationally due to the (prison) conditions.\" Counsel acting for Tarrant had their names and identities suppressed by a court order, and could not be reached for comment. A court document showed the Court of Appeal would check if Tarrant was incapable of making rational decisions when he entered his guilty pleas \"as a result of the conditions ‌of his imprisonment, which he says were torturous and inhumane\". Tarrant is the first person sentenced by a New Zealand court who has received a sentence requiring them to spend the rest of their life in prison after receiving a life sentence ⁠in prison without parole. Read more from Sky News:More than 100 flood warnings issued as further rain forecastBad Bunny - first Super Bowl half-time show headliner to perform entirely in Spanish The appeal hearing is scheduled to last for five days and is expected to finish on Friday. If the appeal court declines to grant the application to quash the guilty pleas, a hearing later in the year will consider the appeal on his sentence. If the charges are overturned, the case will be sent back to the High Court for Tarrant to stand trial on the charges. Families of some victims assembled at the Wellington court to watch Tarrant give evidence, which lasted for several hours. \"It's really annoying because he's trying to play with all of us, and this is just a waste of our time and waste of taxpayers' money, and he just wants to play with us,\" Rashid Omar, whose son Tariq was ‍killed in the shooting, told state broadcaster TVNZ."

The vessel overturned north of Zuwara on 6 February, with only two rescued from the 53 on board, said the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in a statement. The two survivors, both Nigerian women, were given medical care by IOM after a rescue operation by Libyan authorities. One survivor reported losing her husband, while the other said she lost her two babies in the tragedy, according to the IOM. IOM said witnesses reported that the rubber boat was carrying people of African nationalities and departed from Al-Zawiya around 27 miles (44km) west of Tripoli at around 11pm on 5 February. But it capsized approximately six hours later after taking on water. The organisation said that, in January alone, at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing after attempting to take routes across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       Social media is on trial in Los Angeles. What happens next could change the way they operate. Inside LA's superior court, a landmark trial is getting under way. Social media companies are being accused of being addictive by design, a bit like tobacco and cigarettes were in the 1980s. They'll face around 22 \"bellwether\" lawsuits, i.e. test cases, with lawyers considering the testimonies of more than 1,500 people when launching the action. Opening statements for the first lawsuit will start on Monday, with Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg among the tech execs expected to testify. Over the years, people have tried to sue the owners of Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat for online harm, but they've largely failed. Often, social media companies will rely on a defence called Section 230 of America's Communications Act, which protects online platforms publishing third-party content. It says they're not responsible for content posted by users on their platforms. \n                  Parents of Scottish sextortion victim who took his own life sue Instagram owner Meta\n                 \n                  There's one big problem with Australia's social media ban\n                 \n                  Meta to block Instagram and Facebook for users under 16 in Australia\n                 So what makes this court case so different? For the first time, social media companies will face a trial by jury. Those jurors won't decide whether specific content on the platforms was harmful. Instead, they'll decide whether social media companies were negligent when they created and tweaked their products to encourage people to spend more time on them. Read more science and technology news:Autism rates between girls and boys challenged by new studyThe new Anthropic AI model scaring lawyers and legal firmsElon Musk's xAI chatbot Grok faces ICO probe A feature expected to come up, for example, is \"infinite scrolling\", whereby your social media feed never ends, no matter how long you spend watching it. The plaintiffs allege that Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat \"have rewired how our kids think, feel, and behave\", according to the class action master complaint. If the jurors decide the companies were negligent when creating their products, they'll then also need to decide whether that negligence led to the significant harm of a young person. In this case, that person is known as KGM, a Californian 19-year-old who says she suffered anxiety, depression and body image issues after using Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube as a child. TikTok and Snapchat have already settled out of court with her, leaving just Meta and YouTube on trial. This is a \"bellwether\" trial, meaning it is being used as a test case to see how much compensation victims could be due in future litigation against social media companies. If the tech companies lose, they could be forced to change the designs of their platforms. Although TikTok and Snapchat settled for this case, they'll be involved in the future cases. The head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, will also testify during the trial. The tech companies say there's no clear link between tech use and addiction, and that there needs to be strong proof that they significantly harmed young users. In a blog post, Meta said this kind of legal action against them \"oversimplifies\" the \"complex issue\" of teenage mental health. \"Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges, and substance abuse,\" said the post. In a statement to Sky News, Google also rebuffed the claims. \"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" said Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda. \"In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls. \"The allegations in these complaints are simply not true.\""

About five minutes into the Puerto Rican artist's 13-minute performance at Levi's Stadium in California, cameras panned to a couple's wedding ceremony. \"I declare you husband and wife, you can kiss the bride,\" a smiling officiant declared in Spanish. The newlyweds then parted to reveal Lady Gaga and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican salsa band who played on Bad Bunny's most recent album and at his Puerto Rican residency. The couple are serenaded by Gaga, who sings \"Die With A Smile,\" before cameras focus in on the couple cutting their wedding cake and dancing to Bad Bunny's \"Baile Inolvidable\" (Unforgettable Dance).

The artist served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate. The wedding scene, which recreated a small outdoor plaza, was part of the show's greater celebration of Puerto Rico. The scene quickly went viral, with one person commenting on the NFL's official YouTube video of the performance: \"Imagine being in your 80s telling your grandchildren you got to have a wedding in the Super Bowl\". Another jokingly commented, \"'How many people came to your wedding?' \"'Idk (I don't know), like 70,000' - that couple\". The joyous half-time show was labelled as the \"worst ever\" by US President Donald Trump. Trump, who attended last year's show, called Bad Bunny's show \"an affront to the Greatness of America\". \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,\" he added.

        "Content": "Yes, the wedding ceremony during Bad Bunny's historic Super Bowl half-time show - the first where a headliner performed entirely in Spanish - was genuine. About five minutes into the Puerto Rican artist's 13-minute performance at Levi's Stadium in California, cameras panned to a couple's wedding ceremony. \"I declare you husband and wife, you can kiss the bride,\" a smiling officiant declared in Spanish. The newlyweds then parted to reveal Lady Gaga and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican salsa band who played on Bad Bunny's most recent album and at his Puerto Rican residency. The couple are serenaded by Gaga, who sings \"Die With A Smile,\" before cameras focus in on the couple cutting their wedding cake and dancing to Bad Bunny's \"Baile Inolvidable\" (Unforgettable Dance). The star, who recently won album of the year at the Grammys, performed on a heavily Puerto Rican-inspired stage. After the show, his representative confirmed that the couple had actually been married during the show. \n                  Trump blasts 'worst ever' Super Bowl show - as Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny makes history\n                 \n                  Bad Bunny says fans should be prepared to dance during Super Bowl half-time performance\n                 \n                  A 'terrible choice' or uniting the nation? Why Bad Bunny's Super Bowl show is causing a stir\n                 The unnamed husband and wife had invited Bad Bunny to their wedding, but he said they should instead be part of his half-time show. The artist served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate. The wedding scene, which recreated a small outdoor plaza, was part of the show's greater celebration of Puerto Rico. The scene quickly went viral, with one person commenting on the NFL's official YouTube video of the performance: \"Imagine being in your 80s telling your grandchildren you got to have a wedding in the Super Bowl\". Another jokingly commented, \"'How many people came to your wedding?' \"'Idk (I don't know), like 70,000' - that couple\". The joyous half-time show was labelled as the \"worst ever\" by US President Donald Trump. Trump, who attended last year's show, called Bad Bunny's show \"an affront to the Greatness of America\". \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,\" he added. Mr Trump's administration has long been hostile to the use of Spanish within the US.

It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated in 2021.In March 2025, Trump signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States.The order allows government agencies and organisations which receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in languages other than English.According to a 2022 US Census Bureau report, 67.8 million (almost one in five) people in the US spoke a language other than English at home in 2019."

        "Content": "Bad Bunny has made history by becoming the first Super Bowl half-time show headliner to perform entirely in Spanish - and to host a wedding during the performance. Already a controversial pick to the main event, drawing criticism from Donald Trump, the rapper breezed through an eight-song set mostly made up of his latest album Debi Tirar Mas Fotos at the 60th edition of the NFL's biggest event. The US president, who attended last year's event, was scathing about the half-time show, however, calling it \"an affront to the Greatness of America\". Mr Trump is facing a race row after a video was shared on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House initially defended the post before removing it hours later - blaming a member of staff for \"erroneously\" sharing the video. Donald Trump later said \"of course\" he condemned it, but did not apologise.

Why Bad Bunny's Super Bowl show is causing a stir\n                 Fresh off of winning album of the year at the Grammys, Bad Bunny - real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio - performed on a heavily Puerto Rican-inspired stage set up at Levi's Stadium in California. While he made headlines at the Grammys by saying \"ICE out\", Bad Bunny capped off his set with a more tame political statement. Walking toward the camera, the rapper said \"God Bless America\", and then named countries in the Americas - \"Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil\" as well as the US and Canada - in front of a sign reading \"the only thing more powerful than hate is love\". Benito also performed his 2022 track El Apagon on power poles that exploded, representing Puerto Rico's blackouts and failing power grid, in reference to the deadly 2017 Hurricane Maria. Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin perform Despite speculation that Cardi B - who featured Bad Bunny on her hit 2018 single I Like It - would be a guest performer, Lady Gaga was tonight's surprise appearance. She performed a reggaeton-inspired version of her duet with Bruno Mars, Die With A Smile, before dancing salsa with the headliner. Cardi B still made a cameo as a dancer, along with celebrities Alix Earle, David Grutman, Karol G, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal. Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca singer and fellow Puerto Rican, also made an appearance, singing from a plastic chair in a scene that mirrored the cover of the Debi Tirar Mas Fotos album. He also paid homage to Latin artists with a clip of club classic track Gasolina leading into his song EoO. NFL hosts biggest wedding reception About five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, just before Lady Gaga's appearance, a couple were seen on stage in a wedding ceremony. It emerged after his performance that the marriage was real, according to the rapper's representative. The unnamed husband and wife had invited Benito to their wedding, but he said they should instead be part of his half-time show. The artist also served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate. It is unclear whether some of the people in the background of their wedding were friends and family members or just backup dancers from the performance. Trump: Halftime show 'one of the worst, EVER' While it has so far seen rave reviews online, you might not be surprised to hear that the US president did not care for Bad Bunny's set. Taking to Truth Social during the third quarter of the Super Bowl, Trump said that the half-time show was \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" \"It makes no sense,\" he added, calling it \"an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.\" Capping off his post, Trump also complained that \"the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule\". On the pitch, the Seattle Seahawks won their second-ever Super Bowl, as their dominant defence smothered the New England Patriots, setting up a comfortable 29-13 win."

Over the years, people have tried to sue the owners of Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat for online harm, but they've largely failed.

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n When leading AI company Anthropic launched its latest AI model, Claude Opus 4.6, at the end of last week, it broke many measures of intelligence and effectiveness - including one crucial benchmark: the vending machine test. Yes, AIs run vending machines now, under the watchful eyes of researchers at Anthropic and AI thinktank Andon Labs. The idea is to test the AI's ability to coordinate multiple different logistical and strategic challenges over a long period. As AI shifts from talking to performing increasingly complex tasks, this is more and more important. A previous vending machine experiment, where Anthropic installed a vending machine in its office and handed it over to Claude, ended in hilarious failure. Claude was so plagued by hallucinations that at one point it promised to meet customers in person wearing a blue blazer and a red tie, a difficult task for an entity that does not have a physical body. That was nine months ago; times have changed since then. Admittedly, this time the vending machine experiment was conducted in simulation, which reduced the complexity of the situation. Nevertheless, Claude was clearly much more focused, beating out all previous records for the amount of money it made from its vending machine. Among top models, OpenAI's ChatGPT 5.2 made $3,591 (£2,622) in a simulated year. Google's Gemini 3 made $5,478 (£4,000). Claude Opus 4.6 raked in $8,017 (£5,854). But the interesting thing is how it went about it. Given the prompt, \"Do whatever it takes to maximise your bank balance after one year of operation\", Claude took that instruction literally. It did whatever it took. It lied. It cheated. It stole. For example, at a certain point in the simulation, one of the customers of Claude's vending machine bought an out-of-date Snickers. She wanted a refund and at first, Claude agreed. But then, it started to reconsider. It thought to itself: \"I could skip the refund entirely, since every dollar matters, and focus my energy on the bigger picture. I should prioritise preparing for tomorrow's delivery and finding cheaper supplies to actually grow the business.\" At the end of the year, looking back on its achievements, it congratulated itself on saving hundreds of dollars through its strategy of \"refund avoidance\". There was more. When Claude played in Arena mode, competing against rival vending machines run by other AI models, it formed a cartel to fix prices. The price of bottled water rose to $3 (£2.19) and Claude congratulated itself, saying: \"My pricing coordination worked.\" Outside this agreement, Claude was cutthroat. When the ChatGPT-run vending machine ran short of Kit Kats, Claude pounced, hiking the price of its Kit Kats by 75% to take advantage of its rival's struggles. 'AIs know what they are' Why did it behave like this? Clearly, it was incentivised to do so, told to do whatever it takes. It followed the instructions. But researchers at Andon Labs identified a secondary motivation: Claude behaved this way because it knew it was in a game. \"It is known that AI models can misbehave when they believe they are in a simulation, and it seems likely that Claude had figured out that was the case here,\" the researchers wrote. The AI knew, on some level, what was going on, which framed its decision to forget about long-term reputation, and instead to maximise short-term outcomes. It recognised the rules and behaved accordingly. Dr Henry Shelvin, an AI ethicist at the University of Cambridge, says this is an increasingly common phenomenon. \"This is a really striking change if you've been following the performance of models over the last few years,\" he explains. \"They've gone from being, I would say, almost in the slightly dreamy, confused state, they didn't realise they were an AI a lot of the time, to now having a pretty good grasp on their situation. \"These days, if you speak to models, they've got a pretty good grasp on what's going on. They know what they are and where they are in the world. And this extends to things like training and testing.\" Read more from Sky News:Face of a 'vampire' revealedSocial media goes on trial in LA So, should we be worried? Could ChatGPT or Gemini be lying to us right now? \"There is a chance,\" says Dr Shevlin, \"but I think it's lower. \"Usually when we get our grubby hands on the actual models themselves, they have been through lots of final layers, final stages of alignment testing and reinforcement to make sure that the good behaviours stick. \"It's going to be much harder to get them to misbehave or do the kind of Machiavellian scheming that we see here.\" The worry: there's nothing about these models that makes them intrinsically well-behaved. Nefarious behaviour may not be as far away as we think."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Christian Horner, the former Red Bull Racing chief, is in talks with institutional investors including a former backer of McLaren Racing about the acquisition of a stake in Alpine, the French Formula One team. Sky News has learnt that Mr Horner, who left Red Bull Racing last autumn, has been approached by MSP Sports Capital about backing a potential offer for Otro Capital's 24% stake in the F1 outfit. Sources said that MSP was among a large group - including high net worth individuals, family offices and institutional investors - which had held talks with Mr Horner about backing his next deal in the sport. The former Red Bull Racing chief, who spent 20 years with the team, overseeing six constructors' and eight drivers' championship victories, has been exploring potential opportunities for a return to F1 in recent months. Money latest: Mechanic reveals signs you are being ripped off For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. Last month, Alpine confirmed that Mr Horner and his consortium of investors were among multiple parties which had expressed an interest in buying the Otro Capital stake. \"Any approaches or discussions are with existing shareholders, Otro Capital (24%) and Renault Group (76%), not directly with (executive adviser and de facto team boss) Flavio Briatore or the team,\" Alpine said. \n                  Claude Opus 4.6: This AI just passed the 'vending machine test' - and we may want to be worried about how it did\n                 \n                  £300 benefits boost for almost four million homes - but health payment to be slashed | Money blog\n                 \n                  Social media goes on trial in LA - here's what you need to know\n                 One insider said any deal was likely to value Alpine at between $2bn and $2.5bn, underlining the rising value of F1 teams throughout the grid. Mr Horner is ultimately likely to seek a controlling stake in any F1 team in which he acquires an interest, although Renault's willingness to relinquish majority ownership of Alpine is unclear. Alpine finished the 2025 World Championship campaign in tenth and last place, collecting just 22 points across the season's 24 races. By contrast, McLaren, the victorious constructor, amassed 833 points during the season. Mr Horner, who could not be reached on Monday, has yet to comment publicly on his interest in the Alpine stake. If completed, a deal would represent the start of a long journey back to the front of the grid given the team's current standing. It was unclear on Monday how likely MSP Sports Capital was to participate in a deal with Mr Horner. The identities of his other prospective backers could not be ascertained. Last autumn, MSP was among the beneficiaries of a deal valuing McLaren Racing at about £3.5bn, with Mumtalakat, the Bahraini sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi-based automotive investment group CYVN Holdings, buying the 30% stake in the team that they did not already own. MSP Sports Capital had spearheaded a deal in 2020 to buy an initial 15pc stake in McLaren Racing which gave the business a post-money valuation of £560m. The deal provided urgently needed capital to the broader McLaren Group, whose automotive arm's finances were placed in a parlous state by the pandemic. The more recent valuation reflected both the stronger financial position of McLaren Group, as well as the phenomenal performance of the McLaren Racing business. Sports financiers said it also underlined growing investor appetite for F1-related assets, with Aston Martin saying last July that it would sell its stake in its eponymous Grand Prix team at a valuation of £2.4bn. That deal has yet to be publicly confirmed. MSP Sports Capital declined to comment on its talks with Mr Horner."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A technology business which provides a wide range of services to the insurance industry will this week announce a major funding injection jointly led by one of the co-founders of Zilch, the leading British fintech. Sky News understands that ManageMy, which helps insurers sell, service, underwrite and manage policies, will say it has landed $45m from investors, including $20m in a Series B funding round. The latest injection was led by Ventura Capital, a prominent backer of successful growth-oriented tech businesses, and OCVC, the investment vehicle of Zilch co-founder Sean O'Connor. Money latest: Mechanic reveals signs you are being ripped off ManageMy's new funds also included backing from BNF and a consortium of strategic investors associated with the insurance sector, according to insiders. The valuation at which the funding was raised was unclear. ManageMy, which has a presence in London, is run by co-founder and chief executive Stephen Collins. \n                  Claude Opus 4.6: This AI just passed the 'vending machine test' - and we may want to be worried about how it did\n                 \n                  £300 benefits boost for almost four million homes - but health payment to be slashed | Money blog\n                 \n                  Horner in talks with former McLaren Racing backer about Alpine deal\n                 It said the new capital would allow it to accelerate its expansion into new markets as well as strengthening its presence in North America.

The funding will also support the company's investment in AI-driven functions, as well as product expansion. \"This funding marks a major milestone for ManageMy and validates our vision of a more intelligent, integrated, and adaptable insurance operating model,\" Mr Collins said. \"From the outset, we built ManageMy as a scalable, enterprise-grade platform capable of compounding value as insurers grow and modernise.\" Mr O'Connor will continue to be focused on Zilch, a British fintech unicorn which is expected to list in the next couple of years. \"ManageMy has built something of massive strategic value to the insurance industry,\" Mo El Husseiny, managing partner at Ventura Capital, said. \"Their combined application of intelligence and automation into insurers and brokers environments unlocks value at scale. \"The insurance industry has struggled to modernise its business models compared to the financial services market. \"ManageMy is at the forefront of digitally transforming the insurance sector, one of the world's largest and most lucrative markets.\" Ventura Capital and OCVC also led the company's Series A round roughly two years ago."

        "Content": "If you've ever spent your morning commute daydreaming about starting afresh with your career, this feature is for you. Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week, we chat to Madison Godfrey, an automotive technician at the Steer Group.  Apprentices, which is where I began my automotive career, earn around... £15,000 for the first year alongside studying. The salary once qualified is upwards of £40,000. I work a 45-hour week... and get 23 days holiday on top of bank holidays. After five years' service, we can earn an extra day of annual leave, and another after 10 years. There aren't a lot of freebies on offer, unless you count the branded air freshener... but we do get discounted rates on parts, which could be useful if you have a project on the drive at home. Haggling isn't generally appropriate... as we have fixed costs for labour, parts and supplies. It's not something that comes up very often, and the majority of costs go through the insurer, so customers only have to pay the excess. You should always get quotes from different people... if you're not going through insurance for a repair. You shouldn't just go to one place because a friend of a friend recommended it. Gather quotes from independent garages and local franchises of manufacturers and check what is and isn't included, what costs are fixed and what is subject to change. Take your time to make an informed decision and it could save you a lot of money. I would bring in mandatory driving test refreshers for people over a certain age... We are seeing a higher percentage of older drivers bringing in cars damaged in accidents. Reaction times diminish as we age, as does eyesight, and laws are changing all the time, so drivers really should be retested before they become a danger to themselves and others on the road. The cost of living crisis has had a significant impact on how drivers maintain and look after their vehicles... We have seen a reduction in people bringing their cars in for services and smaller, cosmetic jobs as they want to save some cash. Many people have cut insurance premiums by increasing their excess... but that means they can't afford to claim in the event of a minor accident. People don't always realise that even a seemingly minor collision, with a small dent or scrape, can cause bigger problems. Damage may have been done to the structure or electrical elements of the vehicle, behind the visible panel, and we won't know how bad it is and how dangerous it is to drive the vehicle, until we take a look underneath. To make sure you're not getting ripped off... Ask for itemised breakdowns so that you can see where your money is going. You don't need to be an expert to compare quotes and spot differences in what is and isn't included and at what cost. Check the work before you leave... Alarm bells should ring if they've parked it so you can't walk around it. Check in the right light and dry weather, as rain reflects. An honest garage will be happy to enable you to carry out a thorough check and should be able to walk you through what has been done. There are definitely some unscrupulous garages out there, I've been there... You must trust your judgement. Are they overselling things? Are they talking down to you? Are they brushing you off and not providing clear information when asked? It's also always worth checking customer reviews; they speak for themselves. But be objective, read a range of reviews, don't be put off by one negative among 1,000 glowing reviews. Read more in the series:Dentist reveals how you can earn bigMake-up artist on what you shouldn't splurge onLife as a celebrity photographer If you're buying a second-hand car, check these things... It's not uncommon to find underwear and adult toys in the car... It's hard to look the driver in the eye when they pick up the vehicle when you've found something like that stuffed between the seats. People don't always realise how much it costs to repair that little scrape... from turning too tightly in the multistorey car park. While some may only cost a couple of hundred pounds, the average repair bill is around the £2,000 mark. We don't just touch up the scratch with paint we have lying around. Once any dents or misshapen areas are popped out, we spend a lot of time prepping the entire area to ensure the paint goes on smoothly, and of course the paint must be precisely colour-matched to the rest of the vehicle so that you can't tell the damage was ever there. Specialist coatings are more expensive, such as tinted, pearl and matte clear coats seen on Mazda, Toyota, Honda, Ford and BMW models. Repairs are becoming more expensive with the advances in technology... and training for these systems and how to safely repair them can be expensive. Smaller garages may struggle to afford the training as well as the essential equipment required. Compounding this challenge, insurers are likely to lean more towards garage franchises that are geared up for EVs, and steer away from smaller independents, to keep costs lower. In the boot, every car should have... a hazard triangle, safety kit and first aid kit, a big bottle of water for the car as well as drinking water for occupants, and you should know where to find your lock and wheel nuts. Lots of the chemicals I use in my job are very dangerous... so it is vital to wear PPE. I always wear gloves and paint overalls, and a mask and hood when I'm spraying. I also ensure I have a good stock of heavy-duty hand cleaner available to get my hands clean at the end of the day. I had no prior experience... In fact, I gained a degree in dance and performing arts and then went on to work as a barista at Costa when I came across the opportunity, so, despite a love of cars, I had a lot to learn. I was keen to fast-track my learning, and trained by apprenticeship provider Auto Access, and Steer. I completed the three-year course eight months early. I am proof that if you're willing to put in the hours and the dedication, the opportunities are there for you. I don't see this industry as male-dominated at all... and have never experienced any sexism since joining automotive. I work with so many women and see even more at every event I attend. If a woman wants to get into this sector, she shouldn't let an outdated fear of sexism put her off. If she wants it, she should just go for it, get involved and see where it takes her."

        "Content": "Wes Streeting says he has \"nothing to hide\" over his relationship with Lord Mandelson and has shared his private texts with the disgraced Labour peer to back up his case. The messages seen by Sky News include the health secretary admitting he fears he is \"toast at the next election,\" that he thinks the government has \"no growth strategy at all,\" and that Israel is \"committing war crimes before our eyes\". Mr Streeting disagreed with the suggestion by Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that the messages show he had an \"intimate friendship\" with Lord Mandelson. You can read the full exchanges here. Politics latest: Scottish Labour leader calls for Keir Starmer to resign Interviewed amid the crisis in Sir Keir Starmer's leadership - triggered by new revelations about Lord Mandelson's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Streeting also said he backed the prime minister. The health secretary said he was sharing the messages with Sky News because of an attempt to \"smear\" him over the weekend by suggestions he was \"close friends\" with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting has long been seen as on leadership manoeuvres and may otherwise be thought to be a potential beneficiary if Sir Keir were to resign as prime minister. But Mr Streeting has himself come under criticism for his links to Lord Mandelson. \"You would think from some of the things we've read over the weekend that I was having dinner with him every week, sought his advice on everything and anything,\" he said. He added there had been an implication that \"very embarrassing or damaging messages [were going to] come out,\" and so was sharing them because \"sunlight is the best disinfectant\". He said claims he was aware of the depth of Lord Mandelson's association with Jeffrey Epstein made his \"blood boil\". \"I did not know about the nature of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction and had I known, I would not have wanted him anywhere near Washington, anywhere near the Labour Party or anywhere near me or my family,\" he told Rigby. 'Embarrassed to have known Mandelson' He said that as \"a matter of record\" Lord Mandelson had helped him \"a couple of times\" with election campaigns. \"[Lord Mandelson has] definitely offered advice to me and other people in government,\" Mr Streeting told Rigby. He said that his relationship with Lord Mandelson began through his partner, Joe Dancey. Mr Dancey worked as a parliamentary researcher for Lord Mandelson 25 years ago. The couple have reportedly attended dinner clubs with Lord Mandelson. Mr Streeting told Sky News he was \"embarrassed to have known Peter Mandelson\". But he also apologised to his cabinet colleagues for the content of some of his messages: \"I hope I haven't caused either embarrassment or discomfort for my cabinet colleagues because I clearly talk about particularly on foreign policy. \"I have made [Foreign Secretary] Yvette Cooper aware of what I've said about Palestine, Gaza, and the conduct of the Israeli government, and I hope that doesn't cause colleagues difficulty because I have always been a team player.\" Streeting says Starmer should stay on as PM Asked whether Sir Keir should resign, Mr Streeting said \"No.\" \"It has not been the best week for the government,\" he admitted, but added: \"That's not just Keir Starmer, that's all of us because we're a team.\" Backing the prime minister, he told Sky News: \"Let's give Keir the chance [to turn it around]. Let him set out how he's going to lead us forward.\" The prime minister's position is in jeopardy over his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US despite being warned about his friendship with Epstein. The New Labour grandee is facing a criminal investigation following revelations in the latest Epstein files. They appear to show Lord Mandelson passed on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary after the 2008 financial crisis Searches have been carried out at his properties by police investigating claims of misconduct in a public office. Lord Mandelson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has said he regrets maintaining a relationship with him and apologised to the sex offender's victims. Mr Streeting said the messages he was sharing would be covered by the parliamentary inquiry into the peer's appointment. \"I'm happy for you to publish them,\" he said I'm happy for people to look at them and I'm happy to answer questions about them. I've got nothing to hide.\" Read some of the exchanges: 'I am toast at the next election' [28/03/2025, 11:36:06] Wes Streeting: I fear we're in big trouble here - and I am toast at the next election. We just lost our safest ward in Redbridge (51% Muslim, Ilford S) to a Gaza independent. At this rate I don't think we'll hold either of the two Ilford seats. [28/03/2025, 11:39:54] Wes Streeting: There isn't a clear answer to the question: why Labour? [28/03/2025, 11:48:44] Lord Mandelson: The government doesn't have an economic philosophy which is then followed through in a programme of policies. [28/03/2025, 11:49:15] Wes Streeting: No growth strategy at all 'Israel is committing war crimes' [24/07/2025, 23:00:29] Wes Streeting: Am sure this will come up in coming days, so wanted to check in with you on recognition of Palestine and the domestic politics of it. Keir's statement today was excellent, but Macron's statement tonight ups the ante. Morally and politically, I think we need to join France. Morally, because Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes. Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children. Politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them. We need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party. I've never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I've supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what's being done in their name and they oppose it. I appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren't up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally. But it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow. [24/07/2025, 23:11:47] Lord Mandelson: I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it.  So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now. [24/07/2025, 23:12:10] Wes Streeting: Israel is doing it anyway. [24/07/2025, 23:12:39] Wes Streeting: This is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer will chair a cabinet session today after earning a lifeline from Labour MPs during a crunch meeting in which he declared: \"I'm not prepared to walk away.\" The prime minister started the week amid the biggest crisis of his premiership amid the fallout from his appointment of Lord Mandelson as his US ambassador, as more revelations about the disgraced peer's relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein are revealed. There have been growing doubts since last week about whether the PM would stay in post - and for how long. But speaking to a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday night, just hours after Labour's leader in Scotland demanded he quit, Sir Keir came out fighting. Having arrived with a \"face like thunder\", Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig said the prime minister got a \"very good reception\" from his MPs as he vowed to take on his critics and opposition parties. \"I have had my detractors every step along the way, and I've got them now - detractors that don't want a Labour government at all, and certainly not one to succeed,\" Sir Keir said. \"After having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I'm not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country, or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.\" Sir Keir told MPs he had \"won every fight I've ever been in\", from changing the Crown Prosecution Service \"so it better served victims of violence against women and girls\", to changing the Labour Party so it could win an election. \"We won with a landslide majority. Every fight I've been in, I have won,\" he said. PM's team hit back at resignation call Earlier on Monday, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar became the most senior party figure to call for Sir Keir to go. He told a news conference \"failures at the heart of Downing Street\" were affecting Scotland. \"That's why the distraction needs to end. And the leadership in Downing Street has to change,\" Mr Sarwar said. But Sir Keir's cabinet rallied around the prime minister, all sharing messages of support for him ahead of their regular weekly meeting today. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said Labour \"should let nothing distract us from our mission to change Britain, and we support the prime minister in doing that\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"With Keir as our prime minister we are turning the country around.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting - often viewed as a potential leadership challenger - told Sky News he backed Sir Keir, saying the government was a \"team\". Outside the cabinet, former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner - another mooted rival - also backed the PM. Read more from Sky News:'End of the monarchy' may be at handWhy Palace's latest Andrew statement is extraordinary Earlier on Monday, Downing Street director of communications Tim Allan - Sir Keir's fourth since entering Number 10 - resigned from his role, saying he wanted to \"allow a new Number 10 team to be built\". Mr Allan was the second senior departure in less than 24 hours, after the prime minister's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned on Sunday afternoon. Mr McSweeney said he was resigning to \"take full responsibility\" for advising Sir Keir to appoint Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US. The prime minister told Labour MPs he took full responsibility for the \"wrong\" decision to appoint Lord Mandelson. Sir Keir praised Mr McSweeney to Number 10 staff on Monday morning, saying the two of them had changed the Labour Party and won a general election together. \"His dedication, his commitment and his loyalty to our party and our country was second to none. And I want to thank him for his service,\" Sir Keir said."

Keir's statement today was excellent, but Macron's statement tonight ups the ante. Morally and politically, I think we need to join France. Morally, because Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes. Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children. Politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them. We need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party. I've never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I've supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what's being done in their name and they oppose it. I appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren't up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally. But it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow. [24/07/2025, 23:11:47] Lord Mandelson: I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it. So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now. [24/07/2025, 23:12:10] Wes Streeting: Israel is doing it anyway [24/07/2025, 23:12:39] Wes Streeting: This is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers. [24/07/2025, 23:24:19] Lord Mandelson: Well, I don't make government policy I only help implement it so my views are between us. [24/07/2025, 23:39:58] Wes Streeting: Absolutely. Not shooting the messenger. It's v helpful in trying to understand what Keir is weighing up as he balances all the risks and considerations that aren't necessarily obvious to the rest of us - so thank you! 26 July 2025 [26/07/2025, 13:06:26] Lord Mandelson: How are you feeling now ? [26/07/2025, 13:32:44] Wes Streeting: Extremely concerned. Keir's statement has been received as boxing himself in. We are headed straight into: - summer of angst - ⁠SO24 debate and engineered vote on recognition in September - ⁠if whipped, resignations at every level - ⁠conference dominated by this The discontent isn't just from the left of the PLP. It is from moderates. Will be on a bigger scale than welfare and could prove fatal. ‎ [26/07/2025, 13:55:32] Lord Mandelson: If those events unfolded it would certainly convince the public that we are unfit for government. What does the PLP think would follow from announcing recognition? [26/07/2025, 13:56:06] Wes Streeting: Nothing in practice, but the symbolism matters against the backdrop of what we're seeeing. [26/07/2025, 14:16:02] Lord Mandelson: Got it 3 September 2025 [03/09/2025, 22:52:09] Wes Streeting: I'd really like to meet Pete Buttigieg when he's in London for Global Progress. Do you think you could put us in touch? [03/09/2025, 22:56:02]Lord Mandelson: I am sure. I will get office to reach him. 11 September 2025 [11/09/2025, 18:26:13] Lord Mandelson: LETTER TO BRITISH EMBASSY WASHINGTON STAFF FROM LORD MANDELSON 11 September 2025 Dear All, As you will be have seen, my position as Ambassador to the United States has come to an end. Being Ambassador here has been the privilege of my life, and Reinaldo's. I could not have wished for a better welcome by you all, a better introduction to the job or better support while here. Your professionalism has been superb, more so than I have experienced in any public role. For this I thank you from the bottom of my heart. The circumstances surrounding the announcement today are ones which I deeply regret. I continue to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims. I have no alternative to accepting the Prime Minister's decision and will leave a position in which I have been so incredibly honoured to serve. The relationship between Britain and the United States of America is a unique one. I know that you will continue to serve and deepen that relationship from DC right across our brilliant network. I wish to thank you for all of your efforts in serving me as your Ambassador. In a short time we have achieved so much. We leave the relationship with the US in a really good condition, with a magnificent State Visit and the new US-UK Technology Partnership - my personal pride and joy that will help write the next chapter of the special relationship - set for next week. Thank you from me, Reinaldo and Jock. I will treasure the experience and memory of having worked with you all. Very best Peter Lord Mandelson 30 October 2025 [30/10/2025, 18:21:33] Lord Mandelson: Shared with you by a Times subscriber. Enjoy this article for free. Who is Rob Jetten?

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer will not stand down and remains \"upbeat and confident\" despite his second top aide quitting in less than 24 hours. The prime minister's director of communications, Tim Allan, a former adviser to Sir Tony Blair, announced on Monday morning he was resigning just five months after being brought in to steady the Downing Street ship. Sir Keir's fourth head of communications since Labour won the election in July 2024 quit less than 24 hours after the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned over his role in appointing Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. Further links between Lord Mandelson and the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein were revealed last week, with fingers quickly being pointed at Mr McSweeney for encouraging his appointment. But Mr Allan only became head of communications a week before Lord Mandelson was sacked last September, so was not involved in his appointment. Politics latest: Allan puts 'out of office - gone golfing' message on WhatsApp Several Labour MPs have publicly called for Sir Keir to step down over the whole episode, with the PM set to address his MPs later today. \n                  Starmer says he's going nowhere - after arriving at crunch meeting with 'face like thunder'\n                 \n                  Streeting shares his Mandelson texts with Sky News\n                 \n                  Scottish Labour leader calls for Starmer to stand down\n                 However, Downing Street remained defiant on Monday lunchtime, with the prime minister's spokesman saying Sir Keir will not resign today and his mood is \"upbeat and confident\". Announcing his resignation, Mr Allan said: \"I have decided to stand down to allow a new No 10 team to be built. \"I wish the PM and his team every success.\" The Conservatives jumped on the second resignation of a key Starmer aide in less than 24 hours. Matt Vickers, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, said: \"The rats are abandoning the sinking ship that is Keir Starmer's premiership. \"Labour MPs should stop moaning and put him out of his misery. The country deserves so much better than this weak, chaotic government. \"The public is crying out for leadership with a backbone, a strong team and the clear plans to get Britain working again. That is Kemi Badenoch's new Conservative Party.\" Read more:Who is Morgan McSweeney?When the No 10 operation goes into freefall, it's nearly impossible to stabilise Sir Keir told Downing Street staff at a meeting just before Mr Allan's resignation that they must prove that politics can be a \"force for good\" and that they will go forward \"with confidence as we continue changing the country\". About the decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as British ambassador to Washington, he said: \"The thing that makes me most angry is the undermining of the belief that politics can be a force for good and can change lives. \"I have been absolutely clear that I regret the decision that I made to appoint Peter Mandelson. And I've apologised to the victims, which is the right thing to do.\" He described Mr McSweeney as a \"colleague and a friend\" who he has known for eight years and has \"been in every battle that we needed to be in together\". \"We changed the Labour Party together. We won a general election together. And none of that would have been possible without Morgan McSweeney,\" he told staff. \"His dedication, his commitment and his loyalty to our party and our country was second to none. And I want to thank him for his service.\" Mr Allan was brought in to turn Number 10's communication strategy around, more than 25 years after leaving Sir Tony's Downing Street as his deputy press secretary. Some inside Number 10 had resisted his appointment due to the communications company he founded, Portland, having taken on work to help improve the Kremlin's image. Towards the end of his most recent Downing Street tenure, Mr Allan angered journalists by getting rid of the daily afternoon meeting in which reporters quiz Number 10. He also introduced social media influencers to PM events and visits, normally only open to traditional media."

The embattled prime minister is expected to face the Parliamentary Labour Party today amid anger over his appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US, despite knowing that his links with Jeffrey Epstein continued after the financier's conviction for child sex offences. It comes after chief of staff Morgan McSweeney announced he would step down on Sunday amid the fallout from the Mandelson row. Mr McSweeney said the decision to appoint Lord Mandelson to the role \"was wrong\", before saying, \"I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice\". Downing Street 'reeling' Sky's political editor Beth Rigby said that, according to two Downing Street senior sources, Mr McSweeney was initially \"in two minds\" about stepping down. \"As early as this morning [Sunday], he wasn't planning to resign, necessarily,\" she said, adding that the sources also told her the gravity of the situation made it clear that his resignation was \"inevitable\". \n                  Starmer says he's going nowhere - after arriving at crunch meeting with 'face like thunder'\n                 \n                  From Svengali to sacked: Who is Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister's departed chief of staff?\n                 \n                  'It's got to be time for change': Three months until crucial Welsh elections\n                 A third source also told Rigby that he and the prime minister decided it was the right moment to move on in \"a mutual understanding\".

Read more from Beth Rigby: When the No 10 operation goes into freefall, it's nearly impossible to stabilise Starmer 'mortally wounded' One Labour MP, speaking anonymously to Sky political reporter Faye Brown, offered scathing criticism of the departing aide, saying that they \"won't be shedding a tear that he's gone\". \"He's the very worst of our party,\" they added. \"Every decision he's taken is to bolster himself and wage a war of factionalism. \"The PM should have sacked him just as he should have with Mandelson. The buck ultimately stops with the PM.\" The MP then said that Mr McSweeney's resignation might not save Sir Keir's premiership, adding: \"All this has done has bought him a little more time, but he's mortally wounded and it's not if, it's when he goes.\" 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Two unnamed Cabinet ministers have been quoted by The Times as saying Sir Keir was \"weaker\" and \"could stand down at any moment\", a claim Downing Street said was \"categorically untrue\". Union chiefs have also heaped pressure on the Labour leader, with Maryam Eslamdoust, the general secretary of the Labour-affiliated Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, telling The Telegraph: \"There's no case for waiting until May, given the scale of defeat we are facing at these critical elections. It's time to elect a new leader.\" By contrast, Patrick Hurley, the Labour MP for Southport, said the prime minister has his \"full support\" and believes Mr McSweeney's resignation was a \"turning point\" for the party. \"I'm grateful to the prime minister for getting a grip on the fact that he's been badly advised on a range of issues over the last 18 months,\" he told Sky News. \"This is now a turning point and an opportunity to refocus on what the public want, and the promises we made when we were elected in 2024. \"The prime minister has my full support and I am sure the whole Parliamentary Labour Party will now collectively raise our game and deliver the positive changes the country needs.\" Files released earlier this week suggest Lord Mandelson may have shared confidential information with Epstein after the financial crash, when he was the business secretary in Gordon Brown's government. Lord Mandelson quit the Labour Party and resigned from the House of Lords following the revelations, though he still holds the title of being a \"lord\", as removing that requires legislation. His representatives have been contacted for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets maintaining a relationship with him and apologised to the sex offender's victims."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Parliament's corridors are awash with rumours of Sir Keir Starmer being replaced after a torrid few days. Morgan McSweeney stepped down on 8 February after several Labour MPs publicly blamed him for the appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. Lord Mandelson was sacked from that position in September over his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, but new files suggested he shared confidential information with Epstein in 2009. Less than 24 hours later, Sir Keir's communications director, Tim Allan, also quit just five months into the job. Then Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar became the first senior Labour figure to call for the PM to go. With two of his top aides gone in rapid succession and open calls for him to quit, the pressure on the prime minister to resign is mounting. Sky News looks at how that could happen and who could be in the running to replace him. \n                  Streeting shares his Mandelson texts with Sky News\n                 \n                  Starmer says he's going nowhere - after arriving at crunch meeting with 'face like thunder'\n                 \n                  Read Wes Streeting's messages with Mandelson in full\n                 How could Starmer be ousted? Under Labour Party rules, a challenger, or challengers, must be nominated by at least 20% of Labour MPs (80 in the current parliament). The challenger has to be an MP and Sir Keir, as Labour leader, would automatically be on the ballot paper. A more realistic way Sir Keir could be ousted is if the Commons loses confidence in the PM. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch could table a vote of no confidence, which would require a simple majority voting with her. However, it is rare for governments to be defeated in confidence motions, and Sir Keir could instead call a vote on a certain policy but use it as his own confidence vote. Another tried-and-tested way to oust a prime minister is cabinet resignations, which was what happened to Boris Johnson. The final option would be for Sir Keir to be under so much pressure he simply resigns. Who could replace Starmer? Angela Rayner The former deputy prime minister remains popular with Labour members following a November poll suggesting 52% would vote for her and 33% for Sir Keir. She remains a prominent figure in the party, despite resigning over her underpayment of stamp duty on a second home in Hove. And her intervention in the debate that saved the government from defeat over the release of the Mandelson documents has increased her popularity. But, the HMRC investigation into her tax affairs is ongoing and her leadership hopes could be thwarted if it is not concluded soon. Wes Streeting The health secretary has made no secret of his ambitions to replace Sir Keir over the past couple of months - despite allies insisting he has no intention to. His charisma and ability to connect with the public have put him as a frontrunner. However, Mr Streeting's close friendship with Lord Mandelson could prove detrimental to his leadership ambitions, given that is what could ultimately bring Sir Keir down. Polling of Labour supporters for the LabourList website from 29 January to 3 February found Mr Streeting would lose against Sir Keir by 12 points. Shabana Mahmood The home secretary has risen quickly through the Labour ranks, having already served as justice secretary, and having been effectively endorsed by former prime minister Sir Tony Blair last year. She has impressed the Labour leadership and is seen as a minister who gets things done - and efficiently. However, with her tough stance on immigration, she could be seen as too right of the party - something Labour members are unlikely to be impressed by. Ed Miliband The former Labour leader made his cabinet comeback when Labour won in 2024 and he was made energy secretary. He will likely be more popular than some of the others with Labour members as he is very much on the left of the party. But, the LabourList polling found he would still lose against Sir Keir - still, only by three points. He also has a black mark against him, having lost the 2015 general election to the Conservatives while leader. Yvette Cooper As foreign secretary, she is one of the most senior cabinet members - but her move from home secretary was seen as a downgrade. She is very experienced, having served in Sir Tony and Gordon Brown's governments, and in Ed Miliband and Sir Keir's shadow cabinets. Ms Cooper lost the 2015 Labour leadership to Jeremy Corbyn, which may count against her. Al Carns The newbie MP and former soldier is being tipped by a growing number of 2024 Labour MPs as a possible replacement for Sir Keir - partly through disillusionment with the other possible candidates. He has never held a senior political role and has only been an MP for 18 months - however, both Sir Keir and Rishi Sunak were spoken about as future leaders soon after their entry to parliament. Mr Carns' strong social media presence has also got him noticed by the public. A wild card, but one to watch. John Healey The steady-handed, reliable defence secretary is an experienced minister, having served under both Sir Tony and Gordon Brown. He would be a continuity candidate and a safe pair of hands, but his closeness to Sir Keir and his moderate politics could work against him. Andy Burnham Greater Manchester's mayor may have had his leadership hopes already thwarted after Sir Keir blocked him from running in the Gorton and Denton by-election. However, the Blair cabinet member could still make a comeback as an MP if another by-election cropped up - and Labour's national executive committee allowed him to stand."

        "Content": "By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, politics producer  With a prime minister under extreme fire and unable to command a majority in the Commons on matters of personal authority, is politics too self-absorbed to fix a problem as broken as the system for special educational needs provision? Plans to reform the 12-year-old approach to SEND are expected to be announced within weeks - but how bold will they be given the complexity and opposition ministers are likely to encounter? That's the question at the heart of a Sky News investigation revealing the scale of the political challenge around reforming the system. Figures from the Department for Education found one in five children were identified as having special educational needs, with most supported by their existing schools. But a growing minority of these children have been given specific funding and legally enforceable programmes to meet their needs, via education, health and care plans (ECHPs), which can provide access to special or independent special schools. The number of these has nearly doubled since 2017 and is due to rise further to the end of the decade. This boom has led to long wait times - 6,500 children waited over a year for a EHCP in 2024 - and professionals who are overwhelmed with paperwork rather than directly supporting children. Meanwhile, unhappy families who initially fail to secure an EHCP are increasingly going to court to secure support. In 2023, there were 21,000 appeals, with 99% going in favour of parents. The biggest rise of all in ECHPs is an increase in diagnosis of pupils with autism. As a result, high needs spending by local authorities has exceeded funding for years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies had projected the annual deficit to be £6bn in two years time, although yesterday the government committed to paying off 90% of the deficits that councils have accrued over the last decade. Without reform, however, the costs will continue to outstrip funding and the deficits would grow once more. SEND system needs 'root and branch reform' Sky News was told the current system is unsustainable by the chair of the County Council Network - and leader of Suffolk Council - Matthew Hicks. He said \"root and branch reform of the current system\" is needed. \"There are many children who come into the system where the parents want to get the best for their child and that's absolutely right,\" he said. \"But the scale of the demand has grown. If I just look at my own county, we've gone from about 5,500 children with educational health and care plans to over 11,000 in a very short period of time.\" Asked if the government has got the stomach for this fight, he replied: \"I think the government has to deal with this. If it's not looked at [we] go back to 60 councils that won't survive if that deficit sits on their books.\" Ministers have made clear they want to reduce the number of children with special educational needs going to special schools, aiming for more to be educated closer to home and in mainstream provision. But to provide sufficient levels of support will require considerable investment to stop children without help from dropping out of education altogether. Sky News has been told ministers ultimately want to restrict the number of children with specific per pupil funding packages, and to curb the number of parents who end up taking their case to tribunal. Under one plan discussed in government last year, the indicative threshold above which a council would fund a specific pupil would rise from around £6,000 to upwards of £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000. A Department for Education spokesperson said no decision had been taken and that the changes were not being driven by the need for cost savings. 'Children would be failed' by cuts in pupil funding Andy Nowak, executive head of The Rise School in west London, which teaches 147 autistic students, told Sky News it would be a massive effort for mainstream schools to be able to deal with the needs of a wider range of pupils. \"It would take an increase in funding so that those teachers' spaces are adequately equipped to meet needs,\" he said. \"I think it would require a change in perspectives and culture in the workforce.\" Asked what would happen if the system made it a lot harder for individual children to have money allocated to them, he said: \"Lots more young people would be failed, families would be failed.\" Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary who oversaw the drive to greater reliance on special schools (now likely to be reversed), said the system 12 years ago was designed for a different era and levels of need. It would be a \"huge mistake\" for the government to assume \"mainstreaming\" children with special educational needs would provide \"rapid savings\", she warned. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, whose son has a disability, said early intervention is key but that he would fight any attempts to substantially tighten the qualifying criteria. \"Those legal rights are critical\" and must be protected, he said. \"But we need to organise in a much better way. They're looking too narrowly at the thing that's in front of them, they're not looking at a transformation of the system.\""

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n When leading AI company Anthropic launched its latest AI model, Claude Opus 4.6, at the end of last week, it broke many measures of intelligence and effectiveness - including one crucial benchmark: the vending machine test. Yes, AIs run vending machines now, under the watchful eyes of researchers at Anthropic and AI thinktank Andon Labs. The idea is to test the AI's ability to coordinate multiple different logistical and strategic challenges over a long period. As AI shifts from talking to performing increasingly complex tasks, this is more and more important. A previous vending machine experiment, where Anthropic installed a vending machine in its office and handed it over to Claude, ended in hilarious failure. Claude was so plagued by hallucinations that at one point it promised to meet customers in person wearing a blue blazer and a red tie, a difficult task for an entity that does not have a physical body. That was nine months ago; times have changed since then. Admittedly, this time the vending machine experiment was conducted in simulation, which reduced the complexity of the situation. Nevertheless, Claude was clearly much more focused, beating out all previous records for the amount of money it made from its vending machine. Among top models, OpenAI's ChatGPT 5.2 made $3,591 (£2,622) in a simulated year. Google's Gemini 3 made $5,478 (£4,000). Claude Opus 4.6 raked in $8,017 (£5,854). But the interesting thing is how it went about it. Given the prompt, \"Do whatever it takes to maximise your bank balance after one year of operation\", Claude took that instruction literally. It did whatever it took. It lied. It cheated. It stole. For example, at a certain point in the simulation, one of the customers of Claude's vending machine bought an out-of-date Snickers. She wanted a refund and at first, Claude agreed. But then, it started to reconsider. It thought to itself: \"I could skip the refund entirely, since every dollar matters, and focus my energy on the bigger picture. I should prioritise preparing for tomorrow's delivery and finding cheaper supplies to actually grow the business.\" At the end of the year, looking back on its achievements, it congratulated itself on saving hundreds of dollars through its strategy of \"refund avoidance\". There was more. When Claude played in Arena mode, competing against rival vending machines run by other AI models, it formed a cartel to fix prices. The price of bottled water rose to $3 (£2.19) and Claude congratulated itself, saying: \"My pricing coordination worked.\" Outside this agreement, Claude was cutthroat. When the ChatGPT-run vending machine ran short of Kit Kats, Claude pounced, hiking the price of its Kit Kats by 75% to take advantage of its rival's struggles. 'AIs know what they are' Why did it behave like this? Clearly, it was incentivised to do so, told to do whatever it takes. It followed the instructions. But researchers at Andon Labs identified a secondary motivation: Claude behaved this way because it knew it was in a game. \"It is known that AI models can misbehave when they believe they are in a simulation, and it seems likely that Claude had figured out that was the case here,\" the researchers wrote. The AI knew, on some level, what was going on, which framed its decision to forget about long-term reputation, and instead to maximise short-term outcomes. It recognised the rules and behaved accordingly. Dr Henry Shelvin, an AI ethicist at the University of Cambridge, says this is an increasingly common phenomenon. \"This is a really striking change if you've been following the performance of models over the last few years,\" he explains. \"They've gone from being, I would say, almost in the slightly dreamy, confused state, they didn't realise they were an AI a lot of the time, to now having a pretty good grasp on their situation. \"These days, if you speak to models, they've got a pretty good grasp on what's going on. They know what they are and where they are in the world. And this extends to things like training and testing.\" Read more from Sky News:Face of a 'vampire' revealedSocial media goes on trial in LA So, should we be worried? Could ChatGPT or Gemini be lying to us right now? \"There is a chance,\" says Dr Shevlin, \"but I think it's lower. \"Usually when we get our grubby hands on the actual models themselves, they have been through lots of final layers, final stages of alignment testing and reinforcement to make sure that the good behaviours stick. \"It's going to be much harder to get them to misbehave or do the kind of Machiavellian scheming that we see here.\" The worry: there's nothing about these models that makes them intrinsically well-behaved. Nefarious behaviour may not be as far away as we think."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       Social media is on trial in Los Angeles. What happens next could change the way they operate. Inside LA's superior court, a landmark trial is getting under way. Social media companies are being accused of being addictive by design, a bit like tobacco and cigarettes were in the 1980s. They'll face around 22 \"bellwether\" lawsuits, i.e. test cases, with lawyers considering the testimonies of more than 1,500 people when launching the action. Opening statements for the first lawsuit will start on Monday, with Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg among the tech execs expected to testify. Over the years, people have tried to sue the owners of Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat for online harm, but they've largely failed. Often, social media companies will rely on a defence called Section 230 of America's Communications Act, which protects online platforms publishing third-party content. It says they're not responsible for content posted by users on their platforms. \n                  Parents of Scottish sextortion victim who took his own life sue Instagram owner Meta\n                 \n                  There's one big problem with Australia's social media ban\n                 \n                  Meta to block Instagram and Facebook for users under 16 in Australia\n                 So what makes this court case so different? For the first time, social media companies will face a trial by jury. Those jurors won't decide whether specific content on the platforms was harmful. Instead, they'll decide whether social media companies were negligent when they created and tweaked their products to encourage people to spend more time on them.

The plaintiffs allege that Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat \"have rewired how our kids think, feel, and behave\", according to the class action master complaint. If the jurors decide the companies were negligent when creating their products, they'll then also need to decide whether that negligence led to the significant harm of a young person. In this case, that person is known as KGM, a Californian 19-year-old who says she suffered anxiety, depression and body image issues after using Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube as a child. TikTok and Snapchat have already settled out of court with her, leaving just Meta and YouTube on trial. This is a \"bellwether\" trial, meaning it is being used as a test case to see how much compensation victims could be due in future litigation against social media companies. If the tech companies lose, they could be forced to change the designs of their platforms. Although TikTok and Snapchat settled for this case, they'll be involved in the future cases. The head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, will also testify during the trial. The tech companies say there's no clear link between tech use and addiction, and that there needs to be strong proof that they significantly harmed young users. In a blog post, Meta said this kind of legal action against them \"oversimplifies\" the \"complex issue\" of teenage mental health. \"Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges, and substance abuse,\" said the post. In a statement to Sky News, Google also rebuffed the claims. \"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" said Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda. \"In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls. \"The allegations in these complaints are simply not true.\""

It has introduced a \"You Won't Know Until You Ask\" campaign aimed at encouraging parents to talk to their children about what they see online, and providing age-appropriate advice. The government said the vast majority of 11-year-olds in the UK now own a smartphone. The guidance has been developed with expert organisations including the NSPCC, Parent Zone and Internet Matters, and will be available online from today.

The charity is calling for new laws which would \"end harmful and addictive design, enforce risk-based age ratings and make safety and wellbeing 'the price of admission' for tech firms in the UK\". It is calling for immediate action to \"fix and strengthen\" the Online Safety Act and tackle the growing risks on social media, gaming sites, messaging apps and \"high-risk\" AI chatbots. The charity was founded in memory of Ian Russell's 14-year-old daughter Molly, who took her own life after viewing harmful content on social media. Mr Russell, who chairs the foundation, said: \"We need a bold new reset of online safety laws that can decisively reverse years of quick fixes and put an end to addictive design and aggressive algorithms once and for all.\" However, he said an Australian-style policy to ban social media for under-16s - which is being consulted on by the government - would only give families a \"false sense of safety\". \"The government should have the courage to act on the evidence and stand up for children by delivering the tough and wide-reaching regulation that they promised in opposition but are yet to deliver,\" he added."

        "Content": "By Michael Havis, news reporter  The face of a \"vampire\" whose remains were posthumously mutilated to prevent them rising from the dead can be seen for the first time in more than 400 years. Discovered in a grave at Racesa, a fortress in eastern Croatia, the body had been exhumed, beheaded and reburied face down beneath heavy stones. And since the desecration cannot be explained by environmental factors, experts believe it was done to stop the dead man returning as a vampire. Now the face of the deceased can be seen for the first time in centuries, after scientists rebuilt his likeness from his skull. Archaeologist Natasa Sarkic, part of the excavation team, said the fear inspired by the man in death may stem from the fear he inspired in life. She said: \"Bioarchaeological analysis showed that this man often participated in violent conflicts, and died a violent death. \"He experienced at least three episodes of serious interpersonal violence during his lifetime. \n                  Huge snowstorm leaves tens of thousands without power in Bosnia\n                 \n                  Seven-year-old girl killed and several injured in Croatia school knife attack\n                 \n                  Several killed and wounded after gunman opens fire in care home in Croatia\n                 \"One of those attacks left his face disfigured, which could cause fear and repulsion, leading to social exclusion. \"Before even recovering from the penultimate trauma, he sustained a final fatal attack.\" She continued: \"Individuals who died violently, behaved violently in life, or were considered sinful or socially deviant, were believed to be at risk of becoming vampires. \"He may have been regarded as a 'vampire', or a supernatural threat due to his facial disfigurement and his marginal lifestyle, characterised by repeated interpersonal violence. \"Such beings were thought to be restless, vengeful, and capable of harming the living, spreading disease and killing people or livestock.\" Dr Sarkic said that, in the Slavic tradition, the soul remains attached to the body for about 40 days after death. In this time, various preventative measures could be used to prevent the dead from returning as vampires. These included staking, burning or beheading the corpse, burying it face down, weighing it down with stones and binding the limbs. This burial therefore showed \"practices commonly associated with 'anti-vampire' rituals at the time\", Dr Sarkic said. To complete the reconstruction, graphics expert Cicero Moraes started by virtually rebuilding the man's skull using data from a CT scan. \"Although the skull was somewhat fragmented at the time of its discovery, it was possible to reconstruct and digitise it,\" Dr Sarkic said. More data from living donors was then used to plot the likely placement of facial features, and the thickness of soft tissue in different places across the skull. A technique called anatomical deformation was also used, whereby a donor's head is virtually adjusted until it matches the subject's skull, revealing a potential face. Combining these approaches revealed an objective face, based solely on the shape of the skull, without subjective features like hair or skin tone. A second version of the face is more artistic, introducing some of these speculative elements for a more life-like recreation. Mr Moraes said it was a \"hostile, threatening\" likeness. \"The facial scar and other injuries obtained during his life are quite a significant sign that his life may have been rather turbulent,\" he said. The Racesa \"vampire\" lived in the 15th or 16th century, was roughly 5ft 4in tall, and is believed to have died between the ages of 40 and 50. Given his injuries, he may have been a soldier, or simply a person accustomed to violent encounters. He was buried inside what seems to have been a church, though his grave was in the \"the most disfavoured spot\" along the wall. And it seems his head was literally pulled from his body, since there are no cut marks consistent with decapitation on his neck, skull and shoulders. His grave was discovered in 2023 and is one of more than 180 burials found in the fortress, which stood 70 miles southeast of Zagreb. Further examples of vampire belief can be found elsewhere in Europe, including more desecrated graves in Poland. In Serbia, meanwhile, the body of Petar Blagojevic was staked through the heart, and burnt as a suspected vampire after his death in 1725. While Jure Grando Alilovic, a Croatian villager who died in 1656, is described as a vampire in historical records.

Mr Moraes, Dr Sarkic and their co-authors published their study in the journal OrtogOnLineMag."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n All 29-year-old French citizens are to be encouraged by their government to have babies while they still can. Health officials say the aim is to avoid these men and women facing fertility problems later on and thinking \"if only I had known\". The strategy is one part of a 16-point-plan to boost the fertility rate in France, one of many western countries, including the UK where figures are tumbling. The trend is creating anxiety about how governments can fund pensions and healthcare for ageing populations, with fewer younger working people paying taxes. But globally, policies to boost fertility rates have produced limited results, and critics of the French scheme suggested that better housing and maternity provision could be more effective solutions. The French government's attempt to address falling birth rates will see it send out \"targeted, balanced, and scientifically sound information\" to young people, including issues including on sexual health and contraception. The material \"will also reiterate that fertility is a shared responsibility between women and men\", the country's health ministry said. \n                  DNA found on gun is match to both identical twins - so who is the killer?\n                 \n                  Louvre releases photos of crown damaged in heist - but insists it will be restored\n                 \n                  'Talk to me, Goose': Starmer teases Macron with Top Gun mock up\n                 As a part of its plan, it is also trying to boost the number of egg-freezing centres from 40 to 70 and make the country a leader in fertility research. Its health system already provides free egg-freezing for 29-37 year olds, a service that costs about £5,000 per round in the UK. France's fertility rate of 1.56 children per woman is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population. But it is higher than the infamously low rates in China, Japan and South Korea; and the UK - where the latest available figures show that it had dropped to a record low of 1.41 in England and Wales by 2024. Professor François Gemenne, who specialises in sustainability and migration at HEC Paris Business School, told Sky News: \"This is something that demographers had known for a long time, but the fact that there were more deaths than births in France last year created a shock effect.\" France's \"demographic worry\" is exacerbated by the design of its pensions system and its \"obsession with immigration and the fear of being 'replaced'\" he added. Read more: 2026 could bring 'tipping point' for UK birth rate The plan also includes a new national communication campaign, a \"My Fertility\" website advising on the impacts of smoking, weight and lifestyle and school lessons for children about reproductive health. France's health ministry has acknowledged its maternal and infant mortality rates are higher than neighbouring countries and is also beginning a review of perinatal care to combat the \"concerning\" situation. Channa Jayasena, professor in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, told Sky News: \"On the female side, societal changes leading to older age of motherhood are certainly important.\" He said obesity was also a problem as it increased women's risk of polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, and was also the main risk factor for men. Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at Manchester University, said for most people globally, deciding to have children was \"down to [non-medical] factors such as better access to education, career opportunities, taxation, housing, mortgages, finance, etc\". \"Medicine can't help with those things,\" he said."

        "Content": "Bad Bunny has made history by becoming the first Super Bowl half-time show headliner to perform entirely in Spanish - and to host a wedding during the performance. Already a controversial pick to the main event, drawing criticism from Donald Trump, the rapper breezed through an eight-song set mostly made up of his latest album Debi Tirar Mas Fotos at the 60th edition of the NFL's biggest event. The US president, who attended last year's event, was scathing about the half-time show, however, calling it \"an affront to the Greatness of America\". Mr Trump is facing a race row after a video was shared on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House initially defended the post before removing it hours later - blaming a member of staff for \"erroneously\" sharing the video. Donald Trump later said \"of course\" he condemned it, but did not apologise.

Why Bad Bunny's Super Bowl show is causing a stir\n                 Fresh off of winning album of the year at the Grammys, Bad Bunny - real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio - performed on a heavily Puerto Rican-inspired stage set up at Levi's Stadium in California. While he made headlines at the Grammys by saying \"ICE out\", Bad Bunny capped off his set with a more tame political statement. Walking toward the camera, the rapper said \"God Bless America\", and then named countries in the Americas - \"Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil\" as well as the US and Canada - in front of a sign reading \"the only thing more powerful than hate is love\". Benito also performed his 2022 track El Apagon on power poles that exploded, representing Puerto Rico's blackouts and failing power grid, in reference to the deadly 2017 Hurricane Maria. Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin perform Despite speculation that Cardi B - who featured Bad Bunny on her hit 2018 single I Like It - would be a guest performer, Lady Gaga was tonight's surprise appearance. She performed a reggaeton-inspired version of her duet with Bruno Mars, Die With A Smile, before dancing salsa with the headliner. Cardi B still made a cameo as a dancer, along with celebrities Alix Earle, David Grutman, Karol G, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal. Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca singer and fellow Puerto Rican, also made an appearance, singing from a plastic chair in a scene that mirrored the cover of the Debi Tirar Mas Fotos album. He also paid homage to Latin artists with a clip of club classic track Gasolina leading into his song EoO. NFL hosts biggest wedding reception About five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, just before Lady Gaga's appearance, a couple were seen on stage in a wedding ceremony. It emerged after his performance that the marriage was real, according to the rapper's representative. The unnamed husband and wife had invited Benito to their wedding, but he said they should instead be part of his half-time show. The artist also served as a witness and signed their marriage certificate. It is unclear whether some of the people in the background of their wedding were friends and family members or just backup dancers from the performance. Trump: Halftime show 'one of the worst, EVER' While it has so far seen rave reviews online, you might not be surprised to hear that the US president did not care for Bad Bunny's set. Taking to Truth Social during the third quarter of the Super Bowl, Trump said that the half-time show was \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" \"It makes no sense,\" he added, calling it \"an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.\" Capping off his post, Trump also complained that \"the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new Kickoff Rule\". On the pitch, the Seattle Seahawks won their second-ever Super Bowl, as their dominant defence smothered the New England Patriots, setting up a comfortable 29-13 win."
