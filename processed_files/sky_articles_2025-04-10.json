        "Content": " A family of five Spanish tourists, including three children, have been killed in a helicopter crash in New York City. The pilot was among six who died as the aircraft crashed into the Hudson River at around 3.17pm on Thursday. New York Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said divers had recovered all those on board from the helicopter, which was upside down in the water. \"Four victims were pronounced dead on scene and two more were removed to local area hospitals, where sadly both succumbed to their injuries,\" she said. The aircraft was on a tourist flight of Manhattan, run by the New York Helicopters company, with witnesses describing the main rotor blade flying off moments before it dropped out the sky. Lesly Camacho, a worker at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, said she saw the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before it slammed into the water. \"There was a bunch of smoke coming out. It was spinning pretty fast, and it landed in the water really hard,\" she said.  Another witness said \"the chopper blade flew off\". \"I don't know what happened to the tail, but it just straight up dropped,\" Avi Rakesh told Sky's US partner, NBC News. Video on social media showed parts of the Bell 206 helicopter tumbling through the air and landing in the river.  New York Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the six deaths and said authorities believed the tourists were from Spain. He said the flight had taken off from a downtown heliport at around 3pm. The crash happened close to Pier 40 and the Holland tunnel, which links lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood with Jersey City to its west. Tracking service Flight Radar 24 published what it said was the helicopter's route, with the aircraft appearing to be in the sky for 15 minutes before the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have started an investigation."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n If you think it is pensions, investments and jobs that matter most in all this, think again. Ultimately, this is about who gets to run the world. The bad news for America and the rest of the West is that this time, China seems far more prepared and up for the fight. On the one side, a chaotic US administration veering sharply from one policy to another. On the other, an authoritarian government digging in its heels. In Trump's first term, China seemed uncertain how to respond to America's maverick new president and his use of tariffs. Its diplomats' rhetoric this time is far more blunt and defiant; \"We are ready for you,\" they seem to be saying, \"and are up for the fight\". Read more: US trade war with China grows more bloody \n                  China believes capitulating to Trump on tariffs serves no purpose and isn't an option\n                 \n                  Day 81: Can the US and China avoid an all-out trade-war?\n                 \n                  US trade war with China grows more bloody as Trump ups the ante once more\n                  America and China have been locked in a history of both dependence and confrontation. Back in the '90s, China was allowed to trade on favourable terms. \"If they became rich like us\", the West believed, \"they'd become more democratic too\". It was a naive belief. China remained authoritarian and was ruthless too, using piracy, reverse engineering and all-out theft of technology to catch up with the West. But the West didn't seem to care. Everyone was getting richer. China was making the world's stuff and lifting millions of its people out of poverty, while America was buying it cheaply and keeping down its own cost of living.  Fast-forward a few decades, and the two giants are still closely entwined as trading partners, but the rancour between them has grown. First under Trump and then under Biden, the US began seeing the error of being too generous to China. Under both presidents, America has been trying to correct what it sees as a trading relationship stacked in Beijing's favour. Chinese objections are different. Most of all, they resent America's status as world hegemon, or strongest power. The liberal world order was built by and for America, they believe, and has reached its sell-by date. It sees this crisis as a chance to change all that. And it has been getting ready.  China presents itself as a stable, predictable alternative world power to America. The first three months of Donald Trump's second presidency are only helping. This is the pitch to other countries: Want a new partner who offers economic stability, equal standing and no awkward lectures on human rights? Ditch America and call Beijing. There are huge downsides, of course, if America is supplanted by China and the world is refashioned in its image. Ask the people of Hong Kong, whose freedoms have been brutally trampled, the Uyghurs of Xinjiang, victims of what is by most accounts a genocide, or the Taiwanese, currently at the sharp end of massive bullying by Beijing. But America has been busy destroying its sales pitch too, no longer a paragon of stability, good government or rational policy making. In any prolonged trade war, Donald Trump is taking on a foe that is prepared and determined. It has moved much of its industry to other countries to avoid tariffs, built up a massive trade war chest in the shape of its sovereign wealth fund used this week to prop up tumbling stock markets. Read more analysis:For China, capitulating to Trump isn't an optionCould Trump's tariffs tip the world into recession? China has weaknesses, of course. Huge demographic problems, a sclerotic economy, and festering public resentment. But it has one great strength over all, an appetite to endure pain. The Chinese call it \"eating bitterness\". It's considered a virtue. They believe their destiny is at the top of a new multipolar world order, and this could be the moment to seize it. It is not clear whether America has quite the same determination and reserves of strength - or if its president knows what he is taking on."

Harry, who served 10 years in the British Army, visited the Superhumans Center, an orthopaedic clinic in Lviv that treats and rehabilitates wounded military personnel and civilians. The prince, 40, was accompanied by a contingent from his Invictus Games Foundation, including four veterans who have been through similar rehabilitation experiences. A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said Harry had been invited by the centre's CEO, Olga Rudneva, a year ago, and again at the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025, which took place in February.

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  A company started by \"two blokes in a Cardiff garage\" is about to launch a game-changing space factory that could start a new industrial revolution. Space Forge will ship its prototype manufacturing satellite in the coming weeks from an industrial park in the city to the US, where it will be sent into orbit on a SpaceX rocket. Sky News was given exclusive access to the company's dust-free 'clean room' to watch engineers carry out final checks. ForgeStar-1 is already loaded up with the raw ingredients to make a new generation of super-efficient semiconductor chips that would be impossible to produce on the planet's surface. Joshua Western, the company's co-founder, said: \"This is the next industrial revolution but it's in space, it's not on Earth.\" Semiconductors are found in almost all electronic technology. They're currently made from silicon crystals, but the material has a performance ceiling. However, in the microgravity and vacuum of space it's possible to make crystals from a new mix of chemical compounds that would allow computer chips to work faster while consuming less power. \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 \n                  Police searching for missing Cardiff woman launch murder investigation\n                 \"We're able to reduce the energy consumed where they get deployed by more than 50%,\" Joshua said. \"In the UK alone, we're talking billions of pounds being saved in the energy bill alone. \"That's in terms of consumer mobile data, but also data applications that are really (energy) hungry - artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and all the way down to people using ChatGPT at home.\" The prototype will test out the process of making the material, and it's been given the first in-orbit advanced manufacturing licence by the Civil Aviation Authority. If it works, the next mission will be for real, producing pure crystals that could be cloned back on Earth to meet huge demand. The company reckons such high-grade material for electronics could be worth up to £45m per kilogram, far outstripping the cost of launching on a rocket. But to safely bring such a precious cargo back to the planet, the company has had to design its own lightweight heat shield able to withstand high temperatures as it plunges through the atmosphere. It's called Pridwen, named after King Arthur's shield, and it's folded, origami-style, into a tiny space until it's needed. Then it springs open like an umbrella to protect the satellite and slow it down so that it gently splashes down in the ocean, where it can be picked up. ForgeStar-1 is a pioneer.

Nafeesa Dajda, chief of missions at the Catapult, said Britain is taking the lead. \"We can communicate from pretty much anywhere on Earth using satellite technology,\" she said. \"There's an opportunity now to think about how we use space in a different way and the unique environment that space provides us with, that microgravity environment, means we can do things we just can't do on Earth. \"So how big could this be for the UK? Huge. \"We've estimated that the opportunity is worth around £20bn to the UK economy over the next 10 years.\" At Space Forge HQ the team will be anxious to see their satellite leave for the US after years of development work. It's a story that could have come straight from Silicon Valley. \"It demonstrates what a couple of guys who started in a garage on the outskirts of the city when they got bored one night in the pub were actually able to do,\" said Joshua. \"There is an optimism with technology now (in the UK) that we didn't always used to have. \"There is a new life in the industrial base, especially around engineering, and that's despite all of the challenges that it has right now.\""

It was chaos, and in the middle of it, a man still having cancer treatment. If you remember this time 12 months ago, he wasn't even allowed out on full public engagements. Now he was in the middle of what can only be described as a scrum.

I've been on so many engagements and royal tours before where they enjoy nothing more than getting stuck in, meeting as many people as possible - it must be a nightmare for their police as the royal pair go rogue.

Now, he's running his own coffee shop in the town centre, having been made redundant when Tata Steel announced the closure of the plant's blast furnaces. The 28-year-old told Sky News the situation the town faced was \"completely life-changing\". \"They called it an end of an era, and it was. That type of workforce in Wales now is gone, it wasn't just a company shutting down, it was generations of knowledge and generations of workers,\" he said. Six months since Port Talbot's last blast furnace was closed as part of Tata's green transition, talks are ongoing to save thousands of jobs at British Steel amid plans to close Scunthorpe's blast furnaces. Mr Walker-Hunt was the fourth generation of his family to work in Port Talbot's steel industry, a tradition now at an end. \"It's something that I will never forget to be honest, being around the boys for the last time and all of us going off doing different things,\" he said. \n                  Man admits attempted murder of child in Ceredigion\n                 \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 Mr Walker-Hunt said if the UK government did decide to nationalise British Steel, he would be \"happy\" for the people of Scunthorpe, but that it would come as a \"low blow\" to Port Talbot. \"Why couldn't we have it? Why have you left us, our lot, fall apart? Why couldn't we get that support?\" 'Groundhog Day' Tata Steel announced last January that it was cutting 2,800 jobs, with most of those in Port Talbot. Jack Harper had planned to spend his career working at the steelworks in the town. He worked as an apprentice there from 2022 until September last year when he was let go. The 29-year-old said watching the ongoing talks in Scunthorpe was \"like Groundhog Day\". \"It's been the exact same process, if not worse. Because the economic situation and the political situation is a lot worse with tariffs. We don't know where we stand with it,\" he said. Mr Harper now works as a union support worker, helping former steelworkers as they look for alternative employment. \"It's very gratifying because a lot of people I know have come through the door and have obviously got support through us. Ex-colleagues, friends, so it's been really good helping people I actually know,\" he said. \"The vast majority have been men, I'd say in their 30s to 50s, family men. They've got to put food on the table and when the one ticket in town, the major ticket in town, is gone, it's a scramble now to find employment and get back on your feet.\" The steelworks in Scunthorpe are \"a massive part of the UK industry\", according to Mr Harper. \"It's not going to look good if we're importing all of that from abroad, especially in the current economic situation,\" he added. 'Worth fighting for' Plaid Cymru called for the nationalisation of Port Talbot steelworks last year when Tata announced its plans to replace its blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace, but those calls were \"dismissed\". The party's business and trade spokesperson, Llinos Medi, said if the nationalisation of the steelworks at Scunthorpe goes ahead, people in Port Talbot would \"rightly ask why their jobs and community were not worth fighting for\". Liberal Democrat MP David Chadwick said constituents of his would be asking why the government \"allowed\" more than 2,000 jobs to be cut in Wales but were \"seemingly less accepting of the destruction it would cause elsewhere\". The Conservatives have pointed to their £500m rescue deal, which retained around 25% of the workforce at Port Talbot, and have called for a commercial solution in Scunthorpe. Meanwhile, Reform UK has backed bringing British Steel under public ownership to secure the future of the industry. A UK government spokesperson said Port Talbot \"has always been and will always be a steelmaking town\" but that the industry's economic stability relied on \"a cleaner, greener future\". \"Our Steel Strategy will set forth a positive vision for the future of the industry, backed up by up to £2.5bn of government investment, on top of the £500m being provided to transform Port Talbot,\" they added. The Welsh government said it has been \"working closely with all parties to ensure that a range of support is available\". \"Much of the £80m transition funding from UK government is allocated to tailored support and we'd encourage anyone who has not already done so to see what support is available to them,\" it added.

        "Content": "The father of a grooming gang victim has told Sky News the government should be \"ashamed\" of itself over the confusion surrounding inquiries - accusing it of \"messing around with survivors' lives\". Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips this week sparked fresh uncertainty over whether regional inquiries into grooming gangs - promised by the government in January - would go ahead. Following two days of confusion, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, insisted on Thursday that five local inquiries will take place - and hinted more could follow. But her comments have done little to reassure Marlon West, whose daughter Scarlett was a victim of sexual exploitation in Manchester.  Ms Phillips's statement in parliament on Tuesday - which sparked criticism after it failed to mention the reviews - left survivors \"so disappointed\", he said. The uncertainty \"makes you dizzy because you get hope and think 'I'm getting somewhere now' then they do a U-turn as they've done twice this week\", Mr West continued. \"I think they should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said. \"The government now are messing around with survivors' lives and campaigners like me.\"  Throughout her ordeal, Scarlett has \"been let down by the local authority, by social workers, by the police force,\" he said. \"With the government, she's just been let down again. That's what's cruel.\" Mr West added he is \"really disappointed\" in the government's decision to push forward with the five regional inquiries instead of a statutory, national one. He pointed out that police officers and professionals can refuse to give evidence at regional inquiries, whereas national ones can compel them to do so. \"With a statutory inquiry, it'd be more like a [legal] setting,\" Mr West said. \"Professionals will not be allowed to refuse interviews. They have to attend. \"It needs to [be in a] legal arena where they are compelled to give evidence.\" His comments came as the prime minister said the government is focussing on implementing the \"hundreds\" of recommendations from previous inquiries into grooming gangs. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"My strong belief is we've got to implement those recommendations. \"At the moment, and under the last government, they just stacked up and sat on a shelf. So they need to be implemented.\"  Read more:A timeline of the scandalWhat we know from grooming gangs data Both the prime minister and the home secretary have rejected claims the government's pledge to hold \"victim-centred, locally-led inquiries\" is being \"watered down\". Asked by Sky News presenter Anna Jones if that was the case, Ms Cooper replied: \"No, completely the opposite. \"What we're doing is increasing the action we're taking on this vile crime.\" Sir Keir separately said: \"We put the money behind it. We're not watering it down. We're committed to that. \"But, I'm equally committed to implementing the recommendations that we've got.\""

London is expected to enjoy 22C this afternoon, according to the Met Office, while parts of the southeast and the southwest are set to bask in 20C to 21C sunshine.

Amid a reported 48% increase in calls last weekend compared to the same weekend last year, the LFB called on Londoners to \"act responsibly\" to prevent blazes.

Warning: This article contains graphic details of alleged sexual abuse The controversial social media influencer allegedly told her: \"I'm a boss, you're going to do as I say or there'll be hell to pay.\" The woman, who worked for Tate on his online webcam business, alleges he threatened her daily. She is one of four women who have launched a civil claim against Tate in the UK, with allegations including rape, assault and coercive control. A spokesperson for Tate said he \"categorically denies\" the allegations. In a statement, the spokesperson said: \"Mr Tate categorically denies these unproven and untested allegations. \"Specifically, he denies ever threatening anyone with a firearm, engaging in non-consensual acts or subjecting any individual to physical or psychological harm. \"These are civil claims, brought years after the alleged events and following a CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) decision not to pursue criminal charges. \"It is deeply troubling that such graphic and one-sided accounts are being publicised before any judicial assessment has taken place. \"This type of reporting undermines the presumption of innocence and shapes public perception in a way that is fundamentally unjust. \"We have seen other high-profile cases where similarly serious allegations collapsed under scrutiny - but only after irreparable reputational harm had already been done. \"Mr Tate will defend himself vigorously and remains confident the truth will prevail.\" The civil action was launched in the High Court in London last week, and a preliminary hearing is to be held next week. In the court documents, he describes the allegations as \"a pack of lies\", and in a detailed response said: \"There may have been a toy gun in the flat.\" The woman worked for Tate in Luton in 2015 and is claiming damages for \"assault, battery and/or intentional infliction of harm, including rape\".

The Romanian authorities have agreed that after the completion of their own criminal justice process, the brothers can be extradited to the UK on allegations of rape and human trafficking. The brothers, who have joint UK and US citizenship, are also under criminal investigation in Florida, where they visited recently after a Romanian judge lifted a travel ban on them. They are currently in Dubai, but must return to Romania. The four women claim Tate strangled them during sex, and two developed red spots from burst capillaries in their eyes from asphyxia. In an interview with Sky News last year, one of the claimants said she had consensual sex with Tate during a normal relationship with him, but once lost consciousness when he strangled her. She said: \"We were having sex and he put his hands round my throat and strangled me until I lost consciousness. And when I came round he was still having sex with me, still on top of me. \"The next day, all the white had gone completely red in one of my eyes. I looked it up afterwards and it was just lack of oxygen to your brain where your blood vessels start bursting to try and get more oxygen into your brain. That was quite scary.\" She said she didn't call police because she was young, inexperienced and didn't realise how dangerous the encounter had been."

        "Content": "By Alexandra Rogers and Faye Brown, political reporters   The government will fund any further local inquiries into the grooming gangs scandal that are deemed necessary, Sir Keir Starmer has said. However, the prime minister said it is his \"strong belief\" that the focus must be on implementing recommendations from the Alexis Jay national review before more investigations go ahead. Politics latest: 'Our position hasn't changed' on tariffs, says minister It follows a row over whether Labour is still committed to the five local inquiries it promised in January, after safeguarding minister Jess Phillips failed to provide an update on them in a statement to parliament hours before it closed for recess on Tuesday. Instead, Ms Phillips told MPs that local authorities will be able to access a £5m fund to support locally-led work on grooming gangs. On Thursday morning, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper insisted the \"victim-centred, locally-led inquiries\" will still go ahead, while a Home Office source told Sky News more could take place in addition to the five. Speaking to Sky News' Rob Powell later on Thursday, Sir Keir confirmed that there could be more inquiries than those five but said the government must also \"get on and implement the recommendations we've already got\". \n                  Sir Keir Starmer says 24,000 people who have 'no right to be here' have been returned under Labour\n                 \n                  Illegal migration 'pits nations against one another', Sir Keir Starmer to tell summit\n                 \n                  Government looking at other countries to process asylum seekers in, home secretary says\n                 The prime minister said: \"Of course, if there's further local inquiries that are needed then we will put some funding behind that, and they should happen. \"But I don't think that simply saying we need more inquiries when we haven't even acted on the ones that we've had is necessarily the only way forward.\"  Ms Phillips's earlier comments led to accusations that the government was diluting the importance of the local inquiries by giving councils choice over how to use the funds. Sky News understands she was due to host a briefing with MPs this afternoon at 5pm - the second she had held in 24 hours - in an attempt to calm concern amongst her colleagues. Review recommendations 'sat on a shelf' Sir Keir insisted he is not watering down his commitment for the five local enquiries, but said the Jay recommendations were \"sitting on a shelf under the last government\" and he is \"equally committed\" to them. He added: \"At the most important level, if there is evidence of grooming that is coming to light now, we need a criminal investigation. I want the police investigation because I want perpetrators in the dock and I want justice delivered.\" In October 2022, Professor Alexis Jay finished a seven-year national inquiry into the many ways children in England and Wales had been sexually abused, including grooming gangs. Girls as young as 11 were groomed and raped across a number of towns and cities in England over a decade ago. Prof Jay made 20 recommendations which haven't been implemented yet, with Sir Keir saying on Thursday he will bring 17 of them forward. However, the Tories and Reform UK want the government to fund a new national inquiry specifically into grooming gangs, demands for which first started last year after interventions by tech billionaire Elon Musk on his social media platform X. 'Fuelling confusion' Reform leader Nigel Farage said the statement made by Ms Phillips \"was one of the most cowardly things I have ever seen\" as he repeated calls for a fresh inquiry. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, also told Sky News that ministers were \"fuelling confusion\" and that the \"mess.. could have been avoided if the government backed a full national inquiry - not this piecemeal alternative\". Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the government needed to look at \"state failings\" and she would try and force a fresh vote on holding another national inquiry, which MPs voted down in January. 'Political mess' As well as facing criticism from the Opposition, there are signs of a backlash within Labour over how the issue has been handled. Political correspondent With about an hour until the House of Commons rose for Easter recess, the government announced it was taking a more \"flexible\" approach to the local grooming gang inquiries.\n\n Safeguarding minister Jess Philips argued this was based on experience from certain affected areas, and that the government is funding new police investigations to re-open historic cases.\n\n Speaking on Times Radio, former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission Sir Trevor Phillips called the move \"utterly shameful\" and claimed it was a political decision.\n\n One Labour MP told Sky News: \"Some people are very angry. I despair. I don’t disagree with many of our decisions but we just play to Reform – someone somewhere needs sacking.\" The government has insisted party political misinformation was fanning the flames of frustration in Labour. The government also said it was not watering down the inquiries and was actually increasing the action being taken. But while many Labour MPs have one eye on Reform in the rearview mirror, any accusations of being soft on grooming gangs only provides political ammunition to their adversaries. One Labour MP told Sky News the issue had turned into a \"political mess\" and that they were being called \"grooming sympathisers\". On the update from Ms Phillips on Tuesday, they said it might have been the \"right thing to do\" but that it was \"horrible politically\". \"We are all getting so much abuse. It's just political naivety in the extreme.\" Read more:Grooming gangs: What we know from the dataFewer criminals set to be jailed amid overcrowding 'We will leave no stone unturned' Ms Phillips later defended her decision, saying there was \"far too much party political misinformation about the action that is being taken when everyone should be trying to support victims and survivors\". \"We are funding new police investigations to re-open historical cases, providing national support for locally led inquiries and action, and Louise Casey... is currently reviewing the nature, scale and ethnicity of grooming gangs offending across the country,\" she said. \"We will not hesitate to go further, unlike the previous government, who showed no interest in this issue over 14 years and did nothing to progress the recommendations from the seven-year national inquiry when they had the chance. \"We will leave no stone unturned in pursuit of justice for victims and will be unrelenting in our crackdown on sick predators and perpetrators who prey on vulnerable children.\""

        "Content": "The father of a grooming gang victim has told Sky News the government should be \"ashamed\" of itself over the confusion surrounding inquiries - accusing it of \"messing around with survivors' lives\". Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips this week sparked fresh uncertainty over whether regional inquiries into grooming gangs - promised by the government in January - would go ahead. Following two days of confusion, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, insisted on Thursday that five local inquiries will take place - and hinted more could follow. But her comments have done little to reassure Marlon West, whose daughter Scarlett was a victim of sexual exploitation in Manchester.  Ms Phillips's statement in parliament on Tuesday - which sparked criticism after it failed to mention the reviews - left survivors \"so disappointed\", he said. The uncertainty \"makes you dizzy because you get hope and think 'I'm getting somewhere now' then they do a U-turn as they've done twice this week\", Mr West continued. \"I think they should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said. \"The government now are messing around with survivors' lives and campaigners like me.\"  Throughout her ordeal, Scarlett has \"been let down by the local authority, by social workers, by the police force,\" he said. \"With the government, she's just been let down again. That's what's cruel.\" Mr West added he is \"really disappointed\" in the government's decision to push forward with the five regional inquiries instead of a statutory, national one. He pointed out that police officers and professionals can refuse to give evidence at regional inquiries, whereas national ones can compel them to do so. \"With a statutory inquiry, it'd be more like a [legal] setting,\" Mr West said. \"Professionals will not be allowed to refuse interviews. They have to attend. \"It needs to [be in a] legal arena where they are compelled to give evidence.\" His comments came as the prime minister said the government is focussing on implementing the \"hundreds\" of recommendations from previous inquiries into grooming gangs. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"My strong belief is we've got to implement those recommendations. \"At the moment, and under the last government, they just stacked up and sat on a shelf. So they need to be implemented.\"  Read more:A timeline of the scandalWhat we know from grooming gangs data Both the prime minister and the home secretary have rejected claims the government's pledge to hold \"victim-centred, locally-led inquiries\" is being \"watered down\". Asked by Sky News presenter Anna Jones if that was the case, Ms Cooper replied: \"No, completely the opposite. \"What we're doing is increasing the action we're taking on this vile crime.\" Sir Keir separately said: \"We put the money behind it. We're not watering it down. We're committed to that. \"But, I'm equally committed to implementing the recommendations that we've got.\""

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n One year ago, Cassius Walker-Hunt was working at Port Talbot's steel plant. Now, he's running his own coffee shop in the town centre, having been made redundant when Tata Steel announced the closure of the plant's blast furnaces. The 28-year-old told Sky News the situation the town faced was \"completely life-changing\". \"They called it an end of an era, and it was. That type of workforce in Wales now is gone, it wasn't just a company shutting down, it was generations of knowledge and generations of workers,\" he said. Six months since Port Talbot's last blast furnace was closed as part of Tata's green transition, talks are ongoing to save thousands of jobs at British Steel amid plans to close Scunthorpe's blast furnaces. Mr Walker-Hunt was the fourth generation of his family to work in Port Talbot's steel industry, a tradition now at an end. \"It's something that I will never forget to be honest, being around the boys for the last time and all of us going off doing different things,\" he said. \n                  Man admits attempted murder of child in Ceredigion\n                 \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 Mr Walker-Hunt said if the UK government did decide to nationalise British Steel, he would be \"happy\" for the people of Scunthorpe, but that it would come as a \"low blow\" to Port Talbot. \"Why couldn't we have it? Why have you left us, our lot, fall apart? Why couldn't we get that support?\" 'Groundhog Day' Tata Steel announced last January that it was cutting 2,800 jobs, with most of those in Port Talbot. Jack Harper had planned to spend his career working at the steelworks in the town. He worked as an apprentice there from 2022 until September last year when he was let go. The 29-year-old said watching the ongoing talks in Scunthorpe was \"like Groundhog Day\". \"It's been the exact same process, if not worse. Because the economic situation and the political situation is a lot worse with tariffs. We don't know where we stand with it,\" he said. Mr Harper now works as a union support worker, helping former steelworkers as they look for alternative employment. \"It's very gratifying because a lot of people I know have come through the door and have obviously got support through us. Ex-colleagues, friends, so it's been really good helping people I actually know,\" he said. \"The vast majority have been men, I'd say in their 30s to 50s, family men. They've got to put food on the table and when the one ticket in town, the major ticket in town, is gone, it's a scramble now to find employment and get back on your feet.\" The steelworks in Scunthorpe are \"a massive part of the UK industry\", according to Mr Harper. \"It's not going to look good if we're importing all of that from abroad, especially in the current economic situation,\" he added. 'Worth fighting for' Plaid Cymru called for the nationalisation of Port Talbot steelworks last year when Tata announced its plans to replace its blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace, but those calls were \"dismissed\". The party's business and trade spokesperson, Llinos Medi, said if the nationalisation of the steelworks at Scunthorpe goes ahead, people in Port Talbot would \"rightly ask why their jobs and community were not worth fighting for\". Liberal Democrat MP David Chadwick said constituents of his would be asking why the government \"allowed\" more than 2,000 jobs to be cut in Wales but were \"seemingly less accepting of the destruction it would cause elsewhere\". The Conservatives have pointed to their £500m rescue deal, which retained around 25% of the workforce at Port Talbot, and have called for a commercial solution in Scunthorpe. Meanwhile, Reform UK has backed bringing British Steel under public ownership to secure the future of the industry. A UK government spokesperson said Port Talbot \"has always been and will always be a steelmaking town\" but that the industry's economic stability relied on \"a cleaner, greener future\". \"Our Steel Strategy will set forth a positive vision for the future of the industry, backed up by up to £2.5bn of government investment, on top of the £500m being provided to transform Port Talbot,\" they added. The Welsh government said it has been \"working closely with all parties to ensure that a range of support is available\". \"Much of the £80m transition funding from UK government is allocated to tailored support and we'd encourage anyone who has not already done so to see what support is available to them,\" it added.

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  A company started by \"two blokes in a Cardiff garage\" is about to launch a game-changing space factory that could start a new industrial revolution. Space Forge will ship its prototype manufacturing satellite in the coming weeks from an industrial park in the city to the US, where it will be sent into orbit on a SpaceX rocket. Sky News was given exclusive access to the company's dust-free 'clean room' to watch engineers carry out final checks. ForgeStar-1 is already loaded up with the raw ingredients to make a new generation of super-efficient semiconductor chips that would be impossible to produce on the planet's surface. Joshua Western, the company's co-founder, said: \"This is the next industrial revolution but it's in space, it's not on Earth.\" Semiconductors are found in almost all electronic technology. They're currently made from silicon crystals, but the material has a performance ceiling. However, in the microgravity and vacuum of space it's possible to make crystals from a new mix of chemical compounds that would allow computer chips to work faster while consuming less power. \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 \n                  Police searching for missing Cardiff woman launch murder investigation\n                 \"We're able to reduce the energy consumed where they get deployed by more than 50%,\" Joshua said. \"In the UK alone, we're talking billions of pounds being saved in the energy bill alone. \"That's in terms of consumer mobile data, but also data applications that are really (energy) hungry - artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and all the way down to people using ChatGPT at home.\" The prototype will test out the process of making the material, and it's been given the first in-orbit advanced manufacturing licence by the Civil Aviation Authority. If it works, the next mission will be for real, producing pure crystals that could be cloned back on Earth to meet huge demand. The company reckons such high-grade material for electronics could be worth up to £45m per kilogram, far outstripping the cost of launching on a rocket. But to safely bring such a precious cargo back to the planet, the company has had to design its own lightweight heat shield able to withstand high temperatures as it plunges through the atmosphere. It's called Pridwen, named after King Arthur's shield, and it's folded, origami-style, into a tiny space until it's needed. Then it springs open like an umbrella to protect the satellite and slow it down so that it gently splashes down in the ocean, where it can be picked up. ForgeStar-1 is a pioneer. Read more from Sky News:Rocket launches Starlink satellitesSpaceX tourists' historic flightBritish-built Mars rover stuck on Earth The UK's Satellite Applications Catapult, which supports space start-ups, says everything from stronger metal alloys to powerful cancer drugs could in future be made in space. Nafeesa Dajda, chief of missions at the Catapult, said Britain is taking the lead. \"We can communicate from pretty much anywhere on Earth using satellite technology,\" she said. \"There's an opportunity now to think about how we use space in a different way and the unique environment that space provides us with, that microgravity environment, means we can do things we just can't do on Earth. \"So how big could this be for the UK? Huge. \"We've estimated that the opportunity is worth around £20bn to the UK economy over the next 10 years.\" At Space Forge HQ the team will be anxious to see their satellite leave for the US after years of development work. It's a story that could have come straight from Silicon Valley. \"It demonstrates what a couple of guys who started in a garage on the outskirts of the city when they got bored one night in the pub were actually able to do,\" said Joshua. \"There is an optimism with technology now (in the UK) that we didn't always used to have. \"There is a new life in the industrial base, especially around engineering, and that's despite all of the challenges that it has right now.\""

Warning: This article contains graphic details of alleged sexual abuse The controversial social media influencer allegedly told her: \"I'm a boss, you're going to do as I say or there'll be hell to pay.\" The woman, who worked for Tate on his online webcam business, alleges he threatened her daily. She is one of four women who have launched a civil claim against Tate in the UK, with allegations including rape, assault and coercive control. A spokesperson for Tate said he \"categorically denies\" the allegations. In a statement, the spokesperson said: \"Mr Tate categorically denies these unproven and untested allegations. \"Specifically, he denies ever threatening anyone with a firearm, engaging in non-consensual acts or subjecting any individual to physical or psychological harm. \"These are civil claims, brought years after the alleged events and following a CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) decision not to pursue criminal charges. \"It is deeply troubling that such graphic and one-sided accounts are being publicised before any judicial assessment has taken place. \"This type of reporting undermines the presumption of innocence and shapes public perception in a way that is fundamentally unjust. \"We have seen other high-profile cases where similarly serious allegations collapsed under scrutiny - but only after irreparable reputational harm had already been done. \"Mr Tate will defend himself vigorously and remains confident the truth will prevail.\" The civil action was launched in the High Court in London last week, and a preliminary hearing is to be held next week. In the court documents, he describes the allegations as \"a pack of lies\", and in a detailed response said: \"There may have been a toy gun in the flat.\" The woman worked for Tate in Luton in 2015 and is claiming damages for \"assault, battery and/or intentional infliction of harm, including rape\".

The Romanian authorities have agreed that after the completion of their own criminal justice process, the brothers can be extradited to the UK on allegations of rape and human trafficking. The brothers, who have joint UK and US citizenship, are also under criminal investigation in Florida, where they visited recently after a Romanian judge lifted a travel ban on them. They are currently in Dubai, but must return to Romania. The four women claim Tate strangled them during sex, and two developed red spots from burst capillaries in their eyes from asphyxia. In an interview with Sky News last year, one of the claimants said she had consensual sex with Tate during a normal relationship with him, but once lost consciousness when he strangled her. She said: \"We were having sex and he put his hands round my throat and strangled me until I lost consciousness. And when I came round he was still having sex with me, still on top of me. \"The next day, all the white had gone completely red in one of my eyes. I looked it up afterwards and it was just lack of oxygen to your brain where your blood vessels start bursting to try and get more oxygen into your brain. That was quite scary.\" She said she didn't call police because she was young, inexperienced and didn't realise how dangerous the encounter had been."

        "Content": "Rebekah Vardy has lost an appeal after claiming Coleen Rooney's lawyers \"deliberately\" understated some of their client's costs during the \"Wagatha Christie\" libel case. The high-profile court case took place after Mrs Rooney, wife of former Man Utd striker Wayne Rooney, accused Mrs Vardy on social media in 2019 of leaking her private information to the press. Mrs Vardy, wife of Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, unsuccessfully tried to sue Mrs Rooney in a libel battle in 2022 that captivated some areas of the public and was later dramatised for TV. The judge ordered Mrs Vardy to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs, including an initial payment of £800,000. Both women are now in a further dispute over how much Mrs Vardy should pay in legal costs as a result. In October last year, a specialist costs judge ruled Mrs Rooney's lawyers did not commit misconduct after they were accused by Mrs Vardy's legal team of understating some of her costs. Mrs Vardy appealed against the decision last month while Mrs Rooney's lawyers claimed the challenge was \"misconceived\". \n                  'It was a storm... now it's a hurricane': Has the cost of living crisis been forgotten?\n                 \n                  Starmer says government will fund further local grooming gangs inquiries if 'needed'\n                 \n                  Prince Harry visits war victims in Ukraine\n                 In a ruling on Thursday, High Court judge Mr Justice Cavanagh dismissed the appeal. He said: \"The appeal must fail on the basis that the judge was entitled to reach the conclusion that he came to.\" A hearing last October was told that Mrs Rooney's claimed legal bill - £1,833,906.89 - was more than three times her \"agreed costs budget of £540,779.07\". Jamie Carpenter KC, for Mrs Vardy, said that this was \"disproportionate\", and that the earlier \"understatement\" of some costs was \"improper and unreasonable\" and used to \"attack the other party's costs\". However, Senior Costs Judge Andrew Gordon-Saker said that while there was a \"failure to be transparent\" by Mrs Rooney's legal team, he found \"on balance and, I have to say, only just\" that they had not committed wrongdoing. In written submissions for the appeal against the decision last month, Mr Carpenter said Mrs Rooney \"very substantially understated\" her costs by around 40% in her budget, known as a \"precedent H\", in 2021, and that the amount Mrs Vardy should pay should therefore be reduced. Benjamin Williams KC, for Mrs Rooney, said in his written submissions that her budget was \"properly and correctly completed\" and there was \"no tenable case\" of misconduct. In a separate ruling on Thursday, Mrs Vardy largely lost a bid for access to more documents in relation to costs. Her lawyers asked the court in February to order Mrs Rooney's team to hand over \"privileged\" documents, details about her claim for VAT, and further information about retainers between Mrs Rooney and her solicitors. Mrs Rooney's lawyers resisted the bid, describing it as a \"fishing expedition\". Read more from Sky News:Inside missile defence base protecting EuropeStriking bin workers urged to accept dealOver 1,000 Cabinet Office jobs to be axed  On Thursday, Senior Costs Judge Mark Whalan said he was \"not persuaded\" Mrs Vardy's lawyers should be allowed to inspect VAT documents, or other privileged material. But he ruled they should be allowed to see a redacted retainer between Mrs Rooney and her solicitors. Judge Whalan also ordered Mrs Vardy to pay almost £11,000 of costs of the application, stating that he must \"conclude realistically\" that it \"is the defendant and not the claimant\" who had been successful. After the rulings, a spokesperson for Mrs Vardy said: \"In terms of the two judgments today, we are gratified disclosure has been obliged in one ruling whilst being respectfully disappointed that, in the other judgment, our appeal was not successful. \"Now we just wish to move on and look to the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\""

        "Content": "By Peter Nicholas, Garrett Haake and Carol E Lee, NBC News  \"Liberation Day\" just gave way to Capitulation Day. US President Donald Trump pulled back on Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order. Mr Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Tariffs latest: Beijing takes fight to Trump The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Mr Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, a senior administration official told Sky News' US partner network NBC News. \n                  Challenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says Starmer\n                 \n                  China is ready for trade war with the US - and it's not clear Trump knows what he's taking on\n                 \n                  Wolf Hall director on streaming levies: 'The government needs the guts to stand up to the bully in the White House'\n                 Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Mr Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front on Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Mr Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he'll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Mr Trump upped the tariff on the country's biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Mr Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Mr Trump proclaimed: \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.\" It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth.  Read more:Donald Trump has finally blinkedWhat China could do next as Trump's tariff war ramps up Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Mr Trump's popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation's economy. \"Donald Trump's market crash has vaporised a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, said on Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before the president's reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Mr Trump's team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Mr Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive who has been advising Mr Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks,\" while Mr Navarro described Mr Musk as someone who is merely \"a car assembler, in many cases\".  But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Donald Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Mr Musk and Mr Navarro, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a golf partner of Mr Trump's, said: \"I don't think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.\" Markets tend to favour predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Mr Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Mr Trump gave no sign he was about to \"back down quickly on this stuff\". Mr Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. \"He's very confident it's going to work for him,\" the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 And yet in the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, Mr Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Mr Trump's first term. Mr Kudlow told NBC News that he has had \"ongoing\" talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Mr Trump's move Wednesday as \"fabulous,\" Mr Kudlow added: \"Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. \"It's very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.\" Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Mr Graham said he spoke to Mr Trump at length on Tuesday night and told him he had been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Mr Graham's home state and is one of the companies he said he had spoken to. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said on Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Mr Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Mr Kennedy likened Mr Trump to the \"pit bull who caught the car\". Now, he said, the question becomes: \"What are you going to do with the car?\" After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Mr Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had got his attention. \"People were getting a little queasy,\" he acknowledged Wednesday on an event with NASCAR racing champions. \"Over the last few days\" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Mr Bessent and Mr Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. \"We wrote it from our hearts, right?\" Mr Trump said. \"It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don't want to hurt countries that don't need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.\" The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some - but not all - of the \"post-Liberation Day\" losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. \"You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American president in history,\" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted on Wednesday afternoon."

Warning: This article contains graphic details of alleged sexual abuse The controversial social media influencer allegedly told her: \"I'm a boss, you're going to do as I say or there'll be hell to pay.\" The woman, who worked for Tate on his online webcam business, alleges he threatened her daily. She is one of four women who have launched a civil claim against Tate in the UK, with allegations including rape, assault and coercive control. A spokesperson for Tate said he \"categorically denies\" the allegations. In a statement, the spokesperson said: \"Mr Tate categorically denies these unproven and untested allegations. \"Specifically, he denies ever threatening anyone with a firearm, engaging in non-consensual acts or subjecting any individual to physical or psychological harm. \"These are civil claims, brought years after the alleged events and following a CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) decision not to pursue criminal charges. \"It is deeply troubling that such graphic and one-sided accounts are being publicised before any judicial assessment has taken place. \"This type of reporting undermines the presumption of innocence and shapes public perception in a way that is fundamentally unjust. \"We have seen other high-profile cases where similarly serious allegations collapsed under scrutiny - but only after irreparable reputational harm had already been done. \"Mr Tate will defend himself vigorously and remains confident the truth will prevail.\" The civil action was launched in the High Court in London last week, and a preliminary hearing is to be held next week. In the court documents, he describes the allegations as \"a pack of lies\", and in a detailed response said: \"There may have been a toy gun in the flat.\" The woman worked for Tate in Luton in 2015 and is claiming damages for \"assault, battery and/or intentional infliction of harm, including rape\".

The Romanian authorities have agreed that after the completion of their own criminal justice process, the brothers can be extradited to the UK on allegations of rape and human trafficking. The brothers, who have joint UK and US citizenship, are also under criminal investigation in Florida, where they visited recently after a Romanian judge lifted a travel ban on them. They are currently in Dubai, but must return to Romania. The four women claim Tate strangled them during sex, and two developed red spots from burst capillaries in their eyes from asphyxia. In an interview with Sky News last year, one of the claimants said she had consensual sex with Tate during a normal relationship with him, but once lost consciousness when he strangled her. She said: \"We were having sex and he put his hands round my throat and strangled me until I lost consciousness. And when I came round he was still having sex with me, still on top of me. \"The next day, all the white had gone completely red in one of my eyes. I looked it up afterwards and it was just lack of oxygen to your brain where your blood vessels start bursting to try and get more oxygen into your brain. That was quite scary.\" She said she didn't call police because she was young, inexperienced and didn't realise how dangerous the encounter had been."

It was chaos, and in the middle of it, a man still having cancer treatment. If you remember this time 12 months ago, he wasn't even allowed out on full public engagements. Now he was in the middle of what can only be described as a scrum. Security, the Italian president's entourage and members of the royal team all jostling with the locals, as the royal couple tasted traditional food and tried to watch a dance display. I suspect the King and Queen will have loved it. I've been on so many engagements and royal tours before where they enjoy nothing more than getting stuck in, meeting as many people as possible - it must be a nightmare for their police as the royal pair go rogue. But the fact it was only two weeks ago the palace told us the King had suffered side effects from his cancer treatment, and had to cancel a trip to Birmingham, made it particularly surprising to see him right in the middle of the melee.

And as they stepped out on to the balcony of the town hall with Italy's president Sergio Mattarella and his daughter, there was no greater nod to a shared history, as they celebrated allied troops liberating the region of Ravenna 80 years ago to the day.

Space Forge will ship its prototype manufacturing satellite in the coming weeks from an industrial park in the city to the US, where it will be sent into orbit on a SpaceX rocket. Sky News was given exclusive access to the company's dust-free 'clean room' to watch engineers carry out final checks. ForgeStar-1 is already loaded up with the raw ingredients to make a new generation of super-efficient semiconductor chips that would be impossible to produce on the planet's surface. Joshua Western, the company's co-founder, said: \"This is the next industrial revolution but it's in space, it's not on Earth.\" Semiconductors are found in almost all electronic technology. They're currently made from silicon crystals, but the material has a performance ceiling. However, in the microgravity and vacuum of space it's possible to make crystals from a new mix of chemical compounds that would allow computer chips to work faster while consuming less power. \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 \n                  Police searching for missing Cardiff woman launch murder investigation\n                 \"We're able to reduce the energy consumed where they get deployed by more than 50%,\" Joshua said. \"In the UK alone, we're talking billions of pounds being saved in the energy bill alone. \"That's in terms of consumer mobile data, but also data applications that are really (energy) hungry - artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and all the way down to people using ChatGPT at home.\" The prototype will test out the process of making the material, and it's been given the first in-orbit advanced manufacturing licence by the Civil Aviation Authority. If it works, the next mission will be for real, producing pure crystals that could be cloned back on Earth to meet huge demand. The company reckons such high-grade material for electronics could be worth up to £45m per kilogram, far outstripping the cost of launching on a rocket. But to safely bring such a precious cargo back to the planet, the company has had to design its own lightweight heat shield able to withstand high temperatures as it plunges through the atmosphere. It's called Pridwen, named after King Arthur's shield, and it's folded, origami-style, into a tiny space until it's needed. Then it springs open like an umbrella to protect the satellite and slow it down so that it gently splashes down in the ocean, where it can be picked up. ForgeStar-1 is a pioneer.

Huge. \"We've estimated that the opportunity is worth around £20bn to the UK economy over the next 10 years.\" At Space Forge HQ the team will be anxious to see their satellite leave for the US after years of development work. It's a story that could have come straight from Silicon Valley. \"It demonstrates what a couple of guys who started in a garage on the outskirts of the city when they got bored one night in the pub were actually able to do,\" said Joshua. \"There is an optimism with technology now (in the UK) that we didn't always used to have. \"There is a new life in the industrial base, especially around engineering, and that's despite all of the challenges that it has right now.\""

Investigators searched her mobile phone and found that she made a $51.80 (£40) donation to Razom, a charity that provides aid to Ukraine, on the first day of Russia's invasion in 2022. She admitted the charge at a closed trial in the city in August last year and was later jailed for 12 years. Mikhail Mushailov, Ms Karelina's lawyer, said on Instagram that she had been flown to the US from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Thursday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio added that Ms Karelina \"was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year,\" and said \"President Trump secured her release... (and) will continue to work for the release of ALL Americans\". Ms Karelina, an amateur ballerina, was born in Russia but moved to the US in 2012 and became a citizen in 2021. She had moved to Los Angeles, where she worked in a spa. She had been back in Russia visiting family at the start of 2024 when she was arrested, according to rights group The First Department. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed she had proactively collected the money in the interests of one of the Ukrainian organisations. It claimed the donation was \"used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces\". The charity denies it provides military support to Kyiv, while the US authorities have previously called the case against her \"absolutely ludicrous\".

The dual German-Russian citizen was detained in Cyprus at the request of the US. Last year, the US Justice Department said that Petrov participated in a scheme to obtain American-sourced microelectronics for manufacturers supplying the Russian military."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n If you think it is pensions, investments and jobs that matter most in all this, think again. Ultimately, this is about who gets to run the world. The bad news for America and the rest of the West is that this time, China seems far more prepared and up for the fight. On the one side, a chaotic US administration veering sharply from one policy to another. On the other, an authoritarian government digging in its heels. In Trump's first term, China seemed uncertain how to respond to America's maverick new president and his use of tariffs. Its diplomats' rhetoric this time is far more blunt and defiant; \"We are ready for you,\" they seem to be saying, \"and are up for the fight\". Read more: US trade war with China grows more bloody \n                  China believes capitulating to Trump on tariffs serves no purpose and isn't an option\n                 \n                  Day 81: Can the US and China avoid an all-out trade-war?\n                 \n                  US trade war with China grows more bloody as Trump ups the ante once more\n                  America and China have been locked in a history of both dependence and confrontation. Back in the '90s, China was allowed to trade on favourable terms. \"If they became rich like us\", the West believed, \"they'd become more democratic too\". It was a naive belief. China remained authoritarian and was ruthless too, using piracy, reverse engineering and all-out theft of technology to catch up with the West. But the West didn't seem to care. Everyone was getting richer. China was making the world's stuff and lifting millions of its people out of poverty, while America was buying it cheaply and keeping down its own cost of living.  Fast-forward a few decades, and the two giants are still closely entwined as trading partners, but the rancour between them has grown. First under Trump and then under Biden, the US began seeing the error of being too generous to China. Under both presidents, America has been trying to correct what it sees as a trading relationship stacked in Beijing's favour. Chinese objections are different. Most of all, they resent America's status as world hegemon, or strongest power. The liberal world order was built by and for America, they believe, and has reached its sell-by date. It sees this crisis as a chance to change all that. And it has been getting ready.  China presents itself as a stable, predictable alternative world power to America. The first three months of Donald Trump's second presidency are only helping. This is the pitch to other countries: Want a new partner who offers economic stability, equal standing and no awkward lectures on human rights? Ditch America and call Beijing. There are huge downsides, of course, if America is supplanted by China and the world is refashioned in its image. Ask the people of Hong Kong, whose freedoms have been brutally trampled, the Uyghurs of Xinjiang, victims of what is by most accounts a genocide, or the Taiwanese, currently at the sharp end of massive bullying by Beijing. But America has been busy destroying its sales pitch too, no longer a paragon of stability, good government or rational policy making. In any prolonged trade war, Donald Trump is taking on a foe that is prepared and determined. It has moved much of its industry to other countries to avoid tariffs, built up a massive trade war chest in the shape of its sovereign wealth fund used this week to prop up tumbling stock markets. Read more analysis:For China, capitulating to Trump isn't an optionCould Trump's tariffs tip the world into recession? China has weaknesses, of course. Huge demographic problems, a sclerotic economy, and festering public resentment. But it has one great strength over all, an appetite to endure pain. The Chinese call it \"eating bitterness\". It's considered a virtue. They believe their destiny is at the top of a new multipolar world order, and this could be the moment to seize it. It is not clear whether America has quite the same determination and reserves of strength - or if its president knows what he is taking on."

        "Content": " A family of five Spanish tourists, including three children, have been killed in a helicopter crash in New York City. The pilot was among six who died as the aircraft crashed into the Hudson River at around 3.17pm on Thursday. New York Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said divers had recovered all those on board from the helicopter, which was upside down in the water. \"Four victims were pronounced dead on scene and two more were removed to local area hospitals, where sadly both succumbed to their injuries,\" she said. The aircraft was on a tourist flight of Manhattan, run by the New York Helicopters company, with witnesses describing the main rotor blade flying off moments before it dropped out the sky. Lesly Camacho, a worker at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, said she saw the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before it slammed into the water. \"There was a bunch of smoke coming out. It was spinning pretty fast, and it landed in the water really hard,\" she said.  Another witness said \"the chopper blade flew off\". \"I don't know what happened to the tail, but it just straight up dropped,\" Avi Rakesh told Sky's US partner, NBC News. Video on social media showed parts of the Bell 206 helicopter tumbling through the air and landing in the river.  New York Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the six deaths and said authorities believed the tourists were from Spain. He said the flight had taken off from a downtown heliport at around 3pm. The crash happened close to Pier 40 and the Holland tunnel, which links lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighbourhood with Jersey City to its west. Tracking service Flight Radar 24 published what it said was the helicopter's route, with the aircraft appearing to be in the sky for 15 minutes before the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have started an investigation."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  The market rollercoaster of the past week - the tariffs, the jeopardy, the brinkmanship - has highlighted the remarkable nature of an interconnected world we take for granted. There are many frontlines in this global trade war and the port of Duluth-Superior is one. It is a logistical and an engineering wonder. In the northernmost part of the United States, near the border with Canada, there is no seaport anywhere in the world as far inland as this. The sea is more than 2,000 miles away, to the east, along the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Seaway System, a binational waterway with a shared border between the US and Canada. On the portside, vast ocean-going vessels are loaded and unloaded with products which make up the lifeblood of the global economy - iron ore for Canada, cement from Turkey, grain for Algeria and shipping containers packed with \"Made in China\" products for the American market. My guide is Jayson Hron from the Duluth Seaway Port Authority. \"A vessel that is sailing through the seaway to Duluth crosses the international boundary nearly 30 times on that journey,\" he tells me. Duluth-Superior generates $1.6bn (£1.2bn) a year, supports more than 7,000 jobs, and these are nervous times. \"It's certainly a season of more unpredictability than we've seen in the last few years. Unpredictability is bad for ports and bad for supply chains,\" Mr Hron says. Read more:Why Trump finally blinkedThe more 'nuclear' options China could turn toIs there method to madness amid market chaos? Tariffs mean friction and friction is bad for everyone. Approximately 30 million metric tons of waterborne cargo moves through the port each season, placing it among the nation's top 20 ports in terms of cargo flow. \"Iron ore is the port's king cargo by tonnage,\" Mr Hron says. \"It makes up about half of our waterborne tonnage total each year. It is mined 65 miles/104km from the port, on Minnesota's Iron Range.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 But not all of the iron ore sails to domestic mills. Almost a third sailed to Canada in 2024, now subject to the trade war levies between the two nations. \"A fifth of our port's overall waterborne tonnage was Canadian trade in 2024, with the vast majority of it export tonnage from the US to Canada,\" Mr Hron says. Geography combined with American and Canadian engineering over many decades has made this port a logistical wonder. From the high seas, cargo can be imported and exported to and from the heart of the North American continent. On the dockside, the Federal Yoshino is being prepared for her cargo. She will leave here soon with American grain destined for Algeria. The port straddles two states. The John A Blatnik interstate bridge links Duluth with Superior and Minnesota with Wisconsin. A network of roads and rails links the port with the country beyond, and an hour to the southeast are the fields of gold in Wisconsin. Trump suggests farmers can sell more products at home Last year, soybeans were the biggest export from the US to China, totalling nearly $12.8bn (£10bn) in trade. Donald Trump has suggested American farmers can make up the difference by selling more of their products at home. In March, he posted on social media: \"To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\" But there is no solid domestic market for soybeans - America's second largest crop. Two-fifths of the exports go to China. No other export market comes close - 11% to Mexico and 9% to the EU - also now facing potential tariff barriers too. 'These fields are rows of gold' Tanner Johnson is a local farmer and soybean industry representative. He talks regularly to politicians in Washington DC. \"They don't look like much in your hand. But these fields are rows of gold,\" he says. Farmers across this country voted overwhelmingly for Mr Trump. Is there anxiety? Absolutely. \"I don't want to put an exact timeline on when doors around here will close. But in the short term I think most farmers can handle it. Long-term - a year, year plus - things are going to look a lot more bleak around here,\" Mr Johnson tells me. Here, they mostly seem to hold on to a trust in Mr Trump. There remains a belief that his wild negotiating with their livelihoods will pay off. But it's high stakes and with an uncertainty that no one needs."

        "Content": "By Peter Nicholas, Garrett Haake and Carol E Lee, NBC News  \"Liberation Day\" just gave way to Capitulation Day. US President Donald Trump pulled back on Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order. Mr Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Tariffs latest: Beijing takes fight to Trump The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Mr Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, a senior administration official told Sky News' US partner network NBC News. \n                  Challenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says Starmer\n                 \n                  China is ready for trade war with the US - and it's not clear Trump knows what he's taking on\n                 \n                  Wolf Hall director on streaming levies: 'The government needs the guts to stand up to the bully in the White House'\n                 Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Mr Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front on Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Mr Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he'll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Mr Trump upped the tariff on the country's biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Mr Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Mr Trump proclaimed: \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.\" It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth.  Read more:Donald Trump has finally blinkedWhat China could do next as Trump's tariff war ramps up Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Mr Trump's popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation's economy. \"Donald Trump's market crash has vaporised a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, said on Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before the president's reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Mr Trump's team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Mr Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive who has been advising Mr Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks,\" while Mr Navarro described Mr Musk as someone who is merely \"a car assembler, in many cases\".  But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Donald Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Mr Musk and Mr Navarro, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a golf partner of Mr Trump's, said: \"I don't think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.\" Markets tend to favour predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Mr Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Mr Trump gave no sign he was about to \"back down quickly on this stuff\". Mr Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. \"He's very confident it's going to work for him,\" the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 And yet in the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, Mr Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Mr Trump's first term. Mr Kudlow told NBC News that he has had \"ongoing\" talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Mr Trump's move Wednesday as \"fabulous,\" Mr Kudlow added: \"Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. \"It's very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.\" Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Mr Graham said he spoke to Mr Trump at length on Tuesday night and told him he had been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Mr Graham's home state and is one of the companies he said he had spoken to. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said on Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Mr Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Mr Kennedy likened Mr Trump to the \"pit bull who caught the car\". Now, he said, the question becomes: \"What are you going to do with the car?\" After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Mr Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had got his attention. \"People were getting a little queasy,\" he acknowledged Wednesday on an event with NASCAR racing champions. \"Over the last few days\" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Mr Bessent and Mr Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. \"We wrote it from our hearts, right?\" Mr Trump said. \"It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don't want to hurt countries that don't need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.\" The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some - but not all - of the \"post-Liberation Day\" losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. \"You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American president in history,\" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted on Wednesday afternoon."

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n The latest US-Russia prisoner swap is a further sign of the thawing relations between Moscow and Washington, but I think it's also an indication of how slow things are moving. Rewind two months to 11 February and you might remember there was another prisoner swap. Out of the blue, 63-year-old American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been imprisoned in Russia on drug smuggling charges, was suddenly released and on his way home to the US. Ukraine war latest: Kremlin rejects Zelenskyy's China claim It was part of a deal that had been secured following a secret trip to Moscow by US envoy Steve Witkoff, in what marked the first sign of movement towards a peace deal in Ukraine.  Donald Trump said it \"could be a big, important part\" of ending the conflict and that it was a show of good faith from the Russians. It also marked the first sign of rapprochement between the White House and the Kremlin. \n                  Ballerina Ksenia Karelina jailed over Ukraine charity donation released in prisoner swap\n                 \n                  What we learn from video of captured Chinese national in Ukraine - and the serious questions it raises\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy confirms for first time Ukraine forces active in Russia's Belgorod region\n                 Since then, there have been various face-to-face meetings between the two sides, at various levels. There have been at least two phone calls between Trump and Vladimir Putin. We've had talk of sanctions relief, business deals and the resumption of direct flights. But despite the talk, it's just that. Talk. There's still nothing concrete, much to Trump's frustration it seems. The latest round of US-Russia talks, in Istanbul today, is an example of the lack of progress.  Washington said the meeting would be solely focused on \"embassy operations\". That means issues such as paying salaries - which has become harder under sanctions - diplomat travel restrictions and the employment of external contractors including cleaners and gardeners (which Moscow currently forbids for the US mission here). Read more:Video of Chinese national in Ukraine sparks questionsZelenskyy confirms new offensive in Russia So for now, it's still really basic stuff. As the US State Department said yesterday, Ukraine is \"absolutely not on the agenda\". What's striking is that a peace deal appears conditional on the reset of relations, rather than the other way around. To me, that's a sign that Russia is in the driving seat, and not the US. Today's prisoner exchange is part of all this. Like February's swap, I think it's a show of good will, and an attempt by Moscow to keep the Americans sweet, after Putin was accused of dragging his feet in negotiations. It certainly shows Trump that the relationship is moving in the right direction. And on a personal level, for Ksenia Karelina - the Russian-American ballet dancer freed as part of the deal - and her family, it is a hugely significant moment. But on the geopolitical level, these are still just crumbs Russia is offering, not the whole cake."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n If you think it is pensions, investments and jobs that matter most in all this, think again. Ultimately, this is about who gets to run the world. The bad news for America and the rest of the West is that this time, China seems far more prepared and up for the fight. On the one side, a chaotic US administration veering sharply from one policy to another. On the other, an authoritarian government digging in its heels. In Trump's first term, China seemed uncertain how to respond to America's maverick new president and his use of tariffs. Its diplomats' rhetoric this time is far more blunt and defiant; \"We are ready for you,\" they seem to be saying, \"and are up for the fight\". Read more: US trade war with China grows more bloody \n                  China believes capitulating to Trump on tariffs serves no purpose and isn't an option\n                 \n                  Day 81: Can the US and China avoid an all-out trade-war?\n                 \n                  US trade war with China grows more bloody as Trump ups the ante once more\n                  America and China have been locked in a history of both dependence and confrontation. Back in the '90s, China was allowed to trade on favourable terms. \"If they became rich like us\", the West believed, \"they'd become more democratic too\". It was a naive belief. China remained authoritarian and was ruthless too, using piracy, reverse engineering and all-out theft of technology to catch up with the West. But the West didn't seem to care. Everyone was getting richer. China was making the world's stuff and lifting millions of its people out of poverty, while America was buying it cheaply and keeping down its own cost of living.  Fast-forward a few decades, and the two giants are still closely entwined as trading partners, but the rancour between them has grown. First under Trump and then under Biden, the US began seeing the error of being too generous to China. Under both presidents, America has been trying to correct what it sees as a trading relationship stacked in Beijing's favour. Chinese objections are different. Most of all, they resent America's status as world hegemon, or strongest power. The liberal world order was built by and for America, they believe, and has reached its sell-by date. It sees this crisis as a chance to change all that. And it has been getting ready.  China presents itself as a stable, predictable alternative world power to America. The first three months of Donald Trump's second presidency are only helping. This is the pitch to other countries: Want a new partner who offers economic stability, equal standing and no awkward lectures on human rights? Ditch America and call Beijing. There are huge downsides, of course, if America is supplanted by China and the world is refashioned in its image. Ask the people of Hong Kong, whose freedoms have been brutally trampled, the Uyghurs of Xinjiang, victims of what is by most accounts a genocide, or the Taiwanese, currently at the sharp end of massive bullying by Beijing. But America has been busy destroying its sales pitch too, no longer a paragon of stability, good government or rational policy making. In any prolonged trade war, Donald Trump is taking on a foe that is prepared and determined. It has moved much of its industry to other countries to avoid tariffs, built up a massive trade war chest in the shape of its sovereign wealth fund used this week to prop up tumbling stock markets. Read more analysis:For China, capitulating to Trump isn't an optionCould Trump's tariffs tip the world into recession? China has weaknesses, of course. Huge demographic problems, a sclerotic economy, and festering public resentment. But it has one great strength over all, an appetite to endure pain. The Chinese call it \"eating bitterness\". It's considered a virtue. They believe their destiny is at the top of a new multipolar world order, and this could be the moment to seize it. It is not clear whether America has quite the same determination and reserves of strength - or if its president knows what he is taking on."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Global financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few days, but now, with President Donald Trump having paused his \"retaliatory\" tariffs, the situation should stabilise. Here, we outline how the pound in your pocket has been affected. Stock markets, bonds and currencies moved sharply after Mr Trump put a 90-day pause on tariffs other than the base 10% tax slapped on almost all imports to the US. China still faces a levy of 125% on the goods it exports to the US. But there have still been some impactful changes since his so-called \"liberation day\" tariff announcement last week. So, what's happened? Well, last week two more interest rate cuts were expected by the end of this year, but now traders are pricing in three cuts by the Bank of England. Borrowing will become cheaper as the interest rate is now anticipated to be brought down more than previously thought, to 3.75% by the end of 2025 from the current 4.5%. \n                  Challenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says Starmer\n                 \n                  Wolf Hall director on streaming levies: 'The government needs the guts to stand up to the bully in the White House'\n                 \n                  The logistical and engineering wonder on the frontline of Trump's global trade war\n                 Tariffs latest: Beijing takes fight to TrumpMoney blog: 'Barclays just sent me £50' It's not exactly for a good reason, though. The trade war means the UK economy is forecast to grow less. This lower growth is what's making observers think the Bank will cut rates sooner - making borrowing cheaper can lead to more spending. Increased spending can stimulate economic growth. What does this all mean for you? Some debts, like credit card bills, will become a bit cheaper. Mortgages Crucially for anyone soon to re-fix their rate, this means mortgage costs are falling. Already, the typical two and five-year fixed rate deals are coming down, according to data from financial information company Moneyfacts.  After weeks where the average rate would fall only once or twice, there have been larger and daily falls, the data shows. As of Thursday, the typical rate for a five-year deal is 5.14%, and 5.29% for the average two-year fixed mortgage. If the interest rate expectations remain, by the end of the year, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate will fall to 4.3% if a person is borrowing 75% of the property's value, according to analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Filling up your car Another positive that's motivated by a negative is the reduced fuel cost to the motorist of filling up their vehicle. The oil price fell due to rising fears of a recession in the world's biggest economy. Now that those concerns have somewhat subsided, the oil price has remained comparatively low at $63.75 for a barrel of the benchmark Brent crude. It's far below the average price of $80 from last year. This lower cost is likely to filter down to cheaper prices at the pump within days as the sharp oil price drops hit at the end of last week. Lower oil costs could help bring down costs overall, lowering inflation, as oil is still used in many parts of the supply chain. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Savings  Lower interest rates mean falling savings rates, so savers can expect to get less of a return in the coming months. Anyone with a stocks and shares ISA (Individual Savings Account) is likely to get a shock when they see the decline in their returns. Holidays It's not the best time to be heading off on a trip to a country that uses the euro. The pound hasn't strayed far from buying €1.16, a low last seen in August. It means your pound doesn't go as far, as you're getting less euro. Against the dollar, however, sterling has risen to $1.29. The exchange rate had been higher in the immediate wake of Mr Trump's tariff announcement as the dollar value sank. At that point, you could briefly have bought $1.32 for a pound. Supermarket shopping Helpfully, the UK's biggest and most popular UK supermarket, Tesco, updated us that it expects tariffs will have a \"relatively small impact\"."

        "Content": "Are there signs the storm created by Donald Trump's tariffs could be calming? Global markets have rebounded following the US president's announcement of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, prompting hopes that a wider financial crisis could perhaps be avoided. The turnaround came less than 24 hours after steep new tariffs kicked in on most US trading partners and followed the most intense episode of financial market volatility since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But volatile times could still be ahead, with the prospect of the tariffs being reinstated in 90 days and tensions between the US and China. Let's have a look at how markets have fared over the last few days. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the UK's stock market, rose more than 6% on Thursday. UK stocks followed similar rallies for European markets this morning and Asian markets overnight. \n                  How market turmoil has affected mortgages, savings, holidays and fuel\n                 \n                  Tariffs latest: Trump admits 'cost' to tariffs - but says 'everything will be beautiful in the end' after 90-day pause\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has finally blinked - but it's not the stock markets that have forced him to act\n                 But while the FTSE has rebounded following its downturn in earlier days, the index is still far below where it was in the days before Mr Trump's tariffs came into force. On Wednesday, FTSE 100 had finished down by 2.92% - its lowest level since March 2024, 13 months ago. Wall Street had to anxiously watch as the Nasdaq - one of the key indexes tracking the US stock market - plummeted over the last few days. Many financial sector workers surely had to wonder if the president would hold the course with his incendiary tariffs. Before the U-turn, the upheaval had erased trillions of dollars from the market and also led to a surge in US government bond yields - effectively the price at which the US government borrows money - a move that appeared to catch the president's attention. There was relief, then, when Mr Trump announced the 90-day reprieve on the tariffs, which sent the Nasdaq share index rising more than 12%. However, it too still lags behind pre-\"Liberation Day\" levels. In China, which has had its tariffs increased rather than lifted unlike the rest of the world, the Shanghai Composite has risen slightly. Goldman Sachs revised down its forecasts for China's GDP growth to 4% in 2025, from previous projections of 4.5%, citing the negative effects of tariffs. Meanwhile, China's yuan currency hit its lowest level against the dollar on Thursday since the global financial crisis."

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n One year ago, Cassius Walker-Hunt was working at Port Talbot's steel plant. Now, he's running his own coffee shop in the town centre, having been made redundant when Tata Steel announced the closure of the plant's blast furnaces. The 28-year-old told Sky News the situation the town faced was \"completely life-changing\". \"They called it an end of an era, and it was. That type of workforce in Wales now is gone, it wasn't just a company shutting down, it was generations of knowledge and generations of workers,\" he said. Six months since Port Talbot's last blast furnace was closed as part of Tata's green transition, talks are ongoing to save thousands of jobs at British Steel amid plans to close Scunthorpe's blast furnaces. Mr Walker-Hunt was the fourth generation of his family to work in Port Talbot's steel industry, a tradition now at an end. \"It's something that I will never forget to be honest, being around the boys for the last time and all of us going off doing different things,\" he said. \n                  Man admits attempted murder of child in Ceredigion\n                 \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 Mr Walker-Hunt said if the UK government did decide to nationalise British Steel, he would be \"happy\" for the people of Scunthorpe, but that it would come as a \"low blow\" to Port Talbot. \"Why couldn't we have it? Why have you left us, our lot, fall apart? Why couldn't we get that support?\" 'Groundhog Day' Tata Steel announced last January that it was cutting 2,800 jobs, with most of those in Port Talbot. Jack Harper had planned to spend his career working at the steelworks in the town. He worked as an apprentice there from 2022 until September last year when he was let go. The 29-year-old said watching the ongoing talks in Scunthorpe was \"like Groundhog Day\". \"It's been the exact same process, if not worse. Because the economic situation and the political situation is a lot worse with tariffs. We don't know where we stand with it,\" he said. Mr Harper now works as a union support worker, helping former steelworkers as they look for alternative employment. \"It's very gratifying because a lot of people I know have come through the door and have obviously got support through us. Ex-colleagues, friends, so it's been really good helping people I actually know,\" he said. \"The vast majority have been men, I'd say in their 30s to 50s, family men. They've got to put food on the table and when the one ticket in town, the major ticket in town, is gone, it's a scramble now to find employment and get back on your feet.\" The steelworks in Scunthorpe are \"a massive part of the UK industry\", according to Mr Harper. \"It's not going to look good if we're importing all of that from abroad, especially in the current economic situation,\" he added. 'Worth fighting for' Plaid Cymru called for the nationalisation of Port Talbot steelworks last year when Tata announced its plans to replace its blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace, but those calls were \"dismissed\". The party's business and trade spokesperson, Llinos Medi, said if the nationalisation of the steelworks at Scunthorpe goes ahead, people in Port Talbot would \"rightly ask why their jobs and community were not worth fighting for\". Liberal Democrat MP David Chadwick said constituents of his would be asking why the government \"allowed\" more than 2,000 jobs to be cut in Wales but were \"seemingly less accepting of the destruction it would cause elsewhere\". The Conservatives have pointed to their £500m rescue deal, which retained around 25% of the workforce at Port Talbot, and have called for a commercial solution in Scunthorpe. Meanwhile, Reform UK has backed bringing British Steel under public ownership to secure the future of the industry. A UK government spokesperson said Port Talbot \"has always been and will always be a steelmaking town\" but that the industry's economic stability relied on \"a cleaner, greener future\". \"Our Steel Strategy will set forth a positive vision for the future of the industry, backed up by up to £2.5bn of government investment, on top of the £500m being provided to transform Port Talbot,\" they added. The Welsh government said it has been \"working closely with all parties to ensure that a range of support is available\". \"Much of the £80m transition funding from UK government is allocated to tailored support and we'd encourage anyone who has not already done so to see what support is available to them,\" it added.

But the UK's most popular supermarket - with the biggest market share - expects profits to be lower next year amid what its chief executive described as an \"intensification of competition\" in the UK.

Talk of a supermarket price war was sparked after Asda said it was ready to take a hit to profits to improve its offering and cut prices. Government criticism The strong business performance for Tesco came as the grocery chain was vocally critical of the increased employers' national insurance contributions imposed by the government. It is facing a £235m bill as a result of the policy, its financial results for the 2024-25 fiscal year indicated on Thursday. Mr Murphy also reiterated his criticism of business rates, a tax on non-domestic properties, saying they have \"grown exponentially\" and asking the government \"to really look at it\" and \"be fair in the way they levy their taxes\". Spending trends In a sign that the cost of living crisis may be receding for some, Tesco's \"Finest\" line saw a sales growth of 15%. Some products also became cheaper over the year as the retailer reported 2,300 products came down an average of 9% in price. More people were doing their shopping online, with those sales up 10%. Tesco's market share is now at a decade-long high.  Tariffs  While businesses scramble to assess the impact of US President Donald Trump's 10% tariffs on the UK and greater levies on China, cars and some metals, Tesco said the new taxes will have a \"relatively small impact\". \"We don't believe the impact of the tariffs are significant at this stage,\" Mr Murphy told media outlets on Thursday morning. This is due to the fact the majority of its products come from UK suppliers and it is entering a season where that proportion increases, he said. Though things are \"moving very quickly\", and it's \"hard to know\" the significance of announcements."

Sky News has learnt that the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is among the bidders for the long-term income stream generated by the arena. Pension fund sources said a number of prominent institutional investors were participating in an auction being run by Eastdil, the real estate-focused investment bank. USS, which owns stakes in the operator of Britain's air traffic control service and Moto, the motorway service station chain, is understood to be a serious contender for the O2 arena lease. It is among the shareholders burnt by the financial implosion of Thames Water, and has written its stake down to zero as a rescue deal is negotiated. The auction has been under way for some time, with Sky News having revealed several months ago that it was being put up for sale by Cambridge University's wealthiest college. Trinity College, which ranks among Britain's biggest landowners, acquired the site in 2009 for a reported £24m. \n                  How market turmoil has affected mortgages, savings, holidays and fuel\n                 \n                  Tariffs latest: Trump admits 'cost' to tariffs - but says 'everything will be beautiful in the end' after 90-day pause\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has finally blinked - but it's not the stock markets that have forced him to act\n                 The O2, which shrugged off its 'white elephant' status in the aftermath of its disastrous debut as the Millennium Dome in 2000, has since become one of the world's leading entertainment venues. Operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group, it has played host to a wide array of music, theatrical and sporting events over nearly a quarter of a century. The opportunity to acquire the 999-year lease is likely to lead to a deal being struck later in the spring. Trinity College, which was founded by Henry VIII in 1546, bought the O2 lease from Lend Lease and Quintain, the property companies which had taken control of the Millennium Dome site in 2002 for nothing. A USS spokesman declined to comment."

I much prefer a beautiful, well-aged Jersey Angus sirloin or ribeye steak cooked medium-rare. For a cheap meal I go to... Upstairs at Anley Street, run by Chris and Claire Witham. They do a fantastic value Dirty Buns menu every Tuesday to Saturday from 12-2.30pm where you can get a double cheese smashburger for £11 and treat yourself to a spicy marg for £6. Or trade the drink for a water and instead have the duck fat potatoes - delicious! One restaurant that's worth blowing out for is... L'Enclume in Cumbria. It stands above all the rest. When we went it was the most perfect evening - everything from the service, food, wine and team, all in a wonderful setting. I cut costs in my restaurant by... trying to use more of the same types of ingredients across all the board. For example, we offer Jersey oysters for a snack in the Bohemia restaurant and now also offer them in the bar too. We have recently aligned our bar menu with the restaurant menu for a few items. \n                  'I wish they realised': Top chef reveals the one thing customers should know about their bill\n                 \n                  Chef on giving pizza to homeless and why you shouldn't throw away citrus peel\n                 \n                  Chef reveals his pet hate from customers and cheaper olive oil substitute\n                 Braised meat is a good cheap substitute... For example: beef cheek or short rib of beef. Brine the meat for a day, then soak in red wine for six hours. Make it like a bourguignon and cook it low and slow until tender, then reduce some of the sauce until sticky. Add a couple of knobs of butter to coat the meat and serve with a beautiful mash and some kale. It's a dish we have in Bohemia Bar at the moment.

Sky News has learnt that Habitual, which is run by co-founder Napala Pratini, has secured £1m in a funding round led by Lexham Partners, a prominent investor in early-stage companies. The fundraising, which will be announced later this week, comes during a period of rapid growth in the market for weight loss programmes and medication. Habitual offers consumers products including meal replacement shakes and soups, and personalised advice on their weight loss regimes. It also prescribes Wegovy, the medication made by Novo Nordisk and which competes with rival products such as Ozempic. Some estimates suggest the global market for weight loss medications is forecast to reach $150bn in sales during the coming years.

Sky News has learnt that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has approved the reappointment of Nikhil Rathi, whose initial five-year term expires in September. An announcement is expected from the Treasury later on Thursday, according to government officials. The extension of Mr Rathi's tenure until 2030 will come at a time when the Labour government is scrutinising the performance and strategy of scores of economic regulators amid a frantic search for growth. The FCA had been under intense pressure to scale back the intrusiveness of its rules in relation to enforcement, culminating in a recent announcement that it would modify proposals to 'name and shame' companies under investigation. Sky News revealed earlier this year that the Payment Systems Regulator would be scrapped and folded into the FCA, a move subsequently confirmed by the government. Mr Rathi's presentation last month of the FCA's new five-year strategy had prompted speculation that he was minded to stay, after Sky News revealed last year that he had applied to replace Simon Case as cabinet secretary. Mr Rathi had significant credentials for that role, having served as private secretary to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown during their respective stints as prime minister. He also spent nearly a decade in senior Treasury posts, including as head of its financial stability unit and as director of its financial services group. In 2014, he joined the London Stock Exchange, becoming its chief executive in 2015. During his time at the FCA, he had to contend with an often difficult relationship with the government, with public rows about its enforcement regime and approach to economic growth punctuating his tenure. The Treasury declined to comment."

        "Content": "By Alexandra Rogers and Faye Brown, political reporters   The government will fund any further local inquiries into the grooming gangs scandal that are deemed necessary, Sir Keir Starmer has said. However, the prime minister said it is his \"strong belief\" that the focus must be on implementing recommendations from the Alexis Jay national review before more investigations go ahead. Politics latest: 'Our position hasn't changed' on tariffs, says minister It follows a row over whether Labour is still committed to the five local inquiries it promised in January, after safeguarding minister Jess Phillips failed to provide an update on them in a statement to parliament hours before it closed for recess on Tuesday. Instead, Ms Phillips told MPs that local authorities will be able to access a £5m fund to support locally-led work on grooming gangs. On Thursday morning, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper insisted the \"victim-centred, locally-led inquiries\" will still go ahead, while a Home Office source told Sky News more could take place in addition to the five. Speaking to Sky News' Rob Powell later on Thursday, Sir Keir confirmed that there could be more inquiries than those five but said the government must also \"get on and implement the recommendations we've already got\". \n                  Sir Keir Starmer says 24,000 people who have 'no right to be here' have been returned under Labour\n                 \n                  Illegal migration 'pits nations against one another', Sir Keir Starmer to tell summit\n                 \n                  Government looking at other countries to process asylum seekers in, home secretary says\n                 The prime minister said: \"Of course, if there's further local inquiries that are needed then we will put some funding behind that, and they should happen. \"But I don't think that simply saying we need more inquiries when we haven't even acted on the ones that we've had is necessarily the only way forward.\"  Ms Phillips's earlier comments led to accusations that the government was diluting the importance of the local inquiries by giving councils choice over how to use the funds. Sky News understands she was due to host a briefing with MPs this afternoon at 5pm - the second she had held in 24 hours - in an attempt to calm concern amongst her colleagues. Review recommendations 'sat on a shelf' Sir Keir insisted he is not watering down his commitment for the five local enquiries, but said the Jay recommendations were \"sitting on a shelf under the last government\" and he is \"equally committed\" to them. He added: \"At the most important level, if there is evidence of grooming that is coming to light now, we need a criminal investigation. I want the police investigation because I want perpetrators in the dock and I want justice delivered.\" In October 2022, Professor Alexis Jay finished a seven-year national inquiry into the many ways children in England and Wales had been sexually abused, including grooming gangs. Girls as young as 11 were groomed and raped across a number of towns and cities in England over a decade ago. Prof Jay made 20 recommendations which haven't been implemented yet, with Sir Keir saying on Thursday he will bring 17 of them forward. However, the Tories and Reform UK want the government to fund a new national inquiry specifically into grooming gangs, demands for which first started last year after interventions by tech billionaire Elon Musk on his social media platform X. 'Fuelling confusion' Reform leader Nigel Farage said the statement made by Ms Phillips \"was one of the most cowardly things I have ever seen\" as he repeated calls for a fresh inquiry. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, also told Sky News that ministers were \"fuelling confusion\" and that the \"mess.. could have been avoided if the government backed a full national inquiry - not this piecemeal alternative\". Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the government needed to look at \"state failings\" and she would try and force a fresh vote on holding another national inquiry, which MPs voted down in January. 'Political mess' As well as facing criticism from the Opposition, there are signs of a backlash within Labour over how the issue has been handled. Political correspondent With about an hour until the House of Commons rose for Easter recess, the government announced it was taking a more \"flexible\" approach to the local grooming gang inquiries.\n\n Safeguarding minister Jess Philips argued this was based on experience from certain affected areas, and that the government is funding new police investigations to re-open historic cases.\n\n Speaking on Times Radio, former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission Sir Trevor Phillips called the move \"utterly shameful\" and claimed it was a political decision.\n\n One Labour MP told Sky News: \"Some people are very angry. I despair. I don’t disagree with many of our decisions but we just play to Reform – someone somewhere needs sacking.\" The government has insisted party political misinformation was fanning the flames of frustration in Labour. The government also said it was not watering down the inquiries and was actually increasing the action being taken. But while many Labour MPs have one eye on Reform in the rearview mirror, any accusations of being soft on grooming gangs only provides political ammunition to their adversaries. One Labour MP told Sky News the issue had turned into a \"political mess\" and that they were being called \"grooming sympathisers\". On the update from Ms Phillips on Tuesday, they said it might have been the \"right thing to do\" but that it was \"horrible politically\". \"We are all getting so much abuse. It's just political naivety in the extreme.\" Read more:Grooming gangs: What we know from the dataFewer criminals set to be jailed amid overcrowding 'We will leave no stone unturned' Ms Phillips later defended her decision, saying there was \"far too much party political misinformation about the action that is being taken when everyone should be trying to support victims and survivors\". \"We are funding new police investigations to re-open historical cases, providing national support for locally led inquiries and action, and Louise Casey... is currently reviewing the nature, scale and ethnicity of grooming gangs offending across the country,\" she said. \"We will not hesitate to go further, unlike the previous government, who showed no interest in this issue over 14 years and did nothing to progress the recommendations from the seven-year national inquiry when they had the chance. \"We will leave no stone unturned in pursuit of justice for victims and will be unrelenting in our crackdown on sick predators and perpetrators who prey on vulnerable children.\""

Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips this week sparked fresh uncertainty over whether regional inquiries into grooming gangs - promised by the government in January - would go ahead. Following two days of confusion, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, insisted on Thursday that five local inquiries will take place - and hinted more could follow. But her comments have done little to reassure Marlon West, whose daughter Scarlett was a victim of sexual exploitation in Manchester.  Ms Phillips's statement in parliament on Tuesday - which sparked criticism after it failed to mention the reviews - left survivors \"so disappointed\", he said. The uncertainty \"makes you dizzy because you get hope and think 'I'm getting somewhere now' then they do a U-turn as they've done twice this week\", Mr West continued. \"I think they should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said. \"The government now are messing around with survivors' lives and campaigners like me.\"  Throughout her ordeal, Scarlett has \"been let down by the local authority, by social workers, by the police force,\" he said. \"With the government, she's just been let down again. That's what's cruel.\" Mr West added he is \"really disappointed\" in the government's decision to push forward with the five regional inquiries instead of a statutory, national one. He pointed out that police officers and professionals can refuse to give evidence at regional inquiries, whereas national ones can compel them to do so. \"With a statutory inquiry, it'd be more like a [legal] setting,\" Mr West said. \"Professionals will not be allowed to refuse interviews. They have to attend. \"It needs to [be in a] legal arena where they are compelled to give evidence.\" His comments came as the prime minister said the government is focussing on implementing the \"hundreds\" of recommendations from previous inquiries into grooming gangs. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"My strong belief is we've got to implement those recommendations. \"At the moment, and under the last government, they just stacked up and sat on a shelf. So they need to be implemented.\"  Read more:A timeline of the scandalWhat we know from grooming gangs data Both the prime minister and the home secretary have rejected claims the government's pledge to hold \"victim-centred, locally-led inquiries\" is being \"watered down\".

We're not watering it down. We're committed to that. \"But, I'm equally committed to implementing the recommendations that we've got.\""

The Conservative leader said that while she doesn't actively support council coalitions, she is ultimately leaving the decision to local politicians \"because they can't have a re-election if they don't have an outright majority\". Politics Live: Cabinet Office slashes workforce as 1,200 jobs cut However, she said that at a national level \"we're trying to rebuild trust with the public\" and \"suddenly saying that we're rushing to form a pact or merge with another party is not what I was elected to do\". Ms Badenoch was speaking during a local election visit to Lancashire after earlier comments about local coalitions were attacked by opposition parties. She has consistently ruled out a pact at a national level with Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage has vowed to \"destroy\" the Tories. But speaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday, she suggested the picture could be different at a local level, saying: \"I've seen Conservatives go into coalition with Labour, with Liberal Democrats, with Independents. \n                  Nigel Farage would turn UK into a 'Trump tribute act', Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says\n                 \n                  Badenoch makes bleak local elections prediction - as Farage mocks 'comical' new slogan\n                 \n                  Kemi Badenoch thinks she's started a journey - a ruthless party may soon have other ideas\n                 \"What I'm telling local leaders across the country (is) they have to do what is right for the people in their local area and they must stick to Conservative principles.\" Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said it is \"crystal clear\" that if you vote Reform or Conservative, \"you're opening the door to more of the Tory chaos that held our country back over the past 14 years\". Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the two parties had \"merged in all but name\", adding: \"You couldn't put a cigarette paper between Badenoch and Farage when it comes to their policies. It's clear the Conservatives have totally abandoned the centre ground.\" Reform meanwhile snubbed the offer, saying they are \"not interested in coalitions\" and are focused on \"taking the fight to Labour and the Conservatives\".  Ms Badenoch later insisted she is \"'not supporting coalitions at a local level\". She told reporters: \"I am leaving the decision to local leaders because they can't have a re-election if they don't have an outright majority. \"And it's right that they do what they need to do to serve the people of a community.

Space Forge will ship its prototype manufacturing satellite in the coming weeks from an industrial park in the city to the US, where it will be sent into orbit on a SpaceX rocket. Sky News was given exclusive access to the company's dust-free 'clean room' to watch engineers carry out final checks. ForgeStar-1 is already loaded up with the raw ingredients to make a new generation of super-efficient semiconductor chips that would be impossible to produce on the planet's surface. Joshua Western, the company's co-founder, said: \"This is the next industrial revolution but it's in space, it's not on Earth.\" Semiconductors are found in almost all electronic technology. They're currently made from silicon crystals, but the material has a performance ceiling. However, in the microgravity and vacuum of space it's possible to make crystals from a new mix of chemical compounds that would allow computer chips to work faster while consuming less power. \n                  Cardiff University's nursing course may continue despite threat of major cuts\n                 \n                  Colin Richards: Teenager found guilty murdering father-of-seven\n                 \n                  Police searching for missing Cardiff woman launch murder investigation\n                 \"We're able to reduce the energy consumed where they get deployed by more than 50%,\" Joshua said. \"In the UK alone, we're talking billions of pounds being saved in the energy bill alone. \"That's in terms of consumer mobile data, but also data applications that are really (energy) hungry - artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and all the way down to people using ChatGPT at home.\" The prototype will test out the process of making the material, and it's been given the first in-orbit advanced manufacturing licence by the Civil Aviation Authority. If it works, the next mission will be for real, producing pure crystals that could be cloned back on Earth to meet huge demand. The company reckons such high-grade material for electronics could be worth up to £45m per kilogram, far outstripping the cost of launching on a rocket. But to safely bring such a precious cargo back to the planet, the company has had to design its own lightweight heat shield able to withstand high temperatures as it plunges through the atmosphere. It's called Pridwen, named after King Arthur's shield, and it's folded, origami-style, into a tiny space until it's needed. Then it springs open like an umbrella to protect the satellite and slow it down so that it gently splashes down in the ocean, where it can be picked up. ForgeStar-1 is a pioneer.

Nafeesa Dajda, chief of missions at the Catapult, said Britain is taking the lead. \"We can communicate from pretty much anywhere on Earth using satellite technology,\" she said. \"There's an opportunity now to think about how we use space in a different way and the unique environment that space provides us with, that microgravity environment, means we can do things we just can't do on Earth. \"So how big could this be for the UK? Huge. \"We've estimated that the opportunity is worth around £20bn to the UK economy over the next 10 years.\" At Space Forge HQ the team will be anxious to see their satellite leave for the US after years of development work. It's a story that could have come straight from Silicon Valley. \"It demonstrates what a couple of guys who started in a garage on the outskirts of the city when they got bored one night in the pub were actually able to do,\" said Joshua. \"There is an optimism with technology now (in the UK) that we didn't always used to have. \"There is a new life in the industrial base, especially around engineering, and that's despite all of the challenges that it has right now.\""

        "Headline": "Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky says streaming levies are urgently needed to save high-end British TV, and without them shows like Mr Bates Vs The Post Office won't get made in the future.",
        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  The director of hit BBC period drama Wolf Hall says the government \"needs to have enough guts to stand up to the bully in the White House\" to protect the future of public service broadcasting. Peter Kosminsky told Sky News' Breakfast with Anna Jones that calls for a streaming levy to support British high-end TV production was urgently needed to stop the \"decimation\" of the UK industry. His comments follow the release of a new report from the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee, calling for the government to improve support measures for the UK's high-quality drama sector while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content. Specifically, the report calls for streamers - including Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+ and Disney+, all of which are based in the US - to commit to paying 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences. Kosminsky, who made the case for the levy and gave evidence to the committee in January, called global tariffs recently introduced by Donald Trump \"the elephant in the room\". He said he feared they would make the government reticent to introduce a streaming levy, but said it was a necessary step to \"defend a hundred years of honourable tradition of public service broadcasting in this country and not see it go to the wall because [the government are] frightened of the consequences from the bully in the States\". Kosminsky also noted that the streamers would be able to apply for money from the fund themselves, as long as they were in co-production with a UK public service broadcaster. \n                  Challenge posed by Trump's tariffs has 'not gone away', says Starmer\n                 \n                  China is ready for trade war with the US - and it's not clear Trump knows what he's taking on\n                 \n                  How Trump changed his mind on tariffs\n                 Earlier this year, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\". In response to the call for streaming levies, a Netflix spokesperson said such a move would \"penalise audiences\" and \"diminish competitiveness\". They added: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.\" The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said such a levy \"risks damaging UK growth and the global success story of the UK TV sector,\" and \"would risk dampening streamers' existing investment in domestic content and would inevitably increase costs for businesses\". COBA said it welcomed the committee's support for targeted tax breaks for domestic drama. Kosminsky also told Sky News the second series of Wolf Hall was nearly called off just six weeks before it was due to start shooting due to financial pressures, adding: \"It was only because the producer, the director, writer and the leading actor all agreed to take huge cuts in their own remuneration that the show actually got made.\" He said that both he and the show's executive producer, Sir Colin Callender, had \"worked on the show unpaid for 11 years on the basis that we would get a payment when the show went into production\", calling it \"a bitter blow\" to see that disappear. Working in public service broadcasting for his entire career, Kosminsky said it was \"absolutely heartbreaking for me and others like me to see that the industry we have been nurtured by and we care about is being decimated\". While he said he was a \"huge fan of the streamers\", he said it was their \"very deep pockets\" that had \"driven up the price of what we do\", to the point where the traditional broadcasters can no longer afford to make high-end television. Just this week, Adolescence, created by British talent Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, became the fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views. But while some very British shows might get taken on by the streamers due to universal appeal, Kosminsky said dramas including ITV's Mr Bates Vs The Post Office and Hillsborough, and BBC drama Three Girls about the grooming of young girls by gangs in the north of England were examples of game-changing productions that could be lost in the future. He warned: \"These are not dramas that the streamers would ever make, they're about free speech in this country. That's part of what we think of as a democratic society, where we can make these dramas and programmes that challenge on issues of public policy that would never be of any interest in America.\" The CMS report comes following an inquiry into British film and high-end television, which considered how domestic and inward investment production was being affected by the rise of streaming platforms. Chairwoman of the CMS committee, Dame Caroline Dinenage, said \"there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens\" unless the government intervenes to \"rebalance the playing field\" between streamers and public service broadcasters (PSBs). A DCMS spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our Industrial Strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline. We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\""

        "Content": "Rebekah Vardy has lost an appeal after claiming Coleen Rooney's lawyers \"deliberately\" understated some of their client's costs during the \"Wagatha Christie\" libel case. The high-profile court case took place after Mrs Rooney, wife of former Man Utd striker Wayne Rooney, accused Mrs Vardy on social media in 2019 of leaking her private information to the press. Mrs Vardy, wife of Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, unsuccessfully tried to sue Mrs Rooney in a libel battle in 2022 that captivated some areas of the public and was later dramatised for TV. The judge ordered Mrs Vardy to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs, including an initial payment of £800,000. Both women are now in a further dispute over how much Mrs Vardy should pay in legal costs as a result. In October last year, a specialist costs judge ruled Mrs Rooney's lawyers did not commit misconduct after they were accused by Mrs Vardy's legal team of understating some of her costs. Mrs Vardy appealed against the decision last month while Mrs Rooney's lawyers claimed the challenge was \"misconceived\". \n                  'It was a storm... now it's a hurricane': Has the cost of living crisis been forgotten?\n                 \n                  Starmer says government will fund further local grooming gangs inquiries if 'needed'\n                 \n                  Prince Harry visits war victims in Ukraine\n                 In a ruling on Thursday, High Court judge Mr Justice Cavanagh dismissed the appeal. He said: \"The appeal must fail on the basis that the judge was entitled to reach the conclusion that he came to.\" A hearing last October was told that Mrs Rooney's claimed legal bill - £1,833,906.89 - was more than three times her \"agreed costs budget of £540,779.07\". Jamie Carpenter KC, for Mrs Vardy, said that this was \"disproportionate\", and that the earlier \"understatement\" of some costs was \"improper and unreasonable\" and used to \"attack the other party's costs\". However, Senior Costs Judge Andrew Gordon-Saker said that while there was a \"failure to be transparent\" by Mrs Rooney's legal team, he found \"on balance and, I have to say, only just\" that they had not committed wrongdoing. In written submissions for the appeal against the decision last month, Mr Carpenter said Mrs Rooney \"very substantially understated\" her costs by around 40% in her budget, known as a \"precedent H\", in 2021, and that the amount Mrs Vardy should pay should therefore be reduced. Benjamin Williams KC, for Mrs Rooney, said in his written submissions that her budget was \"properly and correctly completed\" and there was \"no tenable case\" of misconduct. In a separate ruling on Thursday, Mrs Vardy largely lost a bid for access to more documents in relation to costs. Her lawyers asked the court in February to order Mrs Rooney's team to hand over \"privileged\" documents, details about her claim for VAT, and further information about retainers between Mrs Rooney and her solicitors. Mrs Rooney's lawyers resisted the bid, describing it as a \"fishing expedition\". Read more from Sky News:Inside missile defence base protecting EuropeStriking bin workers urged to accept dealOver 1,000 Cabinet Office jobs to be axed  On Thursday, Senior Costs Judge Mark Whalan said he was \"not persuaded\" Mrs Vardy's lawyers should be allowed to inspect VAT documents, or other privileged material. But he ruled they should be allowed to see a redacted retainer between Mrs Rooney and her solicitors. Judge Whalan also ordered Mrs Vardy to pay almost £11,000 of costs of the application, stating that he must \"conclude realistically\" that it \"is the defendant and not the claimant\" who had been successful. After the rulings, a spokesperson for Mrs Vardy said: \"In terms of the two judgments today, we are gratified disclosure has been obliged in one ruling whilst being respectfully disappointed that, in the other judgment, our appeal was not successful. \"Now we just wish to move on and look to the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n        The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, will soon find out if they can be released from prison. Lyle Menendez, 56, and his 53-year-old brother Erik are serving life in prison without parole for the shotgun murders of their father and mother - Jose and Kitty Menendez. Speaking from prison for the first time in nearly 10 years, Lyle said he and his brother are \"cautiously hopeful\" about being freed. \"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he told TMZ in an interview at the beginning of April. The brothers have maintained their parents abused them since they were first charged with the murders. A Netflix drama series about the brothers called Monsters, which aired in September, thrust them back into the spotlight and led to renewed calls for their release - including from their family. The brothers' lawyers asked Los Angeles prosecutors to review their sentencing, potentially paving the way for their release. \n                  Six killed as sightseeing helicopter crashes into New York's Hudson River\n                 \n                  Tariffs latest: Trump admits 'cost' to tariffs - but says 'everything will be beautiful in the end' after 90-day pause\n                 \n                  The logistical and engineering wonder on the frontline of Trump's global trade war\n                 After being pushed back a number of times the resentencing hearing is scheduled to take place on 11 April. But what is the case for the brothers' freedom, is there new evidence - and why has the decision been delayed until now? An old defence with new evidence The Menendez brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time their parents died, admitted shooting them before they were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996. But they claim they killed them in self-defence after enduring physical, emotional and sexual abuse over many years, including being molested by their father. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any sexual abuse. They said the brothers were after their parents' multimillion-dollar estate. The jury in their first trial in 1993 was deadlocked before the jury in their second trial found them guilty, rejecting a death sentence in favour of life without parole. But their lawyers argue that because of society's changing views on sexual abuse, the brothers may not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole today. They say they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder, but this was not an option for the jury during the second trial. The brothers' defence team has also uncovered a letter that Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin which is dated months before the murders, which they say alludes to him being abused by his father. Read more:Kim Kardashian visits Lyle and Erik Menendez in jailNetflix series star 'stands with' Menendez brothersMonsters creator reacts after family label drama 'grotesque' LA district attorney (DA) George Gascon briefly shared the letter to his Instagram page before deleting the post. In the handwritten letter, Erik wrote: \"I've been trying to avoid dad... every night, I stay up thinking he might come in.\" He also said he was \"afraid\" and that he needed to \"put it out of my mind\" and \"stop thinking about it\". Roy Rossello, a former member of the band Menudo, also spoke out in the Peacock documentary series Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, alleging he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez as a teenager in the 1980s. The band was signed under RCA Record at the time, where Jose Menendez was chief operating officer, and Mr Rossello claims he drugged and raped him. How can they be freed? Former LA district attorney George Gascon asked LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic to review their convictions before he left the role in December. He recommended giving them a revised sentence of 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for youth parole because they were less than 26 years old when they killed their parents. The judge has been asked to look at whether the pair have been rehabilitated, based on their behaviour in prison. A document filed by the lawyers highlights some of their achievements while behind bars, including both attaining several degrees and contributing to the community. It lists a prison \"beautification programme\" Lyle Menendez started called GreenSpace as one example, and adds that both brothers have received low-risk assessment scores, with Lyle apparently not being involved in a single fight during his time in jail. The lawyers have also submitted the letter Erik wrote to his cousin as new evidence, saying it was not seen by the jury when the brothers were sentenced in 1996 and could have influenced their decision. Roy Rossello has also provided a signed declaration of his alleged rape by Jose Menendez to the brothers' lawyers, which they say is further proof of his supposed abusive nature. In a news conference, Mr Gascon clarified that the review was not to determine whether or not the brothers killed their parents, saying it was \"factual\" and \"well established\" they had. He also said more than 300 people had been resentenced during his term as district attorney and only four had gone on to reoffend. Why has the hearing been delayed? Judge Jesic said it was partially because he needed time to review 17 boxes of documents relating to the case and was \"not ready to go forward\". But it's also because the DA who recommended the review, Mr Gascon, has been replaced by Nathan Hochman, who took office on 2 December. The judge said the delay was also to give Mr Hochman enough time to review and weigh in on the case. The new DA, a Republican-turned-independent, has differing views to his predecessor Mr Gascon, a Democrat known for his particularly progressive views. The trial was set for the end of January, but it was pushed back again to March due to the California wildfires. The two-day resentencing hearing was delayed for a second time to 11 April, where instead a hearing to decide if the resentencing petition proposed by Mr Gascon will be upheld or withdrawn. Depending on what the court decides, a resentencing hearing could happen on 17-18 April. Big changes since new district attorney took office LA's previous DA Gascon called for the resentencing because he believed the brothers had been rehabilitated in prison, and felt their trial would have been treated differently with today's understanding of how sexual and physical abuse affects children. This gave the Menendez brothers hope, because when prosecutors support resentencing, there is \"somewhat of a presumption\" that the court will do it, says Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But his successor, Mr Hochman, disagrees, saying the brothers have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents and \"fell short\" of taking full responsibility for their crimes. He has opposed the resentencing, saying it's because of their \"lack of full insight and lack of complete responsibility for their murders\". His office has submitted an 88-page document urging the judge to withdraw the previous DA's resentencing motion. It does not mean the resentencing is getting called off, but experts like Ms Levenson say it significantly reduces the likelihood of the judge ruling in the brothers' favour. Another potential road to freedom In addition to a resentencing, the brothers have also sought their freedom through a request for clemency from California governor Gavin Newsom, who has the power to free them himself. Mr Newsom, who supported Mr Gascon, ruled out making a decision until he has heard Mr Hochman's views on the brothers' case. \"The governor respects the role of the district attorney in ensuring justice is served and recognises that voters have entrusted District Attorney-elect Hochman to carry out this responsibility,\" Mr Newsom's office said in a statement on 25 November. \"The governor will defer to the DA-elect's review and analysis of the Menendez case prior to making any clemency decisions.\" But even after Mr Hochman's decision to push against the brothers' freedom, their hopes of Mr Newsome granting clemency have not disappeared. At the end of February, the governor ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public. It was a move celebrated by the Menendez's lawyers, who said in a statement: \"The family realises that the governor's action does not mean he will commute the sentences. Instead, this initial step reflects the governor's considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison.\" Mr Newsom said he wanted the parole board to finish the risk assessment within 90 days. A hearing allowing victims' family members and prosecutors to participate in the process, is now scheduled to take place in June. Ms Levenson has suggested that because of the change at the DA's office, clemency is now the brothers' best shot at freedom. What the Menendez family says Some of the brothers' extended relatives attended the hearing on 25 November where a resentencing date was originally set. Two of their aunts testified, making what a lawyer for the siblings described during a brief news conference as \"impassioned pleas\" for Erik and Lyle to be sent home. Erik's stepdaughter said their family remains united in their effort to bring the siblings home. While the judge's delay was not \"the outcome we had hoped for,\" she said in a statement, \"we remain optimistic that it represents a step forward in securing their freedom\". The brothers themselves were scheduled to make their first court appearance in years, but the remote feed from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated was hampered by technical issues. On 17 October, two dozen extended family members gathered for a news conference in Los Angeles. Jose Menendez's niece Anamaria Baralt spoke on their behalf, telling reporters: \"Both sides of the family are united, sharing a new bond of hope. \"This is about truth, justice and healing... Their continued incarceration serves no rehabilitative purpose.\" Ms Baralt said the brothers were victims of a \"culture that was not ready to listen\", as she called on the district attorney's office to \"take into account the full picture\". Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez's sister, also told reporters: \"I had no idea the extent of the abuse they suffered at the hands of my brother-in-law. None of us did. \"We know that abuse has long effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.\" Family not entirely united Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, 90, has said \"the appropriate sentence\" for the pair was life in prison without parole. His lawyer said: \"He believes that there was no molestation that occurred. He believes that the motive was pure greed, because they had just learned that they were going to be taken out of the will.\""
