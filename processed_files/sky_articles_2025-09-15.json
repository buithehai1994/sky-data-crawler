        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a \"clear position\" from Donald Trump to stop Vladimir Putin and end the war in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with Sky News' lead world presenter Yalda Hakim, the Ukrainian president said the only way for the fighting to stop was for defined security guarantees to first be put in place. And that, he said, could only come if Mr Trump was bold. He told Sky News he hopes UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer would drill into the detail of securing Ukraine's future with the president during his state visit to Britain this week. He said: \"I very much hope he (Starmer) will be able to have a very specific discussion on the security guarantees of the US for Ukraine. \"Before we end the war, I really want to have all the agreements in place. I want to… have a document that is supported by the US and all European partners. This is very important. \"To make this happen, we need a clear position of President Trump.\" 'Make Putin afraid' Mr Zelenskyy also urged the US leader to take \"strong personal steps\" to \"stop Putin\", after Mr Trump urged NATO allies to stop buying Russian oil and put tariffs on China to pressure Moscow. \"I believe that the US is strong enough to take decisions of their own,\" he said. \"I believe Donald Trump can give us air defence systems in quantity and US has enough. \"I'm sure the US can apply enough sanctions in order to hurt the Russian economy, plus Donald Trump has enough force to make Putin afraid of him. \"Europe has already introduced 18 sanctions packages against Russia. And all that's lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the US.\" Read more from Sky News:Moscow trying to send a message with military drillsRussia's war rehearsals offer NATO one thing  His comments came following criticism in his interview with Sky News - at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv - of the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. He said Mr Trump \"gave a lot to Putin\" and that \"he should have paid more\" for it. \"I believe, if it was a trilateral meeting [with Ukraine included], we would have some result,\" he added.  Putin 'testing NATO', warns Zelenskyy As news broke that British fighter jets were flying air defence missions over Poland after a Russian drone incursion, Hakim asked the Ukrainian leader what message he thought Putin was sending to Europeans. \"He's testing NATO,\" he said. \"He wants to see what NATO is ready for, what they're capable of, both diplomatically and politically, and how the local population will respond to this.\" \"Also, in my opinion, the other message they are sending is, 'don't you dare to give Ukraine additional air defence systems, because you might need them yourself.'\" Lead world news presenter Ukraine's president has a very clear message for Trump - you alone have the power to stop Putin, and the time to act is now.\n\n Meeting with me in Kyiv on the eve of the US president's state visit to Britain, Zelenskyy bristled with frustration at the failure of the Western powers to ramp up pressure on the Kremlin, even as the Russians escalated their attacks on Ukraine.\n Asked if the summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska has proven a mistake, he responded without hesitation that Putin is clearly not paying a price for his actions. Zelenskyy believes Trump is reluctant to put pressure on Putin because it might jeopardise attempts to end the war. But the Ukrainian leader argues this isn't the way to handle the Russian president. Zelenskyy also argued Trump's emphasis on getting the Europeans to ratchet up economic pressure - foremost by stopping their purchases of Russian energy and tariffing other buyers like China and India - was understandable, but that the world’s sole superpower shouldn’t wait for others to act. Trump has called on EU countries to end all Russian oil and gas purchases - and only then will he consider imposing sanctions on Russia. Mr Trump arrives in the UK today for an unprecedented second state visit, following an invitation from King Charles. He and First Lady Melania will stay at Windsor Castle and be treated to a flypast by the Red Arrows as well as UK and US F-35 military jets on the east lawn, and a special Beating Retreat military ceremony. They will also visit Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence in Buckinghamshire, though details of what they will discuss - and whether it will include the situation in Ukraine - have not been revealed."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  There has been no expense spared for the UK's biggest security operation since the King's coronation. This time the occasion is both royal and presidential. It is vast and honestly feels, well, American. The operation has been led by Thames Valley Police, but officers from across the UK will also play a part in the visit. Windsor is a sea of fluorescent yellow jackets and black and white flat caps. Officers are swarming the town and over the next couple of days will be sending drones into crowds, conducting boat patrols and deploying mounted units in and around the wider area. Authorities have planned for every eventuality but would not expand on whether the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk had led them to heighten security measures. The assassination of the US activist may have intensified consideration about potential threats, but authorities have had extensive security plans in the works for months. Operational firearms commander Sergeant Dan Hatfield explained that the police presence will be heightened - and every plan has been worked on in conjunction with the Secret Service. \"The residents of Windsor and visitors to Windsor are used to seeing a fairly high police presence, including armed police,\" Sgt Hatfield said. \"However, for this state visit, they will see an increase in those numbers. Fortunately, I've had experience working with the Americans with all the Secret Service. We have a really good working relationship and work fairly harmoniously together to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\" Whether in the air, on the ground or on the water, safety is paramount. On a visit with the Thames Valley marine unit, Sky News witnessed what their 24-hour patrol of the waterways would look like. A section of the River Thames that borders the Castle will be closed off during the visit. Sergeant Lyn Smith, head of the joint operations marine unit between the Thames Valley and Hampshire forces, said this is the biggest event she has worked on. \"The team is highly trained, we are ready for anything that will happen on or around the water,\" she said. \"The marine support unit are going to be doing high visibility patrols, some searching, some specialist searching in and around the area, and working with our partners in the Environment Agency to deliver a safe event. \"Similar to President Macron's state visit, we are still providing capability on the water, it's just on a larger scale for us.\" Read more:What we know about Trump's state visitWhat Trump's second state visit really means Notably, for the first time in any state visit or royal occasion, the section of the Long Walk leading up to the castle has been cordoned off with large white barricades erected to shield the residence from view. Airspace over the town is also restricted for the duration of the visit, enforced using police drones and helicopters. Vehicles will be standing by close to patrol officers on the ground, holding their ballistic helmets, ballistic vests and shields if an incident occurs. Thousands of protesters plan to descend on Windsor and central London during the visit to demonstrate against the president's trip. A rally in central London on Wednesday is expected to draw the largest crowd, but protesters from the Stop Trump Coalition have now confirmed plans for a Tuesday event too. A royal welcome may not be extended by all - but many will be hoping they won't drown out the pomp for the president."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Back in February in the Oval Office, it all seemed such a good idea. As world leaders lined up to pay tribute in the court of King Donald, Sir Keir Starmer played a trump card quite literally. Only a British prime minister can offer what Trump is about to enjoy this week as a result, three days of peerless pomp and ceremony in castles and stately homes hosted by royalty. For an Anglophile who craves the spotlight, the idea was irresistible. Trump beamed with delight as he received the King's letter, becoming the first elected leader ever to be invited for a second state visit. Some said the prime minister moved too quickly. This was something Trump should have had to have worked for, dangled as a reward for favourable treatment. Instead, the critics said, he got something for nothing and has abused that generosity ever since. Epstein scandal casts long shadow And, the argument goes, his haste has made that invitation a hostage to fortune. Not least because of the Epstein scandal. The King and prime minister will now play host to a president tainted by association with an infamous paedophile. Making matters worse, Britain's ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, has had to resign over the Epstein furore. There have, of course, been controversial state visits in the past. A parade of rogues have traipsed through the palace. Romania's dictator president Ceaucescu, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and even Vladimir Putin himself. But none have had such an unseemly scandal as their backdrop. There are plenty of more heavyweight issues clouding the special relationship too. Not least Ukraine. Trump is siding more and more with Moscow over how to end the war, increasingly at odds with the UK and the rest of its European allies. And Gaza. Trump's acquiescence with what many in Britain's own ruling party believe to be genocide is another festering transatlantic sore. Then there is Trump's unorthodox trade policy and tariffs, his deportations at home, his trampling of civil rights, the list goes on.  A worthwhile charm offensive? The next three days will be an exercise in papering over cracks in transatlantic relations with as much red carpet, gold brocade and pomp and circumstance as the British government can throw at it. The Starmer government will insist the charm offensive has to some extent already worked, winning Britain better trading terms with Trump's America than Europe, even if the UK still faces higher tariffs than it did before. And more than a billion dollars worth of American money is being invested in British financial firms, say ministers ahead of the visit. Read more from Sky News:What we know about Trump's visitA vanity trip or a powerful card to play? Wise old veteran diplomats say looking for reasons to object to Trump's visit is rather missing the point. Britain cannot afford not to be pragmatic. \"We can't ignore him,\" says Sir Peter Westmacott, former British ambassador to Washington. \"We have to sort of engage with him and sort of use the full sort of power of the British state and royalty to make that succeed. He's there. There's no point pretending otherwise just because you might not like some aspects of President Trump's behavior and policies.\" Forget the scandals and divisions then, hold your nose and muster all the soft power of British royal pageantry. If it helps further British interests, it will have been worth it, say diplomatic observers. Never mind the rest."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The body language experts and lip readers are braced, with Donald Trump's big moment with the Royal Family, or \"fest\" as he excitedly described it, finally here.  The royals know it's their duty to play host and put on a show, but any cynical suggestions they may be dreading it might not be quite right. We know Trump can't get enough of the Royal Family and that means we can probably expect him to be on his best behaviour. We saw it during his first state visit in 2019. His Scottish roots, the fact his mother loved the royals, meant he absolutely revered Queen Elizabeth II; those who saw them up close told me it meant he was charm personified. Now, of course, we have a new monarch in King Charles - and it appears the two men have already developed their own special relationship, which has included writing letters to each other. You might assume they'd be two men who are poles apart on political matters, and I'd bet they are on topics such as Ukraine, Canada, and the climate crisis. But I'm told during the 2019 state visit, they had a very amicable hour-long chat, or exchange of views, on climate change, which came as a bit of a surprise to many insiders considering Trump's track record on the environment. But as one diplomatic source put it to me, often the King is asked to have many meetings on behalf of the Foreign Office, some that you could consider quite tedious. At least Trump is interesting and entertaining. We can probably also expect to see more of Prince William during this state visit. Yes, partly because the government will know how popular he is in America so will want the heir to the throne involved in this significant charm offensive, but also because he has built his own relationship of sorts with the president. You might remember they met in Paris last November, as William was deployed to represent the UK at the reopening of Notre Dame. In front of the cameras, Trump declared him \"a great guy\", but what happened next seemed to surprise some in William's travelling entourage. What was meant to be a short meeting went on for 40 minutes and meant they were both late for a dinner with Emmanuel Macron. Read more from Sky News:UK and US firms announce nuclear dealsPM urged to up pressure over Trump tariffs  A notable absentee As well as William's involvement, the appearance of the Princess of Wales at the official arrival - and then spending time with First Lady Melania Trump - will go down a treat with the White House, adding considerable state visit sparkle for the American audience. But one member of the family who will be absent, who actually lives on the Windsor estate, is Prince Andrew. He was heavily involved in the last state visit because of his work as a business and trade envoy. He is no longer a working royal after being embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, something Trump would rather not be reminded of when it's been such a distraction in the press ahead of his state visit.  But despite all the controversy in the run-up, the rest of the royals will be out in force this week to welcome Trump and his family. This is about family to family relations, not just state to state, which is a powerful thing, as again the Windsors will put on the ultimate display of hospitality to make sure the president goes home happy - and that's one thing we won't need the body language experts to tell us."

        "Headline": "Donald Trump's state visit will highlight pressure on the government to pay more for medicines or risk losing pharmaceutical investments.",
        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n When it comes to the drugs industry, Britain is suffering withdrawal symptoms. This year, three of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies - Merck, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly - have pulled or paused UK investments worth almost £2bn, diagnosing that market conditions, specifically the NHS drugs pricing regime, make the UK a \"contagion risk\". The issue will be highlighted this week as Donald Trump begins his state visit, with executives called to give evidence to a parliamentary select committee on Tuesday, along with science minister Lord Vallance, a veteran of the pandemic, when government worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to speed up vaccine development. How has this come about? The UK pharmaceutical industry is one of those caught in the crossfire of Trump's trade war. In the trade deal agreed by the president and Sir Keir Starmer in May, the prime minister committed to \"improve the overall environment for pharmaceutical companies in the United Kingdom\".  Four months later, those companies - under pressure from Trump to charge US consumers the same as those in Europe, and to invest in US production and research - say the opposite is the case. They argue the British market is becoming unviable to pharmaceutical investors, at a cost to patients, jobs, and the economy. Data from the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries bear this out; R&D investment growth has fallen below the global average and foreign inward investment has declined almost 60% since 2020. Why the corporate backlash? To understand why an industry long regarded as a domestic strength has turned against the UK, it is necessary to understand the complexities of medicines pricing. The NHS is one of the largest \"single buyers\" of medicines in the world, a position that has long given it clout when it comes to negotiating prices. In the last two decades, however, strict conditions on what drugs are approved for use, and at what price, have brought down the price of the medicines but eroded the value of the UK to the companies that provide them. Simply put, the industry believes the NHS has been getting too good a deal for too long and argues the terms are no longer sustainable. In the last decade, the proportion of the NHS budget spent on medicines has fallen to just 9%, below the EU average of 13%. Meanwhile, the amount of revenue returned by companies to the government under complex \"clawback\" arrangements has jumped to more than 23%, more than three times the EU average. Under these complex rules, a form of price control that offers a uniform discount to the health service, manufacturers return revenue equal to the value of any overspend by the NHS on its total medicines budget. The figure has risen rapidly in the UK in the last five years as the NHS has exceeded its medicines budget faster than it has risen. This year it was supposed to be 15%, already double the EU average, but has already risen to 23.5%.  Can this all be resolved? The industry is demanding a commitment to return to single figures by the end of this parliament. Emergency talks with the health department broke up in the summer, and it is unclear when they will resume. It also wants the threshold at which new drugs are admitted to the NHS marketplace, currently £20,000-£30,000 and unchanged since 1999, increased. Had it risen in line with inflation, it would be £40,000-£60,000 today. As a consequence of these downward pressures on price, the industry says the number of new and innovative medicines offered to patients has fallen, with only 37% of available drugs accessed by the NHS, compared to 90% in Germany. Why so much is in the gift of the chancellor Paying higher prices to hugely profitable pharmaceutical giants was not part of Labour's electoral promises for the NHS, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he is committed to getting the best deal for patients, but the UK discount may no longer be sustainable. The issue also highlights a tension between the government's desire for economic growth and greater efficiency in its key public service. As one executive put it, as the UK accounts for only 2.5% of the global medicines market, which meant for a long time the lower margins doing business in Britain could be swallowed. With Trump demanding price parity for the US, which accounts for 40%, that is no longer the case. Read more from Sky News:UK and US firms announce nuclear dealsPM urged to up pressure over Trump tariffs  Life sciences are at the heart of the government's new industrial strategy and the UK still has much to commend it, with world-leading research and skills and a track record of spinning biotech innovation into the private sector. But the withdrawal of big pharma investment tells a different story. Johan Kahlstrom, country president of Novartis UK and Ireland, said: \"The UK is fast becoming uninvestable for life sciences companies. \"High clawback taxes that take almost a quarter of revenues, combined with outdated cost-effectiveness thresholds that haven't changed in over 25 years, are eroding the UK's position as a global life sciences hub.\"  Resolving the pricing row will require compromise and money, with the health secretary's room for manoeuvre ultimately resting on the Treasury, and the balance between losing jobs and investment from a growth industry, and a drugs budget the NHS has long taken for granted."

The Memphis Safe Task Force will be a \"replica of our extraordinarily successful efforts\" in Washington DC, the US president said on Monday, as he continues to use military force to battle urban crime. Officials from various federal agencies - including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the US Marshall's service - will also go to Memphis, as Mr Trump said: \"We're sending in the big force now.\" He said there was \"virtually no crime in DC right now\", after National Guard troops were deployed to the nation's capital last month and the city's police force was brought under federal control. Mr Trump, who arrives in the UK for his second state visit this week, signed a memo setting up the Memphis operation in the White House. He was joined in the Oval Office by Tennessee's Republican governor, Bill Lee, who - the president said - had asked him to intervene there.

Shortly before Mr Trump's announcement, the White House said on social media that Memphis' total crime rate was higher than the national average and suggested it had increased since last year, unlike national rates. But the city's police force recently reported decreases across every major crime category in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in previous years. Overall crime hit a 25-year low, while murder hit a six-year low, police said. Persistent gun violence has plagued Memphis for years, with a record total of more than 390 murders in 2023.

The Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill faces its final vote at the Scottish parliament, with a lengthy session of more than 160 amendments to be debated ahead of a decision. If passed, the new legislation will make a series of changes to the justice system, including scrapping the not proven verdict; establishing a specialist sexual offences court; creating a victims and witnesses commissioner; reforming the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction; and requiring the parole board to take into account if a killer continues to refuse to reveal where they hid their victim's body - a proposal named Suzanne's Law. An earlier plan to pilot juryless trials in rape cases was dropped by the Scottish government last year due to a lack of cross-party support. Ahead of the Stage 3 vote, Justice Secretary Angela Constance said: \"This landmark bill, if passed by parliament, will transform the experiences of victims and witnesses within Scotland's justice system. \"Victims will be heard, supported, protected and treated with compassion, while the rights of the accused will continue to be safeguarded.\" Ms Constance said abolishing the not proven verdict will ensure a \"clearer, fairer and more transparent decision-making process\". She added: \"There will also be wholesale reform to the management of sexual offence cases as we know these victims in particular, who are mostly women and girls, can be retraumatised by the current system. \"This legislation was shaped by the voices of victims, survivors, and their families who have campaigned long and hard for further change. \"Parliament must stand with them and help ensure the justice system doesn't just respond to crime but helps those who have been harmed to rebuild their lives.\" Opposition parties have lodged a series of amendments in a bid to bolster the bill, including allowing victims to be given the right to make a statement in court; ensuring victims are told if a decision is taken not to prosecute an accused; and informing all victims when a plea deal is struck between the defence and prosecution lawyers. The Scottish Conservatives want to see a Scotland-only grooming gangs inquiry and are additionally calling for Suzanne's Law to be strengthened, which would compel killers to reveal the location of their victim's bodies or face having their parole rejected. Read more from Sky News:Why next year's Scottish elections could get messy The proposal is named after Suzanne Pilley, 38, who was murdered by David Gilroy in 2010 but whose body has never been found. Under current legislation, parole board rules dictate that a killer's refusal to disclose the information \"may\" be taken into account. Scottish ministers have accepted a proposed amendment that states parole boards \"must\" take into account the refusal to cooperate, but the Scottish Tories and campaigners are calling for it to go further and instead ensure \"no body, no release\". 👉 Tap here to follow Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts 👈 Scottish Tory MSP Liam Kerr, shadow justice secretary, said: \"Parliament has the chance to reboot Scotland's justice system so that it finally gives crime victims the rights they need and deserve. \"But the SNP bill, as it currently stands, fails to deliver that, so we can't vote for it. At the moment, it's a victims' bill in name only - a wasted opportunity. \"The Scottish Conservatives have submitted several common sense amendments to strengthen this bill and deliver the real change that victims' groups demand. \"I'm pleased that the SNP have backed our calls to scrap the not proven verdict and have heeded our opposition to their juryless trials plan - but now they must go further. \"I urge the nationalists to accept our amendments, instead of selling victims short.\""

A search for Marten and Gordon was launched after a placenta was found in the couple's burnt-out car on a motorway in Bolton in January 2023. Marten said they went on the run so their fifth child would not be removed from them after her other children were \"stolen by the state\".

The Metropolitan Police said there were \"several incidents across central London\", the majority of which were linked to the march \"in and around Whitehall\". It added that officers made \"24 arrests on the day and have since carried out enquiries into other offences\". The force wants to speak to the 11 others in relation to public order offences and offences on emergency services. \"Officers have trawled through hundreds of hours of CCTV footage,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Natalie Norris from the Met's public order crime team. Because marchers may have travelled from outside London, she said she was asking people \"across the country\" to look at a number of pictures that have been released and to get in touch if they recognise anyone. In addition to the eight people who were charged - over offences including assaulting an emergency worker and common assault on a police officer - one received a caution, while a further 11 were bailed under investigation to return at a later date. Three of those arrested were women, while the rest were men. The Met said 26 officers were assaulted with kicks and punches. It added: \"Bottles, flares and other projectiles were also thrown and concerted attempts were made to get past barriers.\" Protesters heard a number of speeches, including from far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who called it the \"biggest freedom of speech\" event in British history. Police estimated that between 110,000 and 150,000 people had attended. An anti-racism counter-protest, attended by about 5,000 campaigners, also took place, with the two groups clashing on Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, separated by lines of police."

        "Content": "Royal Air Force jets will fly air defence missions over Poland as part of a NATO mission, the government has announced. The move comes after Russian drones last week entered Polish airspace in Vladimir Putin's most significant violation of NATO airspace yet. The Typhoons - from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire - will join allied forces from Denmark, France and Germany to reinforce NATO's defence along its eastern side, the Ministry of Defence said. They will be supported by a Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft from RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Russia's reckless behaviour is a direct threat to European security and a violation of international law, which is why the UK will support NATO's efforts to bolster its eastern flank through Eastern Sentry. \"These aircraft are not just a show of strength, they are vital in deterring aggression, securing NATO airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies. \"We will continue to stand firm in our support for Ukraine and ramp up the pressure on Putin until there is a just and lasting peace.\" Russia's incursion into Polish airspace was followed by a violation of Romanian skies just days later. The Kremlin has said its drones went into Poland because they were jammed, but European leaders believe the breaches were a deliberate provocation. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the incident brought his country \"the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two\".  Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"The message to Moscow is clear. Putin tested NATO, NATO responded with unity, and the UK will play our full part. \"When we are threatened, we respond together.\" The Foreign Office has also summoned the Russian ambassador in London, Andrei Kelin, over what it called the \"utterly unacceptable\" violations. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced the Eastern Sentry operation on Friday, and said it would involve the deployment of equipment on the border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine to deter potential Russian aggression. It underlines long-held concerns about the potential expansion of Russia's three-year war in Ukraine.

Among the planned rites due to be undertaken by Bishop James Curry, auxiliary bishop of Westminster and titular bishop of Ramsbury, are a Vigil for the Deceased, a Rite of Reception - which usually involves the coffin being sprinkled with holy water - and evening prayers known as Vespers. The coffin was taken in the royal hearse to the place of worship, the largest Roman Catholic church in England and Wales. It was carried inside by members of the Royal Dragoon Guards, whose regiment the duchess served as deputy colonel-in-chief since its inception in 1992. The coffin was draped with the royal standard, which had a white ermine border signifying she was the spouse of a prince, and there was a large floral display on top of the standard. Members of her immediate family, including her widower, the Duke of Kent and their daughter Lady Helen Taylor, watched from the cathedral steps as the soldiers slowly carried the coffin.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Hillsborough campaigners have hailed a \"momentous\" day as a bill to force public officials to tell the truth is finally introduced into parliament. The Public Office (Accountability) Bill, known more commonly as \"Hillsborough Law\", will be tabled on Tuesday, after a nearly decade-long fight to get it on the statute book. Politics Live: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson Crucially, the legislation contains a new professional and legal Duty of Candour - meaning public officials must act with honesty and integrity at all times, or face criminal sanctions. Concerns that this element would be watered down delayed the bill being introduced by the 36th anniversary of the tragedy in April - a deadline Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer set at the Labour conference in Liverpool last year. Downing Street said more time was needed to redraft the legislation so it had the support of bereaved family members and survivors, who warned against a \"toothless replacement\". Margaret Aspinall, whose son James was 18 when he died in the Hillsborough disaster, acknowledged the \"long journey to get here\" but said Sir Keir's promise was \"well worth waiting for\". \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Flagship Scottish government justice reform bill which will scrap not proven verdict to go before MSPs today\n                 She added: \"This campaign wasn't about just us, it is about the ordinary people of this country, hopefully this law will mean no one will ever have to suffer like we did.\" On 15 April 1989, 97 Liverpool FC fans were killed in a crush during the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium. It took a 27-year campaign by victims' families for an inquest jury to rule that the fans were not to blame for the disaster and those who died were unlawfully killed. In 2016, the first version of Hillsborough Law was drafted, which Sir Keir promised to implement in full while in opposition - a commitment that was included in Labour's 2024 manifesto. 'Seismic changes'  The government said Hillsborough Law will \"end the culture of cover-ups\" and learn lessons from other disasters, including the Grenfell Tower fire, the Post Office Horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal. It said the bill will include \"seismic\" changes, including a new offence of misleading the public, with criminal sanctions \"for the most serious breaches\". It will also provide families bereaved by the state with publicly funded legal representation at inquests, which the Ministry of Justice called the \"largest expansion of legal aid in a decade\", ending \"David and Goliath-style show downs\". The bill will now be debated and voted on by MPs and Peers before it becomes law, as is the case with any major piece of legislation. The Hillsborough Now Campaign hailed the \"landmark\" law but said it will only achieve its aims if it is passed in full.  'Don't weaken the bill now' \"The government will need to be brave and ignore the vested interests that will attempt to water it down as it progresses through parliament,\" a spokesperson for the group said. Elkan Abrahamson, one of the architects of the original bill, said he will scrutinise the legislation as it is debated in parliament \"so we're not quite there yet\". But added said that \"today is still a momentous step, owed entirely to the persistence of campaigners and their refusal to give up\". \"The Hillsborough Law will transform the face of British justice,\" he said. Ahead of the bill's announcement, campaigners met Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy at the memorial site in Anfield on Monday, as well as metro mayors Steve Rotherham and Andy Burnham, who have long backed the legislation. Some families and campaigners are expected to attend Downing Street on Tuesday to mark the bill's introduction. It comes ahead of the Labour Party Conference next week, which is once again being held in Liverpool. Paying tribute to the \"strength and courage\" of Ms Aspinall and other campaigners, Sir Keir said the bill will \"change the balance of power in Britain\" and ensure that the state \"can never hide from the people it is supposed to serve\". He added: \"Make no mistake - this a law for the 97, but it is also a law for the sub-postmasters who suffered because of the Horizon scandal, the victims of infected blood, and those who died in the terrible Grenfell Tower fire. This is change only this government can deliver.\""

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer will be \"completely exonerated\" over the scandal around Peter Mandelson's relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Gordon Brown has told Sky News. The prime minister was forced to sack Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US last Thursday after details of the peer's relationship with Epstein emerged in the media. Emails between Lord Mandelson, a minister under Tony Blair and Mr Brown, and the convicted sex offender revealed that the ex-minister sent messages of support to Epstein even as the US financier faced jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Politics latest: PM speaks for first time since Mandelson sacking Sir Keir said on Monday that he would have \"never appointed\" Lord Mandelson as US ambassador if he knew then what he knows now. But Mr Brown told Sky News' Darren McCaffrey that he believes the prime minister will be \"completely exonerated\" once \"the record is out\" on the matter. The former prime minister said: \"I don't want to criticise Sir Keir Starmer's judgement, because he faces very difficult decisions and we're talking about a very narrow area for timing between a Tuesday and Thursday. \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Campaigners hail 'momentous' step as long-awaited Hillsborough Law introduced \n                 \"I think once the record is out, Sir Keir Starmer will be completely exonerated.\" However, Mr Brown did admit that the situation \"calls somewhat into his judgement\". He said: \"I think every government goes through difficulties. Probably 15 years ago, when I was in government, you'd be asking me questions about what had happened on a particular day. \"But this is not really in the end about personalities. In the end, it's about the policies. \"If you ask people in the street, they might say, well, interesting story, terrible thing that happened to these girls, but also they will say, look what's happening to my life at the moment, what's happening to my community, what's happening to my industry, what's happening to the whole region.  \"I think we've got to think that politics is about changing people's lives and making a difference in those areas where they want to do things.\" Sir Keir has insisted that Lord Mandelson went through a proper due diligence process before his appointment. However, speaking publicly for the first time since he sacked Lord Mandelson on Thursday night, he said: \"Had I known then what I know now, I'd have never appointed him.\" Sir Keir said he knew before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday afternoon that Lord Mandelson had not yet answered questions from government officials, but was unaware of the contents of the messages that led to his sacking. He said Lord Mandelson did not provide answers until \"very late\" on Wednesday, which was when he decided he had to be \"removed\"."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Back in February in the Oval Office, it all seemed such a good idea. As world leaders lined up to pay tribute in the court of King Donald, Sir Keir Starmer played a trump card quite literally. Only a British prime minister can offer what Trump is about to enjoy this week as a result, three days of peerless pomp and ceremony in castles and stately homes hosted by royalty. For an Anglophile who craves the spotlight, the idea was irresistible. Trump beamed with delight as he received the King's letter, becoming the first elected leader ever to be invited for a second state visit. Some said the prime minister moved too quickly. This was something Trump should have had to have worked for, dangled as a reward for favourable treatment. Instead, the critics said, he got something for nothing and has abused that generosity ever since. Epstein scandal casts long shadow And, the argument goes, his haste has made that invitation a hostage to fortune. Not least because of the Epstein scandal. The King and prime minister will now play host to a president tainted by association with an infamous paedophile. Making matters worse, Britain's ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, has had to resign over the Epstein furore. There have, of course, been controversial state visits in the past. A parade of rogues have traipsed through the palace. Romania's dictator president Ceaucescu, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and even Vladimir Putin himself. But none have had such an unseemly scandal as their backdrop. There are plenty of more heavyweight issues clouding the special relationship too. Not least Ukraine. Trump is siding more and more with Moscow over how to end the war, increasingly at odds with the UK and the rest of its European allies. And Gaza. Trump's acquiescence with what many in Britain's own ruling party believe to be genocide is another festering transatlantic sore. Then there is Trump's unorthodox trade policy and tariffs, his deportations at home, his trampling of civil rights, the list goes on.  A worthwhile charm offensive? The next three days will be an exercise in papering over cracks in transatlantic relations with as much red carpet, gold brocade and pomp and circumstance as the British government can throw at it. The Starmer government will insist the charm offensive has to some extent already worked, winning Britain better trading terms with Trump's America than Europe, even if the UK still faces higher tariffs than it did before. And more than a billion dollars worth of American money is being invested in British financial firms, say ministers ahead of the visit. Read more from Sky News:What we know about Trump's visitA vanity trip or a powerful card to play? Wise old veteran diplomats say looking for reasons to object to Trump's visit is rather missing the point. Britain cannot afford not to be pragmatic. \"We can't ignore him,\" says Sir Peter Westmacott, former British ambassador to Washington. \"We have to sort of engage with him and sort of use the full sort of power of the British state and royalty to make that succeed. He's there. There's no point pretending otherwise just because you might not like some aspects of President Trump's behavior and policies.\" Forget the scandals and divisions then, hold your nose and muster all the soft power of British royal pageantry. If it helps further British interests, it will have been worth it, say diplomatic observers. Never mind the rest."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The body language experts and lip readers are braced, with Donald Trump's big moment with the Royal Family, or \"fest\" as he excitedly described it, finally here.  The royals know it's their duty to play host and put on a show, but any cynical suggestions they may be dreading it might not be quite right. We know Trump can't get enough of the Royal Family and that means we can probably expect him to be on his best behaviour. We saw it during his first state visit in 2019. His Scottish roots, the fact his mother loved the royals, meant he absolutely revered Queen Elizabeth II; those who saw them up close told me it meant he was charm personified. Now, of course, we have a new monarch in King Charles - and it appears the two men have already developed their own special relationship, which has included writing letters to each other. You might assume they'd be two men who are poles apart on political matters, and I'd bet they are on topics such as Ukraine, Canada, and the climate crisis. But I'm told during the 2019 state visit, they had a very amicable hour-long chat, or exchange of views, on climate change, which came as a bit of a surprise to many insiders considering Trump's track record on the environment. But as one diplomatic source put it to me, often the King is asked to have many meetings on behalf of the Foreign Office, some that you could consider quite tedious. At least Trump is interesting and entertaining. We can probably also expect to see more of Prince William during this state visit. Yes, partly because the government will know how popular he is in America so will want the heir to the throne involved in this significant charm offensive, but also because he has built his own relationship of sorts with the president. You might remember they met in Paris last November, as William was deployed to represent the UK at the reopening of Notre Dame. In front of the cameras, Trump declared him \"a great guy\", but what happened next seemed to surprise some in William's travelling entourage. What was meant to be a short meeting went on for 40 minutes and meant they were both late for a dinner with Emmanuel Macron. Read more from Sky News:UK and US firms announce nuclear dealsPM urged to up pressure over Trump tariffs  A notable absentee As well as William's involvement, the appearance of the Princess of Wales at the official arrival - and then spending time with First Lady Melania Trump - will go down a treat with the White House, adding considerable state visit sparkle for the American audience. But one member of the family who will be absent, who actually lives on the Windsor estate, is Prince Andrew. He was heavily involved in the last state visit because of his work as a business and trade envoy. He is no longer a working royal after being embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, something Trump would rather not be reminded of when it's been such a distraction in the press ahead of his state visit.  But despite all the controversy in the run-up, the rest of the royals will be out in force this week to welcome Trump and his family. This is about family to family relations, not just state to state, which is a powerful thing, as again the Windsors will put on the ultimate display of hospitality to make sure the president goes home happy - and that's one thing we won't need the body language experts to tell us."

        "Content": " Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a \"clear position\" from Donald Trump to stop Vladimir Putin and end the war in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with Sky News' lead world presenter Yalda Hakim, the Ukrainian president said the only way for the fighting to stop was for defined security guarantees to first be put in place. And that, he said, could only come if Mr Trump was bold. He told Sky News he hopes UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer would drill into the detail of securing Ukraine's future with the president during his state visit to Britain this week. He said: \"I very much hope he (Starmer) will be able to have a very specific discussion on the security guarantees of the US for Ukraine. \"Before we end the war, I really want to have all the agreements in place. I want to… have a document that is supported by the US and all European partners. This is very important. \"To make this happen, we need a clear position of President Trump.\" 'Make Putin afraid' Mr Zelenskyy also urged the US leader to take \"strong personal steps\" to \"stop Putin\", after Mr Trump urged NATO allies to stop buying Russian oil and put tariffs on China to pressure Moscow. \"I believe that the US is strong enough to take decisions of their own,\" he said. \"I believe Donald Trump can give us air defence systems in quantity and US has enough. \"I'm sure the US can apply enough sanctions in order to hurt the Russian economy, plus Donald Trump has enough force to make Putin afraid of him. \"Europe has already introduced 18 sanctions packages against Russia. And all that's lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the US.\" Read more from Sky News:Moscow trying to send a message with military drillsRussia's war rehearsals offer NATO one thing  His comments came following criticism in his interview with Sky News - at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv - of the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. He said Mr Trump \"gave a lot to Putin\" and that \"he should have paid more\" for it. \"I believe, if it was a trilateral meeting [with Ukraine included], we would have some result,\" he added.  Putin 'testing NATO', warns Zelenskyy As news broke that British fighter jets were flying air defence missions over Poland after a Russian drone incursion, Hakim asked the Ukrainian leader what message he thought Putin was sending to Europeans. \"He's testing NATO,\" he said. \"He wants to see what NATO is ready for, what they're capable of, both diplomatically and politically, and how the local population will respond to this.\" \"Also, in my opinion, the other message they are sending is, 'don't you dare to give Ukraine additional air defence systems, because you might need them yourself.'\" Lead world news presenter Ukraine's president has a very clear message for Trump - you alone have the power to stop Putin, and the time to act is now.\n\n Meeting with me in Kyiv on the eve of the US president's state visit to Britain, Zelenskyy bristled with frustration at the failure of the Western powers to ramp up pressure on the Kremlin, even as the Russians escalated their attacks on Ukraine.\n Asked if the summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska has proven a mistake, he responded without hesitation that Putin is clearly not paying a price for his actions. Zelenskyy believes Trump is reluctant to put pressure on Putin because it might jeopardise attempts to end the war. But the Ukrainian leader argues this isn't the way to handle the Russian president. Zelenskyy also argued Trump's emphasis on getting the Europeans to ratchet up economic pressure - foremost by stopping their purchases of Russian energy and tariffing other buyers like China and India - was understandable, but that the world’s sole superpower shouldn’t wait for others to act. Trump has called on EU countries to end all Russian oil and gas purchases - and only then will he consider imposing sanctions on Russia. Mr Trump arrives in the UK today for an unprecedented second state visit, following an invitation from King Charles. He and First Lady Melania will stay at Windsor Castle and be treated to a flypast by the Red Arrows as well as UK and US F-35 military jets on the east lawn, and a special Beating Retreat military ceremony. They will also visit Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence in Buckinghamshire, though details of what they will discuss - and whether it will include the situation in Ukraine - have not been revealed."

        "Content": "\n          Moscow correspondent\n              @IvorBennett\n At times, the sound of these military drills was deafening. There were fighter jets screaming overhead, air strikes on \"enemy\" forces, and tracer rounds from artillery units pounding out of the barrels. Fireballs and mushroom clouds would periodically appear far off on the landscape, followed by a sudden explosive thud several seconds later. I was watching from the safety of a viewing platform, along with other members of the international media. But even at that distance, the various blasts were still powerful enough to reverberate through me. This was the fourth day of 'Zapad-2025' - the joint military drills Russia holds with Belarus roughly every four years. It took place at a training ground near the city of Borisov in Belarus, 150km from the Lithuanian border. Moscow and Minsk insist the exercises are \"defensive\". In this case, they said they were gaming out how they would respond to an attack by a NATO member. But as I watched, I couldn't help feeling that the training aspect was only one part of it. The other part felt like theatre - a show of strength designed to intimidate those watching across the border on Europe's eastern flank. The drills were smaller than previous years, most likely because Russia still needs its troops and equipment at the front in Ukraine. But it still felt like Moscow was trying to send a message here - that despite the costs and casualties incurred fighting Kyiv, it's still a force to be reckoned with. For Belarus's neighbours, these are anxious times. The last Zapad drills in 2021 were used as a springboard for Russia's invasion of Ukraine a few months later. And so this time, Poland has closed its border, and like Lithuania, it's holding military drills of its own. Afterwards, I tried to catch up with some of the defence dignitaries from foreign militaries, who had been invited to observe the drills. I wanted to see what they made of the show. \"A very good demonstration,\" a senior officer from Pakistan told me, declining to give his name. \"It gives us an insight of how war is being fought, with new technologies, in this part of the world.\" But what about Poland's concerns? \"Are they right to be nervous?\" I asked. \"Would you be nervous if you were next door?\" \"Why would I be nervous?\" he replied. \"Being Pakistani, I know what I'm capable of. So I shouldn't be nervous by somebody else doing exercises.\" \"So NATO has no need to worry?\" I continued. \"No, I don't think so. NATO shouldn't be worried.\" There were actually some representatives from NATO members among the observers. Delegations from Hungary and Turkey are no surprise - both countries have good relations with Moscow - but a team from the United States did raise eyebrows.

Unfortunately, none of those officials would answer my questions. Wary, perhaps, of sticking their head above the parapet, as the alliance seeks to present a united front."

        "Content": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders abroad. \"The principle that terrorists should not have immunity wherever they are, wherever they may be, was not established by me,\" he claimed. Mr Netanyahu was speaking during a news conference with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was visiting Jerusalem, a meeting which coincided with an emergency summit in Qatar of Arab and Islamic states convened in response to Israel's attack last week on Hamas leaders in the Gulf state. The strike killed six people - five members of Hamas and a local Qatari security force member. Israel-Hamas latest: Emergency Arab summit to condemn 'brutal' Israeli attack Mr Rubio also said Hamas must be eliminated and all hostages released for there to be peace in Gaza. \"As much as we may wish that there be a peaceful, diplomatic way to end it, and we'll continue to explore and be dedicated to it, we also have to be prepared for the possibility that's not going to happen,\" he said, calling Hamas \"savage terrorists\". \"Hamas needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten the peace and security of the region.\"  When asked how the US will handle Israel's attack in Doha, Mr Rubio did not answer directly, but said the US was focused on what happens next and it will continue to encourage Qatar to play a role in the talks. Donald Trump had said he wasn't \"thrilled\" after Israel's strike, but Mr Netanyahu told Mr Rubio: \"Your presence here in Israel today is a clear message that America stands with Israel. You stand with us in the face of terror.\" The meeting happened as Israel continued attacks on Gaza City, which it aims to take over and claims is Hamas' last stronghold. Read more from Sky News:Prime Madeleine McCann suspect refuses UK police interviewNew details emerge about suspect in Charlie Kirk killing Sky correspondent This is a solidarity visit by America at a time Israel is growing increasingly isolated on the world stage.  It's also damage control by America’s top diplomat. An attempt to calm tensions in the Middle East and rein in Benjamin Netanyahu after Israel attacked a Hamas residence in Qatar. Publicly it was a display of unity by Marco Rubio answering questions from journalists alongside Israel’s prime minister. But the words and messaging were carefully choreographed. Mr Netanyahu was at pains to emphasise that the decision to bomb Qatar was Israel's alone, but he also doubled down on this, refusing to rule out further strikes: \"We sent a message to the terrorists - you can run but you can't hide.\" Marco Rubio was keen to sweep over the diplomatic disaster in Doha. \"We are focused on what happens now. What happens next. What role Qatar can play.\" America's secretary of state has a heck of a job this week trying to repair relationships and get diplomacy back on track. For now, ceasefire talks are completely off. Trust totally eroded. How do you negotiate with individuals you’ve attempted to kill? The goodwill of Qatar, which has been hosting the talks and playing the critical role of mediator, has also been seriously tested. It's undermined American alliances too. Astonishingly, the US didn’t appear to know this attack was going to happen and didn't, or couldn't, stop it. The concern among other Gulf states is if Israel can bomb Qatar, a key American ally and home to the biggest US airbase in the Middle East, then is anywhere in the region safe? Mr Rubio will head to Doha tomorrow where an emergency summit of Arab leaders is currently taking place in response to Israel’s actions. A draft resolution suggests leaders are set to warn Israel that the normalisation of relations between Israel and Arab neighbours is under threat. Today is the fifth anniversary of the Abraham Accords, the peace deals carved out by Donald Trump during his first term in office, formalising diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab nations, including the UAE. Mr Trump has called them one of his proudest achievements but it seems Israel’s attack in Doha has put them on life support. Any hope of a breakthrough on the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has been destroyed this week. Just when you think the situation in Gaza can't get any worse, somehow things take another dire turn. At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes on two homes and on a tent housing a displaced family, local health authorities said. The army also destroyed a 16-floor building in the west of the city, believed to be the tallest in the Gaza Strip, around an hour after warning displaced families sheltering inside and nearby to leave, saying the building was being used to hide \"terrorist infrastructure\". Three more Palestinians died of malnutrition in the last 24 hours, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry said, taking the number of deaths from such causes to at least 425, including 145 children, since the war began. The war started when Hamas and other militant groups stormed into Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. More than 64,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's nearly two-year-long campaign, according to the enclave's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count."

        "Content": "Scientists have found what could be the world's oldest known mummies in southeast Asia, with some of the preserved remains believed to date back 12,000 years. Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam. Other remains were found in the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists revealed the bodies were likely exposed to heat and suggested they had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified. Study author Hirofumi Matsumura, with Sapporo Medical University in Japan, said the practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory\". While mummification can happen naturally in places where conditions can stop decomposition, various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honour them or send their souls to the afterlife. Egyptian mummies are the most well-known, but some of the oldest known mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what is now Peru and Chile. \n                  Prosecutors drop charges against two men accused of spying for China\n                 \n                  Donald Trump urges NATO countries to stop 'shocking' Russian oil purchases to end Ukraine war\n                 \n                  China warns UK and US after USS Higgins and HMS Richmond sail through Taiwan Strait\n                 In modern times, indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea also smoke-dry and mummify their dead.

He told Elise Ann Allen: \"It's very public, people know the phone conversations or meetings I've had with the heads of state of a number of different governments, countries around the world, in a time when the voice of the church has a significant role to play. \"I am learning a lot about how the Holy See has had a role in the diplomatic world for many years.\" \"In theory, the United Nations should be the place where many of these issues are dealt with. Unfortunately, it seems to be generally recognised that the United Nations, at least at this moment in time, has lost its ability to bring people together on multilateral issues.\" As the first US-born pope, he also admitted to a very American problem - family differences over baseball. \"People know I'm a (Chicago) White Sox fan, but as pope, I'm a fan of all the teams. \n                  'There is no more time': Madonna urges the Pope to go to Gaza\n                 \n                  Israel says it 'deeply regrets' deaths at Gaza's only Catholic church\n                 \n                  Pope Leo's hug with brother shows how his life has changed forever\n                 \"Even at home, I grew up a White Sox fan, but my mother was a Cubs fan (the city's second team), so you couldn't be one of those fans that shut out the other side. \"We learned, even in sports, to have an open, dialogical, friendly and not angry competitive stance on things like that, because we might not have gotten dinner had we been!\" The Pope celebrated his 70th birthday by thanking God, his parents and all those who prayed for him. He saw giant \"happy birthday\" banners, in English, Italian and Spanish, balloons and congratulatory signs held up by the faithful gathered in St Peter's Square for his traditional noon blessing on Sunday. Groups of Peruvians, including dancers in traditional attire, were also out in force, a testament to the two decades the Pope spent in Peru as a missionary and a bishop.  In the interview, conducted by Allen for her forthcoming biography of Leo, the pope also lamented widening income gaps between the working class and CEOs, recalling the recent news that Elon Musk could be in line to become the world's first trillionaire. 'We're in big trouble' \"One which I think is very significant is the continuously wider gap between the income levels of the working class and the money that the wealthiest receive. \"For example, CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving, the last figure I saw, it's 600 times more than what average workers are receiving. \"Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we're in big trouble,\" he said. But on an upbeat note, he said he believed that in spite of fears the world was becoming more polarised he had faith in people. \"We live in times when polarisation seems to be one of the words of the day, but it's not helping anybody. Or if it's helping anyone, it's very few, when everyone else is suffering. So to continue to raise those questions, I think, is important. \"We have to continue to remind ourselves of the potential that humanity has to overcome the violence and the hatred that is just dividing us more and more.\""

He would have needed to be nominated either by 20 members of the Irish parliament or four local authorities. McGregor said he had been \"sincere and genuine\" about his intentions to contest the election and had been \"truly humbled\" by the \"support and encouragement\" he received. He went on to claim the election eligibility rules in Ireland's \"outdated constitution\" were a \"straitjacket\" that prevented a \"true democratic presidential election being contested\". He claimed the constitution ensured the election was \"fixed to ensure only Establishment approved candidates may be selected on the ballot\". \"This democratic deficit against the will of the Irish people has now been successfully magnified by my expression of interest,\" he added. \"This is not the end, but the beginning of my political journey,\" he wrote. \"I am driven by a commitment to improve lives, defend rights, and serve the Irish people with dedication and integrity. I will continue to serve my people on the global stage lobbying for Ireland's best interest's socially and economically - of that there is no doubt. \"This is a marathon.

It was alleged they obtained, recorded and published information \"for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state\" and which could be \"directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy\".

The Memphis Safe Task Force will be a \"replica of our extraordinarily successful efforts\" in Washington DC, the US president said on Monday, as he continues to use military force to battle urban crime. Officials from various federal agencies - including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the US Marshall's service - will also go to Memphis, as Mr Trump said: \"We're sending in the big force now.\" He said there was \"virtually no crime in DC right now\", after National Guard troops were deployed to the nation's capital last month and the city's police force was brought under federal control. Mr Trump, who arrives in the UK for his second state visit this week, signed a memo setting up the Memphis operation in the White House.

But the city's police force recently reported decreases across every major crime category in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in previous years.

In an exclusive interview with Sky News' lead world presenter Yalda Hakim, the Ukrainian president said the only way for the fighting to stop was for defined security guarantees to first be put in place. And that, he said, could only come if Mr Trump was bold. He told Sky News he hopes UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer would drill into the detail of securing Ukraine's future with the president during his state visit to Britain this week. He said: \"I very much hope he (Starmer) will be able to have a very specific discussion on the security guarantees of the US for Ukraine. \"Before we end the war, I really want to have all the agreements in place. I want to… have a document that is supported by the US and all European partners. This is very important. \"To make this happen, we need a clear position of President Trump.\" 'Make Putin afraid' Mr Zelenskyy also urged the US leader to take \"strong personal steps\" to \"stop Putin\", after Mr Trump urged NATO allies to stop buying Russian oil and put tariffs on China to pressure Moscow. \"I believe that the US is strong enough to take decisions of their own,\" he said. \"I believe Donald Trump can give us air defence systems in quantity and US has enough. \"I'm sure the US can apply enough sanctions in order to hurt the Russian economy, plus Donald Trump has enough force to make Putin afraid of him. \"Europe has already introduced 18 sanctions packages against Russia. And all that's lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the US.\" Read more from Sky News:Moscow trying to send a message with military drillsRussia's war rehearsals offer NATO one thing  His comments came following criticism in his interview with Sky News - at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv - of the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. He said Mr Trump \"gave a lot to Putin\" and that \"he should have paid more\" for it. \"I believe, if it was a trilateral meeting [with Ukraine included], we would have some result,\" he added.  Putin 'testing NATO', warns Zelenskyy As news broke that British fighter jets were flying air defence missions over Poland after a Russian drone incursion, Hakim asked the Ukrainian leader what message he thought Putin was sending to Europeans. \"He's testing NATO,\" he said. \"He wants to see what NATO is ready for, what they're capable of, both diplomatically and politically, and how the local population will respond to this.\" \"Also, in my opinion, the other message they are sending is, 'don't you dare to give Ukraine additional air defence systems, because you might need them yourself.'\" Lead world news presenter Ukraine's president has a very clear message for Trump - you alone have the power to stop Putin, and the time to act is now.\n\n Meeting with me in Kyiv on the eve of the US president's state visit to Britain, Zelenskyy bristled with frustration at the failure of the Western powers to ramp up pressure on the Kremlin, even as the Russians escalated their attacks on Ukraine.\n Asked if the summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska has proven a mistake, he responded without hesitation that Putin is clearly not paying a price for his actions. Zelenskyy believes Trump is reluctant to put pressure on Putin because it might jeopardise attempts to end the war. But the Ukrainian leader argues this isn't the way to handle the Russian president. Zelenskyy also argued Trump's emphasis on getting the Europeans to ratchet up economic pressure - foremost by stopping their purchases of Russian energy and tariffing other buyers like China and India - was understandable, but that the world’s sole superpower shouldn’t wait for others to act. Trump has called on EU countries to end all Russian oil and gas purchases - and only then will he consider imposing sanctions on Russia. Mr Trump arrives in the UK today for an unprecedented second state visit, following an invitation from King Charles. He and First Lady Melania will stay at Windsor Castle and be treated to a flypast by the Red Arrows as well as UK and US F-35 military jets on the east lawn, and a special Beating Retreat military ceremony. They will also visit Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence in Buckinghamshire, though details of what they will discuss - and whether it will include the situation in Ukraine - have not been revealed."

Speaking to Sky News' Yalda Hakim at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president was asked about the peace summit in Alaska last month - and whether he thought it was a mistake. \"I think it gave a lot to Putin,\" he said, \"and I believe, if it was a trilateral meeting [with Ukraine included], we would have some result.\" He also agreed when asked if the Russian president is trying to trick the US president. During their summit in Alaska, the Russian leader is said to have told Mr Trump he wants the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions - and would give up other Ukrainian territories held by his troops in exchange. Since then, the US president has resumed threats of sanctions against Russia and called for NATO countries to stop buying Russian oil to end the war.

He got the photos with President Trump. \"He received public dialogue, and I think this opens the doors for Putin into some other summits and formats, because that's how it is, and we see that, we observe this, and I don't think he paid anything for it.\" The Ukrainian president continued to say that Mr Putin \"should pay, firstly, because he started the war, and secondly, because (he is) trying to find a way out of isolation\".

That's his language. That is the language he understands. \"He doesn't speak many languages, but that's the language of force he understands, just like Russian, his mother tongue - and we ask very much European and US countries to do that, to show that. \"Yes, they take some steps, such as sanctions, for example, but more needs to be done, quicker.\" After being asked whether Mr Putin is trying to trick Mr Trump, Mr Zelenskyy agreed. He added: \"He's doing everything he can to avoid sanctions, to prevent US and Trump from putting sanctions on him, and if you keep postponing applying sanctions any further, then the Russians will be better prepared.\" Sky News will broadcast an extended interview in President Zelenskyy from 6am on Tuesday morning "

This is not a 'both sides' problem.\"  FBI: Suspect linked to evidence at scene Tyler Robinson, 22, from Washington in Utah, was arrested after a manhunt on suspicion of killing Mr Kirk, and is due to appear in court on Tuesday. He is being held without bail on suspicion of aggravated murder, a felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. The motive of the shooting is unclear, while experts said engravings left on ammunition at the scene of the shooting were \"extremely online\". But Utah's Republican governor, Spencer James Cox, previously claimed in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he had been \"deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology\". And on Sunday's NBC News Meet The Press show, Mr Cox said the suspect was in a relationship with his roommate, who was in the process of transitioning - something unnamed officials confirmed to the channel. So far, no official has yet said whether the relationship is relevant to their investigation. Later on Monday, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News that evidence found at the scene had been linked to Robinson via DNA sequencing. He told Fox and Friends that DNA matching Robinson's was found on a towel allegedly wrapped around a firearm that was discarded in a wooded area near the university - stressing no other evidence from the scene had been processed as of yet. Mr Patel added that the suspect's actions were premeditated, and repeated the claim that the killing was based on his political beliefs. \"His family has collectively told investigators that he subscribed to left-wing ideology,\" he said, \"and even more so in these last couple of years, and he had a text message exchange... in which he claimed that he had an opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and he was going to do it because of his hatred for what Charlie stood for.\" Read more from Sky News:What Trump's second state visit to UK really meansStarmer urged to maximise pressure on US over tariffsHow runaway couple killed their baby 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  Vance says 'I owe so much to Charlie' The vice president and Mr Kirk were close friends, with Mr Vance saying in his first tribute that \"he was a true friend\" and that \"he didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government\". The vice president also said on the Rumble show that \"I owe so much to Charlie\", adding that Mr Kirk texted friends that Mr Vance should be the vice presidential nominee for Donald Trump in the run-up to last year's presidential election. \"It's such an honour to have people show me that Charlie said 'we want JD to be the VP nominee',\" he added. \"Do you know what it means to me that such a good guy, such a good friend, such a lion and visionary of our movement was advocating for me?\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said three people were killed in a US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug cartel vessel. The US president said the strike, on Monday morning, was carried out on his orders and that the vessel was in international waters at the time. It marks the second such US strike on targets the Trump administration says are Venezuelan drug traffickers, with the first killing 11 people earlier this month. Mr Trump provided no evidence that the boat was carrying drugs at the time, but said on Truth Social that the military operation \"positively identified extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists\". The president added: \"These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital US Interests.\" He also posted a nearly 30-second-long video, which appeared to show a vessel in a body of water exploding and then on fire. It comes as the US military continues to build up deployments in the region: Five F-35 aircraft were seen landing in Puerto Rico on Saturday, after the Trump administration ordered 10 of the stealth fighters to join the buildup. \n                  Face-to-face with Zelenskyy, his frustration with the West is clear\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy demands 'clear position' from Trump on ending war\n                 \n                  Trump sends National Guard into Memphis, and hints Chicago is next\n                 That deployment joins at least seven US warships in the region, along with one nuclear-powered submarine. Officials have said that the US military has also been flying P-8 spy planes over international waters in the region to gather intelligence. Meanwhile, ahead of Mr Trump's post, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the recent strikes were an \"aggression\" by the US, and the communications between the two countries had largely ended. After the first strike from the US military on 2 September, Mr Trump said that the US military had identified the crew as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which was designated a terrorist group in February. He then alleged that Tren de Aragua is being controlled by Mr Maduro, which the country denies.

Despite demands from US politicians to justify it, the US government has not publicly said what type of drugs the boat in the first strike was carrying or what type of weapons were used to carry out the strike. US officials told the Reuters news agency that the vessel appeared to be turning around when it was struck. Mr Maduro said earlier this month that he \"would constitutionally declare a republic in arms\" if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n When it comes to the drugs industry, Britain is suffering withdrawal symptoms. This year, three of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies - Merck, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly - have pulled or paused UK investments worth almost £2bn, diagnosing that market conditions, specifically the NHS drugs pricing regime, make the UK a \"contagion risk\". The issue will be highlighted this week as Donald Trump begins his state visit, with executives called to give evidence to a parliamentary select committee on Tuesday, along with science minister Lord Vallance, a veteran of the pandemic, when government worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to speed up vaccine development. How has this come about? The UK pharmaceutical industry is one of those caught in the crossfire of Trump's trade war. In the trade deal agreed by the president and Sir Keir Starmer in May, the prime minister committed to \"improve the overall environment for pharmaceutical companies in the United Kingdom\".  Four months later, those companies - under pressure from Trump to charge US consumers the same as those in Europe, and to invest in US production and research - say the opposite is the case. They argue the British market is becoming unviable to pharmaceutical investors, at a cost to patients, jobs, and the economy. Data from the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries bear this out; R&D investment growth has fallen below the global average and foreign inward investment has declined almost 60% since 2020. Why the corporate backlash? To understand why an industry long regarded as a domestic strength has turned against the UK, it is necessary to understand the complexities of medicines pricing. The NHS is one of the largest \"single buyers\" of medicines in the world, a position that has long given it clout when it comes to negotiating prices. In the last two decades, however, strict conditions on what drugs are approved for use, and at what price, have brought down the price of the medicines but eroded the value of the UK to the companies that provide them. Simply put, the industry believes the NHS has been getting too good a deal for too long and argues the terms are no longer sustainable. In the last decade, the proportion of the NHS budget spent on medicines has fallen to just 9%, below the EU average of 13%. Meanwhile, the amount of revenue returned by companies to the government under complex \"clawback\" arrangements has jumped to more than 23%, more than three times the EU average. Under these complex rules, a form of price control that offers a uniform discount to the health service, manufacturers return revenue equal to the value of any overspend by the NHS on its total medicines budget. The figure has risen rapidly in the UK in the last five years as the NHS has exceeded its medicines budget faster than it has risen. This year it was supposed to be 15%, already double the EU average, but has already risen to 23.5%.  Can this all be resolved? The industry is demanding a commitment to return to single figures by the end of this parliament. Emergency talks with the health department broke up in the summer, and it is unclear when they will resume. It also wants the threshold at which new drugs are admitted to the NHS marketplace, currently £20,000-£30,000 and unchanged since 1999, increased. Had it risen in line with inflation, it would be £40,000-£60,000 today. As a consequence of these downward pressures on price, the industry says the number of new and innovative medicines offered to patients has fallen, with only 37% of available drugs accessed by the NHS, compared to 90% in Germany. Why so much is in the gift of the chancellor Paying higher prices to hugely profitable pharmaceutical giants was not part of Labour's electoral promises for the NHS, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he is committed to getting the best deal for patients, but the UK discount may no longer be sustainable. The issue also highlights a tension between the government's desire for economic growth and greater efficiency in its key public service. As one executive put it, as the UK accounts for only 2.5% of the global medicines market, which meant for a long time the lower margins doing business in Britain could be swallowed. With Trump demanding price parity for the US, which accounts for 40%, that is no longer the case. Read more from Sky News:UK and US firms announce nuclear dealsPM urged to up pressure over Trump tariffs  Life sciences are at the heart of the government's new industrial strategy and the UK still has much to commend it, with world-leading research and skills and a track record of spinning biotech innovation into the private sector. But the withdrawal of big pharma investment tells a different story. Johan Kahlstrom, country president of Novartis UK and Ireland, said: \"The UK is fast becoming uninvestable for life sciences companies. \"High clawback taxes that take almost a quarter of revenues, combined with outdated cost-effectiveness thresholds that haven't changed in over 25 years, are eroding the UK's position as a global life sciences hub.\"  Resolving the pricing row will require compromise and money, with the health secretary's room for manoeuvre ultimately resting on the Treasury, and the balance between losing jobs and investment from a growth industry, and a drugs budget the NHS has long taken for granted."

On top of the new sites to be launched, the UK arm of the German discount retailer said a further 21 stores will open within the next 13 weeks, in London, Durham, and Scotland. \"If we're not there already, we are coming to a town near you,\" Aldi's UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley told reporters, which will create thousands of additonal jobs. Money blog: 'I'm a celeb photographer' Earlier this year, Aldi also said it was seeking sites in Bromley and Ealing in London, South Shields in Tyne and Wear, and Witney in Oxfordshire. Opening more shops will mean growing market share as the barrier of distance to an Aldi is eliminated. \"The last 35 years have taught us that when we open a store nearby, customers switch to Aldi,\" Mr Hurley said. \n                  'We've sold toys, clothes, and even used my kids' birthday money': The parents struggling to feed kids during holidays\n                 \n                  Surprise rise in inflation as summer travel pushes up air fares\n                 \n                  Energy bills expected to rise from October - despite previous forecasts\n                 \"The main reason people choose not to shop with us regularly is distance, with over a third of shoppers saying they'd switched to Aldi for their main shop if we opened a store closer to them.\" There are currently 1,060 Aldis in the UK, with an ambition to bring the total to 1,500. Price wars Aldi is the UK's fourth most popular supermarket, after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, according to industry data from Worldpanel. More families were choosing it as the place to do their weekly shop and were also going more frequently for top-up shopping, the company said, which helped Aldi's UK and Ireland annual revenue reach a new record of £18.1bn in 2024. Prices are to be brought down in the coming weeks and months as Christmas approaches, Mr Hurley said, as 900 products became cheaper with £300m spent on bringing down the cost of goods. \"I'm really confident that in the coming days, weeks and months, we'll continue to see prices in our stores drop\", Mr Hurley added.  Market trends Despite promised price falls, the outlook for overall inflation is \"stubborn\", he said, \"more stubborn than other developed countries\". This is seen in changing buyer behaviour. More shoppers are treating themselves at home rather than going out and are increasingly buying Aldi's own-label premium goods, Mr Hurley said. Looking to the budget on 26 November, he said there's \"no doubt\" it \"does create a bit of uncertainty\".  Grocery prices could rise, and consumer confidence could be affected if business costs grow, he added."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Blackstone, the private equity giant which owns stakes in Legoland and swathes of British real estate, will this week pledge to invest £100bn in UK assets over the next decade during President Trump's state visit. Sky News has learnt that the investment group will unveil the commitment as part of a government-orchestrated announcement aimed at shifting attention back to the economic ties between Britain and the US. President Trump's arrival in the UK this week will come against a febrile political backdrop, following Lord Mandelson's sacking as US ambassador over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Money blog: 'I'm a celeb photographer' Ministers have already begun announcing billions of pounds worth of partnerships in sectors such as financial services and nuclear power, with further deals to follow in areas including artificial intelligence. Blackstone's £100bn commitment to UK investments over the next decade forms part of a $500bn European splurge announced by the buyout firm in June, according to a person familiar with its plans. The figure will encompass private equity buyouts as well as other forms of investment, they added. \n                  Tesla shares soar as Musk goes on buying spree\n                 \n                  Britain's drugs industry is suffering withdrawal symptoms, and it could prove costly\n                 \n                  'If we're not there already we're coming to a town near you' Aldi says, vowing lower prices before Christmas\n                 A source close to the firm said it had agreed to invest the sum following talks with Downing Street officials led by Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer's business adviser. Blackstone has for decades been one of the most prolific investors in British companies, and only last week triumphed in a £490m takeover battle for Warehouse REIT, a London-listed logistics company. Last week, it emerged that Southern Water had banned water tanker deliveries to a country estate owned by Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone's billionaire chief executive. Sky News revealed last week that Mr Schwarzman would be among the corporate chiefs accompanying President Trump on his state visit. Blackstone, which manages assets worth about $1.2trn, declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n English football's new watchdog is convening its inaugural summit early next month despite being warned of a clash with the annual gathering of Europe's main clubs association. Sky News understands that the Independent Football Regulator (IFR) has invited all 116 clubs in the Premier League, English Football League and National League to a meeting in Manchester on October 8. The summit is expected to involve the IFR providing further details of a series of consultations flagged in new legislation on issues including a licensing regime for professional clubs and fan engagement. The IFR began consulting this month on a toughened system of checks for club owners, directors and senior executives, amid fresh concerns about the fate of clubs such as Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. Sources said the IFR had been informed that the date of the meeting clashed with the European Clubs Association's general assembly in Rome, which is scheduled to take place from October 7-9. A Whitehall source insisted, however, that the IFR meeting would proceed as planned, adding that Premier League clubs were adequately resourced to be represented at both events. Invitations to the IFR summit have been issued with clarity on its leadership still being sought. \n                  England star Alessia Russo teams up with Sky in push to get more girls into playing football\n                 \n                  Ex-Premier League referee David Coote pleads not guilty to making an indecent image of a child\n                 \n                  Nottingham Forest sack Nuno Espirito Santo as manager\n                 David Kogan, the media executive, has been named as the government's preferred candidate to become chairman, but his appointment is yet to be formally ratified while a report on the government's handling of it remains outstanding. Mr Kogan, a former Labour donor, has, nevertheless, been holding bilateral meetings with Premier League clubs and with larger groups of EFL clubs during the summer. William Shawcross, the commissioner on public appointments, said in June that he would scrutinise the process, and was expected to have reported back within weeks. Sky News revealed in July that Richard Monks, a partner at the accountancy firm EY who specialises in financial regulation, had been identified as the IFR's first chief executive. The appointments of Mr Kogan and Mr Monks could be formally announced this month. Among the IFR's powers will be the ability to impose a financial settlement on the Premier League in relation to the distribution of money to lower league clubs. The regulator's creation was pledged by the last Conservative government in the wake of the furore over the failed European Super League project in 2021. Its establishment comes with the top tier of the professional game still gripped by civil war, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City at the centre of a major legal case with the Premier League over the club's financial affairs. A spokesperson for the IFR declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Hillsborough campaigners have hailed a \"momentous\" day as a bill to force public officials to tell the truth is finally introduced into parliament. The Public Office (Accountability) Bill, known more commonly as \"Hillsborough Law\", will be tabled on Tuesday, after a nearly decade-long fight to get it on the statute book. Politics Live: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson Crucially, the legislation contains a new professional and legal Duty of Candour - meaning public officials must act with honesty and integrity at all times, or face criminal sanctions. Concerns that this element would be watered down delayed the bill being introduced by the 36th anniversary of the tragedy in April - a deadline Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer set at the Labour conference in Liverpool last year. Downing Street said more time was needed to redraft the legislation so it had the support of bereaved family members and survivors, who warned against a \"toothless replacement\". Margaret Aspinall, whose son James was 18 when he died in the Hillsborough disaster, acknowledged the \"long journey to get here\" but said Sir Keir's promise was \"well worth waiting for\". \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Flagship Scottish government justice reform bill which will scrap not proven verdict to go before MSPs today\n                 She added: \"This campaign wasn't about just us, it is about the ordinary people of this country, hopefully this law will mean no one will ever have to suffer like we did.\" On 15 April 1989, 97 Liverpool FC fans were killed in a crush during the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium. It took a 27-year campaign by victims' families for an inquest jury to rule that the fans were not to blame for the disaster and those who died were unlawfully killed. In 2016, the first version of Hillsborough Law was drafted, which Sir Keir promised to implement in full while in opposition - a commitment that was included in Labour's 2024 manifesto. 'Seismic changes'  The government said Hillsborough Law will \"end the culture of cover-ups\" and learn lessons from other disasters, including the Grenfell Tower fire, the Post Office Horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal. It said the bill will include \"seismic\" changes, including a new offence of misleading the public, with criminal sanctions \"for the most serious breaches\". It will also provide families bereaved by the state with publicly funded legal representation at inquests, which the Ministry of Justice called the \"largest expansion of legal aid in a decade\", ending \"David and Goliath-style show downs\". The bill will now be debated and voted on by MPs and Peers before it becomes law, as is the case with any major piece of legislation. The Hillsborough Now Campaign hailed the \"landmark\" law but said it will only achieve its aims if it is passed in full.  'Don't weaken the bill now' \"The government will need to be brave and ignore the vested interests that will attempt to water it down as it progresses through parliament,\" a spokesperson for the group said. Elkan Abrahamson, one of the architects of the original bill, said he will scrutinise the legislation as it is debated in parliament \"so we're not quite there yet\". But added said that \"today is still a momentous step, owed entirely to the persistence of campaigners and their refusal to give up\". \"The Hillsborough Law will transform the face of British justice,\" he said. Ahead of the bill's announcement, campaigners met Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy at the memorial site in Anfield on Monday, as well as metro mayors Steve Rotherham and Andy Burnham, who have long backed the legislation. Some families and campaigners are expected to attend Downing Street on Tuesday to mark the bill's introduction. It comes ahead of the Labour Party Conference next week, which is once again being held in Liverpool. Paying tribute to the \"strength and courage\" of Ms Aspinall and other campaigners, Sir Keir said the bill will \"change the balance of power in Britain\" and ensure that the state \"can never hide from the people it is supposed to serve\". He added: \"Make no mistake - this a law for the 97, but it is also a law for the sub-postmasters who suffered because of the Horizon scandal, the victims of infected blood, and those who died in the terrible Grenfell Tower fire. This is change only this government can deliver.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n The Scottish government's flagship justice reform bill - which includes abolishing the controversial not proven verdict - will go before MSPs today. The Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill faces its final vote at the Scottish parliament, with a lengthy session of more than 160 amendments to be debated ahead of a decision. If passed, the new legislation will make a series of changes to the justice system, including scrapping the not proven verdict; establishing a specialist sexual offences court; creating a victims and witnesses commissioner; reforming the jury process to require a two-thirds majority for conviction; and requiring the parole board to take into account if a killer continues to refuse to reveal where they hid their victim's body - a proposal named Suzanne's Law. An earlier plan to pilot juryless trials in rape cases was dropped by the Scottish government last year due to a lack of cross-party support. Ahead of the Stage 3 vote, Justice Secretary Angela Constance said: \"This landmark bill, if passed by parliament, will transform the experiences of victims and witnesses within Scotland's justice system. \"Victims will be heard, supported, protected and treated with compassion, while the rights of the accused will continue to be safeguarded.\" Ms Constance said abolishing the not proven verdict will ensure a \"clearer, fairer and more transparent decision-making process\". She added: \"There will also be wholesale reform to the management of sexual offence cases as we know these victims in particular, who are mostly women and girls, can be retraumatised by the current system. \"This legislation was shaped by the voices of victims, survivors, and their families who have campaigned long and hard for further change. \"Parliament must stand with them and help ensure the justice system doesn't just respond to crime but helps those who have been harmed to rebuild their lives.\" Opposition parties have lodged a series of amendments in a bid to bolster the bill, including allowing victims to be given the right to make a statement in court; ensuring victims are told if a decision is taken not to prosecute an accused; and informing all victims when a plea deal is struck between the defence and prosecution lawyers. The Scottish Conservatives want to see a Scotland-only grooming gangs inquiry and are additionally calling for Suzanne's Law to be strengthened, which would compel killers to reveal the location of their victim's bodies or face having their parole rejected. Read more from Sky News:Why next year's Scottish elections could get messy The proposal is named after Suzanne Pilley, 38, who was murdered by David Gilroy in 2010 but whose body has never been found. Under current legislation, parole board rules dictate that a killer's refusal to disclose the information \"may\" be taken into account. Scottish ministers have accepted a proposed amendment that states parole boards \"must\" take into account the refusal to cooperate, but the Scottish Tories and campaigners are calling for it to go further and instead ensure \"no body, no release\". 👉 Tap here to follow Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts 👈 Scottish Tory MSP Liam Kerr, shadow justice secretary, said: \"Parliament has the chance to reboot Scotland's justice system so that it finally gives crime victims the rights they need and deserve. \"But the SNP bill, as it currently stands, fails to deliver that, so we can't vote for it. At the moment, it's a victims' bill in name only - a wasted opportunity. \"The Scottish Conservatives have submitted several common sense amendments to strengthen this bill and deliver the real change that victims' groups demand. \"I'm pleased that the SNP have backed our calls to scrap the not proven verdict and have heeded our opposition to their juryless trials plan - but now they must go further. \"I urge the nationalists to accept our amendments, instead of selling victims short.\""

The prime minister was forced to sack Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US last Thursday after details of the peer's relationship with Epstein emerged in the media. Emails between Lord Mandelson, a minister under Tony Blair and Mr Brown, and the convicted sex offender revealed that the ex-minister sent messages of support to Epstein even as the US financier faced jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Politics latest: PM speaks for first time since Mandelson sacking Sir Keir said on Monday that he would have \"never appointed\" Lord Mandelson as US ambassador if he knew then what he knows now. But Mr Brown told Sky News' Darren McCaffrey that he believes the prime minister will be \"completely exonerated\" once \"the record is out\" on the matter. The former prime minister said: \"I don't want to criticise Sir Keir Starmer's judgement, because he faces very difficult decisions and we're talking about a very narrow area for timing between a Tuesday and Thursday. \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Campaigners hail 'momentous' step as long-awaited Hillsborough Law introduced \n                 \"I think once the record is out, Sir Keir Starmer will be completely exonerated.\" However, Mr Brown did admit that the situation \"calls somewhat into his judgement\". He said: \"I think every government goes through difficulties. Probably 15 years ago, when I was in government, you'd be asking me questions about what had happened on a particular day. \"But this is not really in the end about personalities. In the end, it's about the policies. \"If you ask people in the street, they might say, well, interesting story, terrible thing that happened to these girls, but also they will say, look what's happening to my life at the moment, what's happening to my community, what's happening to my industry, what's happening to the whole region.  \"I think we've got to think that politics is about changing people's lives and making a difference in those areas where they want to do things.\" Sir Keir has insisted that Lord Mandelson went through a proper due diligence process before his appointment. However, speaking publicly for the first time since he sacked Lord Mandelson on Thursday night, he said: \"Had I known then what I know now, I'd have never appointed him.\" Sir Keir said he knew before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday afternoon that Lord Mandelson had not yet answered questions from government officials, but was unaware of the contents of the messages that led to his sacking. He said Lord Mandelson did not provide answers until \"very late\" on Wednesday, which was when he decided he had to be \"removed\"."

Paul Ovenden, who was the director of strategy at Number 10, is understood to have left the role on Monday after a number of instant messages from 2017 became public. Sky News understands he did so to avoid becoming a \"distraction\" for Sir Keir Starmer, just days after he was forced to sack the UK's ambassador to the US - Peter Mandelson - over his ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Politics Hub - latest updates The messages, exchanged between Mr Ovenden and a female colleague, contained the graphic retelling of a conversation he reportedly overheard about Ms Abbott while at a party. The former aide has alleged these were not his original words, but said he \"deeply regrets\" sharing them.

However, in the wake of the publication of these messages, Mr Ovenden \"brought forward\" his resignation to today. The messages, exchanged with a female colleague and seen by Sky News, described a game of \"shag, marry, kill\" the aide overheard while at a party in May 2017. This involved explicit descriptions about suspended Labour MP Ms Abbott. A Number 10 spokesperson said: \"These messages are appalling and unacceptable. \"As the first black woman to be elected to parliament, Diane Abbott is a trailblazer who has faced horrendous abuse throughout her political career. \"These kinds of comments have no place in our politics.\" Sky News has contacted Ms Abbott for comment. The latest Number 10 resignation comes as Sir Keir admitted he never would have appointed Lord Mandelson to the post of UK ambassador to the US if he had known what he knows now about the extent of his association with Epstein. Speaking publicly for the first time since he sacked Mandelson last Thursday, the prime minister explained that a \"due diligence process\" was conducted before he was appointed to the post in February. \"I knew of his association with Epstein,\" Sir Keir said. \"But had I known then what I know now, I'd have never appointed him.\"  Just days before Lord Mandelson was sacked, Angela Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she did not pay enough tax on her second home. She also quit as deputy leader of the Labour Party, an elected post. Sir Keir's second-in-command admitted to Sky News political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast that she should have paid the higher rate of stamp duty on a home she bought in Hove, East Sussex, as it was her second property."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure on multiple fronts amid the fallout from Lord Peter Mandelson's sacking. While there is no direct plot to oust him, the left-wing MP Richard Burgon has predicted the prime minister will be gone by May 2026 if next year's local elections go badly. Politics Live: The Conservative Party is over': MP defects to Reform UK It's worth noting that Mr Burgon has never been a fan of the current Labour leadership and Sir Keir has the full public backing of his cabinet - not to mention a large parliamentary majority. So, how can you oust a UK prime minister? Confidence Vote A core convention of the UK's constitution is that the government must be able to command the confidence of the House of Commons. While governments don't have to consistently prove they \"hold confidence\", they are expected to resign or trigger a general election if they lose a confidence vote. \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Campaigners hail 'momentous' step as long-awaited Hillsborough Law introduced \n                 There are different ways in which this can come about. The leader of the Opposition can table a vote of no confidence, which must explicitly state that the House has lost confidence in the government (rather than simply being critical of the leadership). The last time this brought down an administration was in 1979, when James Callaghan's minority Labour government, plagued by a wave of strikes and high inflation, was defeated by 311 to 310. The knife-edge vote triggered a general election, which the Conservatives won under Margaret Thatcher - and Labour did not return to power for 18 years. However, it is rare for governments to be defeated in confidence motions (before Callaghan, the last time this happened was Stanley Baldwin in 1924). Often, under-fire prime ministers will bring about their own confidence vote, usually by declaring a key policy as a \"matter of confidence\". This tactic was deployed by John Major in 1993, when, threatened with a general election, Eurosceptic Tory rebels got behind his controversial Maastricht Treaty on the foundation of the European Union. Leadership challenges  Political parties also have their own rules around deposing a leader.  As we saw in the dying days of the Conservatives' time in office, a confidence vote can be triggered if 15% of Tory MPs write to the chairman of the party's 1922 backbench committee requesting one. Theresa May and Boris Johnson faced such votes, and while they narrowly survived them, it damaged their authority and they did not last much longer in office (more on that below). The Labour Party has a different set of rules. The only way a leadership challenge can be forced is if a challenger, or challengers, are nominated by at least 20% of Labour MPs (which would be 80 MPs on current numbers). The challenger would have to be a member of parliament, ruling out someone like Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - who, in any case, has shut down mounting rumours he intends to return to Westminster to take on Sir Keir. The leader being challenged would not have to secure any nominations and would automatically be on the ballot paper. However, it is difficult to pull off a coup of this sort, given the high number of nominations required. While Gordon Brown faced open calls to go in 2008-9, the plotters could not get anyone serious to put their names forward as a challenger.

After Boris Johnson survived a no-confidence vote in July 2022, Conservative Party rules meant he was protected from another one for a year. So, when he was embroiled in another scandal regarding the disgraced former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, it sparked a mass revolt of cabinet ministers that made his position untenable. Credibility damage  However, it doesn't always have to be ministerial resignations that tip prime ministers over the edge. Liz Truss, who replaced Mr Johnson, resigned after just 44 days in office when her mini-budget sparked such economic turmoil she had to rapidly row back on most of her measures. This damaged her credibility to such an extent that she conceded she could not go on. Theresa May also faced difficulty commanding authority. While she survived two confidence votes during her time in office, her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by parliament as she failed to get hard-line Brexiteers on side, and she was forced to resign. Tony Blair won an unprecedented three elections for Labour, but his standing suffered in the wake of the Iraq War. Following pressure from within the party to quit, and a plot to replace him with Gordon Brown, he announced an early departure date, resigning mid-way through his final term."

        "Content": " Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK.  The East Wiltshire politician has been made head of Reform's new unit preparing the party for government, Reform leader Nigel Farage announced on stage at a news conference. Politics latest: Kruger's letters to constituents Mr Kruger has been a Conservative MP since 2019 and has been on the Tory frontbench since then, lately as a shadow work and pensions minister under Kemi Badenoch's leadership. He said he informed the Tory chief whip this morning. Announcing his defection, Mr Kruger said: \"The Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the Left. \"But I am not despondent because conservatism is not over. It's never been needed more. And actually, it's never been more vibrant. \n                  Politics latest: Speaker grants emergency debate on Mandelson as Tories seek to force publication of vetting information\n                 \n                  Starmer was aware of the risks of appointing the 'Prince of Darkness' as his man in Washington DC - to an extent\n                 \n                  Campaigners hail 'momentous' step as long-awaited Hillsborough Law introduced \n                 \"Because the failure of the Conservative Party has created space for an alternative. The flame is passing from one torch to another.\" He said his defection is \"very painful\" but added: \"I'm leaving because I think the party is over.\" The Tory party is not dead The MP told Sky News political correspondent Liz Bates: \"I don't think the Conservative Party is dead. It's just over as the official opposition.\" He added that Mr Farage \"may be our last hope\" on the political Right and he is \"proud to follow him\", although he admitted defecting is a \"big risk\", especially as his seat is \"not particularly\" a Reform target. Mr Kruger, who is TV chef Dame Prue Leith's son, has become most well-known for leading opposition to the assisted dying bill - and his differing views on the subject from his mother, who is an advocate. The MP said he has been a Conservative activist and MP for more than 20 years, but he does not believe the \"divided, discredited Conservative Party\" can unite to win power and \"deliver the change that is needed\". He said he has \"great personal regard\" for Conservative leader Ms Badenoch and thinks she has done a \"very, very difficult job with courage and resilience\" - but said \"the problem is the Conservative Party\", which he claimed is divided and \"a toxic brand\". The MP revealed he started to think about defecting when Lee Anderson, a Tory MP who became an independent, moved to Reform in June 2024. Mr Kruger said it was \"fair enough\" to be questioned about how he, as an Eton and Oxford graduate, can understand the British people, but pointed to the charity he founded working in prisons to stop re-offending and his work as a constituency MP. Political correspondent Even amid a wave of news (Mandelson), Reform are adept at grabbing headlines, and defectors. Another news conference from them gave us another new face and a big political shock.\n Danny Kruger is the first sitting Conservative MP to leave his party and join the other side (Lee Anderson had already been suspended). And this one had a different feel to it - as Mr Kruger is much more the traditional Tory than those that came before him. An Eton and Oxbridge-educated politician from the Conservative heartland seat of East Wiltshire - he looks and sounds like part of the Tory party furniture.\n But his assessment of their future couldn't have been more damning - he has not, he says, abandoned conservatism, it simply has a new home with Reform. Asked if he believes the Tories have a future at all, he said never as the political opposition.\n This is why it could represent yet another breakthrough moment for Farage's party - if even MPs like him are wavering, Reform could take swathes of the Conservatives and even more political momentum. A change of heart The MP appears to have changed his mind on Reform's professional accolades after telling MPs in the Commons in July: \"I do quite like the Reform Party and I agree with its members on lots of things, but there is a problem: They would spend money like drunken sailors. \"I can see what is happening and I am very worried about it - they will end up in an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats with a joint ticket to protect welfare spending. I do not know how honorary members feel about the anticipated alliance.\" Badenoch: Tories only party of conservatives Speaking moments after Mr Kruger announced his defection, Ms Badenoch said: \"We are the only party of conservatives who are working on dealing with the government that we have now. \"We want them to live within our means. The economy is in freefall. They don't know what to do.\" She said Sir Keir Starmer is \"facing a political crisis\" and the Conservatives are \"the only people who are drawing attention to that\". Labour: Farage has no plan A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Every Conservative who defects to Reform ties Nigel Farage more closely to their record of failure. Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes - it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain. \"The Tories crashed our economy and left public services crumbling. Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price. \"Only this Labour government is driving forwards delivery to make working people better off and give our country the renewal it needs.\""

        "Content": "Scientists have found what could be the world's oldest known mummies in southeast Asia, with some of the preserved remains believed to date back 12,000 years. Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam. Other remains were found in the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists revealed the bodies were likely exposed to heat and suggested they had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified. Study author Hirofumi Matsumura, with Sapporo Medical University in Japan, said the practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory\". While mummification can happen naturally in places where conditions can stop decomposition, various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honour them or send their souls to the afterlife. Egyptian mummies are the most well-known, but some of the oldest known mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what is now Peru and Chile. \n                  Prosecutors drop charges against two men accused of spying for China\n                 \n                  Donald Trump urges NATO countries to stop 'shocking' Russian oil purchases to end Ukraine war\n                 \n                  China warns UK and US after USS Higgins and HMS Richmond sail through Taiwan Strait\n                 In modern times, indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea also smoke-dry and mummify their dead.

Baroness Amos will lead an investigation that will consult with bereaved families to drive improvements to England's maternity care. New data shows harm to mothers and their babies is at risk of being normalised due to a \"toxic\" culture of \"cover-up\" within the health service. The health secretary previously announced the \"rapid\" national investigation into NHS maternity services, vowing to investigate 10 trusts - this has now been expanded to 14. Among the trusts is Oxford University Hospitals Trust, where more than 500 families claim to have suffered harm. Campaign co-founder Rebecca Matthews said the group, Families Failed by OUH Maternity Services, was \"pleased and relieved\" to be included. \"For 15 months, our inbox has been flooded with stories of shockingly poor and negligent care at OUH,\" she said. \"These include accounts of stillbirth, of babies with brain injuries and women with long-lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of failings in the maternity care they received.\" She added: \"The trust has escaped scrutiny for too long. Now, finally, we hope it will be held accountable.\" Baroness Amos said \"it is vital\" that the experiences of mothers and affected families are at the heart of the investigation from its \"very beginning\" and are \"fully heard\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 She said: \"Their experiences - including those of fathers and non-birthing partners - will guide our work and shape the national recommendations we will publish. \"We will pay particular attention to the inequalities faced by black and Asian women and by families from marginalised groups, whose voices have too often been overlooked.\" Review 'will not scratch the surface' But a statement from the Bereaved and Harmed Families in Leeds said the review \"will not scratch the service of the frontline care failings at Leeds maternity, let alone get anywhere near a culture that incubates these practices, or the leadership and people that allow these terrible cultures to perpetuate\". The Royal College of Midwives (RCN) said it is imperative the \"investigation gets underway at pace\".  \"It is vital this work gets under way quickly so that the families who have suffered unimaginable harm get the answers they need and hard-pressed maternity staff get the support and investment they've been calling for,\" said chief executive Gill Walton. She added: \"It should not be the case that, in 21st century Britain, black and Asian women are disproportionately more likely to die during childbirth or soon after, or that their babies are more likely to have poorer outcomes.\""

        "Content": " Owen Cooper, the star of British TV drama Adolescence, has made history by becoming the youngest male to win an outstanding supporting actor Emmy. Cooper, 15, played Jamie Miller in the highly acclaimed series, which cleaned up in its categories, including gongs for his co-stars Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty, and director Philip Barantini. Adolescence, which dominated Netflix's most-watched list earlier this year, centres on the story of a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a classmate. It was widely praised not just for its subject matter but also its technical brilliance, with each episode shot in one continuous take. Cooper, who was just 14 at the time of filming and had never acted before, saw off competition from Javier Bardem (Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story), Peter Sarsgaard (Presumed Innocent) and his own Adolescence co-star Ashley Walters to win his Emmy. He said in his acceptance speech that he was \"nothing three years ago\". \"It's just so surreal. Honestly, when I started these drama classes a couple of years back, I didn't expect to be even in the United States, never mind here,\" he told the audience in LA. \"So I think tonight proves that if you listen and you focus and you step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life.\" Read more: All the main winners and nominees  The four-part mini-series provoked a strong response from viewers and prompted a conversation in the UK - and worldwide - around misogyny and online safety, with co-creator Jack Thorne joining Prime Minister Keir Starmer for a discussion on the matter at the end of March. \"It shows you that any dream is possible,\" said Graham, who was also co-creator of the show, as he accepted his own acting prize. The show was named best overall anthology or limited series and took home six awards in total, with Thorne and Graham also honoured for outstanding writing. Culture and entertainment reporter It was a show that broke viewing records and fuelled countless conversations when it launched - a gut-punch for parents that shocked and captivated audiences around the world. Adolescence tells the story of a teenage boy arrested for the murder of a female classmate, but is far removed from a typical whodunnit or crime drama. Harrowing and unflinching, this is a show about the impact of a horrendous violent crime on a broken family, highlighting the corrosive rise of online misogyny and the potentially damaging and devastating effects of social media on children growing up with smartphones. The inital idea came to co-creator Stephen Graham following several real-life crimes. It tapped into parents' fears because it felt real. This was down to the script, the masterclass performances, and the one-take shooting - which meant viewers never left the action, had no time to catch a breath, not even for a second.  Prime Minister Keir Starmer revealed he had watched the series with his family, prompting him to publicly support a campaign for it to be shown in parliament and schools. The Met Police also issued advice to parents on the signs to look out for when it comes to online radicalisation and extremism. It happens every now and then, one of those TV moments - such as with Mr Bates Vs The Post Office - when a show's impact extends way beyond the small screen. Gyllenhaal's gift Before the ceremony, Cooper, from Warrington, had been surprised by his acting hero Jake Gyllenhaal, who walked in unannounced during an interview he was giving to the press. Gyllenhaal had been up against Graham in their best actor category for his performance in the Apple TV+ remake of Presumed Innocent. The pair hugged, and Gyllenhaal gave Cooper a small gift - a \"lucky duck\". \"I made this movie [Brokeback Mountain], and I got nominated for an Academy Award, and a friend of mine sent me this before. Something just like this,\" he said. \"It's just a 'Lucky Duck' to keep in your pocket. To give you a little bit of luck.\" The night's other big winners Other major winners included Seth Rogen's Hollywood satire The Studio, which dominated the comedy categories with prizes for directing, writing and outstanding actor, as well as best overall comedy series. In total, the show won 13 awards - breaking the record for the most wins by a comedy series in a single season, set by The Bear last year. Medical procedural drama The Pitt was named best drama series and earned awards in that category for its stars Noah Wyle (best actor) and Katherine LaNasa (supporting actress), while Severance star Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man to win the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series, and co-star Britt Lower was named outstanding lead actress. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver also picked up two prizes for variety series and outstanding scripted variety series. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which was controversially cancelled earlier this year, picked up the prize for outstanding talk series. \"And that's related to love, because sometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,\" Colbert told the crowd as his team cheered his name. As well as the night's winners, the ceremony also honoured stars we have lost in the last year in its In Memoriam section, including Dame Maggie Smith, musicians Ozzy Osbourne and Quincy Jones, Gossip Girl actress Michelle Trachtenberg and director David Lynch. A short speech incentive - but did it work? This year's host, Nate Bargatze, had an interesting way to keep speeches from getting too lengthy, as they often tend to do at awards ceremonies. In his opening address, the comedian announced he would donate $100,000 (about £73,750) to the children's non-profit organisation Boys and Girls Club of America.  But if speeches ran for more than 45 seconds, he said he would deduct $1,000 from the total amount being donated, while those under the time limit would add more cash. \"I know, it's brutal,\" he said. \"This is a game I've made up and these are rules.\" But with the speeches running over, the donation limit decreased. Bargatze told the crowd as he closed the show. \"The number, I'll be honest, it was embarrassing. It went way down. So CBS is going to add $100,000. I will give $250,000. It takes us to $350,000 to the Boys and Girls Club.\""

Speaking about meeting him as a student for the first time, Cooper's drama teacher Helen Thorpe told Sky News: \"It was clear he was an absolute natural. He had such an energy about him and a willingness to join in\". Esther Morgan, who co-founded Drama MOB where Cooper trained, said he was: \"Funny, popular with his classmates and really good at improvising\". With each episode of the hit drama shot in just one take, Ms Morgan said Cooper's skill of \"getting up there and giving it a go… and keep it going even if it goes wrong\" helped win him the role that has seen him go from an unknown to one of the UK's most talked-about actors. On Sunday, Cooper became the youngest male to win an outstanding supporting actor Emmy, with Netflix drama Adolescence sweeping the board and taking home six awards. The 15-year-old from Warrington was just 14 when he was cast as Jamie Miller, a 13-year-old boy arrested for the murder of a classmate, and the role was his first professional job.

Ms Morgan said: \"Owen has got massive talent and had massive talent when he came to us, but I think we were able to work with him, improve those skills, and we can see that in his performance\". Ms Morgan, who admitted she'd stayed up to watch the Emmy's and not yet been to sleep, said: \"To see his mum and dad in the audience, to see how proud they are. They are such a lovely family. That's so grounded. They're so down to earth. He's a Northern boy. He's local to us. He's trained with us. To see him collect an Emmy was just incredible.\" Ms Thorpe called Cooper's performance \"unbelievable,\" particularly praising his relationship with his on-screen dad Graham, which she said \"was just so touching and as a parent drives home that this could be anybody\". As for Cooper's future, Ms Morgan said \"I think he will go on to do great things. I have no doubt,\" but first \"he'll be going back to school to do his GCSEs\". Ms Thorpe added, \"I think he might pop in [to the drama school] at some point… He's a very grounded, local lad. We hope to see him again\". The four-part mini-series sparked a national conversation on misogyny and online safety, while also drawing attention for its technical brilliance, with each episode shot in a single, tension-ramping continuous shot. Despite not being an easy watch, it topped Netflix's charts around the world. It also had real real-world impact, with Prime Minister Kier Starmer - who said he watched it with his own family - supporting a campaign for it to be shown in parliament and schools. Adolescence also scooped two gongs at this year's National Television Awards (NTAs) including the new drama award and best drama performance for Cooper."

        "Content": " Ricky Hatton's family have paid tribute to the former world champion after his death at the age of 46.  Hatton, nicknamed \"The Hitman\", was found dead at his home in Hyde on Sunday morning. The death is not being treated as suspicious by police. During his career between 1997 and 2012, the British fighter won titles in the light welterweight and welterweight divisions. In a tribute, released by Greater Manchester Police, the family said: \"It is with the heaviest of hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved son Richard.\" The statement added: \"Richard was so much more than a world champion. To us, he was simply 'Richard', our son. A loving father, grandfather, and brother, and a true friend to many. \"He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him. \"To the wider world, Richard will always be remembered as one of boxing's greatest champions - a man who gave everything inside the ring and wore his heart on his sleeve outside of it. \n                  Former world champion boxer Ricky Hatton has died aged 46\n                 \n                  Joe Bugner: Former British heavyweight boxing champion, who fought Muhammad Ali, dies\n                 \n                  Fighters will undergo screening to determine sex before women's World Boxing Championships\n                 \"He inspired generations with his fighting spirit, his humility, and his love for the sport. But beyond the titles, the nights to remember, and the roar of the crowd, he remained the same down-to-earth Richard who never forgot where he came from.\" Hatton's brother Matthew, who is also a boxer, posted a series of photos of them together and wrote: \"I love you Richard. See you on the other side.\" Tributes have also been paid from across the world of sport and entertainment, including Amir Khan, Tyson Fury, Chris Eubank Jr, Liam Gallagher, while the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has pledged to \"find a way of honouring him properly\". In a statement on X, Mr Burnham said Hatton supported many good causes and was \"much loved by so many in Greater Manchester\". \"He made us smile and made us proud... We will find a way of honouring him properly,\" he added. Oasis singer Liam Gallagher also wrote on X that he was \"absolutely devastated\". \"It was an absolute honour to know him and carry his belts RIP CHAMP LIVE FOREVER LG x.\" Paul Malignaggi, who lost against Hatton in a legendary 2008 bout in Nevada, posted a message about his \"old friend and foe\", saying his death was \"extremely sad\". Two-time boxing Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams called Hatton a \"true legend in and out of the ring\". Former professional boxer Barry McGuigan told Sky's Jonathan Samuels that Hatton was \"a phenomenal attraction, both inside and outside the ring\". \"He fought at a ferocious pace... He was a great body puncher. He was a real throwback to the swashbuckling days of the 1930s and 1940s. He was just so great to watch and so entertaining, such an enthralling style.\"  Marco Antonio Barrera, who fought Hatton in an unscored exhibition bout in 2022, said the boxer \"was a once in a lifetime man\" and was his \"closest friend in boxing\". Manchester City goalscorer Phil Foden dedicated his side's 3-0 derby win over Manchester United to Hatton, a lifelong City fan. Before kick-off, a one-minute applause was held in Hatton's memory. David Beckham shared several images of Hatton on Instagram, calling the boxer \"one of a kind\". Cricket star Freddie Flintoff also posted an image of the boxer in the ring, adding the word \"legend\" alongside a broken heart emoji. Comedian Paddy McGuinness paid an emotional tribute as he announced news of the boxer's death while presenting his radio show. Arts and entertainment correspondent There are few sporting stars who cross from the newspaper back pages to become front page news... but Ricky Hatton always was one of them. Aside from his boxing brilliance, it was his personality and humour which made people pay attention. In recent years, his happy-go-lucky character saw him cast on reality shows like Dancing on Ice. But what's more interesting is how and why the public came to have such great affection for him back in the day. Putting it kindly, sports stars aren't always known for their sparkling personalities. It was Ricky's lack of interest in the trappings of fame which accompanied his epic run of victories that made him all the more cool. Read more from Katie here. The family statement, released on Monday, also described the \"loss\" and \"pain\" at the news of Hatton's death. \"As a family, our loss is immeasurable, and words cannot truly capture the pain we feel. Yet in the midst of our grief, we have been deeply moved by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. \"It has been a source of great comfort to see just how many lives Richard touched, and how widely he was admired and respected. \"At this time, we kindly ask for privacy as we come to terms with life without him. In the days and weeks ahead, we will take strength from one another and from the knowledge that Richard's legacy - both in boxing and as a man - will continue to live on. \"Richard's memory will forever remain in our hearts, in the hearts of his fans, and in the sport he loved so dearly.\" Hatton had announced he was coming out of retirement for a December bout in Dubai, 13 years after his last professional match. The Manchester boxer had been set to fight Eisa Al Dah on 2 December."

        "Content": "Punk rap duo Bob Vylan have had their next gig cancelled after their frontman made controversial comments about Charlie Kirk's death on stage. A clip from the Ipswich band's performance at Amsterdam's Club Paradiso on Saturday went viral - in which the band's frontman hit out at Mr Kirk. The comments came after Mr Kirk was fatally shot in the neck on Wednesday while speaking to university students at an event in Utah. Bob Vylan were next set to perform at the 013 venue in Tilburg in the Netherlands on Tuesday. The band, who led chants of \"death to the IDF\" at Glastonbury, which are the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by Avon and Somerset Police, released a response to claims online that they were celebrating Kirk's death. Frontman Bobby Vylan, who keeps his real name private, said in a video response on X: \"At no point during yesterday's show was Charlie Kirk's death celebrated. \"I did call him a piece of s***. That much is true. But at no point was his death celebrated. \"If it was, go find me a quote... that proves that we were celebrating his death. You're not gonna find it, because it didn't happen.\" He ended the video by telling people to \"calm down\". The video has received more than 25,000 comments, including from the former mayor of New York and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, who said the band were being \"irresponsible and dangerous\".

It added that it was also because the duo claimed in a statement that the chant was \"not an antisemitic slogan, but rather criticism of the Israeli army\"."
