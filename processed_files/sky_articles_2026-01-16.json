        "Content": "Emergency calls have revealed the moments after mother-of-three Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis.  \"They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car... She's f*****g dead. They f*****g shot her,\" one caller told 911, demanding courageous police officers be sent to the scene to help. \"There's like 50 f*****g ICE agents over here,\" the caller added, according to transcripts acquired by Sky News US partner network NBC. He also said there was video footage of the shooting on 7 January, which enflamed tensions in a city at the focus of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and led to nationwide protests. The Trump administration claimed the ICE officer acted in self-defence after Ms Good used her vehicle as a weapon - a version of events rejected by state and local officials. \"ICE fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked,\" a second caller described the shooting to 911, adding that the driver was bleeding. A third person told a dispatcher that ICE shot an observer in her car, and it crashed. When asked if she could see the person who was shot, the woman replied: \"I had to walk away because I have young kids, and ICE is everywhere over there...\" Good shot in the chest, arm and head When paramedics arrived at the scene, they found Ms Good still alive, with gunshot wounds to her chest, forearm and face, according to an incident report by the Minneapolis Fire Department. She was \"unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity\", with bulging eyes, dilated pupils and blood running from her left ear, according to the report. Paramedics treated Ms Good on the sidewalk before moving her to the street corner, away \"from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders\". They applied a tourniquet and gave her CPR before she was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Hospital staff stopped resuscitation efforts at 10.30am, less than an hour after the shooting.

The first 911 calls were received at 9.38am, according to the police report. Traffic was shut down five minutes later and police taped off the scene. By 10.04am, the ICE agent who shot Ms Good had left the scene. The police report also described \"agitators\" in the crowd cutting crime tape, slashing tyres, throwing snow and ice \"at federal agents but not at MPD [Minneapolis Police Department]\". Border Patrol officers used pepper spray about 20 minutes after the shooting. By 11.20am, all ICE agents had left the scene, with the FBI arriving at 11.31am. Much of the 911 transcripts have been redacted and blacked out, with hidden portions labelled \"Law Enforcement\", according to NBC."

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n Heavily-armed military officers yell at us to kneel on the ground in front of the shuttered shop fronts facing Kibuye roundabout in central Kampala as the jolting sounds of gunfire and stun grenades ring out. Dozens of soldiers gather to enforce the temporary detention. Some are in balaclavas, and others are bare-faced and berating. It is clear from their threats that journalists are as unwelcome as the protesters calling for an end to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's 40-year rule. Eventually, we are pardoned by a senior commander who directs his soldiers to return our cameras and says: \"I forgive you, but don't embarrass us.\" Uganda has been plunged into a state-enforced internet blackout, and the media are being forcefully restricted from reporting on the unfolding scenes of unrest, as votes for the next president are tallied and disputed. When we first arrived at the frenetic roundabout to film the crackdown on protesters, a local journalist showed us the dent of a baton on his bicep and warned: \"I told them I was press and they beat me.\" 'People Power' Across the road, a man sprints away from a huddle of soldiers who hang back to search and beat another man before taking him away. Men driving Boda Boda motorcycle taxis express their discontent from across the street before nearby gunfire drives them off. Drivers yell \"people power!\" from their cars, one of the rallying cries of opposition leader Bobi Wine. One man holds firm on the side of the road to express himself, saying: \"Right now, people are voting for Bobi Wine. He has been cheated of his vote!\" A large billboard of Mr Museveni hovers above this chaos. His election campaign slogan, \"protecting the gains\", feels violently literal. The military forces targeting the supporters of his main opponent are led by his son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the head of the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF) and, to many, his heir apparent. All of this unfolded before Bobi Wine's National Unity Party (NUP) announced that security agents had broken into his home, an army helicopter landed in his compound and abducted him on Friday night. The Ugandan government has denied the NUP's claims. The chair of national strategic communications committee in Uganda said Bobi Wine and his wife are \"safely in their home\" and under the protection of police. Read more:Uganda election descends into deadly violencePresident on shutting down the internetHow Ugandan government is trying to stop pop star politician Claims of his arrest could fuel national protests to rival those of the 2021 election and be met with an even more brutal response. The stand-off between his supporters and the state earlier in the day was mirrored by a feverish brawl in Kampala's Kololo tally centre after a disputed declaration of vote counts, handing wins to Mr Museveni. \"I have the right to speak! I have the right to speak,\" an opposition party official yells into the face of the ruling party's stern agents backed by the military and police flooding the counting tent. The screams of objection from a member of Wine's party spill out of the counting tent: \"We want our win! This is a protesting vote! We want our win! They are protecting the criminals.\" The military and police close in on him and violently drag him on to a police truck. He joins 300 other supporters, and officials that the NUP says have been arrested and disappeared in recent weeks. A fellow NUP member, 23-year-old university student Elizabeth Namagembe, is breathless from frustration. \"We have Ugandans that have voted and this is their right to choose a leader,\" she tells us in tears outside the tent with soldiers and police standing watch behind her. \"The international community, what can they do for us? Because us Ugandans have come out to fight - we have voted, and we have requested no violence.\""

Edward Brandt, 61, was found guilty of the offence in November following a trial at Southampton Crown Court, but was acquitted of the more serious offence of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the former Conservative cabinet minister said: \"I am completely exhausted due to the stress, every time I step out of the building I am looking over my shoulder and checking to see if he is there. \"I am living in a constant fear of a confrontation. It's hugely impacted all aspects of my life, both my professional life and personal life, and I cannot stress enough how much I am exhausted by it.\" The court previously heard Dame Penny believed Brandt was a \"real threat\" and feared \"sexual violence\" because of his \"creepy\" behaviour. The trial was told that Brandt sent at least 17 emails and three phone messages to Dame Penny, as well as turning up at her Portsmouth constituency office out of hours between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, who lived on the Isle of Wight at the time, failed to comply with the terms of a conditional caution issued in April 2024, which required him to complete a victim awareness course and not to contact Dame Penny, the trial heard. 'I am not giving up' The divorced father of two then left two voicemail messages for her on 6 and 10 May, and in one of the messages, he said: \"I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.\" Sentencing Brandt, Judge William Mousley KC said: \"I am satisfied that there is a real risk of you reoffending or causing harm to other people.\" He said it was clear that Brandt's behaviour had a \"very significant and enduring impact\" on Dame Penny.

He was also sentenced for seven breaches of a stalking protection order in December 2025 by failing to notify police of devices capable of connecting to the internet and of the creation of accounts on Facebook and Snapchat. The stalking protection order is in place until November 2034. Brandt was handed 12 weeks in jail over the stalking offence and another eight to serve consecutively for the breaches of the order."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n In a typical Nigel Farage tease, the Reform UK leader has said that a \"well known Labour figure\" will defect to his party next week. But who? Notice that he said a \"Labour figure\" rather than \"Labour MP\". That perhaps suggests he means an ex-MP or a peer. Or someone who's both. And after Nadhim Zahawi and Robert Jenrick this week, what about more Tory defectors. Kemi Badenoch told Sky News she was \"100% confident\" there would be no more shadow cabinet defections. In both parties, it's fair to assume that candidates for defecting to Reform UK will be committed Brexiteers, socially conservative and - from Labour - Red Wallers or Blue Labour. That narrows it down. In the 2016 referendum, the two most high-profile pro-Brexit Labour MPs were Kate Hoey and Gisela Stuart, both awarded a peerage by Boris Johnson and both no longer Labour. \n                  Number of councils that have requested delay to local elections revealed - is yours one of them?\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  Farmers celebrate Sir Keir Starmer's Christmas U-turn on inheritance tax\n                 Kate Hoey Born in Northern Ireland, as MP for the inner London seat of Vauxhall she was a junior Home Office minister and then sports minister under Tony Blair, but later became an outspoken backbench rebel. She was pro fox hunting, pro-Brexit, pro tougher immigration controls, pro curbs on welfare spending and grammar schools. She was against the Iraq war, Trident, tuition fees, ID cards and more LGBT+ rights. On Brexit, she was co-chair of Labour Leave, active in Grassroots Out, alongside Mr Farage and left-wing firebrand George Galloway, and accused the BBC of being \"embittered remainers\". Asked if she's Mr Farage's \"well known Labour figure\", she told Sky News: \"Not sure I'm that well known. Haven't been a Labour Party member for over eight years!\" Not a yes or a no, then. Gisela Stuart Born in Germany, she was MP for the suburban seat of Birmingham Edgbaston and a junior health minister under Tony Blair. She was later chair of Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson later appointed her First Civil Service Commissioner, effectively a Whitehall watchdog, a post she still holds under Sir Keir Starmer. But she emphatically denies being poised to defect to Reform UK. \"Thank you for the straightforward question,\" she told Sky News. \"It deserves a straightforward answer… No.\" Read more:All the former Conservative MPs who have defected to ReformEx-Tory chancellor defects to Reform And what about possible Conservative defections? As Kemi Badenoch says, shadow cabinet defections are highly unlikely. But there are potential Tory defectors among ex-ministers and less senior front benchers. For example: Suella Braverman Named after Sue Ellen Ewing in Dallas, (yes, really!), the fiercely right-wing former home secretary has been on defection watch for years. That's hardly surprising. In 2024, she suggested the Conservatives should welcome Nigel Farage into the party to \"unite the right\", a phrase used by Robert Jenrick after his defection. As a controversial home secretary, she said sending illegal migrants to Rwanda was her \"dream\" and called left-wing demonstrators \"Guardian-reading, Tofu-eating wokerati\". She's a bitter opponent of the European Convention on Human Rights. MP for Fareham and Waterlooville in Hampshire, she chaired the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, was a Brexit minister under Theresa May but quit and stood for the Tory leadership and then backed Liz Truss. Andrew Rosindell The Romford MP and devotee of Margaret Thatcher has called Mr Farage \"a good man and a patriot\" and said he could serve in a government with him in a Conservative-Reform coalition. He also co-sponsored a private member's bill introduced by Mr Farage, which aimed to prevent \"foreign judges\" overturning decisions made by the UK parliament. Socially conservative and Eurosceptic, he was a Brexit rebel against Theresa May, a critic of Boris Johnson's lockdown policy during the Covid pandemic and has voted against extending LGBT+ rights. Asked if he was planning to defect, animal lover, Mr Rosindell sent Sky News a photo of a cute dog with the caption: \"Who me?\" Make of that what you will!"

        "Headline": "Gary Webster, one of 122 children with haemophilia who attended the Lord Mayor's Treloar's College, said the sum offered by the government is \"way off the mark\".",
        "Content": "Proposed compensation for victims of \"unethical testing\" at a college, leaving them with HIV and hepatitis, has been branded \"ridiculous\" by a charity. Between the 1970s and early 1990s more than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis after being given contaminated blood and blood products in what was dubbed the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. More than £2bn has now been paid in compensation to victims of the infected blood scandal. However, a charity has raised \"profound concerns\" about an element of the payouts for people who were victims of \"unethical research\". Pupils at the Lord Mayor's Treloar's College in Hampshire, who were undergoing haemophilia treatment, were also experimented on without their knowledge by NHS clinicians, who knew the dangers it posed. The Infected Blood Public Inquiry's report, published in May 2024, found that boys with the disorder who attended the school were treated as \"objects for research\" and were given \"multiple, riskier\" treatments. They have been offered a one-off £15,000 payment on top of ongoing support, with a £10,000 award available for others in similar, less notorious cases. Changes to the payment are currently under public consultation. Gary Webster was one of 122 children with haemophilia who attended the Lord Mayor's Treloar's College in Hampshire between the 1970s and early 1980s. He was infected with HIV and hepatitis C. Of those who attended the college with the condition, he said that more than 80 are now dead. In response to the compensation offer, he said the sum is \"way off the mark,\" and added: \"How can you offer £25,000 to someone who's been experimented and researched on, and most of the time killed? \"It's just ridiculous. It has to be a lot more than what they are offering.\" Infected blood scandal: The Treloar's School pupils who 'lost everything'  Mr Webster also told the PA news agency that \"we were forced, basically to have injections every day\". \"At the time, we didn't know,\" he added. \"We were eight, nine, 10, years old - and we just thought the doctors, who were our friends, who used to come and play sports with us in the evening, we thought they were doing good for us. \"Our parents had no knowledge of anything.\" Charity raises 'profound concerns' to minister The Hepatitis C Trust has also written to Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds to \"express our profound concerns regarding the proposed compensation\" for the victims - saying the sums are \"wholly inadequate\". \"We are very concerned that the current proposals fall far short of delivering justice and risk sending a dangerous message about the value of human life and the integrity of public institutions in the UK,\" the charity said in a letter. \"You are more than aware of the immense suffering of the victims of what has been termed 'unethical research' - people, most of whom were children, who were deliberately given blood products known to be contaminated with HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. \"This was not an accident; it was a conscious decision by medical professionals.\" Read more:Blood scandal compensation scheme widenedVictims 'scared they won't live to see compensation'  Signatories, including the charity, and other members of the infected blood community, called for the award to be \"fully and transparently reviewed\". The letter also raised concerns over delays to a potential criminal investigation into the scandal, referring to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), saying it instigated a review after the inquiry published its report. In December, the police council said that the review is \"ongoing\". \"(The NPCC) give no timeline for completion,\" the letter added. \"This delay compounds the injustice and erodes public trust.\" When approached for comment, Treloar's College pointed Sky News to a previous statement in May 2025. \"We would like to reiterate the call we made at that time to implement compensation plans without further delay,\" it said at the time. It added: \"The Inquiry's report laid bare the full extent of this horrifying national scandal. We are deeply saddened that some of our former pupils were so tragically infected and their families affected, and we share our former students' frustration with the time it is taking for compensation to be paid.\" A government spokesperson said: \"The suffering endured by all those subjected to unethical medical research is profound, and we remain committed to ensuring that justice is not only delivered but reflected in the way compensation is treated. \"This is why uplifts to the Autonomy awards will be made available through the supplementary route to recognise the suffering of victims subjected to unethical research practices. \"This award is just one part of the overall compensation package available. \"We encourage the community to respond to the government's consultation before January 22, which seeks respondents' feedback on different ways of designing and calculating the award to reflect unethical research practices.\""

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n What led to the downfall of the chief of West Midlands Police goes beyond a football match and the exclusion of a fan base. It is a scandal that exposed skewed approaches while navigating the complexities and sensitivities of policing the ripples of the Israel-Gaza war and inflamed tensions in Birmingham. And above all, it laid bare how one of the country's leading police forces mishandled intelligence, neglected the discrimination faced by a minority community, and repeatedly misled security meetings, the public and MPs. It led to three apologies from West Midlands Police (WMP) before the resignation of chief constable Craig Guildford on Friday, after losing the confidence of the government and the local council leader. There was evasiveness from the moment WMP went public with the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in mid-October, having had since August to prepare for the match against Aston Villa. They couldn't immediately tell me whether it was imposed because of the threat posed by the Israelis or to the Israelis in Birmingham, with its strong contingent of pro-Palestinian activism. It took three weeks to provide answers denouncing Israelis as being too dangerous to allow into Villa Park, which became central to the multiple investigations that forced out Mr Guildford. What chief superintendent Tom Joyce told me remains the only interview in which WMP explained the need to exclude Maccabi fans from the Europa League match on 6 November. The key context was this: Maccabi went into the match without any pending or recent sanctions for fan misconduct by UEFA - the competition organisers who usually impose fan bans. But a section of the Maccabi fan base was filmed engaging in violence in Amsterdam in 2024 and chanting anti-Palestinian racist abuse. That required WMP to contact their Dutch counterparts, who also informed them of the antisemitic violence by locals in Amsterdam, hunting down and kicking Maccabi supporters, leading to the only five convictions. Maccabi CEO Jack Angelides did admit to Sky News: \"There are elements in the club that are not in line with our values, our morals.\" But he was furious at \"falsehoods\" being peddled while lacking an explanation from the police for the ban. It came from Mr Joyce telling Sky News: \"It is exclusively a decision we made on the basis of the behaviour of a sub-section of Maccabi fans.\" He revealed that while the \"threat\" to Maccabi fans was a \"consideration\", it was \"not the primary driver\". Instead, he said, the fact was that \"there is a section of Maccabi fans, not all Maccabi fans, but a section who engage in quite significant levels of hooliganism\". Some pro-Palestinian activists who might otherwise challenge the word of authorities took that as validation of their concerns, while for Jewish groups it deepened fears around antisemitism. Even without away fans, the scale of the police operation at the match itself - with reinforcements brought in from across the country - showed why the easiest option for WMP was to advocate for no Israelis. There were still arrests for discriminatory abuse by activists who gathered outside in support and opposition of Israel. The only heated moments seemed to be from frustrated Villa fans being delayed from getting in. Mr Joyce had approved signs saying \"Zionists not welcome\" - a reference to those backing the existence of the Jewish state of Israel. When asked if there could be signs saying another nationality was not welcome in an area of Birmingham, he said: \"Our understanding is that they don't quite contravene hate crime.\" Such neglect of the concerns of the Jewish community - at a time of heightened antisemitism - explains why MPs on the Home Affairs select committee started investigating the original decision, officially taken by Birmingham City Council's Safety Advisory Group on police advice. Media, including Sky News, also probed how the decision was reached. Dutch police disputed the accuracy of how their Birmingham counterparts used information about the 2024 unrest in Amsterdam, with clear contradictions only able to be highlighted due to leaked WMP documents. WMP's intelligence assessment claimed that Maccabi fans apparently intentionally targeted Muslim communities in Amsterdam, but the Dutch force told me: \"We did not see large groups of Maccabi's (fans) going into Muslim populated areas to target Muslims.\" Claims that Maccabi fans threw \"innocent members of the public into the river\" were also not endorsed by the Dutch. The statement from the Amsterdam Police in full But there was one glaring error that was exposed by fact-checking and took more than a month for police to apologise for - the existence in the intelligence report of a previous Maccabi match in England against West Ham that never existed. They insisted it did not come from tapping into an AI tool but from a Google search, only to admit this week it was spewed out unverified by Microsoft's Copilot system. Another apology came from assistant chief constable Mike O'Hara, telling MPs in December that the Jewish community in Birmingham backed banning Maccabi fans. But Sky News obtained minutes of the SAG meeting the day the ban was imposed that showed officers knew: \"Jewish community groups have expressed concern that banning away fans could be perceived as antisemitic, rather than a public safety decision. \"This perception could undermine trust and increase reputational risk for authorities and the club.\" Mr Guildford did later apologise, writing to MPs to say: \"There was never any intention to mislead whatsoever.\" But the initial report from the body that polices the police, the chief inspectorate, was damning. The 11-page letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said there was \"confirmation bias\" by the police to justify the ban. It concluded that officers overstated the threat posed by Maccabi fans and underplayed the threat to them. West Midlands Police did have \"high confidence intelligence\" that members of the local community in Birmingham were planning to arm themselves to attack Maccabi supporters. That was received in the first week of September but only revealed publicly last week via MPs. Still, for Ayoub Khan, the MP for Aston who pushed for the ban, the danger always came from Maccabi fans. For him, the injustice is Mr Guilford going for protecting the community, insisting there was no \"malign intent\". But for Jews grieving after the deadly terror attack on a Manchester synagogue in October, it reinforced concerns Britain could not protect the community. Or would not do enough to. This is a policing scandal about a match that went far beyond football. And while the government hopes Mr Guildford's exit rebuilds \"trust and confidence in the force\", it could only be the start, with more investigation reports to come from MPs and the police watchdogs."

        "Content": "Venezuela's opposition leader said she is \"confident\" Nicolas Maduro's \"criminal\" regime will be dismantled and free elections will be held. Speaking in the US on Friday, a day after giving her Nobel Peace Prize to US President Donald Trump, Maria Corina Machado told reporters \"I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition\" to elections. \"Venezuela is going to be free,\" she said at the Heritage Foundation, before adding that it would take time. She then said that she felt a \"criminal structure\" had dominated Venezuela for years and that it would eventually dismantle itself. Since the US military's capture of Maduro and his wife to face charges in New York on 3 January, Mr Trump has backed current vice president Delcy Rodriguez to lead the country. Ms Machado, whose movement was widely seen as the winner of a 2024 election, which saw widespread allegations of corruption in favour of the president, insisted her remarks have \"nothing to do with tension or relations between Delcy Rodriguez and myself\" at the news conference. Despite this, she then called Ms Rodriguez a \"communist,\" said she was afraid of Mr Trump, and said she controls a \"repressive\" system but not the military, making her position unsustainable. \n                  Is Trump about to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis?\n                 \n                  Venezuela's Machado gave Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal in pursuit of a greater prize\n                 \n                  Cilia Flores: Maduro's wife and power behind his regime\n                 In a post on Truth Social after their meeting, Mr Trump said that Ms Machado was a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\" and that giving him her Nobel was \"a wonderful gesture of mutual respect\". However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during the visit that Mr Trump stood by his \"realistic\" assessment that she did not currently have the support needed to lead Venezuela in the short term. And as Ms Machado met the president on Thursday, CIA director John Ratcliffe flew to Caracas and met Ms Rodriguez, the highest-level known US visit since the toppling of Maduro. It comes as the Norwegian Nobel Committee said the Peace Prize remains Ms Machado's despite her giving it to Mr Trump. \"Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,\" the award body said in a statement. \"There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money,\" it added. \"This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items.\" Read more from Sky News:Uganda election descends into deadly violenceUK position 'of destructive nature', says Russia It also comes as Venezuela's defence minister confirmed that 47 Venezuelan soldiers were killed in US strike on Caracas on 3 January."

        "Content": "At least seven people have been killed as Uganda's presidential election descended into violence, with the opposition party saying their leader had been forcibly taken away. Posting on X, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party said an army helicopter landed in Bobi Wine's compound, before taking him away to an unknown destination. The Ugandan government has denied the NUP's claims. The chair of national strategic communications committee in Uganda said Bobi Wine and his wife are \"safely in their home\" and under the protection of police. The country's elections this month have been marred by clashes and look set to extend President Yoweri Museveni's rule ⁠into a fifth decade. Police claim that in the early hours of last night, machete-wielding \"goons\" were shot dead by security forces in the central town of Butambala. Those killed were supporters of Bobi Wine - who is trailing in the polls and looks set for a landslide defeat. Authorities claim the mob had attacked a polling station and a police station at around 3am. Local police spokesperson Lydia Tumushabe said the armed group \"came in big numbers\" and security forces had acted in self defence. \"Police fired in self defence\", she told Reuters, adding that 25 people had been arrested. But supporters of Wine dispute the narrative. MP Muwanga Kivumbi argues that those killed were unarmed and shot dead inside his house. He described the scenes as a \"massacre\" - claiming the number of people killed was as high as 10. Read more from Sky News:Man jailed for murdering wife and childTeen plotted Stockport-style attack Mr Kivumbi said: \"There were people inside the garage who were waiting for the results to celebrate my victory. \"They broke the front door and began shooting inside the garage. \"It was a massacre.\" He said security forces had earlier dispersed crowds outside but disputed the police's assertion that the deaths occurred outdoors. It is still unknown exactly how many were killed, nor have the circumstances of their deaths been verified. Africa correspondent Votes are being counted in Uganda today and the capital Kampala feels like a war-zone. There's a full military deployment in the city - we've seen people targeted and tracked down by snatch squads. This is what people have been telling us they're worried about - in the process of their votes being counted, there would be suppression. All around us there are these billboards of President Museveni's face and his campaign slogan: \"Protecting the gains\". It marks a violent end to an election campaign that has been plagued by allegations of voter suppression. Sky's Africa correspondent Yousra Elbagir reported seeing snatch squads picking people up and bundling them into the back of armoured trucks as people registered their vote. Images show heavily armed security forces as they patrol the capital of Kampala. Litter is strewn across the street and officers can be seen watching on as fires rage across the city. Meanwhile, Museveni looks set to cling onto power. Preliminary results announced by the electoral commission showed he was set for a landslide with more than 75% of votes. Wine, who was a popular singer before entering politics, trails on around 21%. He has alleged mass fraud during the election, which took place under an internet blackout. His party, the ​NUP posted to X late on Thursday that the government was \"effectively placing him under house arrest\" after beating him at the polls - something national police said they were unaware of. Museveni told reporters after casting his ballot on Thursday that he expected to win with 80% of the vote \"if there's no cheating\". The dictator seized power in 1986 after a bloody civil war and has held on to power since."

        "Content": "The chief constable of West Midlands Police (WMP) is to retire following a row over the force's decision to ban Israeli football fans from a match in Birmingham for safety reasons. Craig Guildford will step down with immediate effect, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said on Friday. \"In doing so, he has acted with honour and in the best interests of West Midlands Police and our region. I welcome his decision,\" Mr Foster said. Mr Guildford said after his retirement was announced that the \"political and media frenzy\" around his position had become \"detrimental\" to the force. His decision comes after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she did not have confidence in the police chief, following his force's controversial ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from a Europa League tie against Aston Villa at Villa Park in November. On Wednesday, Ms Mahmood said: \"We have witnessed a failure of leadership that has harmed the reputation of and eroded public confidence in West Midlands police, and policing more broadly.\" After it was announced that Mr Guildford would retire, the home secretary welcomed the move and said he had \"done the right thing\". \"I would like to acknowledge his years of service. And I pay tribute to the work of the officers in West Midlands Police, who keep their community safe every day,\" Ms Mahmood said. \"Today marks a crucial first step to rebuilding trust and confidence in the force amongst all the communities they serve.\" But Villa Park MP Ayoub Khan criticised Mr Guildford's retirement in a statement, saying it was \"one of the greatest injustices of our time\", a chief constable was \"sacrificed not for failure, but for doing his duty\". He added Mr Guildford is \"a public servant [who was] ousted for protecting the people of Birmingham and refusing to play politics; a police commander removed for judging the Maccabi Tel Aviv ultras not on their faith or nationality, but on the storied history of violence, racism and thuggery that showed the content of their character\". On Wednesday, Mr Guildford had apologised to MPs for giving them \"erroneous\" evidence about the ban. He revealed that WMP's citing of a fictional match to justify the ban was down to the force's use of AI, something Mr Guildford had previously denied to MPs. The force, which has been accused of misrepresenting the threat posed by the Maccabi fans to justify its ban, also apologised last month for telling MPs that members of the Jewish community had backed its decision, admitting there was \"no documented feedback\" to support the claim. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch were among those who criticised the decision to ban away fans from attending the Israeli side's match in the UK's second-largest city on 6 November. Sir Keir was said to be \"angered\" by the decision, while Ms Badenoch went further and said Mr Guildford's position was \"untenable\", and claimed he had \"capitulated to Islamists and then collaborated with them to cover it up\". \"West Midlands Police have been subjected to, understandable, intense and significant oversight and scrutiny as a consequence of events that led to the recommendation it made\" to the Birmingham City Council Safety Advisory Group to ban the fans, Mr Foster acknowledged on Friday. Read more from Sky News:Why Maccabi fans were bannedSerious question about one of UK's biggest cities He said WMP had received a letter from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, which \"set out significant preliminary concerns and shortcomings in relation to preparation and planning\" by the force. Deputy Chief Constable Scott Green has been appointed as WMP's acting chief constable, Mr Foster said. \"We have already met, to discuss the actions that the force must take to rebuild trust and confidence amongst all the people and communities of the West Midlands, including addressing the significant matters identified in the letter from HMIC,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n What led to the downfall of the chief of West Midlands Police goes beyond a football match and the exclusion of a fan base. It is a scandal that exposed skewed approaches while navigating the complexities and sensitivities of policing the ripples of the Israel-Gaza war and inflamed tensions in Birmingham. And above all, it laid bare how one of the country's leading police forces mishandled intelligence, neglected the discrimination faced by a minority community, and repeatedly misled security meetings, the public and MPs. It led to three apologies from West Midlands Police (WMP) before the resignation of chief constable Craig Guildford on Friday, after losing the confidence of the government and the local council leader. There was evasiveness from the moment WMP went public with the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in mid-October, having had since August to prepare for the match against Aston Villa. They couldn't immediately tell me whether it was imposed because of the threat posed by the Israelis or to the Israelis in Birmingham, with its strong contingent of pro-Palestinian activism. It took three weeks to provide answers denouncing Israelis as being too dangerous to allow into Villa Park, which became central to the multiple investigations that forced out Mr Guildford. What chief superintendent Tom Joyce told me remains the only interview in which WMP explained the need to exclude Maccabi fans from the Europa League match on 6 November. The key context was this: Maccabi went into the match without any pending or recent sanctions for fan misconduct by UEFA - the competition organisers who usually impose fan bans. But a section of the Maccabi fan base was filmed engaging in violence in Amsterdam in 2024 and chanting anti-Palestinian racist abuse. That required WMP to contact their Dutch counterparts, who also informed them of the antisemitic violence by locals in Amsterdam, hunting down and kicking Maccabi supporters, leading to the only five convictions. Maccabi CEO Jack Angelides did admit to Sky News: \"There are elements in the club that are not in line with our values, our morals.\" But he was furious at \"falsehoods\" being peddled while lacking an explanation from the police for the ban. It came from Mr Joyce telling Sky News: \"It is exclusively a decision we made on the basis of the behaviour of a sub-section of Maccabi fans.\" He revealed that while the \"threat\" to Maccabi fans was a \"consideration\", it was \"not the primary driver\". Instead, he said, the fact was that \"there is a section of Maccabi fans, not all Maccabi fans, but a section who engage in quite significant levels of hooliganism\".

        "Content": "Proposed compensation for victims of \"unethical testing\" at a college, leaving them with HIV and hepatitis, has been branded \"ridiculous\" by a charity. Between the 1970s and early 1990s more than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis after being given contaminated blood and blood products in what was dubbed the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. More than £2bn has now been paid in compensation to victims of the infected blood scandal. However, a charity has raised \"profound concerns\" about an element of the payouts for people who were victims of \"unethical research\". Pupils at the Lord Mayor's Treloar's College in Hampshire, who were undergoing haemophilia treatment, were also experimented on without their knowledge by NHS clinicians, who knew the dangers it posed. The Infected Blood Public Inquiry's report, published in May 2024, found that boys with the disorder who attended the school were treated as \"objects for research\" and were given \"multiple, riskier\" treatments. They have been offered a one-off £15,000 payment on top of ongoing support, with a £10,000 award available for others in similar, less notorious cases. Changes to the payment are currently under public consultation. Gary Webster was one of 122 children with haemophilia who attended the Lord Mayor's Treloar's College in Hampshire between the 1970s and early 1980s. He was infected with HIV and hepatitis C. Of those who attended the college with the condition, he said that more than 80 are now dead. In response to the compensation offer, he said the sum is \"way off the mark,\" and added: \"How can you offer £25,000 to someone who's been experimented and researched on, and most of the time killed? \"It's just ridiculous. It has to be a lot more than what they are offering.\" Infected blood scandal: The Treloar's School pupils who 'lost everything'  Mr Webster also told the PA news agency that \"we were forced, basically to have injections every day\". \"At the time, we didn't know,\" he added. \"We were eight, nine, 10, years old - and we just thought the doctors, who were our friends, who used to come and play sports with us in the evening, we thought they were doing good for us. \"Our parents had no knowledge of anything.\" Charity raises 'profound concerns' to minister The Hepatitis C Trust has also written to Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds to \"express our profound concerns regarding the proposed compensation\" for the victims - saying the sums are \"wholly inadequate\". \"We are very concerned that the current proposals fall far short of delivering justice and risk sending a dangerous message about the value of human life and the integrity of public institutions in the UK,\" the charity said in a letter. \"You are more than aware of the immense suffering of the victims of what has been termed 'unethical research' - people, most of whom were children, who were deliberately given blood products known to be contaminated with HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. \"This was not an accident; it was a conscious decision by medical professionals.\" Read more:Blood scandal compensation scheme widenedVictims 'scared they won't live to see compensation'  Signatories, including the charity, and other members of the infected blood community, called for the award to be \"fully and transparently reviewed\". The letter also raised concerns over delays to a potential criminal investigation into the scandal, referring to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), saying it instigated a review after the inquiry published its report. In December, the police council said that the review is \"ongoing\". \"(The NPCC) give no timeline for completion,\" the letter added. \"This delay compounds the injustice and erodes public trust.\" When approached for comment, Treloar's College pointed Sky News to a previous statement in May 2025. \"We would like to reiterate the call we made at that time to implement compensation plans without further delay,\" it said at the time. It added: \"The Inquiry's report laid bare the full extent of this horrifying national scandal. We are deeply saddened that some of our former pupils were so tragically infected and their families affected, and we share our former students' frustration with the time it is taking for compensation to be paid.\" A government spokesperson said: \"The suffering endured by all those subjected to unethical medical research is profound, and we remain committed to ensuring that justice is not only delivered but reflected in the way compensation is treated. \"This is why uplifts to the Autonomy awards will be made available through the supplementary route to recognise the suffering of victims subjected to unethical research practices. \"This award is just one part of the overall compensation package available. \"We encourage the community to respond to the government's consultation before January 22, which seeks respondents' feedback on different ways of designing and calculating the award to reflect unethical research practices.\""

She described his acts as \"wicked\" and \"callous\", and said Rhodes murdered his wife in the \"most brutal way\" with \"significant force\", adding that his actions showed \"significant premeditation and planning\". The 52-year-old carpenter from Withleigh, Devon, was convicted of murdering his estranged wife, Dawn Rhodes, by slitting her throat with a knife at their family home in Redhill, Surrey, in June 2016. He was previously found not guilty after a trial at the Old Bailey in 2017, where he convinced jurors that he had acted in self-defence during an argument. Police started to seriously doubt these claims when the couple's child came forward with new evidence in 2021, initially disclosed in therapy, that Rhodes had killed their mother and that they were involved in the murder too. The child, who was under the age of 10 at the time of the murder, told Surrey Police they had been coerced into helping Rhodes kill her, and that they were manipulated by their father into lying about the true version of events. The child's new testimony meant Rhodes's acquittal was quashed in November 2024, and permission was granted for a rare retrial in 2025, where the jury unanimously found him guilty of murdering Dawn Rhodes. After more than 22 hours of deliberation, Robert Rhodes was also found guilty of child cruelty, perverting the course of justice, and two counts of perjury. Previously, a person could not be retried for the same offence after being cleared. But the double jeopardy law in England and Wales changed in 2005 to allow a second trial for the most serious of offences, including murder, if new and compelling evidence came to light after a verdict. Child addresses court Speaking in court, the child said \"the traumatic experience\" they were put through \"can never go away\". \"The scar Robert Rhodes left me with when he sliced open my forearm will never go away,\" they added, saying the scar was a \"constant reminder\" of what their father did to them. The child described having to testify against their own father as a \"heartbreaking process\", adding their mother \"deserved justice for the agony she was put through\". \"On that evening Robert Rhodes not only murdered my mother but he took my dad away from me as well,\" they added. The double jeopardy rule is a legal principle that prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime after they have been acquitted or convicted.  It's a protection for that person from harassment. However, the law permits a retrial where someone was acquitted of a serious offence, but new and compelling evidence has since come to light which indicates the person might actually be guilty.  In this case, the new evidence from the child was compelling enough for the Court of Appeal to quash the acquittal and a retrial to take place. \n Crucially, the child's evidence was so compelling that the Court of Appeal agreed Rhodes needed to be tried again. The retrial at Inner London Crown Court heard how the plot to kill involved the child - who cannot be named for legal reasons - telling their mother that they had drawn her a picture. She was then told to close her eyes and hold out her hands, before the child left the room, and Rhodes came in to murder her. On 2 June 2016, police found Dawn Rhodes lying on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood with her throat cut to the extent that all the structures in her neck had been severed. During the retrial, eight years later, the court heard how the marriage had been in difficulty prior to Dawn Rhodes's death, and Robert Rhodes had filed for a divorce. Both Robert Rhodes and the child were found with knife wounds at the scene, which were initially claimed to have been inflicted in an attack by Dawn Rhodes at the original trial. Robert Rhodes said they were injured after she \"flipped like the Hulk\" during a row at their family home. At the second trial, jurors heard that these wounds were actually part of a \"cover-up\", to make it look like the pair had sustained self-defence wounds. After he killed his wife, Rhodes self-inflicted two wounds to his scalp before instructing the child to inflict two more on his back. He then cut his own child's arm so deeply that it required stitches under general anaesthetic. The child was under the age of criminal responsibility at the time, and holds no criminal responsibility for their role in the attack. 2 June 2016 - Dawn Rhodes killed 5 June 2016 - Robert Rhodes charged with murder 2 May 2017 - first trial begins 30 May 2017 - not guilty verdict 18 November 2021 - child gives therapist new account Late November 2021 - police reopen case 4 June 2024 - Robert Rhodes rearrested and charged the next day 7 November 2024 - Rhodes's acquittal quashed  2 October 2025 - second trial begins 12 December 2025 - Rhodes is found guilty of murder They told police that during supervised contact with Rhodes in 2016 and 2017, while he was on bail after being charged with murder, he had told them that they had \"got some things wrong\" and continued to give them instructions to stick to the plan. Rhodes even hid a phone at his mother's house for when the child visited, on which he would leave messages for the child, reminding them about the agreement they had."

        "Content": "A former Tory councillor has been jailed for 20 weeks after being found guilty of stalking ex-cabinet minister Dame Penny Mordaunt. Edward Brandt, 61, was found guilty of the offence in November following a trial at Southampton Crown Court, but was acquitted of the more serious offence of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the former Conservative cabinet minister said: \"I am completely exhausted due to the stress, every time I step out of the building I am looking over my shoulder and checking to see if he is there. \"I am living in a constant fear of a confrontation. It's hugely impacted all aspects of my life, both my professional life and personal life, and I cannot stress enough how much I am exhausted by it.\" The court previously heard Dame Penny believed Brandt was a \"real threat\" and feared \"sexual violence\" because of his \"creepy\" behaviour. The trial was told that Brandt sent at least 17 emails and three phone messages to Dame Penny, as well as turning up at her Portsmouth constituency office out of hours between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024. Brandt, who lived on the Isle of Wight at the time, failed to comply with the terms of a conditional caution issued in April 2024, which required him to complete a victim awareness course and not to contact Dame Penny, the trial heard. 'I am not giving up' The divorced father of two then left two voicemail messages for her on 6 and 10 May, and in one of the messages, he said: \"I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.\" Sentencing Brandt, Judge William Mousley KC said: \"I am satisfied that there is a real risk of you reoffending or causing harm to other people.\" He said it was clear that Brandt's behaviour had a \"very significant and enduring impact\" on Dame Penny. Read more from Sky News:Uganda election descends into deadly violenceWest Midlands Police chief retires after Maccabi fan ban row Brandt, who had worked as a professional sailor and used to be a Tory councillor for East Hampshire District Council, told the court that he wanted to shake Dame Penny's hand, and that his intention was \"entirely political and entirely harmless\". He was also sentenced for seven breaches of a stalking protection order in December 2025 by failing to notify police of devices capable of connecting to the internet and of the creation of accounts on Facebook and Snapchat. The stalking protection order is in place until November 2034. Brandt was handed 12 weeks in jail over the stalking offence and another eight to serve consecutively for the breaches of the order."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Wholesale natural gas prices have risen by more than 40% this month as a raft of pressures, described by one analyst as a \"perfect storm\", threaten to raise energy bills ahead. Day-ahead prices for UK delivery were at a six-month high on Friday, a rise of more than 14% on the day, as contracts across Europe rose according to LSEG data. Europe has witnessed a price spike this year as cold weather and low gas storage levels combined with slowing deliveries of liquified natural gas (LNG), mainly from the US. Money latest: The area where £10m lottery prize is unclaimed Contracts for the coming months also rose sharply. The UK February delivery price was more than 8 pence per therm higher on the day at more than 98p. Gas Infrastructure Europe data suggested that storage levels were at just 52% capacity. \n                  South East Water restores supply to homes in Kent and Sussex after week of chaos \n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 \n                  British Gas parent company boss 'happy to pay more' tax for bills to go down\n                 A relatively quiet start to the European winter saw natural gas costs in early January fall to their lowest level since stocks were being replenished late last spring. But colder weather across northern Europe has prompted a spike in use and given rise to fears that supplies are vulnerable due to the LNG squeeze, partly blamed on shipments diverting to Asia, where costs are often higher. Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management, said the market had been hit by a \"perfect storm\" of cold weather forecasts, depleting ‌storage, geopolitical risk in Iran and speculative trading activity that had seen short positions closed. Long-range forecasts suggest a plunge in temperatures towards the end of the month, with lower wind speeds exacerbating the situation as green infrastructure would be unable to fill the void despite record capacity. Data from the National Energy System Operator showed electricity from gas-fired power was responsible for 36% of UK provision, followed closely by wind, on Thursday. The recent national cold snap saw the figure for gas climb well above 50% across four days. A prolonged price spike for wholesale gas would be expected to be reflected in future household energy bills. Current fixed rate deals could rise before the next energy price cap review is due to take effect at the beginning of April. The government says that eradicating gas price volatility is a major reason behind its push for a renewables-based energy system. This week saw a record offshore wind auction completed, leaving the country on track to meet its 2030 clean power goals. But an 11% increase in the so-called strike price means that the cost of achieving those ambitions has also gone up. Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"Following years of price volatility that have left... households with debt and industry with billions of extra costs, it’s a reminder that the price of gas is largely set by the actions of foreign actors, beyond our control. \"The North Sea is continuing to run out of gas and won't help to lower bills or provide security of supply. The latest renewables auction this week secured a record amount of offshore wind, which will cut our need for gas and so stabilise prices and shield households from future gas price spikes. Wind cut the wholesale day-ahead electricity price by around a third in 2025.\""

I'd rather I was left to grieve, but I'm stuck in a tunnel and I can't get out.\" Liam Walsh's daughter Maia died three years ago. She was 13 when she was found unresponsive. Noah Gibson, just 11 years old, had passed away just months before, on 9 December 2021. He was found by his brother in his bedroom. His sister tried to help mum, Louise Gibson, to resuscitate him. They couldn't. \"When I was checking Noah's phone, I was looking for messages from school friends. I was looking for bullying. \"I never thought to check social media to see what he'd been looking at,\" said Louise. Three more families were torn apart in similar circumstances, within months of each other. Jools was 14. He'd spent the entire day mucking about at home with his friends, but an hour after they fell laughing and joking out of the front door, he was found unresponsive by his mum, Ellen Roome. Archie was 12. He was planning to go to the cinema with mum Hollie Dance later that day. Instead, her \"pranky, happy\" son was found unresponsive and after four months on life-support, he died. Isaac, an \"August baby\" who loved to be the joker, was 13. His mum, Lisa Kenevan, found him unresponsive and again tried to resuscitate him. When the police took away his devices, they found videos apparently recorded through TikTok (but not posted) showing Isaac pointing to his neck and laughing. All five parents believe their children died attempting a dangerous stunt known as the blackout challenge. It's a stunt that has been doing the rounds for decades and is banned on mainstream social media apps, including TikTok, because it is so dangerous. But the parents believe their children saw the challenge on TikTok - although they don't have proof. TikTok says the data around what their children were watching has likely been deleted under data privacy rules. The group of bereaved parents are suing TikTok in the US for wrongful death, a process that may see them find out what happened to their children, if that data can be recovered. Their first hearing is on Friday. Since the parents began campaigning for better rights and protections around young people online, TikTok has always said the blackout challenge never trended on its platform. It's been banned on there since 2020. \"Boredom set in through the COVID times. And I think this is what triggered [Isaac's] brain to think, 'Yeah, let's give it a go, why not everyone else has survived, I'll be fine',\" says Lisa. \"Unfortunately, this day on 8 March, he did this act and 9 March, he's no longer here. \"How the hell do you, as a parent, get your head around that.\" For all of them, the campaign to find out what happened to their children has put grief on hold. \"You're not allowed to grieve. You haven't started to grieve,\" says Hollie. \"You have that initial grief, that initial shock but when you don't know what happened to your child, it's very hard to find closure or come to any kind of sense about it all.\" Two of the parents, Ellen and Liam, only had one child. For them, this battle is all-consuming. They're scared about what happens when it ends. \"What happens when we get to the end?\" asks Ellen. \"What's our purpose? Because I'm no longer a parent. I don't have a purpose. \"I no longer have my job. I no longer have a partner. I no longer have a child. So when I get to end of this, then what happens?\" Liam wishes it could have been simpler but he won't stop pushing to discover what happened. \"My daughter deserves better than this, than to be [brushed] under the carpet without an investigation into why she's died, and her family deserves much more than this too. \"I've often thought to myself, if she'd just fallen over and hit her head, you'd just know that's what had happened.\" \"I'd rather not do this. I'd rather I was left to grieve, but I'm stuck in a tunnel and I can't get out.\" The parents' first hearing will involve an attempt by TikTok to have their action dismissed. The company says they're being sued in the wrong place because the harm occurred in the UK. TikTok told Sky News: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families. We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us.\""

        "Content": "By Duncan Gardham, Security journalist  A teenager who was inspired by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana  has been sentenced after he planned an attack on an Oasis concert.  McKenzie Morgan, from the village of Llanfrechfa near Cwmbran in South Wales, can be named for the first time after he turned 18. He has been detained for 14 months after admitting at the Old Bailey to possessing a document useful for terrorism. Morgan had talked of emulating Axel Rudakubana who killed three girls aged six, seven and nine, during a knife attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class during the summer holidays in July 2024. Morgan, who was aged 17 at the time and living with his parents, conducted research into obtaining large knives and, in a chat with a friend on April 19 last year, sent an image of a large knife for sale online saying, \"would this work?\". Police found a note saved on the youth's phone on April 28 headed \"places to attack\". It included images of the Dance Stars Academy near his home, along with directions on how to walk there, taking 31 minutes. Location data on his phone suggested that he had been close to the school a few days earlier. He had also researched other potential targets, including his own school, and told others on Snapchat of a plan to attack the first Oasis reunion concert on July 4 in Cardiff. Read more from Sky News:Parents take TikTok to courtLabour MPs anticipate social media ban U-turn His Snapchat account used a misspelled version of Rudakubana's name and he had researched the killer, saving images of him with words added that mocked the victims. He had participated in discussions with other teenagers on Snapchat in which he praised Rudakubana, who was also aged 17, and said he wanted to participate in a similar \"terrorist-style\" attack. In one chat Morgan said he had tried to make ricin poison - the same substance manufactured by Rudakubana - although he later told police that was not true. One of those he was talking to on Snapchat reported him to the police. His family also became concerned and booked him in for an appointment with a counsellor on June 2, during which he said he planned to commit a \"Rudakubana-style attack\", leading to a second report to the police. At around 10.30am the same day, following the appointment, he researched knives and transferred an al-Qaeda manual between phones. Morgan was arrested the same day for making threats to kill and released on bail while his phone was examined. He was re-arrested on June 19 and told police that he did not really mean what he was saying. Interviewed by police, he said he was unhappy, had suicidal thoughts and thoughts of launching attacks on a regular basis but did not intend to carry them through. He said he had failed to purchase a knife because he could not prove he was over 18 and his mother had hidden the kitchen knives. Morgan is second teenager to face charges after trying to copy Rudakubana He is the second teenager to face charges after seeking to copy the Southport killer. Neither youth was charged with preparing a terrorist attack which would carry a potential life sentence for an adult and are instead charged with the lesser offence of possession of a document. Earlier this month a 16-year-old teenager from Merseyside who planned to copy the Southport killer by attacking a Taylor Swift-themed event wearing a green hoodie pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. He had visited Southport and taken pictures of the area, collected knives, researched a Taylor Swift-themed event and downloaded the same al-Qaeda manual used by Rudakubana to produce the poison ricin. He was only arrested in August after making a 999 call to police to tell them what he was planning. Morgan indicated a guilty plea to a single charge of possessing a document useful for terrorism at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 21. He accepts that he had a copy of the 188-page al-Qaeda Training Manual, the same document found in the possession of the Southport killer, on his phone. He also had three similar documents of varying lengths which contained extracts of the same information, along with individual pages from the same document with instructions that included how to stab someone. The documents, which had been accessed on numerous occasions, also included instructions on how to make explosives, a recipe for the poison ricin and details of how the terrorist group is structured. Morgan told police he had only sent the messages because he was \"bored\" and was being bullied at school. He added that he had sent the manual to other people online at random but had deleted his Snapchat account shortly before his arrest. No winners from Morgan case say counter terror police  Sentencing Morgan on Friday, Judge Sarah Whitehouse KC imposed a criminal behaviour order to supervise him on his release from 14 months youth detention and a further year on licence. She he was a danger to himself and \"vulnerable to being bullied, groomed and radicalised\". Detective Superintendent Andrew Williams, from Counter Terrorism Policing Wales, said: \"Mr Morgan was not born bad... \"As a teenager himself when he committed the offence, he was vulnerable to the malign influences that pray on our young people in today's online world.\"The fact that he was heavily influenced by the perpetrator of one of the most horrific attacks this country has seen in recent times, is a terrifying indictment of the abhorrent commentary, hateful opinion and violent imagery that too many of our young people are exposed to via the myriad of online sites, chat forums, and gaming and social media platforms.\" He added: \"There are no winners today, just a sense of sadness that highlights the need for us as a society to grip this issue and finally stop our young people being exploited in this way.\""

Men driving Boda Boda motorcycle taxis express their discontent from across the street before nearby gunfire drives them off. Drivers yell \"people power!\" from their cars, one of the rallying cries of opposition leader Bobi Wine. One man holds firm on the side of the road to express himself, saying: \"Right now, people are voting for Bobi Wine. He has been cheated of his vote!\" A large billboard of Mr Museveni hovers above this chaos. His election campaign slogan, \"protecting the gains\", feels violently literal. The military forces targeting the supporters of his main opponent are led by his son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the head of the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF) and, to many, his heir apparent. All of this unfolded before Bobi Wine's National Unity Party (NUP) announced that security agents had broken into his home, an army helicopter landed in his compound and abducted him on Friday night. The Ugandan government has denied the NUP's claims. The chair of national strategic communications committee in Uganda said Bobi Wine and his wife are \"safely in their home\" and under the protection of police.

The stand-off between his supporters and the state earlier in the day was mirrored by a feverish brawl in Kampala's Kololo tally centre after a disputed declaration of vote counts, handing wins to Mr Museveni. \"I have the right to speak! I have the right to speak,\" an opposition party official yells into the face of the ruling party's stern agents backed by the military and police flooding the counting tent. The screams of objection from a member of Wine's party spill out of the counting tent: \"We want our win! This is a protesting vote! We want our win! They are protecting the criminals.\" The military and police close in on him and violently drag him on to a police truck. He joins 300 other supporters, and officials that the NUP says have been arrested and disappeared in recent weeks. A fellow NUP member, 23-year-old university student Elizabeth Namagembe, is breathless from frustration. \"We have Ugandans that have voted and this is their right to choose a leader,\" she tells us in tears outside the tent with soldiers and police standing watch behind her. \"The international community, what can they do for us? Because us Ugandans have come out to fight - we have voted, and we have requested no violence.\""

        "Content": "More than 100 people have been killed after torrential rain caused flooding across South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, with authorities issuing warnings that more severe weather is expected across several countries in southern Africa. In central and southern Mozambique, more than 200,000 people have been affected, thousands of homes damaged and tens of thousands of people were facing evacuation, the World Food Programme said. About 173,000 acres of crops, including staples such as rice and corn, have been left waterlogged. At least 103 people have died there, following an unusually severe rainy season since late last year, the country's Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction said on Friday. People have perished by drowning in rising waters or in collapsing infrastructure, while others have died from catching cholera or being electrocuted by lightning strikes, the institute said. Zimbabwean officials have said at least 70 people have died there, with more than 1,000 homes destroyed in heavy rains this year and infrastructure, including schools, roads and bridges, has collapsed. In two northern provinces of South Africa, Limpopo and Mpumalanga, at least 19 deaths have been reported following heavy rain that began last month and has caused severe flooding. On a visit to Limpopo on Thursday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said more than 15 inches (38cm) of rain had fallen in less than a week. He said he had been to an area where 36 houses \"have just been wiped away from the face of the Earth. Everything is gone... the roofs, the walls, the fences, everything\". Around 600 tourists and staff members have been evacuated by helicopter from camps to high-lying areas in the famous Kruger National Park, according to spokesperson Reynold Thakhuli. He could not immediately say how many people there were in the park, while the parks agency said precautions were being taken and no deaths or injuries had been reported at Kruger. The park is closed to visitors as parts of it are inaccessible because of washed-out roads and bridges, South Africa's national parks agency said. The South African Weather Service issued a red-level 10 alert for parts of the country for Friday, warning of more heavy rain and flooding that poses a threat to lives and could cause widespread infrastructure damage. The South African army sent helicopters to rescue other people trapped on the roofs of their houses or in trees in the northern parts of the country, including border post and police officers stranded at a flooded checkpoint on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n Even though it's high summer in the Antarctic, the ocean around the Rothera research station is -1 Celsius. As some of the most productive oceans on the planet - a soup of microscopic plant and animal plankton - it's murky to boot. Not everyone's idea of the perfect scuba spot. But the divers I'm with seem positively excited about tipping themselves backwards into the depths. \"You can get these big starfish with 40 arms that you don't see anywhere else, they're my favourites,\" said Pati Glaz, a marine biologist with the dive team of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). For her dive partner, BAS marine biologist Matt Bell, it's \"polar gigantism\" that floats his boat. No, me neither. \n                  Is Antarctica a time bomb for Trump? \n                 \n                  Is America surrendering Antarctica to its rivals?\n                 \n                  Mad science or a last hope? The researchers trying to repair the climate\n                 It's the phenomenon, he patiently explains through a thick neoprene helmet, of species exclusive to cold polar oceans growing much larger than their cousins in warmer waters. The colder the water, the more oxygen it can carry, and the larger the animal you can grow. \"Because it's cold, the biology is very different,\" said Professor Lloyd Peck, who leads marine biology research at BAS. \"Things live a long time,\" he said. In a rapidly warming Antarctic, that's not necessarily a good thing. Animals down here live long, partly because they grow and reproduce slowly. An Antarctic starfish can take hundreds of days to reproduce compared to a few weeks for its cousins in the UK. Warm things up by just a degree or so, and their larvae hatch earlier, in the winter, say, when there's no food and no light. \"We're really worried that many species could fail because the timing of their cycles is changed in a very detrimental way, by just a small amount of warmth,\" said Prof Peck. The key strength of their dive research is they've been surveying the same sites on the seabed for nearly 30 years. Important, if you want to judge the winners and losers in an ecosystem that's already close to a degree warmer on average than when research here began. But diving in Antarctica is not without complications. As well as specialist dry suits and very thick gloves, before the divers go in, spotters on the surface to check for wildlife. Predatory leopard seals, common in these waters, prefer penguins. But their jaws are powerful enough to take a seal, or a similar-sized diver. Following a fatal encounter in 2003, if leopard seals or curious killer whales are spotted anywhere in the vicinity, before or during a dive, it's immediately aborted. After 20 minutes down, the divers return looking surprisingly warm and cheerful. They carry samples of wildlife to take to their laboratory aquarium. The warming in Antarctica gives a sense of urgency to the research. They're not just interested in understanding how marine ecosystems are coping with climate change. They want to use new techniques to understand sub-zero biology. Something that at a cellular and molecular level, science knows practically nothing about. \"If you take the cells of animals that live at warmer temperatures and you cool them down to zero degrees, they don't work,\" said Prof Peck. Biologists suspect there are many factors at play. But one of particular interest, is how proteins fold and stick together. Cool down a warm-water animal and its proteins stick together. A problem that evolution has obviously solved to allow life to exist in freezing oceans. \"Understanding why our animals don't have problems with their proteins sticking together will shed light on those mechanisms,\" said Prof Peck. And they may turn out to be very useful to medicine. Diseases like Alzheimer's and CJD are caused by proteins abnormally sticking together in the brain. Read more:Why Antarctica's underwater tsunamis are alarming scientistsIs America surrendering Antarctica to its rivals? Growing slowly, but healthily in a high-oxygen environment, could also shed light on the molecular basis of ageing in humans. His team have just begun a new collaboration with the University of Cambridge to develop microscopes capable of operating in sub-zero temperatures. Tools that will be able to explore below-freezing biology at a molecular level for the first time. Back on the dive boat, there are other reasons to be optimistic. Whales, once a rare sight at Rothera, are all around us. They count at least 30, possibly 40 humpback whales in the bay, a new record. Populations are recovering after the ban on whaling 40 years ago. Receding sea ice has also allowed whales swim here for the first time in millennia. How ocean ecosystems respond to warming is important. In the past, they absorbed so much carbon from the atmosphere that they helped usher in ice ages after periods in geological time when Antarctica was even warmer than today. Fossilised palm trees on the continent speak to that fact - one often championed by those sceptical of climate change. But Antarctica appears to be warming far faster than it did in aeons past; at a pace its slow, cold biology may struggle to match."

Posting on X, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party said an army helicopter landed in Bobi Wine's compound, before taking him away to an unknown destination. The Ugandan government has denied the NUP's claims. The chair of national strategic communications committee in Uganda said Bobi Wine and his wife are \"safely in their home\" and under the protection of police. The country's elections this month have been marred by clashes and look set to extend President Yoweri Museveni's rule ⁠into a fifth decade. Police claim that in the early hours of last night, machete-wielding \"goons\" were shot dead by security forces in the central town of Butambala. Those killed were supporters of Bobi Wine - who is trailing in the polls and looks set for a landslide defeat. Authorities claim the mob had attacked a polling station and a police station at around 3am. Local police spokesperson Lydia Tumushabe said the armed group \"came in big numbers\" and security forces had acted in self defence. \"Police fired in self defence\", she told Reuters, adding that 25 people had been arrested. But supporters of Wine dispute the narrative. MP Muwanga Kivumbi argues that those killed were unarmed and shot dead inside his house.

It is still unknown exactly how many were killed, nor have the circumstances of their deaths been verified. Africa correspondent Votes are being counted in Uganda today and the capital Kampala feels like a war-zone. There's a full military deployment in the city - we've seen people targeted and tracked down by snatch squads. This is what people have been telling us they're worried about - in the process of their votes being counted, there would be suppression. All around us there are these billboards of President Museveni's face and his campaign slogan: \"Protecting the gains\". It marks a violent end to an election campaign that has been plagued by allegations of voter suppression. Sky's Africa correspondent Yousra Elbagir reported seeing snatch squads picking people up and bundling them into the back of armoured trucks as people registered their vote. Images show heavily armed security forces as they patrol the capital of Kampala. Litter is strewn across the street and officers can be seen watching on as fires rage across the city. Meanwhile, Museveni looks set to cling onto power. Preliminary results announced by the electoral commission showed he was set for a landslide with more than 75% of votes. Wine, who was a popular singer before entering politics, trails on around 21%. He has alleged mass fraud during the election, which took place under an internet blackout. His party, the ​NUP posted to X late on Thursday that the government was \"effectively placing him under house arrest\" after beating him at the polls - something national police said they were unaware of. Museveni told reporters after casting his ballot on Thursday that he expected to win with 80% of the vote \"if there's no cheating\". The dictator seized power in 1986 after a bloody civil war and has held on to power since."

        "Content": "The former president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been sentenced to five years in prison on charges relating to his failed martial law declaration. Yoon was found guilty on Friday of mobilising the presidential ⁠security service to block authorities from executing an arrest warrant to investigate him over his imposition of martial law. The Seoul Central District Court also found Yoon guilty of fabricating official documents and failing to follow ​the legal process required for martial law, which must be discussed at a formal cabinet meeting. The ruling is the first in relation to criminal charges Yoon faces over his bid to impose martial law on 3 December 2024, which was reversed after six hours and saw him dismissed as president. \"The defendant abused his enormous influence as president to prevent the execution of legitimate warrants through officials from ‍the Security Service, which effectively privatised officials ... loyal to the Republic of Korea for personal safety and personal gain,\" the lead judge on the three-justice panel said. The judges also noted that Yoon had not shown remorse for his actions. Yoon has argued it was within his power as president to declare martial law and claimed the decision was a response to the danger of the liberal-controlled parliament obstructing his agenda. \n                  K-pop stars BTS reveal comeback tour after completing military service\n                 \n                  Woman jailed for blackmailing ex-Tottenham Hotspur footballer Son Heung-min with pregnancy claim\n                 \n                  South Korea: All 267 passengers and crew rescued from ferry that ran aground, says coastguard\n                 He also said he had not intended to place the Asian democracy under martial law for an extended period.

She was \"unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity\", with bulging eyes, dilated pupils and blood running from her left ear, according to the report. Paramedics treated Ms Good on the sidewalk before moving her to the street corner, away \"from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders\".

By 10.04am, the ICE agent who shot Ms Good had left the scene. The police report also described \"agitators\" in the crowd cutting crime tape, slashing tyres, throwing snow and ice \"at federal agents but not at MPD [Minneapolis Police Department]\".

Speaking in the US on Friday, a day after giving her Nobel Peace Prize to US President Donald Trump, Maria Corina Machado told reporters \"I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition\" to elections. \"Venezuela is going to be free,\" she said at the Heritage Foundation, before adding that it would take time. She then said that she felt a \"criminal structure\" had dominated Venezuela for years and that it would eventually dismantle itself. Since the US military's capture of Maduro and his wife to face charges in New York on 3 January, Mr Trump has backed current vice president Delcy Rodriguez to lead the country. Ms Machado, whose movement was widely seen as the winner of a 2024 election, which saw widespread allegations of corruption in favour of the president, insisted her remarks have \"nothing to do with tension or relations between Delcy Rodriguez and myself\" at the news conference.

However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during the visit that Mr Trump stood by his \"realistic\" assessment that she did not currently have the support needed to lead Venezuela in the short term. And as Ms Machado met the president on Thursday, CIA director John Ratcliffe flew to Caracas and met Ms Rodriguez, the highest-level known US visit since the toppling of Maduro. It comes as the Norwegian Nobel Committee said the Peace Prize remains Ms Machado's despite her giving it to Mr Trump. \"Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,\" the award body said in a statement. \"There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money,\" it added. \"This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items.\" Read more from Sky News:Uganda election descends into deadly violenceUK position 'of destructive nature', says Russia It also comes as Venezuela's defence minister confirmed that 47 Venezuelan soldiers were killed in US strike on Caracas on 3 January."

The Emmy Award-winning actor, 68, made his first court appearance on Wednesday over allegations he sexually abused two boys on the set of a ​television series. Busfield appeared remotely via a video link from jail a day after turning himself in - when he was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. The judge ordered Busfield to be held without bond. Prosecutors allege Busfield groomed and sexually abused the children. An arrest warrant was issued for Busfield on Monday, who turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police ‌Department on Tuesday and was booked into the Bernalillo County jail without bond, said Nancy Laflin, a spokesperson for the district attorney's office. In a video posted online shortly before his surrender, Busfield ​called the allegations against him \"lies\" and said: \"I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am.\" \"I did not do anything to those little boys,\" he said during the 45-second clip. In November, he told investigators he probably had physical contact with the boys on occasion, like tickling or picking them up, but in a playful manner with others present, according to a sworn statement.

The UK February delivery price was more than 8 pence per therm higher on the day at more than 98p. Gas Infrastructure Europe data suggested that storage levels were at just 52% capacity. \n                  South East Water restores supply to homes in Kent and Sussex after week of chaos \n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 \n                  British Gas parent company boss 'happy to pay more' tax for bills to go down\n                 A relatively quiet start to the European winter saw natural gas costs in early January fall to their lowest level since stocks were being replenished late last spring. But colder weather across northern Europe has prompted a spike in use and given rise to fears that supplies are vulnerable due to the LNG squeeze, partly blamed on shipments diverting to Asia, where costs are often higher. Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management, said the market had been hit by a \"perfect storm\" of cold weather forecasts, depleting ‌storage, geopolitical risk in Iran and speculative trading activity that had seen short positions closed. Long-range forecasts suggest a plunge in temperatures towards the end of the month, with lower wind speeds exacerbating the situation as green infrastructure would be unable to fill the void despite record capacity. Data from the National Energy System Operator showed electricity from gas-fired power was responsible for 36% of UK provision, followed closely by wind, on Thursday. The recent national cold snap saw the figure for gas climb well above 50% across four days. A prolonged price spike for wholesale gas would be expected to be reflected in future household energy bills. Current fixed rate deals could rise before the next energy price cap review is due to take effect at the beginning of April. The government says that eradicating gas price volatility is a major reason behind its push for a renewables-based energy system. This week saw a record offshore wind auction completed, leaving the country on track to meet its 2030 clean power goals. But an 11% increase in the so-called strike price means that the cost of achieving those ambitions has also gone up. Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"Following years of price volatility that have left... households with debt and industry with billions of extra costs, it’s a reminder that the price of gas is largely set by the actions of foreign actors, beyond our control. \"The North Sea is continuing to run out of gas and won't help to lower bills or provide security of supply. The latest renewables auction this week secured a record amount of offshore wind, which will cut our need for gas and so stabilise prices and shield households from future gas price spikes. Wind cut the wholesale day-ahead electricity price by around a third in 2025.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Rachel Reeves's plans to curb cash ISA limits with the aim of fuelling a wave of stock market investing \"are doomed to fail\", the boss of one of Britain's biggest retail investment platforms has warned. Sky News has learnt that Michael Summersgill, chief executive of AJ Bell, which has more than £100bn of client assets under administration, wrote to the chancellor this week to intensify his criticism of the reforms. In an excoriating letter, seen by Sky News, Mr Summersgill expressed concern not only at the plan to cut the cash ISA allowance from £20,000 to £12,000 in 2027, but also at the \"lack of proper process in implementing the planned changes\". Money latest: The 'safest' airlines in the world \"It is my strongly held view these unwieldy proposals are doomed to fail in their aim of encouraging more people to invest for the long term and represent a significant backward step for a product whose success has been largely down to its relative simplicity,\" Mr Summersgill wrote. \"Rushing to implement these changes, which represent a material intervention in the market with wide-ranging consequences, without a proper consultation or any clear evidence they will incentivise long-term investing represents the worst kind of policymaking.\" The forthright nature of the AJ Bell chief's criticism underlines the deep misgivings in Britain's investment industry about the implications of the Treasury's plans. \n                  Gas prices soar 40% amid 'perfect storm' of pressures\n                 \n                  Why this could be final nail in coffin for an industry that was once pride of UK's economy\n                 \n                  £10m lottery prize unclaimed after two months - here's the area it was bought in | Money blog\n                 Sky News revealed earlier this week that a swathe of ISA providers had met officials from the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs to outline the details of their concerns. The government is drawing up detailed anti-circumvention rules including banning transfers from stocks and shares and Innovative Finance ISAs to cash ISAs; the use of tests to determine whether an investment is eligible to be held in a stocks and shares ISA or is 'cash-like'; and charges on any interest paid on cash held in a stocks and shares or Innovative Finance ISA. However, the investment industry has been vocal in warning that the rule changes will increase complexity and penalise savers who are focused on de-risking their portfolios before they turn 65. There are also concerns that a more robust approach to taxing cash balances held in stocks and shares ISAs would severely damage the image of ISAs as a tax-free investment option. In his letter to Ms Reeves, Mr Summersgill, whose company serves more than 640,000 customers, said the fact that the reforms were being pushed through in relation to a product at the centre of plans for a multimillion pound industry-funded campaign to promote retail investing was \"all the more troubling\". A number of firms, including AJ Bell, have already pulled out of participating in that campaign over its costs and coordination. Mr Summersgill said there was no evidence that the cut to cash ISA allowances would materially boost retail investment, adding that a survey conducted by AJ Bell found \"the vast majority would simply opt for cash alternatives, such as NS&I bonds, or save in a taxable cash account\". \"As we warned Treasury officials on multiple occasions ahead of the Budget, this will harden the border between Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs, making it less likely existing excess funds held in Cash ISAs will shift to long-term investing through Stocks and Shares ISAs.\" \"Given there are 3 million people with at least £20,000 invested in Cash ISAs and nothing invested in Stocks and Shares ISAs, this represents a missed opportunity worth at least £60 billion,\" Mr Summersgill warned. \"In the short term, people will rationally flock to Cash ISAs - the opposite of the policy intent - ahead of the allowance reduction in April 2027.\" He also lambasted the decision to exempt those aged 65 and over from the changes, saying it was \"a baffling age to choose\" given that it does not correspond with the state pension age. \"As if this complexity wasn't enough, the anti-avoidance measures HMRC will be required to draw up to accompany these reforms risk further undermining the attractiveness of ISAs,\" he wrote. \"The proposed ban on transfers restricts choice and flexibility, two key benefits of ISAs, but more worrying is the intention to apply a tax charge to cash held in Stocks and Shares ISAs. \"The simple fact is that cash passes through Stocks and Shares ISAs all the time. \"Contributions are made in cash, dividends are received in cash, fees are paid in cash, and risk-based assets have to be sold to create the cash for withdrawals. \"In other words, the government intends to punish retail investors for using the Stocks and Shares ISA the way it was designed to be used by levying tax.\" He warned the measures \"could potentially mean Stocks and Shares ISAs which allow people to hold cash can no longer be marketed as 'tax-free', weakening the appeal of the most popular investment account in the UK market\". Mr Summersgill urged the chancellor to \"adopt a light touch approach to anti-avoidance, at least until the reforms have bedded in and there is an evidence basis upon which to formulate any necessary interventions\". \"Any cash held in a Stocks and Shares ISA for investment purposes should remain exempt from any charge, with HMRC reserving the right to apply a charge where this is not deemed the case,\" he wrote. Read more from Sky News:Industry once pride of UK's economy faces watershed momentWater finally restored to thousands of homes after week of chaos The AJ Bell chief added that plans to replace the Lifetime ISA with a savings product targeting first-time buyers only risked adding \"even more complexity to the ISA landscape\". And he said the nature of the Treasury's consultation on the sweep of ISA reforms \"with only a few months to work with HMRC on the nuts and bolts means unintended consequences are far more likely\". \"Given the government's plans to cut the Cash ISA allowance were briefed to the media ahead of your Mansion House statement in July last year, there has been more than enough time to consult properly ahead of an April 2027 implementation,\" he wrote. \"The fact this hasn't happened represents a failure to conduct even the most basic due diligence before making a substantial policy intervention.\" In the 2023-24 tax year, savers ploughed a record £103bn into ISAs, with almost exactly two-thirds of that - £70bn - invested in cash ISAs. Earlier this week, a government spokesperson said: \"To encourage greater investment in stocks and shares, we're developing changes to ISA rules which will prevent circumvention of the new lower cash ISA limit. \"We're already working closely with industry and will publish clear guidance before the changes come into effect.\""

        "Content": "Water is finally being restored to some homes across Kent and Sussex - after almost a week of chaos. Some 6,500 homes will have their taps running again after a gruelling six days of disruption - which has prompted fury towards provider South East Water (SEW). The firm blames the outage - which has affected 30,000 homes since Saturday - on Storm Goretti bursting pipes and cutting power. It has prompted a probe by water regulator Ofwat - with hundreds still experiencing low water pressure. The beleaguered water firm has faced heavy criticism from MPs and the public as the outage came off the back of a similar incident last month, when 24,000 homes were affected. A major incident was declared by SEW and Kent County Council on Monday, but not by either East or West Sussex County Councils. On Friday, SEW's incident manager Mathew Dean said: \"Water supplies have now been restored to the 6,500 properties in Tunbridge Wells area. \n                  Gas prices soar 40% amid 'perfect storm' of pressures\n                 \n                  Scottish independence could 'reduce energy bills by more than a third', First Minister John Swinney says\n                 \n                  British Gas parent company boss 'happy to pay more' tax for bills to go down\n                 \"Some customers may be experiencing low pressure as the water levels continue to build this morning throughout the area's pipeline network. \"Continuous supplies have been restored to the town after we implemented our recovery plan which involved keeping local booster pumps switched off for 36 hours so our drinking water storage tank could fill. \"We are very sorry to every single one of our customers who have been affected. \"We know and understand how difficult going without water for such a long period of time is and how difficult it makes everyday life.\" sfgdg Read more from Sky News:Parents take on TikTok over viral trend Earlier this week Sky News spoke to elderly residents who were affected.

It's awful.\" Ofwat's investigation will look into whether the supplier had breached its licence condition by failing to comply with customer service standards obligations and offering appropriate support to affected customers. If the regulator decides SEW has breached the conditions it could be stripped of its licence. South East Water Limited reported an increase in pre-tax profit to £18.2 million for the six months up to 30 September 2025, up from £2.6 million in the same period last year. In the village of Bidborough, Kent, there are still are 320 homes still affected by low water levels. Bottled water sites will still remain open today \"as a precaution\", the company has said."

Kemi Badenoch's team could have chosen anywhere in Scotland to hold their media event on Friday morning. On Thursday, they picked a whisky distillery to talk tough on the cameras in the wake of Robert Jenrick's alleged scheming and plotting with Nigel Farage. And on the morning after the highest profile Conservative defection, the Tories rallied Sky News and others to an industrial estate on the outskirts of Aberdeen. It was a survival training centre preparing offshore workers for worst-case-scenario disasters.

The type of rubber vessels that North Sea workers would cling to and hoist themselves on board if an emergency unfolded in choppy waters. Workers were being put through their paces, treading water, dressed in their safety gear. Given the political context of the past 24 hours, it seemed an extraordinary choice of location, given the obvious headlines that would be generated. As we prepared our camera, Ms Badenoch's minders shuffled over to try and take a look at what we would be filming, what the scene would be behind where the Tory chief would be standing. The massive life raft was floating behind. A few moments later, we were all asked to move to another part of the building where a large swimming pool would be in shot. We were told it was the venue's decision. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 This bizarre circus was all unfolding as the leader of the opposition was being given a tour of the facility, separate from the awaiting bank of cameras. A photographer later posted a picture of Ms Badenoch on board, which looked like a simulator of a sinking ship. When our interview finally got under way, the aides stood excitedly at the edge of the camera theatrically punching the air when their leader delivered what they believed was a key message or attack against Mr Farage and Mr Jenrick. This whole 20-minute interaction behind the scenes is not exactly breaking news, but it gives an insight into what the public does not see. It is still baffling why the Conservatives were happy for the emergency training facility to be the backdrop to their narrative at a time when so many of their colleagues are literally jumping ship."

But who? Notice that he said a \"Labour figure\" rather than \"Labour MP\". That perhaps suggests he means an ex-MP or a peer. Or someone who's both. And after Nadhim Zahawi and Robert Jenrick this week, what about more Tory defectors. Kemi Badenoch told Sky News she was \"100% confident\" there would be no more shadow cabinet defections. In both parties, it's fair to assume that candidates for defecting to Reform UK will be committed Brexiteers, socially conservative and - from Labour - Red Wallers or Blue Labour. That narrows it down. In the 2016 referendum, the two most high-profile pro-Brexit Labour MPs were Kate Hoey and Gisela Stuart, both awarded a peerage by Boris Johnson and both no longer Labour. \n                  Number of councils that have requested delay to local elections revealed - is yours one of them?\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  Farmers celebrate Sir Keir Starmer's Christmas U-turn on inheritance tax\n                 Kate Hoey Born in Northern Ireland, as MP for the inner London seat of Vauxhall she was a junior Home Office minister and then sports minister under Tony Blair, but later became an outspoken backbench rebel. She was pro fox hunting, pro-Brexit, pro tougher immigration controls, pro curbs on welfare spending and grammar schools. She was against the Iraq war, Trident, tuition fees, ID cards and more LGBT+ rights. On Brexit, she was co-chair of Labour Leave, active in Grassroots Out, alongside Mr Farage and left-wing firebrand George Galloway, and accused the BBC of being \"embittered remainers\". Asked if she's Mr Farage's \"well known Labour figure\", she told Sky News: \"Not sure I'm that well known. Haven't been a Labour Party member for over eight years!\" Not a yes or a no, then. Gisela Stuart Born in Germany, she was MP for the suburban seat of Birmingham Edgbaston and a junior health minister under Tony Blair. She was later chair of Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson later appointed her First Civil Service Commissioner, effectively a Whitehall watchdog, a post she still holds under Sir Keir Starmer. But she emphatically denies being poised to defect to Reform UK. \"Thank you for the straightforward question,\" she told Sky News. \"It deserves a straightforward answer… No.\" Read more:All the former Conservative MPs who have defected to ReformEx-Tory chancellor defects to Reform And what about possible Conservative defections? As Kemi Badenoch says, shadow cabinet defections are highly unlikely. But there are potential Tory defectors among ex-ministers and less senior front benchers. For example: Suella Braverman Named after Sue Ellen Ewing in Dallas, (yes, really!), the fiercely right-wing former home secretary has been on defection watch for years. That's hardly surprising. In 2024, she suggested the Conservatives should welcome Nigel Farage into the party to \"unite the right\", a phrase used by Robert Jenrick after his defection. As a controversial home secretary, she said sending illegal migrants to Rwanda was her \"dream\" and called left-wing demonstrators \"Guardian-reading, Tofu-eating wokerati\". She's a bitter opponent of the European Convention on Human Rights. MP for Fareham and Waterlooville in Hampshire, she chaired the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, was a Brexit minister under Theresa May but quit and stood for the Tory leadership and then backed Liz Truss. Andrew Rosindell The Romford MP and devotee of Margaret Thatcher has called Mr Farage \"a good man and a patriot\" and said he could serve in a government with him in a Conservative-Reform coalition. He also co-sponsored a private member's bill introduced by Mr Farage, which aimed to prevent \"foreign judges\" overturning decisions made by the UK parliament. Socially conservative and Eurosceptic, he was a Brexit rebel against Theresa May, a critic of Boris Johnson's lockdown policy during the Covid pandemic and has voted against extending LGBT+ rights. Asked if he was planning to defect, animal lover, Mr Rosindell sent Sky News a photo of a cute dog with the caption: \"Who me?\" Make of that what you will!"

Where we have asked councils to let us know if there needs to be a delay or a postponement is where we're going through the biggest reorganisation of councils in decades.\" \n                  Life raft backdrop a baffling choice for Kemi Badenoch's Aberdeen visit given latest defection\n                 \n                  Badenoch turned a crisis into an opportunity - but her Reform problems aren't over\n                 \n                  'No tears' in Tory party over Jenrick's departure, ex-Scottish Conservative leader says\n                 He explained that a third of the country has two councils, rather than one, which is money that could be spent on local services, and so they are offering to postpone elections this year if holding them could mean a delay to elections next year. Sky News has contacted all of the 63 councils offered a delay, and a total of 29 have said they will be requesting one, 33 have said they will not, and one could not agree internally whether to ask for a delay. All the councils that have requested a delay cited the resources needed to deliver the government's LGR programme, and many said it would not make sense to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to hold an election for councillor positions that would only exist for one year. The final decision on whether an election will be delayed rests with the government, and opposition parties are furious. At his news conference on Thursday, at which he announced Robert Jenrick's defection from the Tories, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"I had the full intention today to tell you how absolutely monstrous it is that elections for millions of people all over this country are being cancelled, in some cases for the second year in a row.\" Instead, he will do that at a later date, and he said he is preparing to bring a legal challenge against the government's plans. He has previously accused Labour and the Tories of working together to lock his party out of power - but just four Tory-led councils have confirmed they will be seeking a delay, while nine have said they will not. The Conservatives have said publicly they want all local elections due in May to go ahead, with shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride telling broadcasters on Thursday it is \"not right\" that millions could be \"denied the democratic right to seek change in their councils if they desire it\". \"We don't want to see councillors serving seven-year terms. We need to get on with democracy,\" he added. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 The chief executive of the Electoral Commission, Vijay Rangarajan, has also criticised the potential delays to elections, saying in December he was \"concerned\" that some elections could be postponed, having already been deferred from 2025. \"Scheduled elections should, as a rule, go ahead as planned, and only be postponed in exceptional circumstances,\" he said in a statement. \"We very much recognise the pressures on local government, but these late changes do not help administrators. Parties and candidates have already been preparing for some time, and will be understandably concerned.\" He said \"capacity constraints\" were not a \"legitimate reason for delaying long planned elections\", which risked \"affecting the legitimacy of local decision-making and damaging public confidence\". The watchdog chief also said there was \"a clear conflict of interest in asking existing councils to decide how long it will be before they are answerable to voters\". The councils that have asked for a delay:• Adur District Council (Labour)• Basildon Borough Council (Labour)• Blackburn with Darwen Council (Labour)• Burnley Borough Council (Burnley Independent Group)• Cannock Chase District Council (Labour)• Cheltenham Borough Council (Lib Dem)• Chorley Borough Council (Labour)• City of Lincoln Council (Labour)• Crawley Borough Council (Labour)• East Sussex County Council (Tory)• Exeter City Council (Labour)• Harlow District Council (Tory)• Hastings Borough Council (Green)• Hyndburn Borough Council (Labour)• Ipswich Borough Council (Labour)• Norwich City Council (Labour)• Pendle Borough Council (Lib Dem)• Peterborough City Council (Labour)• Preston City Council (Labour)• Redditch Borough Council (Labour)• Rugby Borough Council (Labour)• Stevenage Borough Council (Labour)• Suffolk County Council (Tory)• Tamworth Borough Council (Labour)• Thurrock Council (Labour)• Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council (Labour)• West Lancashire Borough Council (Labour)• West Sussex County Council (Tory)• Worthing Borough Council (Labour)"

        "Content": "The chief constable of West Midlands Police (WMP) is to retire following a row over the force's decision to ban Israeli football fans from a match in Birmingham for safety reasons. Craig Guildford will step down with immediate effect, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said on Friday. \"In doing so, he has acted with honour and in the best interests of West Midlands Police and our region. I welcome his decision,\" Mr Foster said. Mr Guildford said after his retirement was announced that the \"political and media frenzy\" around his position had become \"detrimental\" to the force. His decision comes after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she did not have confidence in the police chief, following his force's controversial ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from a Europa League tie against Aston Villa at Villa Park in November. On Wednesday, Ms Mahmood said: \"We have witnessed a failure of leadership that has harmed the reputation of and eroded public confidence in West Midlands police, and policing more broadly.\" After it was announced that Mr Guildford would retire, the home secretary welcomed the move and said he had \"done the right thing\". \"I would like to acknowledge his years of service. And I pay tribute to the work of the officers in West Midlands Police, who keep their community safe every day,\" Ms Mahmood said. \"Today marks a crucial first step to rebuilding trust and confidence in the force amongst all the communities they serve.\" But Villa Park MP Ayoub Khan criticised Mr Guildford's retirement in a statement, saying it was \"one of the greatest injustices of our time\", a chief constable was \"sacrificed not for failure, but for doing his duty\". He added Mr Guildford is \"a public servant [who was] ousted for protecting the people of Birmingham and refusing to play politics; a police commander removed for judging the Maccabi Tel Aviv ultras not on their faith or nationality, but on the storied history of violence, racism and thuggery that showed the content of their character\". On Wednesday, Mr Guildford had apologised to MPs for giving them \"erroneous\" evidence about the ban. He revealed that WMP's citing of a fictional match to justify the ban was down to the force's use of AI, something Mr Guildford had previously denied to MPs. The force, which has been accused of misrepresenting the threat posed by the Maccabi fans to justify its ban, also apologised last month for telling MPs that members of the Jewish community had backed its decision, admitting there was \"no documented feedback\" to support the claim. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch were among those who criticised the decision to ban away fans from attending the Israeli side's match in the UK's second-largest city on 6 November. Sir Keir was said to be \"angered\" by the decision, while Ms Badenoch went further and said Mr Guildford's position was \"untenable\", and claimed he had \"capitulated to Islamists and then collaborated with them to cover it up\". \"West Midlands Police have been subjected to, understandable, intense and significant oversight and scrutiny as a consequence of events that led to the recommendation it made\" to the Birmingham City Council Safety Advisory Group to ban the fans, Mr Foster acknowledged on Friday. Read more from Sky News:Why Maccabi fans were bannedSerious question about one of UK's biggest cities He said WMP had received a letter from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, which \"set out significant preliminary concerns and shortcomings in relation to preparation and planning\" by the force. Deputy Chief Constable Scott Green has been appointed as WMP's acting chief constable, Mr Foster said. \"We have already met, to discuss the actions that the force must take to rebuild trust and confidence amongst all the people and communities of the West Midlands, including addressing the significant matters identified in the letter from HMIC,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Labour MPs expect a \"politically inept\" U-turn from the government on banning social media for under-16s to prevent a potential Commons showdown. Dozens of Labour MPs are pushing ministers to adopt an Australia-style ban, Sky News has been told. Politics Live: Sacked Tory defector Robert Jenrick speaks at Reform event Many expect the government will move on the issue, following pressure from the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and the Conservatives. Peers have tabled an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which would regulate social media platforms \"to use highly-effective age assurance measures to prevent children under 16 from accessing services\". This is expected to be voted on in the House of Lords on Wednesday when the bill begins its report stage in the upper chamber. It has cross-party support, including the backing of former Labour MP turned peer Luciana Berger and former Conservative education minister Lord John Nash. If passed, that provides a way for it to be debated in the Commons. One Labour MP told Sky News there was \"no way\" the government could whip the PLP against, claiming a majority are in favour of the ban and Number 10 will want to avoid another welfare-style rebellion. \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 \n                  Conservatives pledge to ban social media for under-16s\n                 \n                  'Get a grip' on Grok, Starmer tells X after AI tool is used for child sex images\n                 They said they expect the government to back a ban but lamented the \"political ineptitude\" of being on the backfoot to Conservatives on this issue, after they pledged to ban social media for under-16s last week. The amendment in the Lords was put down before Christmas, but Tory insiders are hopeful it can be used to their advantage to force Sir Keir Starmer into another policy shift. Labour MPs told Sky News that dozens of backbenchers are pushing the government to move to a ban and they don't think it will come to a rebellion as \"the government will do it\". Some MPs are pushing for the government to table its own amendment that they can get behind, which would promise to at least consult on an Australia-style ban. But another MP said they were \"sick of consultations\" and the government should just get on with it. Many Labour MPs have been vocal in calling for a ban, as well as Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - who many expect could launch a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer in the future. 'Let kids be kids' Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, told Sky News that MPs \"across the political spectrum recognise the harm that social media is causing to our young people\". He said: \"Children are spending sleepless nights glued to addictive platforms, feeding them harmful content. \"We know that the recent explosion in mental illness among young people is correlated to excessive social media use, and it's time for action. \"I know the government are looking closely at what is happening in Australia, where tech companies have to prevent under-16s from accessing social media. I very much hope we will see a similar model implemented here.\" Jess Asato, the MP for Lowestoft, also welcomed the government \"looking closely\" at a ban. She said there is \"strong evidence of the mental and physical harm that accessing social media causes children\", including acting as a \"gateway for child sexual abuse and exploitation\". \"We should take the precautionary principle and let kids be kids.\" York Outer MP Luke Charters said: \"It's totally right that we consider a social media ban for children. \"I have two boys under four, and like many parents I find myself worrying about the world they're growing up in. Social media is a big part of that worry in the years ahead, and we can't afford not to act while harm is being done in plain sight. \"We've all heard stories of children being groomed, bullied, exploited and extorted online, and it's important that we're taking action to prevent that harm, and give our kids the safe and healthy childhoods they deserve.\" Read more:Ofcom welcomes Grok sexualised image restrictionsNew rules for the internet come into force The government does not currently support a ban on social media for children. Ministers say they are waiting to see how it plays out in Australia, after it became the first country in the world to enforce an under-16 social media ban in December. However there are signs of their position softening. The prime minister didn't rule out a ban on Thursday, saying \"all options are on the table\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting has also heavily hinted he is in favour of the ban, telling broadcasters there is a \"strong case for action in this area\" and \"the prime minister encourages that debate\". \"On one hand, we know that social media can be a great point of connection, and that's true for young people as well as the rest of us. At the same time, we also see the impact of doomscrolling on the cognitive, the brain development of children,\" he said. He said that debate should not just involve politicians but parents and young people too. Asked if he would back the amendment if it came back to the Commons, he said: \"That's a decision for the prime minister and the education secretary but I'm really glad we're having this debate.\""

        "Content": "A court has thrown out a £50m compensation claim against the Scottish government over its doomed deposit return scheme. Waste management firm Biffa won a contract as part of plans to bring in the scheme, and later took ministers to court when the initiative was shelved. Biffa had been seeking £51.4m in damages at the Court of Session to cover losses it said it had incurred through the project's failure. In a ruling published on Friday, Lord Sandison found against the firm. His judgment read: \"The court is not concerned with the question of who (if anyone) ought to be regarded as bearing political responsibility for the failure of the Scottish deposit return scheme to launch in August 2023. \"Rather, it is only concerned with the legal questions of whether the defenders owed a duty of care to the pursuer in either of the regards contended for, and, if so, whether any such duty was breached and loss was thereby caused to the pursuer.\" Biffa had argued that former Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater - who was the minister in charge of the project - made a \"negligent misrepresentation\" in a letter she sent the company which \"provided assurances in respect of the viability of the scheme\", but did not mention the Scottish government would need an exemption from the UK government to the Internal Market Act (IMA) for it to go ahead. Westminster legislation governs trade between the different parts of the UK post-Brexit. Then Scottish secretary Lord Jack refused to grant an exemption to the Scottish government - which meant Holyrood ministers could not proceed with plans to include glass bottles in their scheme, and ultimately left them unable to bring in deposit return as planned in August 2023. A deposit return scheme (DRS) sees shoppers charged a deposit when buying drinks, with the cash returned to them when they bring their empty cans and bottles back for recycling. Biffa had argued the letter of \"comfort\" it received from MSP Ms Slater in May 2022 had negligently misrepresented the true level of risk facing the project as it failed to mention the need to secure an IMA exemption. Read more from the court case:Slater gave 'emphatic' assurance about DRS, court toldScottish government 'utterly irresponsible' over DRS, court toldUK government blocked DRS to give SNP 'black eye', court told Lord Sandison made clear he did \"not accept that a reasonable person could have looked at\" the letter sent by the then circular economy minister and taken it as \"amounting to a general statement that there was no risk that the scheme would not be proceeding and that all would be well\". He therefore ruled the Scottish government \"did not breach the duty incumbent on them\", adding: \"The matters which they stated in the letter were true and accurate.\" Lord Sandison concluded the firm's case \"fails in fact and law\". A spokesperson for Biffa said: \"We note today's decision and are reviewing our position with our legal advisers.\" The Scottish government said it would \"not be appropriate\" to comment on live legal proceedings. A Scottish Green spokesperson said what happened with the DRS showed \"the worst of Westminster\". They added: \"MSPs voted to introduce a recycling scheme, with businesses investing money to make it happen. \"There are bottles, cans and glass littering our parks, beaches and streets. This scheme would have led to more of them being recycled.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n Even though it's high summer in the Antarctic, the ocean around the Rothera research station is -1 Celsius. As some of the most productive oceans on the planet - a soup of microscopic plant and animal plankton - it's murky to boot. Not everyone's idea of the perfect scuba spot. But the divers I'm with seem positively excited about tipping themselves backwards into the depths. \"You can get these big starfish with 40 arms that you don't see anywhere else, they're my favourites,\" said Pati Glaz, a marine biologist with the dive team of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). For her dive partner, BAS marine biologist Matt Bell, it's \"polar gigantism\" that floats his boat. No, me neither. \n                  Is Antarctica a time bomb for Trump? \n                 \n                  Is America surrendering Antarctica to its rivals?\n                 \n                  Mad science or a last hope? The researchers trying to repair the climate\n                 It's the phenomenon, he patiently explains through a thick neoprene helmet, of species exclusive to cold polar oceans growing much larger than their cousins in warmer waters. The colder the water, the more oxygen it can carry, and the larger the animal you can grow. \"Because it's cold, the biology is very different,\" said Professor Lloyd Peck, who leads marine biology research at BAS. \"Things live a long time,\" he said. In a rapidly warming Antarctic, that's not necessarily a good thing. Animals down here live long, partly because they grow and reproduce slowly. An Antarctic starfish can take hundreds of days to reproduce compared to a few weeks for its cousins in the UK. Warm things up by just a degree or so, and their larvae hatch earlier, in the winter, say, when there's no food and no light. \"We're really worried that many species could fail because the timing of their cycles is changed in a very detrimental way, by just a small amount of warmth,\" said Prof Peck. The key strength of their dive research is they've been surveying the same sites on the seabed for nearly 30 years. Important, if you want to judge the winners and losers in an ecosystem that's already close to a degree warmer on average than when research here began. But diving in Antarctica is not without complications. As well as specialist dry suits and very thick gloves, before the divers go in, spotters on the surface to check for wildlife. Predatory leopard seals, common in these waters, prefer penguins. But their jaws are powerful enough to take a seal, or a similar-sized diver. Following a fatal encounter in 2003, if leopard seals or curious killer whales are spotted anywhere in the vicinity, before or during a dive, it's immediately aborted. After 20 minutes down, the divers return looking surprisingly warm and cheerful. They carry samples of wildlife to take to their laboratory aquarium. The warming in Antarctica gives a sense of urgency to the research. They're not just interested in understanding how marine ecosystems are coping with climate change. They want to use new techniques to understand sub-zero biology. Something that at a cellular and molecular level, science knows practically nothing about. \"If you take the cells of animals that live at warmer temperatures and you cool them down to zero degrees, they don't work,\" said Prof Peck. Biologists suspect there are many factors at play. But one of particular interest, is how proteins fold and stick together. Cool down a warm-water animal and its proteins stick together. A problem that evolution has obviously solved to allow life to exist in freezing oceans. \"Understanding why our animals don't have problems with their proteins sticking together will shed light on those mechanisms,\" said Prof Peck. And they may turn out to be very useful to medicine. Diseases like Alzheimer's and CJD are caused by proteins abnormally sticking together in the brain.

Growing slowly, but healthily in a high-oxygen environment, could also shed light on the molecular basis of ageing in humans. His team have just begun a new collaboration with the University of Cambridge to develop microscopes capable of operating in sub-zero temperatures. Tools that will be able to explore below-freezing biology at a molecular level for the first time. Back on the dive boat, there are other reasons to be optimistic. Whales, once a rare sight at Rothera, are all around us. They count at least 30, possibly 40 humpback whales in the bay, a new record. Populations are recovering after the ban on whaling 40 years ago. Receding sea ice has also allowed whales swim here for the first time in millennia. How ocean ecosystems respond to warming is important. In the past, they absorbed so much carbon from the atmosphere that they helped usher in ice ages after periods in geological time when Antarctica was even warmer than today. Fossilised palm trees on the continent speak to that fact - one often championed by those sceptical of climate change. But Antarctica appears to be warming far faster than it did in aeons past; at a pace its slow, cold biology may struggle to match."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       Warning: This story contains descriptions of parents finding their children unresponsive. \"I'd rather not do this. I'd rather I was left to grieve, but I'm stuck in a tunnel and I can't get out.\" Liam Walsh's daughter Maia died three years ago. She was 13 when she was found unresponsive. Noah Gibson, just 11 years old, had passed away just months before, on 9 December 2021. He was found by his brother in his bedroom. His sister tried to help mum, Louise Gibson, to resuscitate him. They couldn't. \"When I was checking Noah's phone, I was looking for messages from school friends. I was looking for bullying. \"I never thought to check social media to see what he'd been looking at,\" said Louise. Three more families were torn apart in similar circumstances, within months of each other. Jools was 14. He'd spent the entire day mucking about at home with his friends, but an hour after they fell laughing and joking out of the front door, he was found unresponsive by his mum, Ellen Roome. Archie was 12. He was planning to go to the cinema with mum Hollie Dance later that day. Instead, her \"pranky, happy\" son was found unresponsive and after four months on life-support, he died. Isaac, an \"August baby\" who loved to be the joker, was 13. His mum, Lisa Kenevan, found him unresponsive and again tried to resuscitate him. When the police took away his devices, they found videos apparently recorded through TikTok (but not posted) showing Isaac pointing to his neck and laughing. All five parents believe their children died attempting a dangerous stunt known as the blackout challenge. It's a stunt that has been doing the rounds for decades and is banned on mainstream social media apps, including TikTok, because it is so dangerous. But the parents believe their children saw the challenge on TikTok - although they don't have proof. TikTok says the data around what their children were watching has likely been deleted under data privacy rules. The group of bereaved parents are suing TikTok in the US for wrongful death, a process that may see them find out what happened to their children, if that data can be recovered. Their first hearing is on Friday. Since the parents began campaigning for better rights and protections around young people online, TikTok has always said the blackout challenge never trended on its platform. It's been banned on there since 2020. \"Boredom set in through the COVID times. And I think this is what triggered [Isaac's] brain to think, 'Yeah, let's give it a go, why not everyone else has survived, I'll be fine',\" says Lisa. \"Unfortunately, this day on 8 March, he did this act and 9 March, he's no longer here. \"How the hell do you, as a parent, get your head around that.\" For all of them, the campaign to find out what happened to their children has put grief on hold. \"You're not allowed to grieve. You haven't started to grieve,\" says Hollie. \"You have that initial grief, that initial shock but when you don't know what happened to your child, it's very hard to find closure or come to any kind of sense about it all.\" Two of the parents, Ellen and Liam, only had one child. For them, this battle is all-consuming. They're scared about what happens when it ends. \"What happens when we get to the end?\" asks Ellen. \"What's our purpose? Because I'm no longer a parent. I don't have a purpose. \"I no longer have my job. I no longer have a partner. I no longer have a child. So when I get to end of this, then what happens?\" Liam wishes it could have been simpler but he won't stop pushing to discover what happened. \"My daughter deserves better than this, than to be [brushed] under the carpet without an investigation into why she's died, and her family deserves much more than this too. \"I've often thought to myself, if she'd just fallen over and hit her head, you'd just know that's what had happened.\" \"I'd rather not do this. I'd rather I was left to grieve, but I'm stuck in a tunnel and I can't get out.\" The parents' first hearing will involve an attempt by TikTok to have their action dismissed. The company says they're being sued in the wrong place because the harm occurred in the UK. TikTok told Sky News: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families. We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Labour MPs expect a \"politically inept\" U-turn from the government on banning social media for under-16s to prevent a potential Commons showdown. Dozens of Labour MPs are pushing ministers to adopt an Australia-style ban, Sky News has been told. Politics Live: Sacked Tory defector Robert Jenrick speaks at Reform event Many expect the government will move on the issue, following pressure from the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and the Conservatives. Peers have tabled an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which would regulate social media platforms \"to use highly-effective age assurance measures to prevent children under 16 from accessing services\". This is expected to be voted on in the House of Lords on Wednesday when the bill begins its report stage in the upper chamber. It has cross-party support, including the backing of former Labour MP turned peer Luciana Berger and former Conservative education minister Lord John Nash. If passed, that provides a way for it to be debated in the Commons. One Labour MP told Sky News there was \"no way\" the government could whip the PLP against, claiming a majority are in favour of the ban and Number 10 will want to avoid another welfare-style rebellion. \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 \n                  Conservatives pledge to ban social media for under-16s\n                 \n                  'Get a grip' on Grok, Starmer tells X after AI tool is used for child sex images\n                 They said they expect the government to back a ban but lamented the \"political ineptitude\" of being on the backfoot to Conservatives on this issue, after they pledged to ban social media for under-16s last week. The amendment in the Lords was put down before Christmas, but Tory insiders are hopeful it can be used to their advantage to force Sir Keir Starmer into another policy shift. Labour MPs told Sky News that dozens of backbenchers are pushing the government to move to a ban and they don't think it will come to a rebellion as \"the government will do it\". Some MPs are pushing for the government to table its own amendment that they can get behind, which would promise to at least consult on an Australia-style ban. But another MP said they were \"sick of consultations\" and the government should just get on with it. Many Labour MPs have been vocal in calling for a ban, as well as Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - who many expect could launch a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer in the future. 'Let kids be kids' Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, told Sky News that MPs \"across the political spectrum recognise the harm that social media is causing to our young people\". He said: \"Children are spending sleepless nights glued to addictive platforms, feeding them harmful content. \"We know that the recent explosion in mental illness among young people is correlated to excessive social media use, and it's time for action. \"I know the government are looking closely at what is happening in Australia, where tech companies have to prevent under-16s from accessing social media. I very much hope we will see a similar model implemented here.\" Jess Asato, the MP for Lowestoft, also welcomed the government \"looking closely\" at a ban. She said there is \"strong evidence of the mental and physical harm that accessing social media causes children\", including acting as a \"gateway for child sexual abuse and exploitation\". \"We should take the precautionary principle and let kids be kids.\" York Outer MP Luke Charters said: \"It's totally right that we consider a social media ban for children. \"I have two boys under four, and like many parents I find myself worrying about the world they're growing up in. Social media is a big part of that worry in the years ahead, and we can't afford not to act while harm is being done in plain sight. \"We've all heard stories of children being groomed, bullied, exploited and extorted online, and it's important that we're taking action to prevent that harm, and give our kids the safe and healthy childhoods they deserve.\" Read more:Ofcom welcomes Grok sexualised image restrictionsNew rules for the internet come into force The government does not currently support a ban on social media for children. Ministers say they are waiting to see how it plays out in Australia, after it became the first country in the world to enforce an under-16 social media ban in December. However there are signs of their position softening. The prime minister didn't rule out a ban on Thursday, saying \"all options are on the table\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting has also heavily hinted he is in favour of the ban, telling broadcasters there is a \"strong case for action in this area\" and \"the prime minister encourages that debate\". \"On one hand, we know that social media can be a great point of connection, and that's true for young people as well as the rest of us. At the same time, we also see the impact of doomscrolling on the cognitive, the brain development of children,\" he said. He said that debate should not just involve politicians but parents and young people too. Asked if he would back the amendment if it came back to the Commons, he said: \"That's a decision for the prime minister and the education secretary but I'm really glad we're having this debate.\""

        "Content": "Actor Timothy Busfield, who starred in the hit shows The West Wing and Thirtysomething, has been charged with child sex abuse. The Emmy Award-winning actor, 68, made his first court appearance on Wednesday over allegations he sexually abused two boys on the set of a ​television series. Busfield appeared remotely via a video link from jail a day after turning himself in - when he was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. The judge ordered Busfield to be held without bond. Prosecutors allege Busfield groomed and sexually abused the children. An arrest warrant was issued for Busfield on Monday, who turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police ‌Department on Tuesday and was booked into the Bernalillo County jail without bond, said Nancy Laflin, a spokesperson for the district attorney's office. In a video posted online shortly before his surrender, Busfield ​called the allegations against him \"lies\" and said: \"I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am.\" \"I did not do anything to those little boys,\" he said during the 45-second clip. In November, he told investigators he probably had physical contact with the boys on occasion, like tickling or picking them up, but in a playful manner with others present, according to a sworn statement. He also suggested the parental claims were an act of revenge after producers decided to replace the children in the series.

        "Content": "Julio Iglesias has denied abusing two former domestic employees behind a criminal complaint against him, calling the accusations \"completely false\". Prosecutors with Spain's High Court have opened preliminary proceedings into the complaint lodged by women who used to work for him in the Caribbean. In a post written in Spanish containing his signature and published on his Instagram page, the Spaniard said he denied \"having abused, coerced or disrespected any woman. These accusations are completely false and cause me great sadness\". He said messages of support had given him \"great comfort\". The women said he was guilty of human trafficking for ​forced labour and servitude, sexual abuse and violations of workers' rights, ​according to Women's Link Worldwide, the campaign group which filed the complaint on their behalf. It comes after Spanish online newspaper elDiario.es and Spanish-language television channel Univision Noticias published a joint investigation into Iglesias' alleged misconduct following a three-year investigation. Women's Link Worldwide described the complainants as ‌young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were ⁠heavily dependent on their wages due to ‌their economic and social conditions\". \n                  Actor Timothy Busfield charged with child sex abuse\n                 \n                  Prince Harry expected in court to give evidence in legal action against Daily Mail publisher\n                 \n                  Sting pays £595k to The Police bandmates, court hears\n                 Identified under the pseudonyms Rebeca and Laura, they worked in the singer's homes in the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas for 10 months in 2021, the group said.
