        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Sir Keir Starmer will host the first meeting of his new-look cabinet today, as the race to replace Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader gets under way. Left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy has become the first to throw her hat into the ring, after former transport secretary Louise Haigh - who resigned last November - ruled herself out. Politics Hub: Follow latest ahead of PM's cabinet meeting Ms Haigh said she would prefer to stay on the backbenches where she can \"speak plainly and campaign boldly\". Ms Ribeiro-Addy has the backing of the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG), which met in Westminster on Monday night to coalesce around one candidate following criticism of the contest's rules. Hopefuls wishing to enter the race only have until Thursday to secure the backing of 80 of their colleagues, which some backbenchers perceived as a \"stitch-up\" to prevent MPs on the left from standing. In a post on X last night, Ms Ribeiro-Addy said she looked forward to explaining her candidacy \"over the three short and undemocratic days we have to do so\". The Clapham and Brixton Hill MP has been backed by former Corbynite Richard Burgon, who said she \"would ensure Labour members' voices are heard at the top of our party - and not sidelined by yet more stitch-ups\". Brian Leisham, the MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, echoed that praise, writing on X: \"The party needs a strong voice from the left as deputy leader. Someone who will represent the politics and opinions of the rank and file grassroots members who want to see us govern by real Labour values.\" Ms Ribeiro-Addy was sacked as trade envoy for rebelling against the government over welfare cuts in July. MPs keen for non-London candidates Many Labour MPs have said they want a woman to take over from Ms Rayner, who resigned last week after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a new flat. However, they have also said they want someone from outside London to counteract the number of MPs from the capital in government - including Sir Keir's new deputy prime minister, David Lammy. Read more:Who's in and out in Starmer's reshuffle? This might also make things tricky for Dame Emily Thornberry, a fellow London MP who has been approaching colleagues about standing. In a WhatsApp message seen by Sky News, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee said the government has made \"too many mistakes\" on issues like welfare reform and Gaza, and Number 10 \"aren't listening\" to the concerns of backbenchers. But Patrick Hurley, the MP for Southport in Merseyside, told Sky News he would like a deputy leader who is \"geographically closer to home\". Lewis Atkinson, the MP for Sunderland Central, said on X that, given the geographical distribution of the current cabinet, he will also be looking to support \"a non-London woman\". Backbench MPs Callum Anderson and Connor Naismith have expressed a similar view, as have the likes of Labour peer Harriet Harman and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Political reporter The Labour Party rule book sets out how candidates can get on the ballot to stand in the election for deputy party leader. Each nominee must be a sitting member of the Parliamentary Labour Party (a Labour MP), and must be supported by 20% of their fellow members, which currently equates to 80 Labour MPs. The deadline set by the party's governing body to gather the required nominations is 5pm on Thursday 11 September. After that, candidates must win the support of either: • 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs), which are local party groups; • At least three organisations affiliated to the party - at least two of which must be trade unions - that comprise 5% of the affiliated party membership. This process will start on Saturday 13 September, and close on Saturday 27 September. The successful candidates will then appear on the ballot for a vote of all party members and affiliated party supporters, which will open on Wednesday 8 October, and close on Thursday 23 October at 12pm. The winner will be announced on Saturday 25 October. 'We need strong voices pushing for renewal' Northern female MPs being encouraged to stand include the former transport secretary Ms Haigh as well as former Leader of the House of Commons, Lucy Powell, who was sacked in the cabinet reshuffle last week. Ms Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, is understood to be \"taking soundings\" after being approached by colleagues. Ms Haigh, who was forced to resign after it emerged she pleaded guilty to a criminal offence, said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the encouragement she had received from colleagues but would not stand. In a statement to Sky News, she said: \"Labour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain - not simply to steady the ship, but to remake it completely. \"We need strong voices pushing for that renewal: on the economy, on workers' rights, and on climate change. For me, that means remaining on the backbenches for now, where I can speak plainly and campaign boldly.\" Could top ministers enter race? The deputy leader of Labour is an elected position voted on by members. Ms Rayner quit the role, along with her government positions as deputy prime minister and housing secretary, after she was found to have breached the ministerial code for failing to get correct tax advice. It is not clear if a Starmer loyalist will put themselves forward. Many cabinet ministers have ruled themselves out, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Sky News understands Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, from Sunderland, is on the brink of entering the race. Housing minister Alison McGovern, who represents Birkenhead near Liverpool, has also not ruled herself out.  Either of these could end up being Downing Street's preferred choice and would also be popular among MPs who not only want a northern woman, but someone who will work constructively with government rather than oppose it. However, if a minister enters the race and loses, that would be a huge blow to Sir Keir's authority, as the result would widely be seen as a referendum on his leadership and policies. As one backbench MP put it: \"The question is who is willing to be humiliated on behalf of Keir Starmer, so far nobody.\""

        "Headline": "The government is introducing performance-related pay linked to the tables - and senior managers at trusts with consistently low scores could see their pay docked. ",
        "Content": "The NHS has for the first time published league tables ranking every trust in England. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said each trust will be ranked quarterly on the standards of its services, from urgent and emergency care to elective operations and mental health support. The tables see trusts categorised in four segments, with the first reflecting the best performers and the fourth showing the worst. Those doing the best will be rewarded with greater freedoms and investment, while those underperforming will receive targeted support. To allow for fair comparisons, the trusts ware grouped into acute, non-acute and ambulance trusts. Use the tools below to see how yours rank: This will help end the postcode lottery, says Streeting The move is part of the government's 10-year plan to reform the health service. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We must be honest about the state of the NHS to fix it. \"Patients know when local services aren't up to scratch, and they want to see an end to the postcode lottery - that's what this government is doing. \"We're combining the extra £26bn investment each year with tough reforms to get value for money, with every pound helping to cut waiting times for patients.\" Read more:Funding shortfall for weight-loss jabAI tech to be used to free up hospital beds From next year, the NHS will introduce a new wave of Foundation Trusts, giving the best performers more freedom to shape services around local needs, and those in the middle will be encouraged to learn from the top trusts. Meanwhile, those with lower scores will receive enhanced support - and senior leaders will be held accountable with performance-linked pay. Where trusts are persistently failing, senior managers could see their pay docked, the DHSC has said. The best NHS leaders will be offered higher pay to taken on the toughest jobs at challenged services, it added. Health correspondent The trouble with league tables is, however well-intentioned, they become a competition. As soon as I saw the list, I scanned it to see where the trusts I've received care from had been placed. Then I looked for the ones where my family and loved ones had been looked after. It's a completely natural reaction. What comes next is the worry you might feel as a patient about to go into a hospital that has been placed into segment four - the lowest ranking. It means your trust has been identified as one where the standard of care is poor and needs intervention. This isn't, of course, what this list is designed to do: spread fear and panic. Quite the reverse, in fact.  It's supposed to provide transparency. To give patients information and a voice (they'll be asked to give feedback that will affect gradings).  The worst performing trusts will be given more help and the best NHS leaders will be given financial incentives to encourage them to move to these failing hospitals.  This is supposed to end the \"postcode lottery\".  It's a great idea in theory. You cannot stop while that process is under way.  The purpose of the tables, I was reminded, is not to \"name and shame\" but ensure the best quality patient care is standardised across the country. Sir Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS England, said: \"Letting patients and the public access more data will help to drive improvement even faster by supporting them to identify where they should demand even better from their NHS.\" It will also put \"more power in their hands to make informed decisions on their choice of provider\", he said. By summer 2026, the tables will expand to cover integrated care boards, which are the NHS organisations responsible for planning health services for locals."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n        Parents in England will receive redesigned Ofsted report cards from November as part of wide-ranging changes to the way schools are inspected.  The reforms were initiated following a difficult period for Ofsted, after the death of headteacher Ruth Perry last year. Ms Perry took her own life after her Reading primary school was downgraded from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\", prompting criticism of the inspection system. But some - including Ms Perry's sister - have criticised the new system. The new reports will use a colour-coded, five-point grading scale, giving families more detail on areas such as attendance, behaviour, and inclusion. Ofsted says the system will provide \"greater nuance\" than its previous one-word judgments. The grades will range from \"urgent improvement\" and \"needs attention\" up to \"expected standard\", \"strong standard\", and the top mark of \"exceptional\". Additional monitoring inspections will be carried out in schools and colleges that fall below the expected standard, with Ofsted insisting this will ensure action is taken quickly to raise performance. In early years settings, inspections will take place every four years instead of every six, with a sharper focus on the quality of education and care. \n                  Brianna Ghey's mother calls for school smartphone ban\n                 \n                  Schools 'left to pick up the pieces' from 'crumbling public services', says teaching union\n                 \n                  Parents must help tackle schoolchildren's bad behaviour, education secretary says - as figures show 'entrenched class divide'\n                 Inspectors will also assess how well schools support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), and those known to social care, with inclusion given its own grade. Contextual factors will also contribute to the judgements that are made, including the number of children who are eligible for free school meals, and any other socio-economic factors which influence the outcomes for children. To ease pressure on staff, an extra inspector will be added to school inspection teams.  His Majesty's chief inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver, said the changes were designed to \"reset relationships\" with teachers while maintaining public confidence. \"Children deserve the best possible education; their parents deserve the best possible information, and education professionals deserve to have their work fairly assessed,\" he said. \"Our new report cards will give parents a clearer understanding of the strengths and areas for improvement at the places where their children learn. \"We will work with professionals in schools, early years and further education to help them showcase the best of what they do and help them identify where they can improve.\" New system 'makes things much worse', says critic But the new inspection framework has been criticised by some. A coalition made up of school leaders, former inspectors, trade unions and Ms Perry's sister, Professor Julia Waters, is calling for the government to delay the changes. In an open letter, they said: \"Today's announcement is deeply disappointing and extremely worrying, as it is clear Ofsted have failed to learn the lessons from the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. \"The proven life-threatening risks associated with a grades-based schools accountability system, based on public shaming and the fear of high stakes consequences, have not changed.\" They are calling for the roll-out to be halted because of \"continuing concerns about the reliability, accuracy, and consistency of inspection results\" and \"the dangerous, negative impact of a punitive, grades-based inspection system on the welfare of the workforce\". The one-word judgements have been scrapped - well sort of. They have been replaced by two words instead, although \"exceptional\" is still one of the judgements in the new framework. The \"Big Listen\" was the consultation process which was undertaken by Ofsted to provide an opportunity for parents and teachers, alongside other stakeholders, to have input into the process. And there are 21 mentions of the word parent in the new \"toolkit\" for schools, showing Ofsted is relying heavily on parental input. But parental input and voices were never an issue under the old system, so why have they been considered so greatly under the new framework? And will these changes result in the stable and steady teacher workforce that parents need for their children? Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \"Sir Martyn Oliver has failed. He was asked to bring in a system that reduced pressure. \"Removing the single word judgement was meant to be a powerful revolution, but this makes things much worse. More of the same. More pressure. More ranking and competition. More labels.\" Read more:The parents struggling to feed their kidsSupply teachers cost schools more than £1bn However, a YouGov survey commissioned by Ofsted found nearly seven in 10 parents preferred the new format to the current reports, while nine in 10 said they were easier to understand. Jason Elsom, chief executive of Parentkind, the UK's largest parent charity, said: \"For the first time, parental engagement is given clear priority: no school will be able to achieve top marks unless it demonstrates that it has got this right. This is a significant step forward.\""

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  It's been a while since we've seen pictures of both Prince Harry and Prince William out on engagements on the same day in the UK. Geographically, they were closer than they've been in some time, but sadly it seems emotionally still so far apart. Prince Harry had flown in for what him and his team wanted to be a trip with no negativity. The WellChild awards is always an event where he shines. The children don't seem to care who he is or what they ask him. An openness that's also been clear from Harry's team, with much less secrecy than previous trips. The one thing they have been careful to avoid talking about is his relatives, especially as his arrival came on a poignant day for the family. Gun salutes in London marked three years since Queen Elizabeth II died, as the King spent his accession day privately in Scotland. Whether his father will travel to London in time to see Harry this week, the palace won't say. We were told that Harry did go to Windsor to lay flowers as a tribute to his grandmother, taking him even closer to Prince William, who lives on the Windsor estate. But there was no suggestion of a meet-up, as around the same time William was about eight miles away in Sunningdale with the Princess of Wales, sharing stories and tea with members of the Women's Institute who had met his grandmother. Read more from Sky News:Where does your NHS trust rank?New-look Ofsted report cards to be rolled out One thing the two brothers would no doubt be united on, whether they're talking or not, is their desire that we'd all stop fixating on them and focus on the engagements they were doing instead. As a crowd gathered outside the Royal Lancaster Hotel to get a glimpse of Harry, it had been a day which felt like a reminder of how families do go through painful times. With talk of reconciliation and a potential reset, we wait to see if the Windsors are really any closer to moving on."

A lewd birthday message Trump allegedly sent to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been released by Democrats. The letter, surrounded by a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a woman, bearing Trump's name and allegedly his signature, includes the text: \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The alleged note had always been in doubt, as long as the fabled birthday book remained unpublished. There's more certainty now. Trump had repeatedly denied all association, saying: \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women.\" It will amplify questions surrounding his friendship with Epstein and suggestions of improper behaviour. The US president denies any wrongdoing. In suing the publishers of The Wall Street Journal, Trump's attorneys have argued that \"no authentic letter or drawing exists\". Expect arguments over authenticity to continue - forensic investigations, who knows, to establish the provenance of the picture signed \"Donald\".

The birthday book handed over to the Congressional committee had the names and faces of women and minors redacted. The drawing and its publication is the hard piece of evidence that makes it even harder for the president to cry \"hoax\". And yet, he surely will. To admit the picture was drawn by his own hand would be to admit a lie that would bind him tighter still to the scandal that stalks him. A first sight of the drawing is one development in this story, but it's not the only one. Lawyers for the Epstein estate wrote in their covering letter to the committee that they are unaware of the existence of a \"list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking facilitated by Mr Jeffrey Epstein\". It is their word, for public consumption. They'll be aware, as they are in the White House, that on this story, the public would rather make up its own mind."

The National Assembly, like many a political chamber, voted according to its own interests.  The Socialists feel overlooked by Mr Macron and want their own person installed as PM; National Rally, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, want new elections because they are confident of success, and the Far Left simply want to bring down the French president.

The accident took place shortly before 7am (2pm UK time) on a railway crossing in an industrial part of Atlacomulco, a town about 80 miles (130km) northwest of the capital, Mexico City. The state of Mexico's civil defence agency said on X that authorities were still working at the site of the accident, and the state prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation. The attorney general's office said seven women and three men were killed, and some of those injured were in severe condition. Images from the scene show the roof had been ripped from the top of the bus, owned by the passenger bus company Herradura de Plata (Silver Horseshoe). Video on social platforms of what appeared to be CCTV footage of the crossing showed the bus in heavy traffic slowly moving across the train tracks. The train then suddenly appeared, ramming the bus at its midpoint and splitting the vehicle in two. The train's momentum carried the bus down the tracks. The front half came to rest beside the crossing and the rear half further down on the opposite side of the tracks. Authorities did not immediately give details about how the accident could have occurred. There were no visible crossing gates or other stop lights, witnesses said. Miguel Sanchez, 33, who works at a service station about 100 yards away said he heard the train blow its horn ahead of the crossing. \"We heard a crash. We thought it was just a car. We never thought it would be a bus with so many people aboard,\" Mr Sanchez told the AP news agency.

The bus firm Herradura de Plata did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The most recent report from Mexico's Rail Transportation Regulating Agency, published in September, revealed there were 800 accidents at level crossings last year, compared to 602 in 2020.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Sir Keir Starmer will host the first meeting of his new-look cabinet today, as the race to replace Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader gets under way. Left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy has become the first to throw her hat into the ring, after former transport secretary Louise Haigh - who resigned last November - ruled herself out. Politics Hub: Follow latest ahead of PM's cabinet meeting Ms Haigh said she would prefer to stay on the backbenches where she can \"speak plainly and campaign boldly\". Ms Ribeiro-Addy has the backing of the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG), which met in Westminster on Monday night to coalesce around one candidate following criticism of the contest's rules. Hopefuls wishing to enter the race only have until Thursday to secure the backing of 80 of their colleagues, which some backbenchers perceived as a \"stitch-up\" to prevent MPs on the left from standing. In a post on X last night, Ms Ribeiro-Addy said she looked forward to explaining her candidacy \"over the three short and undemocratic days we have to do so\". The Clapham and Brixton Hill MP has been backed by former Corbynite Richard Burgon, who said she \"would ensure Labour members' voices are heard at the top of our party - and not sidelined by yet more stitch-ups\". Brian Leisham, the MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, echoed that praise, writing on X: \"The party needs a strong voice from the left as deputy leader. Someone who will represent the politics and opinions of the rank and file grassroots members who want to see us govern by real Labour values.\" Ms Ribeiro-Addy was sacked as trade envoy for rebelling against the government over welfare cuts in July. MPs keen for non-London candidates Many Labour MPs have said they want a woman to take over from Ms Rayner, who resigned last week after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a new flat. However, they have also said they want someone from outside London to counteract the number of MPs from the capital in government - including Sir Keir's new deputy prime minister, David Lammy. Read more:Who's in and out in Starmer's reshuffle? This might also make things tricky for Dame Emily Thornberry, a fellow London MP who has been approaching colleagues about standing. In a WhatsApp message seen by Sky News, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee said the government has made \"too many mistakes\" on issues like welfare reform and Gaza, and Number 10 \"aren't listening\" to the concerns of backbenchers. But Patrick Hurley, the MP for Southport in Merseyside, told Sky News he would like a deputy leader who is \"geographically closer to home\". Lewis Atkinson, the MP for Sunderland Central, said on X that, given the geographical distribution of the current cabinet, he will also be looking to support \"a non-London woman\". Backbench MPs Callum Anderson and Connor Naismith have expressed a similar view, as have the likes of Labour peer Harriet Harman and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Political reporter The Labour Party rule book sets out how candidates can get on the ballot to stand in the election for deputy party leader. Each nominee must be a sitting member of the Parliamentary Labour Party (a Labour MP), and must be supported by 20% of their fellow members, which currently equates to 80 Labour MPs. The deadline set by the party's governing body to gather the required nominations is 5pm on Thursday 11 September. After that, candidates must win the support of either: • 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs), which are local party groups; • At least three organisations affiliated to the party - at least two of which must be trade unions - that comprise 5% of the affiliated party membership. This process will start on Saturday 13 September, and close on Saturday 27 September. The successful candidates will then appear on the ballot for a vote of all party members and affiliated party supporters, which will open on Wednesday 8 October, and close on Thursday 23 October at 12pm. The winner will be announced on Saturday 25 October. 'We need strong voices pushing for renewal' Northern female MPs being encouraged to stand include the former transport secretary Ms Haigh as well as former Leader of the House of Commons, Lucy Powell, who was sacked in the cabinet reshuffle last week. Ms Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, is understood to be \"taking soundings\" after being approached by colleagues. Ms Haigh, who was forced to resign after it emerged she pleaded guilty to a criminal offence, said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the encouragement she had received from colleagues but would not stand. In a statement to Sky News, she said: \"Labour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain - not simply to steady the ship, but to remake it completely. \"We need strong voices pushing for that renewal: on the economy, on workers' rights, and on climate change. For me, that means remaining on the backbenches for now, where I can speak plainly and campaign boldly.\" Could top ministers enter race? The deputy leader of Labour is an elected position voted on by members. Ms Rayner quit the role, along with her government positions as deputy prime minister and housing secretary, after she was found to have breached the ministerial code for failing to get correct tax advice. It is not clear if a Starmer loyalist will put themselves forward. Many cabinet ministers have ruled themselves out, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Sky News understands Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, from Sunderland, is on the brink of entering the race. Housing minister Alison McGovern, who represents Birkenhead near Liverpool, has also not ruled herself out.  Either of these could end up being Downing Street's preferred choice and would also be popular among MPs who not only want a northern woman, but someone who will work constructively with government rather than oppose it. However, if a minister enters the race and loses, that would be a huge blow to Sir Keir's authority, as the result would widely be seen as a referendum on his leadership and policies. As one backbench MP put it: \"The question is who is willing to be humiliated on behalf of Keir Starmer, so far nobody.\""

        "Content": "The NHS has for the first time published league tables ranking every trust in England. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said each trust will be ranked quarterly on the standards of its services, from urgent and emergency care to elective operations and mental health support. The tables see trusts categorised in four segments, with the first reflecting the best performers and the fourth showing the worst. Those doing the best will be rewarded with greater freedoms and investment, while those underperforming will receive targeted support. To allow for fair comparisons, the trusts ware grouped into acute, non-acute and ambulance trusts. Use the tools below to see how yours rank: This will help end the postcode lottery, says Streeting The move is part of the government's 10-year plan to reform the health service. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We must be honest about the state of the NHS to fix it. \"Patients know when local services aren't up to scratch, and they want to see an end to the postcode lottery - that's what this government is doing. \"We're combining the extra £26bn investment each year with tough reforms to get value for money, with every pound helping to cut waiting times for patients.\" Read more:Funding shortfall for weight-loss jabAI tech to be used to free up hospital beds From next year, the NHS will introduce a new wave of Foundation Trusts, giving the best performers more freedom to shape services around local needs, and those in the middle will be encouraged to learn from the top trusts. Meanwhile, those with lower scores will receive enhanced support - and senior leaders will be held accountable with performance-linked pay. Where trusts are persistently failing, senior managers could see their pay docked, the DHSC has said. The best NHS leaders will be offered higher pay to taken on the toughest jobs at challenged services, it added. Health correspondent The trouble with league tables is, however well-intentioned, they become a competition. As soon as I saw the list, I scanned it to see where the trusts I've received care from had been placed. Then I looked for the ones where my family and loved ones had been looked after. It's a completely natural reaction. What comes next is the worry you might feel as a patient about to go into a hospital that has been placed into segment four - the lowest ranking. It means your trust has been identified as one where the standard of care is poor and needs intervention. This isn't, of course, what this list is designed to do: spread fear and panic. Quite the reverse, in fact.  It's supposed to provide transparency. To give patients information and a voice (they'll be asked to give feedback that will affect gradings).  The worst performing trusts will be given more help and the best NHS leaders will be given financial incentives to encourage them to move to these failing hospitals.  This is supposed to end the \"postcode lottery\".  It's a great idea in theory. You cannot stop while that process is under way.  The purpose of the tables, I was reminded, is not to \"name and shame\" but ensure the best quality patient care is standardised across the country. Sir Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS England, said: \"Letting patients and the public access more data will help to drive improvement even faster by supporting them to identify where they should demand even better from their NHS.\" It will also put \"more power in their hands to make informed decisions on their choice of provider\", he said. By summer 2026, the tables will expand to cover integrated care boards, which are the NHS organisations responsible for planning health services for locals."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n        Parents in England will receive redesigned Ofsted report cards from November as part of wide-ranging changes to the way schools are inspected.  The reforms were initiated following a difficult period for Ofsted, after the death of headteacher Ruth Perry last year. Ms Perry took her own life after her Reading primary school was downgraded from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\", prompting criticism of the inspection system. But some - including Ms Perry's sister - have criticised the new system. The new reports will use a colour-coded, five-point grading scale, giving families more detail on areas such as attendance, behaviour, and inclusion. Ofsted says the system will provide \"greater nuance\" than its previous one-word judgments. The grades will range from \"urgent improvement\" and \"needs attention\" up to \"expected standard\", \"strong standard\", and the top mark of \"exceptional\". Additional monitoring inspections will be carried out in schools and colleges that fall below the expected standard, with Ofsted insisting this will ensure action is taken quickly to raise performance. In early years settings, inspections will take place every four years instead of every six, with a sharper focus on the quality of education and care. \n                  Brianna Ghey's mother calls for school smartphone ban\n                 \n                  Schools 'left to pick up the pieces' from 'crumbling public services', says teaching union\n                 \n                  Parents must help tackle schoolchildren's bad behaviour, education secretary says - as figures show 'entrenched class divide'\n                 Inspectors will also assess how well schools support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), and those known to social care, with inclusion given its own grade. Contextual factors will also contribute to the judgements that are made, including the number of children who are eligible for free school meals, and any other socio-economic factors which influence the outcomes for children. To ease pressure on staff, an extra inspector will be added to school inspection teams.  His Majesty's chief inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver, said the changes were designed to \"reset relationships\" with teachers while maintaining public confidence. \"Children deserve the best possible education; their parents deserve the best possible information, and education professionals deserve to have their work fairly assessed,\" he said. \"Our new report cards will give parents a clearer understanding of the strengths and areas for improvement at the places where their children learn. \"We will work with professionals in schools, early years and further education to help them showcase the best of what they do and help them identify where they can improve.\" New system 'makes things much worse', says critic But the new inspection framework has been criticised by some. A coalition made up of school leaders, former inspectors, trade unions and Ms Perry's sister, Professor Julia Waters, is calling for the government to delay the changes. In an open letter, they said: \"Today's announcement is deeply disappointing and extremely worrying, as it is clear Ofsted have failed to learn the lessons from the death of headteacher Ruth Perry. \"The proven life-threatening risks associated with a grades-based schools accountability system, based on public shaming and the fear of high stakes consequences, have not changed.\" They are calling for the roll-out to be halted because of \"continuing concerns about the reliability, accuracy, and consistency of inspection results\" and \"the dangerous, negative impact of a punitive, grades-based inspection system on the welfare of the workforce\". The one-word judgements have been scrapped - well sort of. They have been replaced by two words instead, although \"exceptional\" is still one of the judgements in the new framework. The \"Big Listen\" was the consultation process which was undertaken by Ofsted to provide an opportunity for parents and teachers, alongside other stakeholders, to have input into the process. And there are 21 mentions of the word parent in the new \"toolkit\" for schools, showing Ofsted is relying heavily on parental input. But parental input and voices were never an issue under the old system, so why have they been considered so greatly under the new framework? And will these changes result in the stable and steady teacher workforce that parents need for their children? Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \"Sir Martyn Oliver has failed. He was asked to bring in a system that reduced pressure. \"Removing the single word judgement was meant to be a powerful revolution, but this makes things much worse. More of the same. More pressure. More ranking and competition. More labels.\" Read more:The parents struggling to feed their kidsSupply teachers cost schools more than £1bn However, a YouGov survey commissioned by Ofsted found nearly seven in 10 parents preferred the new format to the current reports, while nine in 10 said they were easier to understand. Jason Elsom, chief executive of Parentkind, the UK's largest parent charity, said: \"For the first time, parental engagement is given clear priority: no school will be able to achieve top marks unless it demonstrates that it has got this right. This is a significant step forward.\""

Geographically, they were closer than they've been in some time, but sadly it seems emotionally still so far apart. Prince Harry had flown in for what him and his team wanted to be a trip with no negativity. The WellChild awards is always an event where he shines. The children don't seem to care who he is or what they ask him. An openness that's also been clear from Harry's team, with much less secrecy than previous trips. The one thing they have been careful to avoid talking about is his relatives, especially as his arrival came on a poignant day for the family. Gun salutes in London marked three years since Queen Elizabeth II died, as the King spent his accession day privately in Scotland. Whether his father will travel to London in time to see Harry this week, the palace won't say. We were told that Harry did go to Windsor to lay flowers as a tribute to his grandmother, taking him even closer to Prince William, who lives on the Windsor estate. But there was no suggestion of a meet-up, as around the same time William was about eight miles away in Sunningdale with the Princess of Wales, sharing stories and tea with members of the Women's Institute who had met his grandmother.

With talk of reconciliation and a potential reset, we wait to see if the Windsors are really any closer to moving on."

Speaking to broadcasters, Shabana Mahmood repeatedly said that her \"top priority\" is to \"secure our borders\", and called on countries to take back their citizens if they have no right to be in the UK. The government is under vast pressure to stop small boats crossing the English Channel - over 30,000 people have arrived so far this year, including over 1,000 people on Saturday alone. Politics latest: Home secretary rules out standing for deputy Labour leader The new home secretary is hosting her counterparts from fellow members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance - which includes the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand - to discuss \"what more we can do to work together to make sure that our borders are secure and that all citizens feel safe\". Speaking to broadcasters during the summit, Ms Mahmood said: \"For countries that do not play ball, we've been talking about how we can take much more co-ordinated action between the Five Eyes countries. \"For us, that means including possibly the cutting of visas in the future, just to say, you know, we do expect countries to play ball, play by the rules, and if one of your citizens has no right to be in our country, you do need to take them back.\" She repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop small boat crossings, and she rejected the suggestion that she is emulating policies already proposed by other parties, saying: \"This is a Labour government with Labour policy and Labour proposals. \"We've been looking at this for some time. It's been discussed already across the government, and I'm very clear that there has to be a strong approach to maintaining our border, and that does mean saying to countries who do not take their citizens back that we're not simply going to allow our laws to remain unenforced.\"  👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 But shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"All we get from Labour are tough words. I urged them to immediately use the powers which the last government created some months ago, but nothing has happened. We should also cut overseas aid to countries not taking back their own nationals. \"This Labour government is too weak to take the steps necessary to protect our borders, and I see no sign of that changing any time soon.\" Ms Mahmood also suggested that the government could roll out digital ID as part of measures to prevent illegal working and reduce the \"pull factors\" that draw migrants to the UK. While she has long been personally in favour of them, she said the government current position is to \"look at\" them, and she will be \"discussing\" the possibility of rolling them out with government colleagues. Balance between human rights and securing borders The home secretary also reiterated that the UK will not be leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) - as Reform UK and some in the Tory party have called for - because that would have \"other consequences that we think are not in our national interest\".  \"We absolutely see the case for reform primarily in our domestic, legal framework, tightening up the rules,\" she said. \"In the end, this is about how you strike the balance between human rights on the one hand, and securing our borders. I do think that that balance isn't in the right place at the moment. That's why we will come forward with changes to our domestic legislation and the guidance in terms of how we apply some of the convention rights legally here at home.\" She added that she will continue work she started in her previous post of justice secretary to reform the convention and ensure it is \"fit for purpose in the modern era\".  Ms Mahmood's comments come on her third day in her new role of home secretary, which she was given in a wide-ranging cabinet and ministerial reshuffle, triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner as housing secretary and deputy prime minister on Friday, after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a new property. There was a clear out of the ministerial team in the Home Office, with new ministers brought in as the government seeks to get a grip on small boat crossings and close asylum hotels amid protests. Dover MP Mike Tapp - a strong proponent of taking tough measures to break up criminal gangs and stop boats landing on British shores - is one of those MPs who has been given his first ministerial role in the Home Office."

The Duke of Sussex arrived in the UK on Monday and visited the royal residence, where he left flowers for the former monarch on the third anniversary of the late Queen's death. Harry then attended the annual WellChild Awards in London, amid speculation his trip could include meetings with his brother, Prince William, or his father, the King. The WellChild Awards marked the first time the Duke of Sussex, who is the charity's patron, has returned to the UK in five months. Harry was pictured speaking with seriously ill youngsters ahead of a glittering awards ceremony, which aims to recognise their efforts to succeed and thrive despite life-threatening conditions. He appeared to allude to his strained relationship with William while chatting with Declan Bitmead, 17, when Harry learned the teenager had a younger brother. \"Does he drive you mad?\" Harry asked, and Declan replied: \"No, we get on fine\". But when Harry, who followed William to Eton, learned that Declan and his brother went to the same school, he said: \"That sometimes makes it more challenging.''

Prince Harry has flown in for what him and his team want to be a trip with no negativity. The WellChild awards is always an event where he shines.  The children don't seem to care who he is or what they ask him. An openness that's also been clear from Harry's team, with much less secrecy than previous trips. The one thing they have been careful to avoid talking about is his relatives, especially as his arrival came on a poignant day for the family. Gun salutes in London marking three years since Queen Elizabeth died, as the King spent his accession day privately in Scotland.  Whether his father will travel to London in time to see Harry this week, the palace won't say. We were told that Harry did go to Windsor to lay flowers as a tribute to his grandmother, taking him even closer to Prince William who lives on the Windsor estate. But there was no suggestion of a meet-up, as around the same time William was about eight miles away in Sunningdale with the Princess of Wales, sharing stories and tea with members of the Women's Institute who had met his grandmother. One thing the two brothers would no doubt be united on, whether they're talking or not, is their desire that we'd all stop fixating on them and focus on the engagements they were doing instead. As a crowd gathered outside the Royal Lancaster Hotel to get a glimpse of Harry, it had been a day which felt like a reminder of how families do go through painful times. With talk of reconciliation and a potential reset, we wait to see if the Windsors are really any closer to moving on. Harry has had little contact with his father and elder brother, since he and his wife, gave up royal duties and moved to California in 2020. Harry and Charles last met face-to-face more than a year and a half ago, after the duke rushed over from his home in the US to see the King following his cancer diagnosis.

Harry was last in London in April, when the Court of Appeal rejected his bid to restore police protection that was cancelled after he stopped being a working royal."

        "Content": "A pensioner attempted to smuggle cocaine worth £600,000 in his mobility scooter before he was stopped at Gatwick Airport. Ronald Lord, 71, has been jailed for six years after the thwarted attempt in February this year. Mr Lord, from Montreal, Canada, claimed he had been on a seven-day holiday to Barbados before heading to the UK for sightseeing. But Border Force x-rayed his scooter and found eight kilos of the class A drug hidden in a void in the seat back panel. The haul was valued at around £640,000, at street-level prices, by experts from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). Mr Lord told NCA investigators he didn't know how it got there, denying any knowledge. But, during the search, a screw from the panel was found in his pocket. Investigators, who carried out checks with airlines, also found he had lied about his time in Barbados. They found he had only been there three days before travelling to the UK. Mr Lord admitted the class A drug smuggling charges at Croydon Crown Court on 5 August. He was sentenced to six years in prison at the same court on 5 September. Read more from Sky News:Terminal at Heathrow Airport evacuatedNew Banksy artwork is quickly covered up NCA Senior Investigating Officer, Richard Wickham, said: \"Organised crime groups need smugglers like Mr Lord to bring class A drugs into the UK, where they are sold for huge profit by gangs who deal in violence and exploitation.\"He obviously thought that because he was a pensioner, he would be less of a target for law enforcement. He was wrong, and I hope this case sends out a message to anyone who would consider doing the same.\"Working with partners like Border Force, the NCA is determined to do all we can to stop class A drugs finding their way into the hands of criminal gangs, and target those involved in helping them.\""

        "Content": " France's prime minister has failed in a last-minute bid to save his job, with the country's National Assembly ousting him in a confidence vote. Francois Bayrou - who entered office just nine months ago - is required to submit the resignation of his minority government after losing Monday afternoon's vote by an overwhelming 364-194. The outgoing prime minister is paying the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, as he gambled that lawmakers would back his view that France should slash public spending to address its growing economic issues.   Earlier in the day, Mr Bayrou called for unity as he attempted to win support for both his premiership and his ambitious plan to curb France's public spending. Arguing the country's spiralling public deficits are threatening the future of the European Union's second-largest economy, Mr Bayrou said state debts will weigh on future generations and leave France vulnerable to foreign creditors. \"Our country works, thinks it's getting richer, but keeps getting poorer,\" he said, pausing for sips of water when hecklers tried to drown him out. Mr Bayrou had proposed to cut a huge €44bn (£38.1bn) in spending in 2026.  But his plan - which included the removal of two public holidays - was heavily criticised by his political rivals, who sensed a golden opportunity to bring him down. Addressing the confidence vote, he said: \"Our country has an urgent need for lucidity, it has the most urgent need for unity. But it is division that threatens to prevail, that threatens its image and reputation.\" Europe correspondent The result was never in question, but it has thrown real doubt over France's future. Francois Bayrou gambled and lost. France's prime minister called a surprise vote of no confidence in late August, and this evening the National Assembly in Paris voted to oust him from office. It leaves France with no solution to a worsening economic crisis and President Emmanuel Macron with few good options. He is now forced to look for a new prime minister, his fifth in a little over two years. But there is no guarantee this will break a parliamentary deadlock that is of his own making after he lost his parliamentary majority following snap elections in 2024. Read more Mathilde Panot of the hard-left France Unbowed, told Mr Bayrou in the debate before the vote: \"Today is a day of relief for millions of French people, of relief over your departure.\" Marine Le Pen said: \"This moment marks the end of the agony of a phantom government.\" What happens next?  France's President Emmanuel Macron now faces finding another government chief - the country's fourth in 12 months - after Mr Bayrou tenders his resignation on Tuesday. Mr Macron is facing a narrowing set of options, and financial markets are signalling worry at France's political and financial crisis. More from Sky News:France's spending crisis explainedAustralian mum jailed over mushroom poisoning He could nominate a politician from his own centrist minority ruling group for the top job, or someone from the ranks of conservatives, but that would mean doubling down on a strategy that has failed to secure stability. Mr Macron could also nominate someone on the left, but no scenario is likely to hand the next government a majority. The president has so far resisted calls from France's far-right and far-left factions to call a snap parliamentary election as he did in June last year - which was the root of the latest government collapse."

The National Assembly, like many a political chamber, voted according to its own interests.  The Socialists feel overlooked by Mr Macron and want their own person installed as PM; National Rally, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, want new elections because they are confident of success, and the Far Left simply want to bring down the French president. Mr Bayrou's argument to reform the economy, however sound, fell on deaf ears. He warned that without swift and sweeping reforms, France would continue staggering \"towards the edge of a cliff\". His opponents didn't buy it - they accuse him of scaremongering and blame the instability on Mr Macron's eight years in power.

        "Content": "A freight train has collided with a double-decker bus in Mexico, shearing it in two and killing at least 10 people while injuring 41 others, authorities said. The accident took place shortly before 7am (2pm UK time) on a railway crossing in an industrial part of Atlacomulco, a town about 80 miles (130km) northwest of the capital, Mexico City. The state of Mexico's civil defence agency said on X that authorities were still working at the site of the accident, and the state prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation. The attorney general's office said seven women and three men were killed, and some of those injured were in severe condition. Images from the scene show the roof had been ripped from the top of the bus, owned by the passenger bus company Herradura de Plata (Silver Horseshoe). Video on social platforms of what appeared to be CCTV footage of the crossing showed the bus in heavy traffic slowly moving across the train tracks. The train then suddenly appeared, ramming the bus at its midpoint and splitting the vehicle in two. The train's momentum carried the bus down the tracks. The front half came to rest beside the crossing and the rear half further down on the opposite side of the tracks. Authorities did not immediately give details about how the accident could have occurred. There were no visible crossing gates or other stop lights, witnesses said. Miguel Sanchez, 33, who works at a service station about 100 yards away said he heard the train blow its horn ahead of the crossing. \"We heard a crash. We thought it was just a car. We never thought it would be a bus with so many people aboard,\" Mr Sanchez told the AP news agency.

The Calgary-based company said its personnel were on site and cooperating with authorities. It also called on drivers to respect road signs and stop orders at railroad crossings. The bus firm Herradura de Plata did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The most recent report from Mexico's Rail Transportation Regulating Agency, published in September, revealed there were 800 accidents at level crossings last year, compared to 602 in 2020. Last month, six people died when a train hit several vehicles in Guanajuato state. In 2019, nine people were killed when a freight train struck a passenger bus crossing the tracks in the central state of Queretaro."

Footage from a dashboard camera showed dozens of people fleeing from a bus stop as shots rang out. Paramedics who responded said the scene was chaotic and covered in broken glass, with people wounded and lying unconscious on the road and a pavement near the bus stop. The two attackers, who Israeli media said were believed to have set out from two villages in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, were shot dead by police. A third suspect was later arrested. Palestinian militant group Hamas praised two Palestinian \"resistance fighters\" who it said had carried out the attack, but it stopped short of claiming responsibility. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited the scene at Ramot Junction and is assessing, with his heads of security, what happened. He sent condolences to the families of the victims and said Israel was \"in an intense war against terror on several fronts\". He vowed: \"We are now in pursuit, sieging the villages from which the murderers came. And we will get everyone who helped them, everyone who sent them, and we will carry out even tougher measures.\" It is understood a total of about 15 people were injured - with six in a serious condition - after the attackers opened fire as the bus reached a major intersection at the northern entrance to Jerusalem, on a road that leads to Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem.

Other casualties have been evacuated from the scene to hospitals in Jerusalem. A number are said to be in a serious condition with gunshot wounds. Several people with minor injuries from glass shards were treated at the roadside. The shooting is sure to ignite tensions in the region. Even before it happened, Israel had vowed to ramp up airstrikes on Gaza in a \"mighty hurricane\", to serve as a last warning to Hamas that it will destroy the enclave unless fighters accept a demand from US President Donald Trump to free all hostages and surrender.

A series of bomb threats against the Harris family home were phoned to police stations in Wexford and Wicklow yesterday. It's the third time in a week that the Harris family have been threatened in what the deputy prime minister, or Tanaiste, claims is a \"sinister\" campaign to \"intimidate\" him out of public office. \"Imagine how anybody would feel if in the last week somebody threatened to kidnap a child, carry out extreme violence against a close family relative and blow up your house\", Harris said to reporters today. \"That's all happened in the last seven days, to me this time, to who else next time. I'm not willing to gloss over that fact. \"This is not something that deserves to go up and down the news agenda. Somebody will get seriously hurt in this country. We've to start taking security in this country seriously.\" He said that the Special Detective Unit of the Irish police force, known as the Gardai, is investigating the threats.

Thomas Phillips and his two daughters and son, believed to be aged 9, 10 and 12, had been evading police since December 2021 in a remote part of the country's North Island. While formal identification has yet to take place, New Zealand's acting deputy police commissioner Jill Rogers said at a news conference on Monday: \"We believe him to be Tom Phillips.\" His relatives confirmed his death to local news outlets. A police officer was shot in the head and critically injured during the confrontation with Phillips, who he is believed to have robbed a farm supplies shop in the Waikato region in the early hours of Monday morning, Ms Rogers said.

        "Content": "\n          Crime correspondent\n              @skymartinbrunt\n  A woman investigated over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has told Sky News she was shocked by the police interest in her. Portuguese and British police investigated the German woman seven years ago while their focus was on a theory Madeleine woke up, got out of her family's Praia da Luz holiday apartment through an unlocked patio door and was killed in a hit-and-run accident. This was just before Christian B emerged as the prime suspect over the three-year-old British girl's disappearance in 2007. He is expected to be released from a German jail next week at the end of a sentence for raping an elderly woman in Praia da Luz in 2005. The hit-and-run theory was leaked to Portugal's Correio da Manha newspaper in June. It didn't identify the woman, but the report suggested the investigation fizzled out because German authorities refused to get involved and deploy an undercover detective to befriend the suspect. We tracked down the German woman, and she said she was not aware she had been under suspicion. She told us she'd been working in a restaurant near the beach in Praia da Luz and got home after the time Madeleine was discovered missing from her bed. Her British partner was a chef at the Ocean Club who had served dinner to the McCanns and their friends. \"I don't even know if there was a car accident, because I was working,\" she said. \"I came home at half ten, and my boyfriend was home already.\" Their flat, like the homes of many residents, was searched by Portuguese police in the days after Madeleine vanished. 'Do you think I've cut her up?' The German woman said she got angry during a second search when she was asked to empty her freezer and asked a police officer: \"Do you think I've cut her up in little pieces and I'm going to have her for dinner?\" The woman said that more than 10 years later, German police contacted her, but only to ask her if she knew Christian B and had seen him near the McCanns' apartment. She said: \"They wanted to know if I ever saw this German bloke around this area where I was living for a long time. Other people obviously saw his van, but I never saw it.\" The woman told us a German police commissar - equivalent to an inspector - called her several times over more than a year. He asked for the SIM card from a phone she used when she was living in Portugal. That might suggest the officer was fishing for more than information about Christian B. Local reports alleged the woman may have borrowed a car, but she said: \"Do you think I ran her over? I didn't even have a car at the time.\" She was unaware of the Portuguese newspaper report in June until we told her. \"Why didn't my friends tell me and call me about this?\" she said. The family of the woman's British partner, who has since died, told us they had been questioned by detectives from Scotland Yard's Operation Grange, which is supporting the German and Portuguese police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. When asked about the investigation into the German woman, a Met Police spokesperson said: \"We continue to support Madeleine's family to understand what happened on the evening of 3 May 2007 in Praia da Luz. This includes working with our colleagues in Germany and Portugal. \"Our thoughts remain with the family and it would be inappropriate to comment further while enquiries continue.\" Christian B warned not to return to Portugal The night before Madeleine's disappearance, her parents said she had woken up crying, and the next day she had asked where they had been. Part of the hit-and-run theory is that she might have gone looking for them. But Madeleine's mother, Kate, has long dismissed the suggestion that her daughter managed to get out of the apartment alone. In her book entitled Madeleine, she wrote: \"To give any credence whatsoever to the idea Madeleine could have walked out on her own you would have to accept that she had gone out the back way, pulling aside the sitting room curtains and drawing them again, then opening the patio door, the child safety gate at the top of the stairs on the veranda and the little gate to the road - and carefully closing all three behind her. \"What three-year-old do you know who would do that?\" It appears police played down the hit-and-run theory when their case against Christian B began to look more promising. Christian B remains under investigation and has been warned not to return to Portugal when he is freed from jail. Ex-pat Ken Ralphs, who knew the German drifter at the time Madeleine vanished, told us: \"I think he's a danger to society. \"It's going to make a lot of children and women feel vulnerable again. He's an injurious monster as far as I'm concerned.\" Mr Ralphs, a former community campaigner from Stockport, told Sky News last year about a mutual friend, a fellow Briton, who claimed to have got involved in a plot with Christian B, a convicted child sex offender. The alleged plan, a week before Madeleine vanished, was to steal a child to sell to a childless couple. All three men were part of an off-grid community living in camper vans near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished. Mr Ralphs, who lives outside Luz, said: \"Christian wouldn't be welcomed back by many people here. I'm not worried about him personally, but there are others who are concerned. If he turns up here, I'll be watching him 24/7.\" Christian B, 48, who cannot be fully identified under German privacy laws, is thought by investigators to have kidnapped and murdered Madeleine, but he hasn't been charged and denies any involvement. Christian B 'will be forever connected with Madeleine case' Mr Ralphs' damning view of the suspect echoes that of the German prosecutor investigating the Madeleine case. Hans Christian Wolters said a psychiatrist had assessed Christian B as dangerous and \"similar crimes, especially sexual offences, are to be expected from him again\". \"We do consider him very dangerous and assume there is a risk of reoffending,\" he said. He added: \"For us, he is still the only suspect in the case. We continue to assume that he is responsible for her [Madeleine] disappearance and ultimately also for her death.\" Ahead of Christian B's release, the German authorities are to try to persuade a judge to impose restrictions on him: an electronic tag, a curfew, a fixed address or even a travel ban. The Portuguese lawyer who represented Christian B when he was convicted of diesel theft in the Algarve in 2006 believes he will never shake off the suspicion over Madeleine.

        "Content": " A lewd birthday message Donald Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein has been released by Democrats. The US president has denied writing the letter or creating a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a woman around the text. The letter, bearing Mr Trump's name and allegedly his signature, includes the words: \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret.\" Mr Trump has called a report on the letter \"false, malicious, and defamatory\". \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" Mr Trump said. The letter was included as part of a 2003 album compiled for Epstein's birthday. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee received a copy of the birthday album on Monday as part of a batch of documents from the estate of convicted sex offender Epstein. Mr Trump has already filed a $10bn (£7.3bn) lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a report in July on the alleged letter. After the letter was released on Monday, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted pictures on X of Trump's signature and tagged The Wall Street Journal's parent corporation, News Corp, writing: \"Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it's not his signature. DEFAMATION!\" Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said: \"The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire 'Birthday Card' story is false. \"As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it. President Trump's legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation.\" The letter's disclosure comes amid a bipartisan demand in Congress for the release of the so-called Epstein files amid years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Calls for the release of the records came from Republicans, including JD Vance before he was sworn in as vice-president. Read more from Sky News:Six killed in Jerusalem shootingAustralian mum jailed over mushroom poisoning US correspondent Finally, we see the look of the evidence and it doesn't look great for Donald Trump. It had always been in doubt, as long as the fabled birthday book remained unpublished. There's more certainty now. Donald Trump had repeatedly denied all association, saying: \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women.\" It will amplify questions surrounding Donald Trump's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and suggestions of improper behaviour. The US president denies any wrongdoing. In suing the publishers of the Wall Street Journal, Trump's attorneys have argued that \"no authentic letter or drawing exists\". Expect arguments over authenticity to continue - forensic investigations, who knows, to establish the provenance of the picture signed \"Donald\". What isn't in doubt is the traction it will lend to calls for a full release of the Epstein files. The birthday book handed over to the Congressional committee had the names and faces of women and minors redacted. The drawing and its publication is the hard piece of evidence that makes it even harder for the president to cry \"hoax\". And yet, he surely will. To admit the picture was drawn by his own hand would be to admit a lie that would bind him tighter still to the scandal that stalks him. A first sight of the drawing is one development in this story but it's not the only one. Lawyers for the Epstein estate wrote in their covering letter to the committee that they are unaware of the existence of a \"list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking facilitated by Mr Jeffrey Epstein\". It is their word, for public consumption. They'll be aware, as they are in the White House, that on this story, the public would rather make up its own mind. In June 2008 Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls."

        "Content": "The trial of a man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump while he played golf has started, with jury selection underway.  Ryan Routh, 59, was arrested after a rifle was seen poking through bushes at Mr Trump's West Palm Beach golf course in Florida on 15 September last year. The incident occurred weeks after a bullet grazed the president's ear in another assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Routh, who faces the prospect of life in prison, has pleaded not guilty to all five charges against him. He has also opted to defend himself in court - an unusual move that legal experts say could add an unpredictable element to the trial. Here is all you need to know as legal proceedings begin in Fort Pierce, Florida. What did Routh allegedly do? Prosecutors allege Routh, a construction worker from North Carolina, was \"lying in wait\" with a rifle near the sixth hole of the Florida golf course when Mr Trump was playing. A Secret Service agent, who was patrolling the course ahead of Mr Trump, spotted a rifle barrel coming out of a perimeter fence. After seeing Routh, the agent opened fire, causing him to flee the scene in a black Nissan SUV. He was later arrested on a motorway about 46 miles from the golf course. Mr Trump was uninjured in the incident, and there is no evidence that Routh fired his weapon at the golf course. Months before his arrest, Routh allegedly wrote a note signalling his intention to kill the president. The note, which was left in a box at the house of an unidentified person, was headlined \"Dear World\" and allegedly said: \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you.\" A handwritten list of dates and locations where Mr Trump was expected to be was also found on him, according to prosecutors. What are the charges? Routh is facing five felony counts in relation to the alleged assassination attempt. They include: • Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate;• Possessing a firearm to carry out a violent crime;• Assaulting a federal officer;• Felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition;• Possession of a firearm with an obliterated (removed) serial number. In addition to the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder. How will the trial unfold? The trial will begin on 8 September with the selection of the jury. Lawyers aim to find 12 jurors and four alternates, with the process expected to last three days. Opening statements are then scheduled to begin on Thursday 11 September, and prosecutors will begin their case immediately after that. Prosecutors will have to convince a jury that Routh both intended to kill Mr Trump and took a substantial step toward doing so. Mr Trump is not expected to attend court or give evidence. The court has scheduled four weeks for the trial, but lawyers expect it will not last that long. Why is Routh defending himself? Routh, who has no formal legal training, is set to deliver opening and closing statements, question witnesses and present evidence on his own behalf. In a letter to US district judge, Aileen Cannon, Routh said it was \"ridiculous\" to consider a \"random stranger that knows nothing of who I am to speak for me\". He added: \"Best I walk alone.\" Routh's two former lawyers will serve as \"standby counsel,\" where they can provide him with advice if called upon. He will also face strict limits on his ability to deliver political or ideological arguments at trial. Read more from Sky News:Trump orders 'take down' of 44-year-old peace vigilTrump rebrands Pentagon as the Department of War Criminal defendants have a legal right to self-representation, but experts say Routh's decision increases the chance of legal risks. \"If his sole goal is to be acquitted, then his chances probably go down,\" Erica Hashimoto, a law professor at Georgetown University, said. \"If he has something else that he's trying to do by going to trial, then representing himself may be the only way to do that.\" Who is the judge? District judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Mr Trump during his first term, is presiding over the case. She also oversaw the criminal case accusing Mr Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents, a case which she threw out, to the consternation of Trump critics. Ms Cannon has already ruled that some of Routh's prior writings, which he sought to show the jury, cannot be presented as evidence. She has also ordered against him using witness testimony as a \"tool for calculated chaos\". It comes as Routh previously suggested trading himself for a prisoner held by China or Iran, and unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena (order to court) Mr Trump himself, according to The New York Times."

Screenwriters, producers, actors and directors have signed a pledge created by Film Makers for Palestine in the latest show of celebrities speaking out against the humanitarian situation in Gaza. They will boycott Israeli film institutions and companies, which they say are \"implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people\". Some of the biggest names in film have signed the pledge, Riz Ahmed, Miriam Margolyes, Juliet Stevenson and Ken Loach also among them. Writer-directors such as The Lobster director Yorgos Lanthimos and British filmmaker Asif Kapadia, who made documentaries Senna, Amy and Diego Maradona, and producers such as two-time BAFTA winner James Wilson and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy producer Robyn Slovo have also signed the pledge. Palme d'Or and BAFTA-winning producer Rebecca O'Brien, who produced I, Daniel Blake with Ken Loach, told Sky News: \"For decades, Israeli festivals, broadcasters, and production companies have played their role in masking and justifying Israel's system of apartheid and its war crimes - some through direct government partnerships. \"I refuse to let my work be used to whitewash a genocide.\" \n                  Jerusalem bus shooting will exacerbate already high tensions between Israelis and Palestinians\n                 \n                  Six killed in rush hour bus shooting in Jerusalem\n                 \n                  Anger over Israeli president's planned visit to UK - as ministers urged not to meet him\n                 Israel has repeatedly said its actions in Gaza are justified as a means of self-defence and denied they amount to genocide. After the world's leading association of genocide scholars, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, declared Israel is committing genocide in Gaza last week, the Israeli foreign ministry said it was based on \"Hamas lies\" and poor research. The boycott pledge urges the industry to \"refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation and to do everything humanly possible to end complicity in their oppression\". The declaration was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, founded by award-winning filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Jonathan Demme in 1987, which led to more than 100 prominent filmmakers refusing to screen their films in apartheid South Africa.

In May, Sky News exclusively reported a letter signed by more than 300 famous names urging Sir Keir Starmer to \"end UK complicity\" in Gaza. Benedict Cumberbatch, Annie Lennox, Gary Lineker and Dua Lipa were among the public figures joining leading doctors, academics, campaign groups and a Holocaust survivor. In June, more celebrities added their names to the letter to try to push the government to act after they said nothing had changed.

The spokesman also said the government suspended export licences to Israel last year \"for items used in military operations in Gaza\" and called for a ceasefire agreement.  More than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Strip since the war began, Hamas-run Gaza health authorities say. The war was sparked by Hamas's attack on Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages. Of the 48 hostages still held in Gaza, 20 are believed to still be alive. Over the past few weeks, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have been preparing to intensify the war after the government vowed to gain full military control of Gaza to defeat Hamas."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  Once upon a time if folks wanted to pinpoint the most economically-vulnerable country in Europe - the one most likely to face a crisis - they would invariably point to Greece or to Italy. They were the nations with the eye-wateringly high bond yields, signalling how reluctant financiers were to lend them money. Today, however, all of that has changed. The country invariably highlighted as Europe's problem child is France. Indeed, look at the interest rates investors charge European nations and France faces even higher interest rates than Greece. And these economic travails are central to understanding the political difficulties France is facing right now, with one prime minister after another resigning in the face of a parliamentary setback. Read more:French PM looks set to lose confidence vote  \n                  Emmanuel Macron will now have to find new PM - with no guarantee this will break parliamentary deadlock\n                 \n                  French PM loses confidence vote - as country's political crisis deepens\n                 \n                  France on brink of economic and political crisis as PM looks set to lose confidence vote\n                 It mostly comes back to the state of the public finances. France's deficit is among the highest in the developed world right now. Everyone spent enormous sums during the pandemic. But France has struggled, more than nearly everyone else, to bring its spending back down and, hence, to reduce its deficit. Successive budget plans have been announced and then shelved in the face of political resistance. France's government spends more, as a percentage of gross domestic product, than any other developed economy. The government's most recent budget plans called for what most people would see as relatively minor spending cuts - barely more than a couple of percentage points off spending, after which France would still be the third biggest spender in the world. But even these cuts were too controversial for the French people, or rather their politicians. Yet another prime minister looks likely to fall victim to an unsuccessful bill. Deja vu all over again, you might say. A deeper issue is that the latest worsening in France's public finances isn't just a sign of political resistance, or indeed of a nation that can't bear to take the unpalatable fiscal medicine others (for instance Greece or the UK) have long been ingesting. For years, France could rely on a phenomenon many other developed economies couldn't: strong productivity growth. The country's people might not work as many hours as everyone else, but they sure created a lot of economic output when they were at their desks. However, in recent years, French productivity has disappointed. Indeed, output per hour growth in France has dropped well below other nations, which in turn means less tax revenue and, lo and behold, the deficit gets bigger and bigger. All of which is why so many people, including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou himself, have warned that France is at risk of a market meltdown. In a recent speech, he pointed to the example of Liz Truss and her 2022 mini-Budget. Beware the market, he said. You never know how close you are to a crisis."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Sir Keir Starmer will host the first meeting of his new-look cabinet today, as the race to replace Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader gets under way. Left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy has become the first to throw her hat into the ring, after former transport secretary Louise Haigh - who resigned last November - ruled herself out. Politics Hub: Follow latest ahead of PM's cabinet meeting Ms Haigh said she would prefer to stay on the backbenches where she can \"speak plainly and campaign boldly\". Ms Ribeiro-Addy has the backing of the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG), which met in Westminster on Monday night to coalesce around one candidate following criticism of the contest's rules. Hopefuls wishing to enter the race only have until Thursday to secure the backing of 80 of their colleagues, which some backbenchers perceived as a \"stitch-up\" to prevent MPs on the left from standing. In a post on X last night, Ms Ribeiro-Addy said she looked forward to explaining her candidacy \"over the three short and undemocratic days we have to do so\". The Clapham and Brixton Hill MP has been backed by former Corbynite Richard Burgon, who said she \"would ensure Labour members' voices are heard at the top of our party - and not sidelined by yet more stitch-ups\". Brian Leisham, the MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, echoed that praise, writing on X: \"The party needs a strong voice from the left as deputy leader. Someone who will represent the politics and opinions of the rank and file grassroots members who want to see us govern by real Labour values.\" Ms Ribeiro-Addy was sacked as trade envoy for rebelling against the government over welfare cuts in July. MPs keen for non-London candidates Many Labour MPs have said they want a woman to take over from Ms Rayner, who resigned last week after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a new flat. However, they have also said they want someone from outside London to counteract the number of MPs from the capital in government - including Sir Keir's new deputy prime minister, David Lammy. Read more:Who's in and out in Starmer's reshuffle? This might also make things tricky for Dame Emily Thornberry, a fellow London MP who has been approaching colleagues about standing. In a WhatsApp message seen by Sky News, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee said the government has made \"too many mistakes\" on issues like welfare reform and Gaza, and Number 10 \"aren't listening\" to the concerns of backbenchers. But Patrick Hurley, the MP for Southport in Merseyside, told Sky News he would like a deputy leader who is \"geographically closer to home\". Lewis Atkinson, the MP for Sunderland Central, said on X that, given the geographical distribution of the current cabinet, he will also be looking to support \"a non-London woman\". Backbench MPs Callum Anderson and Connor Naismith have expressed a similar view, as have the likes of Labour peer Harriet Harman and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Political reporter The Labour Party rule book sets out how candidates can get on the ballot to stand in the election for deputy party leader. Each nominee must be a sitting member of the Parliamentary Labour Party (a Labour MP), and must be supported by 20% of their fellow members, which currently equates to 80 Labour MPs. The deadline set by the party's governing body to gather the required nominations is 5pm on Thursday 11 September. After that, candidates must win the support of either: • 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs), which are local party groups; • At least three organisations affiliated to the party - at least two of which must be trade unions - that comprise 5% of the affiliated party membership. This process will start on Saturday 13 September, and close on Saturday 27 September. The successful candidates will then appear on the ballot for a vote of all party members and affiliated party supporters, which will open on Wednesday 8 October, and close on Thursday 23 October at 12pm. The winner will be announced on Saturday 25 October. 'We need strong voices pushing for renewal' Northern female MPs being encouraged to stand include the former transport secretary Ms Haigh as well as former Leader of the House of Commons, Lucy Powell, who was sacked in the cabinet reshuffle last week. Ms Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, is understood to be \"taking soundings\" after being approached by colleagues. Ms Haigh, who was forced to resign after it emerged she pleaded guilty to a criminal offence, said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the encouragement she had received from colleagues but would not stand. In a statement to Sky News, she said: \"Labour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain - not simply to steady the ship, but to remake it completely. \"We need strong voices pushing for that renewal: on the economy, on workers' rights, and on climate change. For me, that means remaining on the backbenches for now, where I can speak plainly and campaign boldly.\" Could top ministers enter race? The deputy leader of Labour is an elected position voted on by members. Ms Rayner quit the role, along with her government positions as deputy prime minister and housing secretary, after she was found to have breached the ministerial code for failing to get correct tax advice. It is not clear if a Starmer loyalist will put themselves forward. Many cabinet ministers have ruled themselves out, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Sky News understands Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, from Sunderland, is on the brink of entering the race. Housing minister Alison McGovern, who represents Birkenhead near Liverpool, has also not ruled herself out.  Either of these could end up being Downing Street's preferred choice and would also be popular among MPs who not only want a northern woman, but someone who will work constructively with government rather than oppose it. However, if a minister enters the race and loses, that would be a huge blow to Sir Keir's authority, as the result would widely be seen as a referendum on his leadership and policies. As one backbench MP put it: \"The question is who is willing to be humiliated on behalf of Keir Starmer, so far nobody.\""

        "Content": " The UK could suspend visas from countries that do not \"play ball\" and agree to returns deals for migrants, the new home secretary has said. Speaking to broadcasters, Shabana Mahmood repeatedly said that her \"top priority\" is to \"secure our borders\", and called on countries to take back their citizens if they have no right to be in the UK. The government is under vast pressure to stop small boats crossing the English Channel - over 30,000 people have arrived so far this year, including over 1,000 people on Saturday alone. Politics latest: Home secretary rules out standing for deputy Labour leader The new home secretary is hosting her counterparts from fellow members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance - which includes the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand - to discuss \"what more we can do to work together to make sure that our borders are secure and that all citizens feel safe\". Speaking to broadcasters during the summit, Ms Mahmood said: \"For countries that do not play ball, we've been talking about how we can take much more co-ordinated action between the Five Eyes countries. \"For us, that means including possibly the cutting of visas in the future, just to say, you know, we do expect countries to play ball, play by the rules, and if one of your citizens has no right to be in our country, you do need to take them back.\" She repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop small boat crossings, and she rejected the suggestion that she is emulating policies already proposed by other parties, saying: \"This is a Labour government with Labour policy and Labour proposals. \"We've been looking at this for some time. It's been discussed already across the government, and I'm very clear that there has to be a strong approach to maintaining our border, and that does mean saying to countries who do not take their citizens back that we're not simply going to allow our laws to remain unenforced.\"  👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 But shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"All we get from Labour are tough words. I urged them to immediately use the powers which the last government created some months ago, but nothing has happened. We should also cut overseas aid to countries not taking back their own nationals. \"This Labour government is too weak to take the steps necessary to protect our borders, and I see no sign of that changing any time soon.\" Ms Mahmood also suggested that the government could roll out digital ID as part of measures to prevent illegal working and reduce the \"pull factors\" that draw migrants to the UK. While she has long been personally in favour of them, she said the government current position is to \"look at\" them, and she will be \"discussing\" the possibility of rolling them out with government colleagues. Balance between human rights and securing borders The home secretary also reiterated that the UK will not be leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) - as Reform UK and some in the Tory party have called for - because that would have \"other consequences that we think are not in our national interest\".  \"We absolutely see the case for reform primarily in our domestic, legal framework, tightening up the rules,\" she said. \"In the end, this is about how you strike the balance between human rights on the one hand, and securing our borders. I do think that that balance isn't in the right place at the moment. That's why we will come forward with changes to our domestic legislation and the guidance in terms of how we apply some of the convention rights legally here at home.\" She added that she will continue work she started in her previous post of justice secretary to reform the convention and ensure it is \"fit for purpose in the modern era\".  Ms Mahmood's comments come on her third day in her new role of home secretary, which she was given in a wide-ranging cabinet and ministerial reshuffle, triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner as housing secretary and deputy prime minister on Friday, after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a new property. There was a clear out of the ministerial team in the Home Office, with new ministers brought in as the government seeks to get a grip on small boat crossings and close asylum hotels amid protests. Dover MP Mike Tapp - a strong proponent of taking tough measures to break up criminal gangs and stop boats landing on British shores - is one of those MPs who has been given his first ministerial role in the Home Office."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The beauty contest hasn't even started, but at least two of the potential Labour deputy leadership contenders have been strutting their stuff on the TUC catwalk in Brighton. In public and behind the scenes at the TUC conference, would-be candidates Richard Burgon and Alison McGovern were meeting and greeting the barons and the brothers - and sisters - in what looked like canvassing support. Politics Live: Labour reveals date new deputy leader will be elected But this pair weren't the only people who caught the eye in the Brighton Centre. Former Labour MP Sam Tarry - yes, really - Angela Rayner's partner, turned up mid-afternoon. He queued for his pass, visited a few stands in the exhibition area, and then chaired a fringe meeting on workplace rights. He looked serious and a little sheepish, as well he might, and told the audience at his fringe meeting he wouldn't be answering questions. No surprise there. But given the events of the past week, he was jolly brave to turn up at such a big public gathering. Earlier, Mr Burgon and Ms McGovern had been quick off the mark. The Labour Party hadn't even announced the timetable for the election to succeed Angela Rayner when the pair - separately - strode into Brighton's famous conference centre shortly after midday. When Sky News asked Mr Burgon if he was going to stand, he replied: \"What I think needs to happen is there needs to be a left candidate for deputy leader of the Labour Party. \"And by that I mean someone who voted for a ceasefire (in Gaza) and someone who voted against disability benefit cuts, because the deputy leader is meant to be the voice of members at the top table. \"Members, quite rightly, had a strong position on a ceasefire in relation to Gaza, a strong opinion on Palestine, and a strong position against the disability benefit cuts. As to who that left candidate should be, colleagues will discuss that.\" It was an answer that suggested Mr Burgon - MP for Leeds East, the constituency once held by that giant of Labour Party politics, Denis Healey - would very much like to stand. First, though, he and any other candidates need to secure 80 nominations from Labour MPs, a high bar and one that was raised by Sir Keir Starmer in what was seen as a move to keep left-wingers out of the race. Read more:Unite boss warns Labour's key backer may end supportUnions demand no retreat on workers' rights after Rayner quits Senior union leaders have told Sky News that could restrict the number of candidates to four at most and more likely just three. Left-wingers also claim it will be an outrage if the suspended welfare rebels are disqualified from nominating candidates. Sky News tracked down Ms McGovern at a fringe meeting on the Employment Rights Bill. Asked during the meeting if she was going to stand, she replied: \"Hold your horses on that one. It's all a bit soon for that sort of thing.\" Like Mr Burgon, there was no denial. And later, invited by Sky News to be interviewed, she smiled and said: \"I'm busy.\" And off she went. It was once said that politics is a cross between a soap opera and a spectator sport. If the soap opera in Brighton was the plotting in the Labour deputy leadership race, the spectator sport was TUC general secretary Paul Nowak's fiery speech in the hall. After accusing Labour of failing to deliver last year's \"Change\" manifesto, he tore into Nigel Farage and launched a deeply personal attack on Robert Jenrick. Note, first, that his most sustained attack was on Reform UK and not the Tories and, second, that he targeted Mr Jenrick and not Kemi Badenoch. Mr Farage and his deputy, Richard Tice, said Mr Novak, were \"right-wing con-men, lining their own pockets\". But they're not alone, he added. \"No amount of TikToks, or Ozempic, or expensive haircuts will ever hide the inner ugliness of Robert Jenrick,\" said the TUC chief. Harsh. Read More:Angela Rayner admits underpaying taxWho is Shabana Mahmood - Britain's new home secretary  But he had one more target in his powerful speech. \"Benjamin Netanayu's government is committing genocide in Gaza,\" he declared. That was language we hear from Labour left-wingers and other left-leaning opposition parties, but not from Sir Keir Starmer and his ministers. Not yet, anyway. The day's business ended with a speech from Ellie Reeves, who was Labour party chair until last week's reshuffle and is now solicitor general. She'd obviously written her speech and didn't want to see it go to waste. By now, it was almost 5.30pm, and the applause for her speech was muted, polite at best. Truly, it was the graveyard slot for poor Ellie. Next up, in the morning, it's Labour's Bridget Phillipson speaking from the platform. This time last week, it was due to be Angela Rayner. Enough said."

After Angela Rayner's sudden departure from the government for failing to pay enough stamp duty, she now leaves a hole at the top of the party as deputy leader - an elected position by the membership which means a full leadership contest will have to begin, and fast. Politics latest: Home secretary rules out standing for deputy leader Candidates will probably have to decide today whether they are going to put their names in the mix. So, who could throw their hat into the ring? David Lammy - the 'makes sense' candidate This would be a neat little way to solve the problem for the government and an attempt to try to kick it back to the status quo. \n                  PM facing claims of 'stitch-up' in battle to replace Rayner - as first candidate enters race \n                 \n                  Would-be Labour deputies woo the unions in Brighton\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner 'won't get involved' in race to choose successor as deputy leader\n                 Sir Keir Starmer appointed the former foreign secretary as deputy prime minister in the government during his reshuffle at the weekend, and if he won, he would effectively occupy the same role Ms Rayner had, being both the PM's elected deputy, as well as the members' choice. He is London-born to Guyanese parents in Tottenham, where he is still an MP. He went on to be the first black Briton to attend Harvard Law School, and in a Tony Blair government he was seen as a rising star when he became a junior minister. From the backbenches, he then became outspoken on issues around race and social justice, but since returning to the front bench, has softened his language around Trump, and he apologised for nominating Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader back in 2015. In 2016, he was commissioned to lead a review into racial disparities in the justice system. Dame Emily Thornberry The Foreign Affairs Committee chair has lived many lives. Born to an academic and teacher, she moved into a council house at seven years old when her parents divorced. She later became a lawyer specialising in human rights law, and became an MP in 2005 - elected initially from an all-women shortlist. That might be helpful, as inside the Labour Party, it's widely thought that Ms Rayner's replacement should be a woman. While she's had many roles in opposition - shadow energy minister, shadow attorney general, shadow defence secretary, and shadow foreign secretary - she is probably most known for a controversial tweet. Whilst serving in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet, she was forced to resign in 2014 following a picture she posted of an England flag while campaigning in the Rochester and Stroud by-election. Richard Burgon - the left candidate With Sir Keir faring badly in the polls, some in the party think this member-led vote could be a way to show their discontent with the prime minister and his government by selecting a staunchly left-wing candidate. Richard Burgon has already been making noises about a potential bid, tweeting how he sees the role of deputy playing out. The Leeds MP has been a constant pain for the government. A firm left-wing candidate, he has been vocal over Gaza, the winter fuel U-turn, the government's welfare bill, and he temporarily lost the Labour whip after voting against the government over the two-child benefit cap. His appointment would be a coup for the left, who have been crushed by Sir Keir since he came to power in 2020. But remember - Rayner's power came from the fact that she wasn't just deputy leader, but also deputy prime minister, and had a long-established line into No 10, meaning she had genuine influence. If the winner is not from the leader's faction of the party, then the new deputy could be sidelined again. Political reporter The Labour Party rule book sets out how candidates can get on the ballot to stand in the election for deputy party leader. Each nominee must be a sitting member of the Parliamentary Labour Party (a Labour MP), and must be supported by 20% of their fellow members, which currently equates to 80 Labour MPs. The deadline set by the party's governing body to gather the required nominations is 5pm on Thursday 11 September. After that, candidates must win the support of either: • 5% of Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs), which are local party groups; • At least three organisations affiliated to the party - at least two of which must be trade unions - that comprise 5% of the affiliated party membership. This process will start on Saturday 13 September, and close on Saturday 27 September. The successful candidates will then appear on the ballot for a vote of all party members and affiliated party supporters, which will open on Wednesday 8 October, and close on Thursday 23 October at 12pm. The winner will be announced on Saturday 25 October. Who else could throw their hat in the ring? Other names being touted (some without their knowledge) are former development minister Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler, and Miatta Fahnbulleh. Ms Dodds has bolstered her integrity credentials inside the party since resigning over principles and not in disgrace after the international aid budget was cut. She also has a forensic knowledge of the internal workings of the Labour Party and, as a former women and equalities minister, has broad appeal within the party. Dawn Butler has previously expressed an interest in replacing Sadiq Khan as London mayor, but she's already tweeted today about how she could pivot to other positions - so one to watch. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 The 2024 intake is also a large and unpredictable group. They've flexed their muscles before over the welfare rebellion, proving not only their ambitions, but their soft left leaning credentials too, even surprising the prime minister. Could they galvanise and organise a candidate between themselves in the time to nominate? The deputy position is an elected position that will eventually go out to the wide membership, but MPs need to first get 80 nominations from their own MPs. At midday today, the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC) will have a full meeting to agree a timetable and code of conduct for a deputy leadership contest. And because of the London Tube strikes, it will be a digital meeting. So expect lots of organised high-speed dating-style coffees in Portcullis House, and hushed conversations in corridors today - or more likely the unending WhatsApp groups with disappearing messages. The sudden nature of this contest, coupled with the speed at which it has to happen, means really anyone now has a shot."

The 44-year-old replaced Yvette Cooper, 10 years after she helped run Cooper's failed Labour leadership campaign, and faces flag-waving anti-immigration protesters and the growing threat of Nigel Farage's Reform UK. Raised in Birmingham and Saudi Arabia Shabana Mahmood was born in Birmingham to parents from the Pakistani-administered region of Azad Kashmir. Soon after they were born, they moved her and her twin brother to the Saudi Arabian city of Taif, where her father worked as a civil engineer and the family would make regular visits to religious sites in Mecca and Medina. After seven years, they moved back to Birmingham and her father, still employed as a full-time engineer, bought a corner shop and became chairman of the local Labour Party. She attended an all-girls grammar school and then Oxford University to study law at Lincoln College, where she was elected Junior Common Room president, with a vote from former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was in the year above her. After university, she moved to London to train as a lawyer, specialising in professional indemnity for most of her 20s. 'My faith is the centre point of my life' At the age of 29 in 2010, she was elected MP for her home constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, a safe Labour seat, with a majority of just over 9%, which grew to 82.7% at its peak in the snap election of 2017. Along with Rushanara Ali and Yasmin Qureshi, this made her one of Britain's first female Muslim MPs. In an interview with The Times, she said: \"My faith is the centre point of my life and it drives me to public service, it drives me in the way that I live my life and I see my life.\" She held several shadow cabinet positions under Ed Miliband's leadership, including shadow prisons and higher education minister, and shadow financial secretary to the treasury. Read more from Sky NewsWhat a moment for Shabana Mahmood to take the helmCabinet reshuffle - who's in and who's out? Often described as 'blue Labour', Mahmood returned to the backbenches when Jeremy Corbyn took over as party leader in 2015, telling him as she refused a shadow cabinet position: \"I'll be miserable and I'll make you miserable as well.\" She had chaired her now-predecessor Yvette Cooper's failed campaign to beat him to the leadership. During the Corbyn years, she was elected to the Parliamentary Labour Party's National Executive Committee and as vice chairman of the party's National Policy Forum. When Mr Corbyn was replaced by Sir Keir Starmer, Ms Mahmood became national campaign coordinator and was tasked with preparing Labour for the next general election. During her two-and-a-half years in that job, she is credited with helping Labour win the Batley and Spen by-election and helping Sir Keir recover from Labour's defeat in Hartlepool - where the Conservatives won for the first time ever in 2021. Early prison release scheme and views on Gaza Soon after becoming justice secretary and lord chancellor, Mahmood commissioned a report into the crumbling prison estate. Carried out by one of her Conservative predecessors, David Gauke, it revealed they were practically full, and triggered a controversial decision to release more than 1,000 inmates early to ease pressure on the system. The Ministry of Justice were forced to apologise after it emerged 37 prisoners had been released by mistake. She has also endorsed tougher immigration laws, announcing in August that foreign criminals will be deported after sentencing, and has been critical of their use of human rights lawyers, calling for reform of the European Convention on Human Rights as a result. Answering questions on Asian grooming gangs, she previously told former Tory minister Michael Gove in The Spectator that there is \"still a moment of reckoning\" and an \"outstanding question of why so many looked the other way\". She has also been vocal on Labour's stance on Gaza, warning the prime minister that \"British Muslims are feeling a very strong sense of pain\" and that the government would have to rebuild their trust. When she was last re-elected in 2024, she suffered a 42% drop in her majority, facing off an independent candidate whose campaign centred around Palestinian rights. Like her parliamentary neighbour, Labour MP Jess Phillips, she said the election campaign had been \"sullied by harassment and intimidation\"."

Baroness Grey-Thompson said she is not opposed to the principle of assisted dying but is against the legislation in its current form. The peer said the emails have been tough to read, but she accepts it's \"part of the job\". She said: \"I've had emails, people saying, 'thank you so much for protecting us'. And I've had some incredibly abusive ones as well, saying that I'm responsible for people dying in pain, and it will be on me.\" Baroness Grey-Thompson said the experience of losing her own mother to cancer means she understands people's strong feelings, but insisted there should be more focus on improving end-of-life care. \"It's absolutely appalling that people are scared about how they're going to die.

Around 200 peers have put their names down to speak on the bill when it comes to the Lords on Friday. It is thought this second reading stage could go into a second day to allow everyone to have their say on the proposed legislation. The Commons has voted twice on the overall bill, having approved the principle of assisted dying. Peers in the Lords will now be given the chance to put forward changes. The legislation, which applies only to England and Wales, would face further scrutiny at committee and report stages. Those in favour are hopeful it could pass into law by the end of this parliamentary session in spring.

Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill to the Commons last year, appealed for \"no funny games\" in terms of procedure in the Lords. She said she \"would be upset to think that anybody was playing games with such an important and such an emotional issue\". Baroness Grey-Thompson added: \"It's my intention to bring a number of amendments to make it as safe as it can possibly be. But we do need to have a really detailed discussion.\""

        "Content": "A team of researchers has identified a possible atmosphere around an Earth-sized planet. The researchers, from the University of St Andrews, have today published two separate papers on planet TRAPPIST-1e. They say liquid water, in the form of a global ocean or icy expanse, might exist on its surface. Published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, researchers say the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a step closer to solving whether or not the planet has an atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1e is the fourth planet in the red dwarf star system TRAPPIST-1, which is located in the constellation Aquarius, and is around 40 light years away from Earth. The planet orbits firmly within the star's habitable zone, and has a mass comparable to that of Earth. This is the first search for an atmosphere and surface habitability on the planet with the JWST. Planet 1e is of particular interest because the presence of liquid water is theoretically viable, but only if the planet has an atmosphere. The initial results indicate several potential scenarios, including the possibility of an atmosphere. These findings are a significant moment in the search for habitable conditions beyond Earth. Dr Ryan MacDonald, lecturer in extrasolar planets in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: \"TRAPPIST-1e has long been considered one of the best habitable zone planets to search for an atmosphere. \"But when our observations came down in 2023, we quickly realised that the system's red dwarf star was contaminating our data in ways that made the search for an atmosphere extremely challenging.\" Read more from Sky News:'Blood moon' captured in photos across the worldGoodbye summer - get ready for a wet and windy autumn The researchers aimed the JWS telescope's powerful NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument at the system as planet 1e passed in front of its star. Starlight passing through the planet's atmosphere, if there is one, will be partially absorbed and the corresponding changes in the light spectrum that reaches the JWST tell astronomers what chemicals are found there. But astronomers must also carefully account for starspots, spots created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars, from the red dwarf star. The team spent over a year correcting the data for the star's contamination before they could zero in on the planet's atmosphere. Dr MacDonald, who contributed to the analysis of TRAPPIST-1e's spectrum, added: \"We are seeing two possible explanations. \"The most exciting possibility is that TRAPPIST-1e could have a so-called secondary atmosphere containing heavy gases like nitrogen. \"But our initial observations cannot yet rule out a bare rock with no atmosphere.\" The researchers are now obtaining further JWST observations of the planet to enable a deeper search for an atmosphere. With each additional transit, the atmospheric contents become clearer. Dr MacDonald added: \"In the coming years we will go from four JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to nearly 20. \"We finally have the telescope and tools to search for habitable conditions in other star systems, which makes today one of the most exciting times for astronomy.\""

Sky News has learnt that Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive who has presided over the stratospheric rise in its valuation to more than $4trn, is expected to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles during the trip.

The 81-year-old, who had been battling multiple myeloma - a type of blood cancer - for the last decade, died on Saturday, a statement from the band said. The band's lead singer wrote many of their hits, including Breakfast In America and The Logical Song, alongside Roger Hodgson. The band's statement, posted with a photo of Davies walking his dog by the sea and soundtrack of Goodbye Stranger, paid tribute to both his musical legacy and his warm personality. The statement read: \"As co-writer, along with partner Roger Hodgson, he was the voice and pianist behind Supertramp's most iconic songs, leaving an indelible mark on rock music history. \"His soulful vocals and unmistakable touch on the Wurlitzer became the heartbeat of the band's sound.\" \"Beyond the stage, Rick was known for his warmth, resilience, and devotion to his wife Sue, with whom he shared over five decades,\" the band said. \"After facing serious health challenges, which kept him unable to continue touring as Supertramp, he enjoyed performing with his hometown buds as Ricky and the Rockets. \"Rick's music and legacy continue to inspire many and bear testament to the fact that great songs never die, they live on.\" Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1944, Davies's love of music began in his childhood, the group said, listening to Gene Krupa's Drummin' Man, which sparked a lifelong passion for jazz, blues and rock 'n' roll. Davies and Hodgson formed the band that would become Supertramp in 1969. The line-up changed numerous times over the years, with the band best remembered for the period from 1973 to 1983, when Davies and Hodgson performed with Dougie Thomson on bass, Bob Siebenberg on drums and John Helliwell on saxophone. Crime of the Century, their breakthrough album, came out in 1974, followed by their biggest hit in 1979 with Breakfast In America, and hit singles The Logical Song, Breakfast in America, Goodbye Stranger and Take the Long Way Home. Amid creative disputes, Hodgson left the band to go solo in 1983. Davies eventually became the only constant member throughout its history. While a reunion tour was announced in 2015, it was cancelled when Davies was diagnosed with cancer. He settled a royalties lawsuit in 2023 after a long-running dispute with ex-bandmates. Just last month, a US appeals court ruled that Hodgson must share royalties for three of Supertramp's songs with his ex-bandmates. Davies leaves behind his wife Sue, who had managed the band since the mid-80s."

        "Content": "A new Banksy artwork that has sprung up at the Royal Courts of Justice will be removed, HM Courts and Tribunals has said. The latest piece shows a judge in a wig and gown appearing to use a gavel - a small hammer used by auctioneers rather than judges in the UK - to beat a protester who is lying on the ground holding a blood-spattered placard. The work was first seen on Monday on an external wall of the Queen's Building, part of the Royal Courts of Justice complex. It has since been concealed by large sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers. The elusive artist confirmed he was responsible for the work with an Instagram post, showing the graffiti before it was covered over. Banksy, whose identity is the source of constant speculation, captioned the pictures: \"Royal Courts Of Justice. London.\" A HM Courts and Tribunals spokesperson said it will be removed in accordance with rules about listed buildings. They said: \"The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character.\" The artwork is being guarded by security officials outside the building and is under a CCTV camera. His stencilled graffiti is often a comment on political issues and many of his pieces are critical of government policy, war and capitalism. The latest work comes after almost 900 demonstrators were arrested for protesting in central London on Saturday against the banning of Palestine Action as a terror group. Several other people have previously been charged with allegedly expressing support for the group, which was proscribed under anti-terror laws by the then home secretary Yvette Cooper earlier this year. It makes membership of, or support for, the direct action group a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison, while even wearing a T-shirt or badge with the group's name on could attract a maximum six-month sentence. The ban came shortly after two Voyager aircraft suffered around £7m worth of damage at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on 20 June. Defence Secretary John Healey told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips that he expects newly appointed Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood to be \"just as tough\" as her predecessor Ms Cooper on Palestine Action. He said: \"I expect her to defend the decision the government has taken to proscribe Palestine Action because of what some of its members are responsible for, and were planning for.\" Responding to Banksy's work, a spokesperson for campaign group Defend Our Juries, which was behind Saturday's rally, said it \"powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed by Yvette Cooper on protesters by proscribing Palestine Action\". They said: \"When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent, it strengthens it. \"As Banksy's artwork shows, the state can try to strip away our civil liberties, but we are too many in number and our resolve to stand against injustice cannot be beaten - our movement against the ban is unstoppable and growing every day.\" Read more:Harry visits Windsor to pay tribute to late QueenRace organisers apologise after glaring error on medals Other notable works by Banksy included an animal-themed collection in the capital last summer, which concluded with a gorilla appearing to lift up a shutter on the entrance to London Zoo. There have also been piranhas swimming in a police sentry box in the City of London, turning the box into what looked like a giant fish tank, and a howling wolf on a satellite dish. That latter piece was taken off the roof of a shop in Peckham, south London, less than an hour after it was unveiled."

Ariana Grande and Sabrina Carpenter took three awards each. It was a night dominated by women, with female stars bagging all the awards, with the exception of Bruno Mars for his collaborations with Gaga and Blackpink member Rose. Mariah Carey collected her first-ever VMA award, swiftly followed by a second when she was awarded the Video Vanguard award. And tribute was paid to Ozzy Osbourne, who died in July, with Yungblud and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry performing Black Sabbath classics, introduced by Jack Osbourne and his four daughters. Here's the best of the MTV VMAs, in pictures."
