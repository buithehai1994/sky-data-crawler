        "Content": " Two children, aged eight and 10, have been killed in a shooting during mass at a school in Minneapolis. An attacker opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. The FBI has confirmed the killer has been identified as Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman, and is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The city's police chief Brian O'Hara said the attacker - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds as mass was celebrated during the first week of term. He added that 17 other people were injured, including 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition. Police believe the suspect, thought to be in his early 20s and acting alone, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr O'Hara called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.\" He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. Three adults in 80s among those injured Hennepin Healthcare, the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said four of the patients were taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. At a later news conference, Mr O'Hara said three adults in their 80s are among those injured in the attack. He added that Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube, which \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". The video has since been taken down with the assistance of the FBI. 'So much' gunfire, witness says Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  The pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school had an all-school mass scheduled at 8.15am local time on Wednesday morning (2.15pm UK time), according to its website. Monday was the first day of the school semester. Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At the first news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\"  Speaking later, and joined by Governor Tim Walz, Mr Frey said that the \"Minneapolis family\" has stepped up in \"thousands of different ways\" after the shooting. \"The way that they acted during the severe threat and danger was nothing short of heroic,\" he says. \"This is a tragic and horrible event that should never occur.\" He added: \"Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainise our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity.\"  Mr Walz said: \"We often come to these and say these are unspeakable tragedies or there are no words for this, there shouldn't be words for these types of incidents because they shouldn't happen.\" The school's headteacher Matt DeBoer added: \"To any of our students and families and staff watching right now, I love you. You're so brave, and I'm so sorry this happened.\"  Senator: Girl 'had to watch several of her friends get shot' Speaking to MSNBC, Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar said she had called one of her longtime employees who had three children in the school during the shooting. The senator described the call with the mother as \"one of the most upsetting things I've ever heard\". \"These kids are doing an all-school mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot - one in the back, one in the neck,\" Ms Klobuchar added. \"And they all got down under the pews and she - her daughter, of course, was not shot - but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.\" Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\""

        "Content": " Two children have been killed and 17 other people injured after a shooter opened fire at a school in Minneapolis. The shooter - Robin Westman - opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The victims killed were aged eight and 10, and the others injured included 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition, according to the city's police chief Brian O'Hara. Here is what we know so far. What happened? Police were called to the school at just after 8.20am (2.20pm UK time) after witnesses reported hearing semi-automatic gunfire at the pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school. The shooting happened during a mass for all year groups, coming during the first week of term. Police chief Mr O'Hara said the shooter - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds. He called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. The FBI said it is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". What we know about the suspect Police said they believed the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on the site's car park. Mr O'Hara said the suspect had been identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman. Westman is believed to have acted alone in the attack and had lawfully purchased the rifle, pistol, and shotgun used. He added Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube and that it \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". He said the content was taken down with the assistance of the FBI. Asked about a motive, Mr O'Hara said he had no information to share other than the manifesto that was scheduled to come out on YouTube. \"I cannot confirm a relationship between the suspect or his family and the church at this time, but that's obviously something we're looking very closely at,\" he added.  What do we know about the victims? The two children killed have not yet been named publicly. The others injured included 14 children and three adults in their 80s, according to police. After the incident the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, Hennepin Healthcare, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said seven of the patients were critically injured and that four had been taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. In a later update, Mr O'Hara said all of those injured in the shooting were expected to survive. 'It seemed like it went on for eternity' Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  His daughter Alexandra, who attended the school for nine years, added: \"It makes me sick to my stomach knowing that there's probably people I know that are injured or maybe have been killed. \"It doesn't make me feel safe at all in this community that I have been a part of for so long. \"Me and my friends were talking, and we said this is like our version of 9/11.\"  Madee Brandt, a nanny who works near the shooting scene, pulled into the area just as police arrived and children fled. \"I was thankful to see kids coming out unharmed, safe, but just [seeing] the looks on some of their faces... just the screams coming from the mums who didn't know where their kids are,\" Brandt told reporters. \"You see videos online, but it does not compare to seeing it and witnessing it in person. That was rough.\" Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At a news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\" He said the community didn't just want prayers, adding: \"These kids were literally praying, it was the first week of school. \"They were in a church, these are kids that should be learning with their friends.\"  'Deeply unsettling' Later, he called for action on gun violence, saying: \"I think the impetus has to be on all of us as leaders to do a whole lot more to recognise that we've got more guns in this country than we have people.\" Minnesota governor Tim Walz added children at the school had been met with \"evil and horror and death\". Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\" Minneapolis Police were already investigating three deadly shootings in the space of 12 hours. \"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (Â£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (Â£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter?  Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price capWagamama owner among suitors for Costa  Nvidia itself saw its share price rise more than 40% over the past year. Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (Â£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (Â£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint."

Sir Ed, who has been vocal in his disapproval of the US president, said he \"thought and prayed long and hard\" about whether to accept the invitation to the state banquet at Windsor Castle during Mr Trump's historic second visit next month. \"I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse,\" he wrote in The Guardian. The Lib Dem leader said it is an \"enormous honour\" to receive an invitation from the king, and he takes \"very seriously my duty to our sovereign\". \"To refuse an invitation like this goes against all my instincts,\" he added. But, he said he fears Mr Trump will be honoured with a \"lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces and nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation, death, and captivities in Gaza\". \"And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right thing,\" he said. Trump 'has more power than anyone' Sir Ed said Mr Trump \"more than anyone else\" has the power to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, end the famine and get the hostages returned. \"Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace with a two-state solution,\" Sir Ed said. \"But so far, he's decided not to. Instead, he's given Netanyahu his full support.\" Read more:Has Trump ended seven wars as he claims? Sir Ed said he feels \"a responsibility to do whatever I can to ensure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony\" and to ensure the UK makes Trump's \"personal responsibility for securing peace in Israel and Palestine an issue\". The Lib Dem leader made clear that refusing the invitation is not about \"the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree with President Trump\".  'Trump and Starmer can't wish this away' He said he thinks Sir Keir Starmer is right to engage with him, but wishes he would be tougher with Trump \"on everything from tariffs to Vladimir Putin\". Sir Ed pointed out he even argued the UK should use the offer of a state visit as \"leverage\" to persuade Mr Trump \"to do the right thing\". He added: \"Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away.\" Earlier this year, Sir Ed called Mr Trump a \"bully\" and accused him of \"betraying Ukraine\" and \"selling out\" the security of Europe. Last year, after Mr Trump won the election, Sir Ed called it a \"dark, dark day\" as the US would be led \"by a dangerous, destructive demagogue\". Sir Ed is not the first party leader to refuse an invitation to a state dinner with Mr Trump. Then-Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, then-SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and former Speaker of the Commons John Bercow all boycotted the 2019 Trump state dinner."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n Reform's plan was meant to be detailed. Instead, there's more confusion. The party had grown weary of the longstanding criticism that their tough talk on immigration did not come with a full proposal for what they would do to tackle small boats if they came to power. So, after six months of planning, yesterday they attempted to put flesh on the bones of their flagship policy. At an expensive press conference in a vast air hanger in Oxford, the headline news was clear: Reform UK would deport anyone who comes here by small boat, arresting, detaining and then deporting up to 600,000 people in the first five years of governing. They would leave international treaties and repeal the Human Rights Act to do it But, one day later, that policy is clear as mud when it comes to who this would apply to. I asked Farage at the time of the announcement whether this would apply to women and girls - an important question - as the basis for their extreme policy seemed to hinge on the safety of women and girls in the UK. He was unequivocal: \"Yes, women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained. \"And I've accepted already that how we deal with children is a much more complicated and difficult issue.\" But a day later, he appeared to row back on this stance at a press conference in Scotland, saying Reform is \"not even discussing women and children at this stage\". Read more:Farage's new 'leave' campaign - how could it work? He later clarified that if a single woman came by boat, then they could fall under the policy, but if \"a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do\". A third clarification in the space of 24 hours on a flagship policy they worked on over six months seems like a pretty big gaffe, and it only feeds into the Labour criticism that these plans aren't yet credible. If they had hoped to pivot from rhetoric to rigour, this announcement showed serious pitfalls. But party strategists probably will not be tearing out too much hair over this, with polling showing Reform UK still as the most trusted party on the issue of immigration overall."

        "Headline": "Fertility rates are falling in Great Britain, as in many parts of the world. The number of babies continues to rise, however, thanks to population increase.",
        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n  The fertility rate in England and Wales fell to its lowest level on record in 2024. It is the third consecutive year that record has been broken. Other than a slight jump during the pandemic, birth rates have been falling consistently since 2010. On average, women now have 1.41 babies, compared with 1.42 in 2023 and 1.94 in 2010. Rates in Scotland are even lower still, according to data released on Tuesday by National Records Scotland. Women there have an average of just 1.25 babies, falling from 1.77 in 2008. To sustain the size of the global population, demographic experts say women need to have an average of 2.1 babies. This is what they call the \"replacement rate\". A similar rate is required to maintain the population of England and Wales, but it has been below that for more than 50 years. Despite that, the population has increased, largely as a result of immigration. What's happening in Britain reflects part of a global trend in declining fertility rates. In South Korea, the country with the lowest fertility rate in the world, women now have fewer than one baby on average - just 0.75. Fertility remains high in many African countries, however. Somalia has the highest fertility rate in the world, with women there having more than six babies on average. Despite the declining fertility rate, more babies were born in England and Wales in 2024 compared with 2023, although the 2023 figure was the lowest it had been since 1977. This is because the population of England and Wales grew by more than 700,000 between 2023 and 2024, mainly due to immigration. So a lower fertility rate is offset by there being more women in the country. Although fertility rates are falling across England and Wales as a whole, they have risen slightly in London and the West Midlands. Birmingham was the local authority with the largest increase, rising from 1.61 babies per woman in 2023 to 1.75 in 2024. The largest fall was in Maldon, in Essex, where the number fell from 1.59 to 1.37 per woman. Since 2014, there has been a fall in fertility in every one of the 303 local authorities for which we have continuous data. Luton, the local authority with the highest overall fertility rate, where women have an average of exactly two babies, recorded the smallest fall - dropping just 6% in the last 10 years. In places like Torbay, in Devon, Denbighshire, in north Wales, and the City of Bristol, fertility has fallen by more than a third in the past decade. Data released last month reveals more information about the demographic make-up of mothers in the UK. There has been a steady and sustained fall in the number of babies born to British-born mothers, but in 2024 that was offset by an increase in births among those born abroad. The rise is particularly pronounced among mothers who were born in southern Asia. In 2024, there were 20,000 more babies born in England and Wales to mothers from that region than there were in 2021 - a rise of almost 50% in just three years. Births to African mothers have also risen sharply over that period, although there has been an equally rapid fall in babies born to mothers from EU countries, coinciding with Brexit coming into effect. In 2024, just over a third of babies born in England and Wales had mothers who were born outside the UK, but in some areas foreign-born mothers made up a much higher proportion. In Luton, for example, which we mentioned earlier, has the highest fertility rate in England and Wales, seven in 10 babies were born to foreign-born mothers in 2024. As of the 2021 census, the total foreign-born population of Luton was 38%, but many of the foreign-born population will be younger, in age groups more likely to have children. Birth rates by age Fertility rates for both men and women are now falling among every age group, and the birth rate among under-30s is the lowest it has ever been. The number of births to women in their 30s had been rising early this century, but has been steadily falling over the last decade. In 2024, the average number of babies born to mothers aged between 30 and 34 was the lowest it's been in more than 20 years. The average age that mothers have their first child is now 29 years and five months in England and Wales, although there are significant variations in different parts of the country. In the North East, mothers have their first child shortly after their 28th birthday, on average. In London, it's three years later - just after turning 31. The financial burden of low fertility A combination of women having fewer babies and people living longer means that there is a higher economic burden on each person of working age to support those in retirement. Demographics expert Dr Paul Morland told Sky News: \"In terms of economic society politics, the fundamental problem is that you get more people who are of retirement age [compared with] the number of people working. \"The workers are the ones who are doing the work, paying the taxes, and people over a certain age consume a lot in healthcare - an 80-something consumes five or six times as much as a 20-something. \"The triple locki in the UK means very often that pensioners, even at the very bottom, are better looked after than poor workers. This puts more and more pressure on the state and more and more pressure on labour markets.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "All members of the United Nations Security Council - except the US - have said the famine in Gaza was a \"manmade crisis\". In a joint statement, the 14 council members warned the use of starvation as a weapon of war is banned under international humanitarian law. They called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups, a substantive surge of aid throughout Gaza, and for Israel to immediately and unconditionally lift all restrictions on aid delivery. Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined last week. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system said 514,000 people, nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza, are experiencing famine. It warned the figure is due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September. Israel asked the monitor to retract its assessment on Wednesday, dismissing the findings as false and biased. It said the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food. Meanwhile, Donald Trump held a policy meeting on the war with former British prime minister Tony Blair and his ex-Middle East envoy Jared Kushner. The trio and top White House officials discussed all aspects of Gaza, including escalating food aid deliveries, the hostage crisis, and - notably - post-war plans, a senior administration official told Reuters.

The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said: \"Evacuating Gaza City is inevitable, and therefore, every family that relocates to the south will receive the most abundant humanitarian aid that is currently being worked on.\" Aid groups have warned an expanded Israeli military offensive could deepen the humanitarian crisis facing the besieged enclave. There was also increasing outrage over the double Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza, which killed journalists, emergency responders and others, as the number killed rose to 22 after two more people died. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, abducting 251 people and killing around 1,200, mostly civilians, on 7 October 2023. Israel's offensive has killed nearly 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says around half of those killed were women and children."

        "Content": " An asylum seeker has denied trying to kiss a 14-year-old girl and told a court: \"I'm not a wild animal.\" On day two of his trial, Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was asked if he tried to kiss the girl and gave the reply through an interpreter, adding: \"I can't do these kind of things. These are children, new generation.\" The court heard the 38-year-old told the girl he wanted her to go back to the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, where he was staying. Kebatu is accused of attempting to kiss the teenager, putting his hand on her thigh and brushing her hair last month. He denies two counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and one count of harassment without violence. The alleged incident involving Kebatu sparked protests and counter-protests outside the hotel in Essex after similar protests were held outside hotels across the country housing asylum seekers. On Wednesday, the trial at Colchester Magistrates' Court saw police interviews with male friends of the alleged victim being played to the court. One of the teenager's friends, a 14-year-old boy, said Kebatu was \"staring at us the whole time\", adding: \"We went into Tesco and he was following us.\" In footage played to the court on Wednesday, the witness said Kebatu had informed him he paid about â¬2,500 (Â£2,155) to \"get on a rubber dinghy to come to our country\". Another 14-year-old boy told police the defendant described two of his teenage female friends as \"pretty\" and \"asked for a kiss from them both\". The boy said they gave the man a slice of pizza on 7 July, and then the man \"asked to have babies with [the 14-year-old girl] and this other girl, then he asked for a kiss from both of them\". The witness added: \"He just said they're pretty, and he also said do you want to come to the Bell Hotel to have babies then we could go to Kenya with each other.\" Describing a comment the man allegedly made to a girl in the group, the boy said: \"The geezer said 'come back to Africa, you would be a good wife'.\" A woman said Kebatu was \"begging, pleading and apologising\" when she confronted him after he allegedly sexually assaulted the 14-year-old girl. The witness, who alleges Kebatu also sexually assaulted her, said the defendant ran away when she asked him what he was doing when she saw him speaking with a \"young schoolgirl\". Addressing what happened when she eventually caught up with him near the Bell Hotel, the woman said: \"It was a lot of begging, pleading and apologising, and a lot of 'I'm sorry, I'm going to go, it was a mistake' - along those lines.\" In a 999 call played at Colchester Magistrates' Court, the woman tells a police call handler: \"I want to report a man, a very strange man in this area.\" \"He's very touchy-feely, he touched me,\" she said. She said she \"saw him talking to minors still in school uniform\". The woman said the man \"lives in the Bell Hotel, Epping\" and had been \"harassing 14-year-olds\". She said he had \"done a runner to the hotel, that's where he lives\". She is heard on the call walking towards the man and explaining to the call handler where he is, as police units are sent to the area. She repeatedly swore and said: \"This man is a paedophile\". The woman was asked by Molly Dyas, defending Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, if she had made up allegations because she was angry Kebatu was an asylum seeker. \"I didn't make up any allegation,\" the woman told Colchester Magistrates' Court. \"I know exactly what I saw. I've no issue with asylum seekers.\" The woman said she had drunk about a cup of rose wine earlier in the day. Asked by Ms Dyas if she thought she sounded drunk in the 999 call, the woman replied: \"No, I sound emotional and angry.\" The woman said she had \"seen a grown man touch a 14-year-old girl's leg so she moved his hand away\". Prosecutor Stuart Cowen told the court Kebatu gave a no comment interview to police, but began the interview by denying the offences and adding \"she's young enough to be my child\". The trial continues."

A vigil was held opposite Downing Street on Wednesday for the nearly 200 journalists killed in Gaza since the war began in October 2023. Ahead of the gathering, the National Union of Journalists' (NUJ) London freelance branch handed a letter to Number 10 calling on the prime minister to clarify what steps the government is taking to protect journalists in Gaza and to ensure they have safe access to food, water and necessary equipment. They also asked what the government is doing to get international journalists into Gaza to report freely. Currently, Israel only allows them in under IDF supervision. At least 189 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). It is the deadliest period for journalists since the CPJ started gathering data in 1992. Israel has repeatedly denied targeting reporters and accused some of those killed of being terrorists, including prominent Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif, who was killed two weeks ago. The latest attack happened on Monday, when five journalists were among 21 people killed at Nasser Hospital in a \"double tap\" strike. Benjamin Netanyahu described it as a \"tragic mishap\". Journalists at the vigil held up placards with the names of Gazan journalists, many of whom were freelance, who have been killed. They read their names out.

'Starmer can do something' Mariam Elsayeh, NUJ ethics council representative and freelance journalist, told Sky News the UK has the power to protect journalists in Gaza and ensure international journalists are allowed in. \"We can do anything, we're a great country, and we have the law and a prime minister who graduated from law school and is known for decades for his humanitarian support,\" she said. \"During the Iraq War, we all witnessed him defending activists, and he was defending the freedom of protest, and he was doing a lot, so we are recalling this from history, and we know he can do something.\" 'A generation has been erased' She added that foreign journalists are needed \"because a generation of journalists in Gaza have been erased\". \"I'm not just looking for foreign journalists to get into Gaza, I would hope to see the Pope asking to get into Gaza, I would hope to see ministers here asking to get into Gaza, I would hope politicians in the European parliament would get in,\" she said. \"If you don't want us to report, at least let people witness, allow politicians to enter. \"This is not insulting the Palestinian people, what the Israelis are doing is insulting the entire international community because they are not respecting anyone, so at least, respect international law.\""

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n  The fertility rate in England and Wales fell to its lowest level on record in 2024. It is the third consecutive year that record has been broken. Other than a slight jump during the pandemic, birth rates have been falling consistently since 2010. On average, women now have 1.41 babies, compared with 1.42 in 2023 and 1.94 in 2010. Rates in Scotland are even lower still, according to data released on Tuesday by National Records Scotland. Women there have an average of just 1.25 babies, falling from 1.77 in 2008. To sustain the size of the global population, demographic experts say women need to have an average of 2.1 babies. This is what they call the \"replacement rate\". A similar rate is required to maintain the population of England and Wales, but it has been below that for more than 50 years. Despite that, the population has increased, largely as a result of immigration. What's happening in Britain reflects part of a global trend in declining fertility rates. In South Korea, the country with the lowest fertility rate in the world, women now have fewer than one baby on average - just 0.75. Fertility remains high in many African countries, however. Somalia has the highest fertility rate in the world, with women there having more than six babies on average. Despite the declining fertility rate, more babies were born in England and Wales in 2024 compared with 2023, although the 2023 figure was the lowest it had been since 1977. This is because the population of England and Wales grew by more than 700,000 between 2023 and 2024, mainly due to immigration. So a lower fertility rate is offset by there being more women in the country. Although fertility rates are falling across England and Wales as a whole, they have risen slightly in London and the West Midlands. Birmingham was the local authority with the largest increase, rising from 1.61 babies per woman in 2023 to 1.75 in 2024. The largest fall was in Maldon, in Essex, where the number fell from 1.59 to 1.37 per woman. Since 2014, there has been a fall in fertility in every one of the 303 local authorities for which we have continuous data. Luton, the local authority with the highest overall fertility rate, where women have an average of exactly two babies, recorded the smallest fall - dropping just 6% in the last 10 years. In places like Torbay, in Devon, Denbighshire, in north Wales, and the City of Bristol, fertility has fallen by more than a third in the past decade. Data released last month reveals more information about the demographic make-up of mothers in the UK. There has been a steady and sustained fall in the number of babies born to British-born mothers, but in 2024 that was offset by an increase in births among those born abroad. The rise is particularly pronounced among mothers who were born in southern Asia. In 2024, there were 20,000 more babies born in England and Wales to mothers from that region than there were in 2021 - a rise of almost 50% in just three years. Births to African mothers have also risen sharply over that period, although there has been an equally rapid fall in babies born to mothers from EU countries, coinciding with Brexit coming into effect. In 2024, just over a third of babies born in England and Wales had mothers who were born outside the UK, but in some areas foreign-born mothers made up a much higher proportion. In Luton, for example, which we mentioned earlier, has the highest fertility rate in England and Wales, seven in 10 babies were born to foreign-born mothers in 2024. As of the 2021 census, the total foreign-born population of Luton was 38%, but many of the foreign-born population will be younger, in age groups more likely to have children. Birth rates by age Fertility rates for both men and women are now falling among every age group, and the birth rate among under-30s is the lowest it has ever been. The number of births to women in their 30s had been rising early this century, but has been steadily falling over the last decade. In 2024, the average number of babies born to mothers aged between 30 and 34 was the lowest it's been in more than 20 years. The average age that mothers have their first child is now 29 years and five months in England and Wales, although there are significant variations in different parts of the country. In the North East, mothers have their first child shortly after their 28th birthday, on average. In London, it's three years later - just after turning 31. The financial burden of low fertility A combination of women having fewer babies and people living longer means that there is a higher economic burden on each person of working age to support those in retirement. Demographics expert Dr Paul Morland told Sky News: \"In terms of economic society politics, the fundamental problem is that you get more people who are of retirement age [compared with] the number of people working. \"The workers are the ones who are doing the work, paying the taxes, and people over a certain age consume a lot in healthcare - an 80-something consumes five or six times as much as a 20-something. \"The triple locki in the UK means very often that pensioners, even at the very bottom, are better looked after than poor workers. This puts more and more pressure on the state and more and more pressure on labour markets.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

        "Content": "The two electric car models eligible for Â£3,750 purchase grants have been revealed by the government. Two Ford vehicles - the Puma Gen-E or e-Tourneo Courier - will come with the Â£3,750 discount, while 26 other models are eligible for grants of Â£1,500. The government announced its Â£650m Electric Car Grant scheme last month to help drive the switch to non-polluting vehicles. Grants will only apply to vehicles with a list price of Â£37,000 or below, and the discount will be applied automatically at the point of sale. Ford puts the price of a new Puma Gen-E at Â£28,495 and the e-Tourneo Courier at Â£32,190. They qualify for the highest grant because they are the greenest available within the eligible price range. Here is the full list of electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for the Â£1,500 grant: â¢ Citroen e-C3 and Citroen e-C3 Aircrossâ¢ Citroen e-C4 and Citroen e-C4 Xâ¢ Citroen e-C5 Aircrossâ¢ Citroen e-Berlingoâ¢ Cupra Bornâ¢ DS DS3â¢ DS NÂ°4â¢ Nissan Ariyaâ¢ Nissan Micraâ¢ Peugeot E-208â¢ Peugeot E-2008â¢ Peugeot E-308â¢ Peugeot E-408â¢ Peugeot E-Rifterâ¢ Renault 4â¢ Renault 5â¢ Renault Alpine A290â¢ Renault Meganeâ¢ Renault Scenicâ¢ Vauxhall Astra Electricâ¢ Vauxhall Combo Life Electricâ¢ Vauxhall Corsa Electricâ¢ Vauxhall Frontera Electricâ¢ Vauxhall Grandland Electricâ¢ Vauxhall Mokka Electricâ¢ Volkswagen ID.3 The scheme comes in response to EV sales struggling to keep pace with what is needed to meet emissions targets. Challenges include the high prices for electric cars when compared to conventionally powered models. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030, but has allowed non-plug in hybrid sales to continue until this year.

Ian Plummer, commercial director at online vehicle marketplace Autotrader, said it had prompted the highest uptick in consumer demand for electric vehicles on the platform for three years. The Conservatives previously criticised the scheme, suggesting taxpayers shouldn't be footing the bill."

        "Content": "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has refused an invitation from King Charles to a state dinner with Donald Trump in protest over Gaza. Sir Ed, who has been vocal in his disapproval of the US president, said he \"thought and prayed long and hard\" about whether to accept the invitation to the state banquet at Windsor Castle during Mr Trump's historic second visit next month. \"I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse,\" he wrote in The Guardian. The Lib Dem leader said it is an \"enormous honour\" to receive an invitation from the king, and he takes \"very seriously my duty to our sovereign\". \"To refuse an invitation like this goes against all my instincts,\" he added. But, he said he fears Mr Trump will be honoured with a \"lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces and nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation, death, and captivities in Gaza\". \"And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right thing,\" he said. Trump 'has more power than anyone' Sir Ed said Mr Trump \"more than anyone else\" has the power to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, end the famine and get the hostages returned. \"Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace with a two-state solution,\" Sir Ed said. \"But so far, he's decided not to. Instead, he's given Netanyahu his full support.\" Read more:Has Trump ended seven wars as he claims? Sir Ed said he feels \"a responsibility to do whatever I can to ensure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony\" and to ensure the UK makes Trump's \"personal responsibility for securing peace in Israel and Palestine an issue\". The Lib Dem leader made clear that refusing the invitation is not about \"the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree with President Trump\".  'Trump and Starmer can't wish this away' He said he thinks Sir Keir Starmer is right to engage with him, but wishes he would be tougher with Trump \"on everything from tariffs to Vladimir Putin\". Sir Ed pointed out he even argued the UK should use the offer of a state visit as \"leverage\" to persuade Mr Trump \"to do the right thing\". He added: \"Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away.\" Earlier this year, Sir Ed called Mr Trump a \"bully\" and accused him of \"betraying Ukraine\" and \"selling out\" the security of Europe. Last year, after Mr Trump won the election, Sir Ed called it a \"dark, dark day\" as the US would be led \"by a dangerous, destructive demagogue\". Sir Ed is not the first party leader to refuse an invitation to a state dinner with Mr Trump. Then-Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, then-SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and former Speaker of the Commons John Bercow all boycotted the 2019 Trump state dinner."

The alleged victim said moments after telling the man to \"make himself comfortable\" while she finished getting ready for their dinner date, she was pushed against a wall and brutally assaulted. Suspect James Clacher, 57, has been accused of the violent rape of two women, one in 2019 and the other in 2020. Clacher has denied any wrongdoing and is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow. He has lodged a special defence, claiming any sex was consensual. The first alleged attack is said to have taken place at a house in Troon, South Ayrshire, on 24 August 2019. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the accuser said she met Clacher on Tinder. At the time, Clacher was going by the name James Clarke and claimed to be 41-years-old instead of his correct age of 51. \n                  No arrests at Glasgow rally after man in 'Plasticine Action' T-shirt spoken to by police\n                 \n                  Ex-world snooker champion Graeme Dott to face child sex abuse trial\n                 \n                  Woman arrested at anti-abortion protest in Glasgow faces no further action\n                 After speaking for a week, the pair arranged to meet at the woman's home ahead of taking a train to Prestwick for dinner. Clacher was said to have arrived around 15 minutes early, so the woman invited him in while she finished getting ready for their night out. She said she poured herself a glass of prosecco, while Clacher asked for water. The woman, who was wearing a black dress, said she became aware of the accused behind her in the kitchen. Believing him to be nervous, she said: \"Make yourself comfortable, have a wee seat.\" The woman said Clacher went in for a kiss, which she initially refused. During another attempt, it is alleged the accused tried to touch the woman intimately and for her to reciprocate, however, she told jurors she pushed his hand away. The woman then claimed Clacher flipped her around, pushed her against a kitchen wall and raped her. All this was said to have occurred within 10 to 15 minutes of Clacher arriving at her home, When asked by advocate depute Catriona MacLeod if the accused said anything during the alleged attack, the woman replied: \"No, not a word.\" When asked what she said, the woman said she told Clacher: \"I don't like this and I don't want to do this.\" The accuser said Clacher only stopped when she started \"shaking and crying\". Following the alleged serious sexual assault, Clacher reportedly said: \"I need a cuddle.\" The woman said Clacher then guided her to the staircase and upstairs despite her objection, explaining: \"I was in shock. I can't really explain it unless you've experienced it.\" Clacher is then accused of repeatedly attacking the woman in her bedroom. During the alleged incident, the accuser claims she was pushed face-first on to her bed during a sex attack before later being flipped on to her back, pinned down and raped again. Following the alleged assault, the woman said she went to the bathroom to \"clean up\" and described her behaviour as \"really strange\". She said: \"It was almost as if I disappeared. I didn't know what to do.\" The woman added: \"I was just confused. It's really difficult to explain. It's a trauma response.\" Clacher was then said to have told the woman he had received a message from his father that his brother had allegedly suffered a heart attack. The complainer said the accused then attempted to force her into another sex act, but then quickly left her house after she reportedly highlighted: \"Your brother's dying.\" During the early hours of the following morning, the woman phoned Police Scotland in an attempt to seek support information. She told the court she did not intend to report Clacher to the authorities at that time and did not file an official complaint with the officers who turned up at her door later that morning. She said she was still trying to \"make sense of it all\", adding: \"I wasn't ready to have that conversation.\" The woman told the court she shared details of the alleged incident with friends and told her GP \"everything\". She then said she sought support from Archway, a sexual assault referral centre. Read more from Sky News:Two children killed in shooting during mass at primary schoolShooting suspect identified as manhunt continues A few days after the reported attack, jurors heard how Clacher messaged the woman asking if she wanted to go for a walk a day or two after his brother's alleged funeral. The woman confronted him in subsequent text messages, alleging what he had done and branding him a \"predatory rapist\". In response, Clacher apologised if he had \"offended\" the woman and described her as a \"lovely person\". Jurors also heard a recorded phone call between the pair, where she once again confronted him about his alleged behaviour. Clacher denied planning the alleged attack, claiming: \"I never used any force.\" The woman was heard responding \"yes, you did\", before later saying: \"You need to understand what consent is.\" Clacher, who was also confronted about using a false name, denied being a \"predator\" or a \"threat\" to anyone. He told the woman: \"I apologise from the bottom of my heart.\" Clacher even floated the idea of the pair becoming boyfriend and girlfriend and going on dates, saying: \"I like you.\" The woman replied: \"You broke me.\" Clacher then asked for a \"chance to make it up\" to her, adding: \"I could be kind. I could be loving.\" When questioned why she continued to speak to Clacher after the alleged incident, the woman claimed she felt \"sympathy\" for the accused due to his brother reportedly dying. She said she had \"empathy for people\", adding: \"It's just the sort of person I am.\" The second alleged sex attack reportedly occurred in September 2020 at a property in Glasgow. That woman is said to have been repeatedly raped, to her injury, with Clacher facing accusations of pinning her down, struggling with her, and shouting at her during the alleged incident. The first accuser said she received a phone call from the police in September 2020 about that second allegation involving another potential victim. She told the court: \"I quite literally hit the deck.\" The trial, before judge Lord Cubie, will continue on Thursday."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n Reform's plan was meant to be detailed. Instead, there's more confusion. The party had grown weary of the longstanding criticism that their tough talk on immigration did not come with a full proposal for what they would do to tackle small boats if they came to power. So, after six months of planning, yesterday they attempted to put flesh on the bones of their flagship policy. At an expensive press conference in a vast air hanger in Oxford, the headline news was clear: Reform UK would deport anyone who comes here by small boat, arresting, detaining and then deporting up to 600,000 people in the first five years of governing. They would leave international treaties and repeal the Human Rights Act to do it But, one day later, that policy is clear as mud when it comes to who this would apply to. I asked Farage at the time of the announcement whether this would apply to women and girls - an important question - as the basis for their extreme policy seemed to hinge on the safety of women and girls in the UK. He was unequivocal: \"Yes, women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained. \"And I've accepted already that how we deal with children is a much more complicated and difficult issue.\" But a day later, he appeared to row back on this stance at a press conference in Scotland, saying Reform is \"not even discussing women and children at this stage\". Read more:Farage's new 'leave' campaign - how could it work? He later clarified that if a single woman came by boat, then they could fall under the policy, but if \"a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do\". A third clarification in the space of 24 hours on a flagship policy they worked on over six months seems like a pretty big gaffe, and it only feeds into the Labour criticism that these plans aren't yet credible. If they had hoped to pivot from rhetoric to rigour, this announcement showed serious pitfalls. But party strategists probably will not be tearing out too much hair over this, with polling showing Reform UK still as the most trusted party on the issue of immigration overall."

        "Content": " Two children, aged eight and 10, have been killed in a shooting during mass at a school in Minneapolis. An attacker opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. The FBI has confirmed the killer has been identified as Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman, and is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The city's police chief Brian O'Hara said the attacker - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds as mass was celebrated during the first week of term. He added that 17 other people were injured, including 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition. Police believe the suspect, thought to be in his early 20s and acting alone, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr O'Hara called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.\" He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. Three adults in 80s among those injured Hennepin Healthcare, the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said four of the patients were taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. At a later news conference, Mr O'Hara said three adults in their 80s are among those injured in the attack. He added that Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube, which \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". The video has since been taken down with the assistance of the FBI. 'So much' gunfire, witness says Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  The pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school had an all-school mass scheduled at 8.15am local time on Wednesday morning (2.15pm UK time), according to its website. Monday was the first day of the school semester. Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At the first news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\"  Speaking later, and joined by Governor Tim Walz, Mr Frey said that the \"Minneapolis family\" has stepped up in \"thousands of different ways\" after the shooting. \"The way that they acted during the severe threat and danger was nothing short of heroic,\" he says. \"This is a tragic and horrible event that should never occur.\" He added: \"Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainise our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity.\"  Mr Walz said: \"We often come to these and say these are unspeakable tragedies or there are no words for this, there shouldn't be words for these types of incidents because they shouldn't happen.\" The school's headteacher Matt DeBoer added: \"To any of our students and families and staff watching right now, I love you. You're so brave, and I'm so sorry this happened.\"  Senator: Girl 'had to watch several of her friends get shot' Speaking to MSNBC, Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar said she had called one of her longtime employees who had three children in the school during the shooting. The senator described the call with the mother as \"one of the most upsetting things I've ever heard\". \"These kids are doing an all-school mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot - one in the back, one in the neck,\" Ms Klobuchar added. \"And they all got down under the pews and she - her daughter, of course, was not shot - but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.\" Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\""

The shooter - Robin Westman - opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The victims killed were aged eight and 10, and the others injured included 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition, according to the city's police chief Brian O'Hara. Here is what we know so far. What happened? Police were called to the school at just after 8.20am (2.20pm UK time) after witnesses reported hearing semi-automatic gunfire at the pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school. The shooting happened during a mass for all year groups, coming during the first week of term. Police chief Mr O'Hara said the shooter - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds. He called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. The FBI said it is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". What we know about the suspect Police said they believed the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on the site's car park. Mr O'Hara said the suspect had been identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman. Westman is believed to have acted alone in the attack and had lawfully purchased the rifle, pistol, and shotgun used. He added Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube and that it \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". He said the content was taken down with the assistance of the FBI. Asked about a motive, Mr O'Hara said he had no information to share other than the manifesto that was scheduled to come out on YouTube. \"I cannot confirm a relationship between the suspect or his family and the church at this time, but that's obviously something we're looking very closely at,\" he added.  What do we know about the victims? The two children killed have not yet been named publicly. The others injured included 14 children and three adults in their 80s, according to police. After the incident the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, Hennepin Healthcare, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said seven of the patients were critically injured and that four had been taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. In a later update, Mr O'Hara said all of those injured in the shooting were expected to survive. 'It seemed like it went on for eternity' Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  His daughter Alexandra, who attended the school for nine years, added: \"It makes me sick to my stomach knowing that there's probably people I know that are injured or maybe have been killed. \"It doesn't make me feel safe at all in this community that I have been a part of for so long. \"Me and my friends were talking, and we said this is like our version of 9/11.\"  Madee Brandt, a nanny who works near the shooting scene, pulled into the area just as police arrived and children fled. \"I was thankful to see kids coming out unharmed, safe, but just [seeing] the looks on some of their faces... just the screams coming from the mums who didn't know where their kids are,\" Brandt told reporters. \"You see videos online, but it does not compare to seeing it and witnessing it in person. That was rough.\" Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At a news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\" He said the community didn't just want prayers, adding: \"These kids were literally praying, it was the first week of school. \"They were in a church, these are kids that should be learning with their friends.\"  'Deeply unsettling' Later, he called for action on gun violence, saying: \"I think the impetus has to be on all of us as leaders to do a whole lot more to recognise that we've got more guns in this country than we have people.\" Minnesota governor Tim Walz added children at the school had been met with \"evil and horror and death\". Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\" Minneapolis Police were already investigating three deadly shootings in the space of 12 hours. \"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said."

        "Content": "All members of the United Nations Security Council - except the US - have said the famine in Gaza was a \"manmade crisis\". In a joint statement, the 14 council members warned the use of starvation as a weapon of war is banned under international humanitarian law. They called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups, a substantive surge of aid throughout Gaza, and for Israel to immediately and unconditionally lift all restrictions on aid delivery. Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined last week. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system said 514,000 people, nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza, are experiencing famine. It warned the figure is due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September. Israel asked the monitor to retract its assessment on Wednesday, dismissing the findings as false and biased. It said the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food. Meanwhile, Donald Trump held a policy meeting on the war with former British prime minister Tony Blair and his ex-Middle East envoy Jared Kushner. The trio and top White House officials discussed all aspects of Gaza, including escalating food aid deliveries, the hostage crisis, and - notably - post-war plans, a senior administration official told Reuters.

The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said: \"Evacuating Gaza City is inevitable, and therefore, every family that relocates to the south will receive the most abundant humanitarian aid that is currently being worked on.\" Aid groups have warned an expanded Israeli military offensive could deepen the humanitarian crisis facing the besieged enclave. There was also increasing outrage over the double Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza, which killed journalists, emergency responders and others, as the number killed rose to 22 after two more people died. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, abducting 251 people and killing around 1,200, mostly civilians, on 7 October 2023. Israel's offensive has killed nearly 63,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says around half of those killed were women and children."

The whereabouts of Freeman's wife and two children were initially unknown, but Mr Bush said they had visited a police station and spoken to officers late on Tuesday night. Detective leading senior constable Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable Vadim De Waart, 35, have been named by Victoria Police as the two officers fatally shot on Tuesday at Freeman's property. Thompson was just days away from retiring when he was killed, the force said. Another detective was shot, but his wounds are not life-threatening. Ten armed officers tried to execute a search warrant in Porepunkah, a town of just over 1,000 people located 200 miles northeast of Melbourne. The officers \"were met by the offender and they were murdered in cold blood,\" the police chief said. The armed man fled alone on foot into the nearby forest, where an intensive search for him continued through the night and into Wednesday. Mr Bush would not elaborate on the search warrant for Freeman's property and said it was \"too soon to say\" if his attack on the officers was ideologically motivated. But he told reporters that some of the officers who tried to execute the search warrant included members of a unit that investigates sexual offences and child abuse. Read more on Sky News:Israel 'killing a lot of journalists'Three die in helicopter crashSpaceX completes spectacular test flight Australian media widely reported that Freeman expressed so-called sovereign citizen beliefs, pointing to a 2021 video from Wangaratta Magistrates' Court in which he is seen representing himself and unsuccessfully trying to arrest a magistrate and police officers. Members of self-proclaimed sovereign citizen movements use debunked legal theories to reject government authority. In a 2024 finding from Victoria's Supreme Court, where Freeman attempted to challenge a lengthy suspension of his driver's licence, a judge noted that the man had \"a history of unpleasant encounters with police officers\". In his submissions to the court, Freeman referred to the officers as \"Nazis\" and \"terrorist thugs\". The chief commissioner would not say how much was known of Freeman's beliefs before the visit to his property. Porepunkah, famous for its vineyards and beautiful views, is a gateway to Victoria's alpine tourist region. On Tuesday, public buildings and the nearby airfield were shut, and the local school, with just over 100 students, was locked down for several hours before children and staff were permitted to leave. \"Be vigilant, keep yourselves safe,\" Mr Bush urged residents on Wednesday. \"Please don't go outside if you don't need to.\" Mr Bush said the suspect's knowledge of outdoor survival skills posed a \"challenge\" to authorities."

        "Content": "Denmarkâs foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in the country over a report alleging that people connected to Donald Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland.Â  The move to summon the American charge d'affaires came after Denmark's national broadcaster reported on Wednesday that at least three people linked to the US president have been involved in such operations. Mr Trump has repeatedly said he seeks US jurisdiction over Greenland - a vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. He has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. Denmark, a US NATO ally, and Greenland have both stated that the island is not for sale and have criticised reports of US intelligence-gathering activities in the territory.  Danish public broadcaster DR reported on Wednesday that unnamed Danish government and security insiders, as well as unidentified sources in Greenland and the US, believe that at least three Americans with connections to Mr Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations. According to the report, one individual allegedly created a list of Greenlanders supportive of the US, gathered the names of those critical of Mr Trump, and encouraged locals to highlight incidents that could portray Denmark negatively in the American media. Two others reportedly attempted to build relationships with local politicians, business figures, and residents. \n                  Denmark's PM says 'you can't spy against an ally' after claims of US gathering intelligence on Greenland\n                 \n                  Head of US base in Greenland, Colonel Susan Meyers, sacked after criticising JD Vance's remarks during his visit\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 69: Vance visits Greenland - to a frosty reception\n                 An influence operation is an organised effort to shape how people in a society think in order to achieve certain political, military or other objectives. DR said its report is based on information from eight sources who believe the objective is to undermine Denmark's relationship with Greenland by influencing Greenlandic society from within. The US embassy in Copenhagen directed queries on the issue to Washington. Read more from Sky News:Family of Briton held in India asks Foreign Office to helpNazi-looted painting 'spotted in property listing' The Danish broadcaster said it had been unable to clarify whether the Americans were working at their own initiative or on orders from someone else. It said it knows their names but chose not to publish them in order to protect its sources. Sky News is unable to independently verify those claims. \"We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement released by his ministry. \"It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the kingdom in the time ahead. \"Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the kingdom will of course be unacceptable,\" Mr Rasmussen said. Cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland \"is close and based on mutual trust,\" he added. Responding to a request for comment, the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) said it believes that \"particularly in the current situation, Greenland is a target for influence campaigns of various kinds\" that could aim to create divisions in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland The service said it has consistently increased its efforts and presence in Greenland in collaboration with local authorities and plans to maintain this approach moving forward."

        "Content": "A portrait by an Italian master that was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War may have resurfaced for the first time in 80 years - after it was apparently spotted in a property listing. Argentinian police raided the villa in the coastal town of Mar del Plata, which is around 250 miles (410km) south of Buenos Aires, on Tuesday after they were alerted by Dutch journalists. The 17th-century oil-on-canvas, named Portrait of a Lady, was painted by Baroque artist Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi. The artwork had belonged to Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker before the Nazi takeover of his prominent Amsterdam gallery in May 1940. Reporters working for the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad - who have been carrying out a years-long investigation into high-ranking Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien and the Jewish artefacts he stole - reported how they saw the painting hanging in a room in a property listing on Monday. The home is believed to have been owned by the descendants of Kadgien. The listing was still live late on Tuesday, but the image of the apparent portrait, first seen in a 3D tour of the home's interior, appears to have been removed. Sky News has contacted the estate agents, Robles Casas & Campos, for comment. Federal prosecutor Carlos Martinez has said the painting was not found in the house when police raided, but officers seized \"other items that could be useful for the investigation, such as weapons, some engravings, prints and period reproductions\". He said investigators are examining possible charges of concealment and smuggling. The art of the steal The official Dutch database of missing Second World War art, maintained by the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency, identifies the painting as having originally belonged to Mr Goudstikker. Through outright looting or coercive sales, agents acting on behalf of the Nazis made off with countless artworks from private Dutch-Jewish dealers. Mr Goudstikker's paintings were sold illegally to Hermann Goering, known as Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, after his gallery was taken over by the Nazis. The Dutch database lists \"Portrait of a Lady\" as having later passed into the hands of a man named Kadgien from Berlin. A search of the German Federal Archives records the existence of only one Nazi party member with that surname - Friedrich Gustav Kadgien, who oversaw foreign currency, precious metals and the sale of confiscated property as a financial aide to Mr Goering. Following the German defeat in the Second World War, Mr Kadgien fled to Switzerland, then Argentina, according to a declassified report from the Central Intelligence Agency. Read more from Sky News:Warning of six million new cancer casesSpaceX completes spectacular test flightGWR highlights some unclaimed world records Members of the Kadgien family and their business dealings show up repeatedly in Argentine judicial and property registries beginning in the 1950s. Mr Kadgien was never charged with crimes related to the Nazi regime during decades in Argentina. He died in 1978 in Buenos Aires, according to local media reports. Mr Goudstikker's sole surviving heir, his daughter-in-law Marei von Saher, has long pursued restitution for the art dealer's stolen works. In a landmark 2006 case, the Dutch government agreed to return 202 looted paintings from Mr Goudstikker's collection to Ms von Saher after a protracted legal battle. Argentina's dark past The investigation reopens a shadowy chapter in the history of Argentina, which sheltered scores of Nazis who fled Europe to avoid prosecution for war crimes after World War Two, including high-ranking party members and notorious architects of the Holocaust like Adolf Eichmann. Under the government of Argentine General Juan Peron, whose first tenure lasted from 1946 until his overthrow in 1955, fugitive German fascists brought plundered Jewish property with them from the other side of the world, including gold, bank deposits, paintings, sculptures and furnishings. The fate of those items continues to make news decades later as the process of restitution drags along in Argentina and beyond."

        "Content": "The family of a British man held in India without trial for seven years for alleged corruption has demanded the government intervene to secure his release. Christian Michel, 63, has been held since 2018, accused of bribing Indian officials to win a multimillion-dollar helicopter contract. He denies the allegations. Investigators say he was paid almost Â£26m in kickbacks for his part in a 2010 deal won by British-Italian defence company AgustaWestland, which they estimate cost the Indian exchequer around Â£344m. The deal, for 12 luxury helicopters, was cancelled in 2014 amid the corruption allegations. His son Alois Michel, who met Foreign Office minister Catherine West on Tuesday, said the UK government has so far done \"nothing\" to help his father. While he said he didn't get any commitments from Ms West during their meeting, he said she told him the foreign office will \"have a look\" at his requests, the main one being that the government bring the case to the International Criminal Court (ICJ). Christian has been held in New Delhi's Tihar Jail since being extradited to the country from the United Arab Emirates. Indian law allows under-trial prisoners to seek release if they have served more than half of the maximum sentence for their alleged offences. Mr Michel has served the maximum term for his alleged offence - seven years. Alois said his father \"has been illegally detained in India and has already completed the maximum sentence of seven years for the charge against him; that, too, without trial. \"Even the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2020 confirmed that serious human rights violations were taking place and that he should be released immediately. The UK government, however, did nothing. He said they \"truly expect them [ministers] to act against the unlawful behaviour of a Commonwealth country\". India has \"violated its own constitution and international law\" by failing to abide by its own Extradition Act, which asserts that no new charges can be added following extradition to India unless the person commits a new offence after their arrival. Read more on Sky News:Family ready for air crash court battleMillions new cancer cases warningSpaceX test flight success He is now also facing additional charges of forgery of valuable security, which carries severe penalties, including life imprisonment. At a hearing at the Delhi High Court earlier this month, a judge said the offence can carry a life sentence, so it \"cannot be said that the accused has already undergone the period of maximum punishment prescribed for the alleged offences\". That charge was added \"in an illegal manner\", according to Alois. Earlier this year, the Delhi High Court ordered the release of Mr Michel on bail, but said he was unable to leave the country. However, Alois said that they are afraid that if he accepts, he will then be charged with \"another trumped-up offence\". He said: \"In India, today, there is no accountability, no protection and no security.\" Alois' sister Alienor Michel, who has not seen her father since she was 14 years old, said: \"The most important years of my life; which is growing from a little girl to an adult, was spent without my father. Years when I needed him the most. \"I will never get these moments back. I need him to come back home so that he won't miss the time when I grow as a young adult.\" Sky News has contacted the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       A \"weird\", heavily armoured dinosaur just became stranger than palaeontologists even realised, following the discovery of new fossils. The Spicomellus, a 165-million-year-old type of armoured dinosaur famous for its tail weapon, was covered in shields and huge spikes, with some even fused to its skeleton, scientists have discovered. \"We've got this tail weapon, we've this shield over its pelvis, and we've all these crazy spikes,\" Professor Susannah Maidment, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum, told Sky News. \"None of those features would we have predicted to see in the earliest Ankylosaur.\" She co-led the research, which is now published in the science journal Nature. The new fossils, discovered in the Moroccan Atlas mountain town of Boulemane, revealed spikes of up to one metre long around the dinosaur's head, along with plates protecting its throat. On every rib, it had foot-long spikes fused to its skeleton, leading to questions over how its muscles were formed along its ribcage. Its spiked ribs are a protective feature not seen in any other vertebrate, living or extinct, and the dinosaur's distinctive armour may have been used to attract mates, as well as for defence. \"Seeing and studying the Spicomellus fossils for the first time was spine-tingling,\" said the project's co-lead, Professor Richard Butler of the University of Birmingham. \"We just couldn't believe how weird it was and how unlike any other dinosaur, or indeed any other animal we know of alive or extinct. \"It turns much of what we thought we knew about ankylosaurs and their evolution on its head and demonstrates just how much there still is to learn about dinosaurs\". It is an early member of the ankylosaur family and appears to have had a tail weapon around 35 million years earlier than scientists had previously realised. \"We have these really kind of tantalising fragments of ankylosaurs in the Middle Jurassic [period] already,\" said Professor Maidment. \"We knew that they were around, we just have a very poor fossil record from that time period.\" This is the first \"really good\" skeleton of an ankylosaur from that time, according to Professor Maidment. \"The amazing thing about it is that it is absolutely covered in these incredibly elaborate spikes all over its body.\" Professor Maidment was part of the team that excavated the dinosaur, working with the University of Fez in Morocco. When she got to the farmer's house, who had spotted the fossils initially during flash flooding, she thought: \"This is the highlight of my career. I'm never going to see anything as crazy as this ever again.\" Read more on Sky News:Israel 'killing a lot of journalists'Three die in helicopter crashSpaceX completes spectacular test flight The farmer had been pulling out fossils when they appeared, worried that more flooding would wash them away again, and then saving them in his house for the palaeontologists. \"We wouldn't have any fossils at all if it wasn't for him,\" said Professor Maidment. The farmer took her team to the hillside bank where he'd found the fossils, and they began digging. Soon, they found the bone layer and were able to excavate even more of the specimen themselves. This is the only ankylosaur known in Africa, and Professor Maidment says palaeontologists have \"hardly scratched the surface\" of the continent. Because it is a fairly new region to dig in, her team are battling against black market fossil smugglers, excavating and selling precious dinosaur bones without licenses all over the world. \"The last time I went back to the site,\" she said, \"there were huge holes everywhere\", where the illegal diggers had been. \"They had dug huge holes, and we're seeing material pop up on the commercial market.\" Part of the Natural History Museum's plan to find more specimens like the Spicomellus is to work with the local community to build protections for the areas and put an end to illegal fossil smuggling."

A vigil was held opposite Downing Street on Wednesday for the nearly 200 journalists killed in Gaza since the war began in October 2023. Ahead of the gathering, the National Union of Journalists' (NUJ) London freelance branch handed a letter to Number 10 calling on the prime minister to clarify what steps the government is taking to protect journalists in Gaza and to ensure they have safe access to food, water and necessary equipment. They also asked what the government is doing to get international journalists into Gaza to report freely. Currently, Israel only allows them in under IDF supervision. At least 189 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). It is the deadliest period for journalists since the CPJ started gathering data in 1992. Israel has repeatedly denied targeting reporters and accused some of those killed of being terrorists, including prominent Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif, who was killed two weeks ago. The latest attack happened on Monday, when five journalists were among 21 people killed at Nasser Hospital in a \"double tap\" strike. Benjamin Netanyahu described it as a \"tragic mishap\".

'Starmer can do something' Mariam Elsayeh, NUJ ethics council representative and freelance journalist, told Sky News the UK has the power to protect journalists in Gaza and ensure international journalists are allowed in. \"We can do anything, we're a great country, and we have the law and a prime minister who graduated from law school and is known for decades for his humanitarian support,\" she said. \"During the Iraq War, we all witnessed him defending activists, and he was defending the freedom of protest, and he was doing a lot, so we are recalling this from history, and we know he can do something.\" 'A generation has been erased' She added that foreign journalists are needed \"because a generation of journalists in Gaza have been erased\". \"I'm not just looking for foreign journalists to get into Gaza, I would hope to see the Pope asking to get into Gaza, I would hope to see ministers here asking to get into Gaza, I would hope politicians in the European parliament would get in,\" she said. \"If you don't want us to report, at least let people witness, allow politicians to enter. \"This is not insulting the Palestinian people, what the Israelis are doing is insulting the entire international community because they are not respecting anyone, so at least, respect international law.\""

        "Content": " Two children, aged eight and 10, have been killed in a shooting during mass at a school in Minneapolis. An attacker opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. The FBI has confirmed the killer has been identified as Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman, and is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The city's police chief Brian O'Hara said the attacker - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds as mass was celebrated during the first week of term. He added that 17 other people were injured, including 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition. Police believe the suspect, thought to be in his early 20s and acting alone, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr O'Hara called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". \"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.\" He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. Three adults in 80s among those injured Hennepin Healthcare, the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said four of the patients were taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. At a later news conference, Mr O'Hara said three adults in their 80s are among those injured in the attack. He added that Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube, which \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". The video has since been taken down with the assistance of the FBI. 'So much' gunfire, witness says Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  The pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school had an all-school mass scheduled at 8.15am local time on Wednesday morning (2.15pm UK time), according to its website. Monday was the first day of the school semester. Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At the first news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\"  Speaking later, and joined by Governor Tim Walz, Mr Frey said that the \"Minneapolis family\" has stepped up in \"thousands of different ways\" after the shooting. \"The way that they acted during the severe threat and danger was nothing short of heroic,\" he says. \"This is a tragic and horrible event that should never occur.\" He added: \"Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainise our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity.\"  Mr Walz said: \"We often come to these and say these are unspeakable tragedies or there are no words for this, there shouldn't be words for these types of incidents because they shouldn't happen.\" The school's headteacher Matt DeBoer added: \"To any of our students and families and staff watching right now, I love you. You're so brave, and I'm so sorry this happened.\"  Senator: Girl 'had to watch several of her friends get shot' Speaking to MSNBC, Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar said she had called one of her longtime employees who had three children in the school during the shooting. The senator described the call with the mother as \"one of the most upsetting things I've ever heard\". \"These kids are doing an all-school mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot - one in the back, one in the neck,\" Ms Klobuchar added. \"And they all got down under the pews and she - her daughter, of course, was not shot - but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.\" Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\""

        "Content": " Two children have been killed and 17 other people injured after a shooter opened fire at a school in Minneapolis. The shooter - Robin Westman - opened fire with a rifle through the windows of a church at Annunciation Catholic School and struck a group of children as they sat in pews on Wednesday morning. As it happened: FBI says attack investigated as 'terrorism' The victims killed were aged eight and 10, and the others injured included 14 children, two of whom were in a critical condition, according to the city's police chief Brian O'Hara. Here is what we know so far. What happened? Police were called to the school at just after 8.20am (2.20pm UK time) after witnesses reported hearing semi-automatic gunfire at the pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade school. The shooting happened during a mass for all year groups, coming during the first week of term. Police chief Mr O'Hara said the shooter - armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol - approached the side of the church and fired dozens of rounds. He called the attack in Minnesota a \"deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping\". He also said a wooden plank had been used to barricade some side doors. Authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene, Mr O'Hara said. The FBI said it is investigating the shooting as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" and a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". What we know about the suspect Police said they believed the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on the site's car park. Mr O'Hara said the suspect had been identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, a male born as Robert Westman. Westman is believed to have acted alone in the attack and had lawfully purchased the rifle, pistol, and shotgun used. He added Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube and that it \"appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings\". He said the content was taken down with the assistance of the FBI. Asked about a motive, Mr O'Hara said he had no information to share other than the manifesto that was scheduled to come out on YouTube. \"I cannot confirm a relationship between the suspect or his family and the church at this time, but that's obviously something we're looking very closely at,\" he added.  What do we know about the victims? The two children killed have not yet been named publicly. The others injured included 14 children and three adults in their 80s, according to police. After the incident the main trauma hospital in Minneapolis, Hennepin Healthcare, received 11 patients, including nine children - aged six to 14 - and two adults, emergency medicine chair Dr Thomas Wyatt said. He said seven of the patients were critically injured and that four had been taken to operating rooms. Children's Minnesota, a paediatric trauma hospital, said in a statement that five children were admitted. In a later update, Mr O'Hara said all of those injured in the shooting were expected to survive. 'It seemed like it went on for eternity' Bill Bienemann, a witness to the shooting, told Sky News it went on \"for several minutes - a long time for live gunfire\". \"I know what gunfire sounds like, and I was shocked,\" he added. \"I said there's no way that could be gunfire, there was so much of it. \"It seemed like a rifle, it certainly didn't sound like a handgun, so he must have reloaded several times.\"  His daughter Alexandra, who attended the school for nine years, added: \"It makes me sick to my stomach knowing that there's probably people I know that are injured or maybe have been killed. \"It doesn't make me feel safe at all in this community that I have been a part of for so long. \"Me and my friends were talking, and we said this is like our version of 9/11.\"  Madee Brandt, a nanny who works near the shooting scene, pulled into the area just as police arrived and children fled. \"I was thankful to see kids coming out unharmed, safe, but just [seeing] the looks on some of their faces... just the screams coming from the mums who didn't know where their kids are,\" Brandt told reporters. \"You see videos online, but it does not compare to seeing it and witnessing it in person. That was rough.\" Mayor calls shooting 'unspeakable act' At a news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the shooting was an \"unspeakable act\". \"Children are dead,\" he said. \"There are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the absolute pain of this situation.\" He said the community didn't just want prayers, adding: \"These kids were literally praying, it was the first week of school. \"They were in a church, these are kids that should be learning with their friends.\"  'Deeply unsettling' Later, he called for action on gun violence, saying: \"I think the impetus has to be on all of us as leaders to do a whole lot more to recognise that we've got more guns in this country than we have people.\" Minnesota governor Tim Walz added children at the school had been met with \"evil and horror and death\". Responding to the reports, US President Donald Trump said on Truth Social: \"I have been fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene. The White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation.\" Minneapolis Police were already investigating three deadly shootings in the space of 12 hours. \"The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling,\" the Minneapolis Police Department said."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (Â£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (Â£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter?  Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price capWagamama owner among suitors for Costa  Nvidia itself saw its share price rise more than 40% over the past year. Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (Â£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (Â£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint."

        "Content": "Denmarkâs foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in the country over a report alleging that people connected to Donald Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland.Â  The move to summon the American charge d'affaires came after Denmark's national broadcaster reported on Wednesday that at least three people linked to the US president have been involved in such operations. Mr Trump has repeatedly said he seeks US jurisdiction over Greenland - a vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. He has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. Denmark, a US NATO ally, and Greenland have both stated that the island is not for sale and have criticised reports of US intelligence-gathering activities in the territory.  Danish public broadcaster DR reported on Wednesday that unnamed Danish government and security insiders, as well as unidentified sources in Greenland and the US, believe that at least three Americans with connections to Mr Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations. According to the report, one individual allegedly created a list of Greenlanders supportive of the US, gathered the names of those critical of Mr Trump, and encouraged locals to highlight incidents that could portray Denmark negatively in the American media. Two others reportedly attempted to build relationships with local politicians, business figures, and residents. \n                  Denmark's PM says 'you can't spy against an ally' after claims of US gathering intelligence on Greenland\n                 \n                  Head of US base in Greenland, Colonel Susan Meyers, sacked after criticising JD Vance's remarks during his visit\n                 \n                  Trump 100 Day 69: Vance visits Greenland - to a frosty reception\n                 An influence operation is an organised effort to shape how people in a society think in order to achieve certain political, military or other objectives. DR said its report is based on information from eight sources who believe the objective is to undermine Denmark's relationship with Greenland by influencing Greenlandic society from within. The US embassy in Copenhagen directed queries on the issue to Washington. Read more from Sky News:Family of Briton held in India asks Foreign Office to helpNazi-looted painting 'spotted in property listing' The Danish broadcaster said it had been unable to clarify whether the Americans were working at their own initiative or on orders from someone else. It said it knows their names but chose not to publish them in order to protect its sources. Sky News is unable to independently verify those claims. \"We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement released by his ministry. \"It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the kingdom in the time ahead. \"Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the kingdom will of course be unacceptable,\" Mr Rasmussen said. Cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland \"is close and based on mutual trust,\" he added. Responding to a request for comment, the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) said it believes that \"particularly in the current situation, Greenland is a target for influence campaigns of various kinds\" that could aim to create divisions in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland The service said it has consistently increased its efforts and presence in Greenland in collaboration with local authorities and plans to maintain this approach moving forward."

His parents, Matt and Maria, say OpenAI and its chief executive Sam Altman put profit over safety. Warning: This article contains references to suicide that some readers may find distressing. Adam initially used the AI bot to help him with school work, but it quickly \"became Adam's closest confidant, leading him to open up about his anxiety and mental distress\", according to the legal filing. The bot gave the teenager detailed information on how to hide evidence of a failed suicide attempt and validated his suicidal thoughts, according to his parents.

ChatGPT told him: \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival.

They added that OpenAI will continually improve on its safeguards and did not specifically address the lawsuit's allegations. OpenAI said in a blog post that it is planning to add parental controls and explore ways to connect users in crisis with real-world resources. It is also exploring building a network of licensed professionals who can respond through ChatGPT itself. The case against OpenAI is thought to be the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death and seeks unspecified financial damages. It is being jointly represented by Edelson and the Tech Justice Law Project, a legal advocacy group that last year filed a lawsuit with Character.ai over the death of another teenager.

        "Content": "A man who faked his own death so he could be with a woman he met online has been jailed for 89 days.Â  Ryan Borgwardt, 45, from the US state of Wisconsin, was reported missing last August, after telling his wife he was going kayaking on Green Lake, about 100 miles (160km) northwest of Milwaukee. He was presumed to have drowned, but, after failing to find his body, investigators discovered he had acquired a new passport, bought life insurance and reversed a vasectomy, and wondered if he had faked his death to meet up with an Uzbekistani woman he had been communicating with. They tracked him down and persuaded him to return to the US in December, where, after turning himself in, he was charged with obstructing the search for his body. Prosecutors said he went to the lake, around 50 miles (80km) from his family's home in Watertown, on 11 August. During the night, he overturned his kayak and paddled back to shore in an inflatable raft that he brought with him. Leaving his ID in the water, he used an electric bicycle to get to the state capital, Madison, 70 miles (112km) away. From there, he caught a bus to Toronto, flew to Paris and then to Asia, before moving onto the country of Georgia. He was picked up by a woman and they spent several days in a hotel before he took up residency in Georgia. Ahead of his sentencing, Green Lake County District Attorney Gerise LaSpisa said his \"entire plan to fake his death to devastate his family in order to serve his own selfish desires hinged on him dying in the lake and selling his death to the world\". Borgwardt's wife of 22 years divorced him four months after he returned.

Prosecutors asked Green Lake County Circuit Judge Mark Slate to jail Borgwardt for 45 days, but the judge handed down 89 days - the length of time between being declared missing and being contacted by the sheriff's department in November. The case echoes that of John Darwin, who faked his own death while canoeing in the North Sea in 2002 in order to avoid bankruptcy."

Three minutes into the flight and dozens of miles above ground, the rocket's upper half separated as planned from its Super Heavy booster - the 232ft first stage that normally lands back in its launch tower's giant catch-arms. But this time the booster, which SpaceX said had been fitted with larger and stronger fins for greater stability, targeted the Gulf of Mexico waters to demonstrate an alternate landing strategy. Meanwhile, Starship was launched into space, and deployed its eight dummy Starlink satellites, a key demonstration for a rocket that represents the future of SpaceX's dominant launch business. An hour into the mission, Starship re-entered Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, putting a variety of hexagonal heat shield tiles to the test as it blazed at supersonic speed. More science and tech news:Warning of six million new cancer casesScientists hail treatment for babies with rare condition Spacecraft that return to Earth have historically required new heat shields or repairs after each mission due to damage that occurs from high-speed atmospheric friction. Science correspondent \"A lot was hanging on this test flight, and they nailed it,\" said Sky's science correspondent Thomas Moore.  This was the fourth test flight of the year for the world's largest and most powerful rocket, after the previous three ended in failure. This time, however, the booster came down in the controlled descent as planned - SpaceX decided not to send it to the launch pad for its classic \"chopsticks\" catch. The upper-stage, called the ship, released its satellites, relit its engine and safely made it back through the atmosphere. That's despite the fact that engineers had removed some of the tiles from the heat shield in order to stress-test the structure. They were also testing other ways of cooling down the rocket for \"what is a blistering ride,\" according to Moore. However, even though this test flight has been a success, the rocket hasn't yet proved itself ready to go to the moon and Mars, he said. \"Elon Musk has talked about how difficult it has been designing a heat shield that is robust enough for the really quick turnarounds that he envisages for these rockets,\" said Moore, who said Musk wants the turnaround to be as \"fast as an airliner turns around at an airport\". NASA is \"banking on\" SpaceX to get the Starship ready in just two years to take people and goods to the surface of the moon. Elon Musk has even bigger dreams and has talked about an uncrewed Starship going all the way to Mars by the end of next year. \"Now, at the moment, that looks doubtful, but you'd never bet against SpaceX,\" said Moore. But SpaceX has been trying to create an exterior shield that requires little to no refurbishment after each use. The crewless demo launch came after back-to-back tests in January and March ended just minutes after lift-off, raining wreckage into the ocean, before the most recent test in May ended when the spacecraft tumbling out of control and breaking apart.  That all came after the first Starship exploded minutes into its inaugural test flight in 2023. NASA has ordered two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade, while Mr Musk has ambitious plans to send humans to space in the next few years."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (Â£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (Â£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter?  Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price capWagamama owner among suitors for Costa  Nvidia itself saw its share price rise more than 40% over the past year. Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (Â£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (Â£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n  For people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, also known as ADHD, the traditional workplace can be a challenging world to navigate.Â  Yet, diagnosis rates of the condition are rocketing across all age groups and employment lawyers are now being flooded with enquiries from people who are concerned about how their condition has been handled at work. Businesses are being forced to pay attention. Bahar Khorram is one of those people. The IT executive was working at Capgemini, the global consultancy firm. While on her probation period, she started struggling with her tasks and asked for support. \"I was trying to avoid taking the legal route because I really liked the company. This was my dream job, I loved it, and I knew I could do it. So I was trying to manage it in my head and trying to do what they asked. But when I realised that I couldn't, I was experiencing anxiety,\" she said. \"I started losing a lot of weight, I went to the doctor, and I sat there, and I burst into tears, and he said, 'you are depressed, and you have anxiety.'\" Not everyone's experience is the same, but people with the condition might have difficulty concentrating on certain tasks or remembering instructions. They might struggle with organisation and restlessness. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price cap Wagamama owner among suitors for Costa Last month, an employment tribunal in London found Capgemini failed to provide the recommended neurodiversity awareness training, and this amounted to discrimination. In a statement, the company said: \"Capgemini is deeply committed to building a truly inclusive and diverse workplace, where everyone feels valued and respected. \"We continuously strengthen our culture of inclusion through employee networks, training, and open dialogue, ensuring that every voice is heard. We don't comment on specific employees.\" An issue for businesses across the country The Capgemini case is not remote or isolated. The decision has ramifications for businesses across the country, especially as rates of ADHD diagnosis are climbing. Official data analysed by Sky News shows the number of people in work with disabilities or long-term health conditions has risen by 21% since the pandemic. That includes a 35% jump in workers with learning difficulties and mental conditions like ADHD. Many of these people will already be in work and are being diagnosed as adults. This is a trend that is particularly pronounced among older women, with ADHD traditionally having been underdiagnosed in young girls. However, it will also affect the future workforce. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the number of disabled children with ADHD as their main condition has more than doubled - from 38,000 in 2013 to 66,000 in 2023. It means the profile of the workforce is changing, and businesses will have to think hard about how they can harness the potential and meet the needs of their workers to maximise their productivity. A growing legal issue  Failure to do so could also have legal consequences. Although not every case of ADHD meets the definition of a disability, employment lawyers are increasingly receiving enquiries about possible discrimination related to neurodivergent conditions, especially since the pandemic. Elizabeth McGlone, an employment lawyer at the law firm Didlaw, said every other enquiry she receives now relates to neurodiversity, up from one in every 10 or 20 before the pandemic. \"So the classic scenario is performance. They're struggling at work in relation to time management, attendance, assimilating information, assimilating tasks, prioritising. And it's not so much that they can't do the job, they are just not having enough adjustments made to be able to do the job,\" she said. \"I do think employers have greater responsibilities. I do also think it depends on the size and the resources of your business. So for a smaller business, it's going to be much more difficult to make great changes. But some of the changes don't have to be that significant. \"They can be as small as moving someone's desk so they haven't got as much surrounding noise, or making sure that they are taking regular rest breaks.\" Grey areas However, not all cases are clear-cut. Neurodiversity sits on a spectrum, and a diagnosis can create grey areas for businesses, where it is difficult to determine how much of a role the condition is playing in an employee's performance at work. \"You don't want to be cynical,\" said Ms McGlone. \"Obviously, you take everybody at face value, but I have had chronological circumstances where somebody has got performance issues, the employer isn't aware of any diagnosis, then a diagnosis has been sought and confirmedâ¦ sometimes you do feel some element of it being contrived, but that's very, very few and far between.\""

Sky News has learnt that Apollo Global Management, which owns Wagamama's parent company, The Restaurant Group, is one of a small number of suitors to have held initial talks with advisers to The Coca-Cola Company, Costa's owner. Sources close to the process said it remained at a very early stage, with indicative bids not due for several weeks. Money latest: Should I fix? Reaction to energy price cap shift Apollo might not decide to pursue a formal offer for Costa, the sources said. KKR, another US-based private equity giant, has also spoken to Lazard, Coca-Cola's adviser, but was unlikely to table a firm bid for Costa, they added. News of Apollo's early interest comes days after Sky News revealed that Coca-Cola was exploring a disposal of Costa, less than seven years after acquiring it in a bid to reduce its reliance on carbonated soft drinks. Costa trades from more than 2,000 stores in the UK, and well over 3,000 globally, according to the latest available figures. It has been reported to have a global workforce numbering 35,000, although Coca-Cola has not responded to questions from Sky News about Costa's current number of outlets or employees. Analysts believe a sale could crystallise a multibillion-pound loss on the Â£3.9bn sum Coca-Cola agreed to pay to buy Costa from Whitbread, the London-listed owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain, in 2018. One suggested that Costa might now command a price tag of just Â£2bn in a sale process. Accounts filed at Companies House for Costa show that in 2023 - the last year for which standalone results are available - the coffee chain recorded revenues of Â£1.22bn. While this represented a 9% increase on the previous year, it was below the Â£1.3bn recorded in 2018, the final year before Coca-Cola took control of the business. Coca-Cola has been grappling with the weak performance of Costa for some time, with Mr Quincey saying on an earnings call last month: \"We're in the mode of reflecting on what we've learned, thinking about how we might want to find new avenues to grow in the coffee category while continuing to run the Costa business successfully.\" \"It's still a lot of money we put down, and we wanted that money to work as hard as possible.\" The deal was intended to provide Coca-Cola with a global platform in a growing area of the beverages market. Costa trades in dozens of countries, including India, Japan, Mexico and Poland, and operates a network of thousands of coffee vending machines internationally under the Costa Express brand. The chain was founded in 1971 by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa. It was sold to Whitbread for Â£19m in 1995, when it traded from fewer than 40 stores. The business is now one of Britain's biggest private sector employers, and has become a ubiquitous presence on high streets across the country. Its main rivals include Starbucks, Caffe Nero, and Pret a Manger - the last of which is being prepared for a stake sale and possible public market flotation. It has also faced growing competition from more upmarket chains such as Gail's, the bakeries group, which has also been exploring a sale. Apollo and KKR both declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  The small increase in domestic energy bills announced today confirms that prices have stabilised since the ruinous spikes that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but remain 40% higher than before the war - around 20% in real terms - with little chance of falling in the medium-term. Any increase in the annual cost of gas and electricity is unwelcome. But, at 2%, it is so marginal that in practice many consumers will not notice it unless they pay close attention to their consumption. Regulator Ofgem uses a notional figure for \"typical\" annual consumption of gas and electricity to capture the impact of price change, which shows a Â£34 increase to Â£1,755. Money latest: Should I fix? Reaction to energy price cap shift At less than Â£3 a month, it's a small increase that could be wiped out by a warm week in October, doubled by an early cold snap, and only applies to those households that pay a variable rate for their power. That number is declining as 37% of customers now take advantage of cheaper fixed rate deals that have returned to the market, as well as direct debit payments, options often not available to those struggling most. Ofgem's headline number is useful as a guide, but what really counts is how much energy you use, and the cap the regulator applies to the underlying unit prices and standing charges. \n                  Energy price cap: Government costs to raise bills from October\n                 \n                  Energy bills expected to rise from October - despite previous forecasts\n                 \n                  Energy price cap drop is welcome - but eyes will be on Trump, Ukraine and the weather ahead of winter\n                 Here, the maximum chargeable rate for electricity rises from 25.73p per kWh to 26.35p, while the unit cost of gas actually falls, from 6.33p per kWh to 6.26p. Daily standing charges for both increase, however, by a total of 7p. That increase provides an insight into the factors that will determine prices today and in future.  The biggest factor remains the international price of wholesale gas. It was what drove prices north of Â£4,000 a year after the pipelines to Russia were turned off, and has dragged them back down as Norway and liquid natural gas imported from the US, Australia and Qatar filled the gap. The long-term solution is to replace reliance on gas with renewable and low-carbon sources of energy, but shifting the balance comes with an up-front cost shared by all bill payers. So too is the cost of energy poverty that has soared since 2022.  This price cap includes an increase to cover \"balancing costs\". These are fees typically paid to renewable generators to stop producing electricity because the national grid can't always handle the transfer of power from Scotland, where the bulk is produced, to the south, where the lion's share is consumed. There is also an increase to cover the expansion of the Warm Homes Discount, a Â£150 payment extended to 2.7 million people by the government during the torturous process of withdrawing and then partially re-instating the winter fuel payment to pensioners. And while the unit price of gas has actually fallen, the daily standing charge, which covers the cost of maintaining the gas network, has risen by 4p, somewhat counterintuitively, because we are using less. While warmer weather and greater efficiency of homes mean consumption has fallen, the cost of maintaining the network remains, and has to be shared across fewer units of gas. Expect that trend to be magnified as gas use declines but remains essential to maintaining electricity supply at short notice on a grid dominated by renewables. And we can expect further increases to come next year when the cost of building the new nuclear power station at Sizewell C starts to appear on bills. That's expected to add around Â£10 to every bill for the next 40 years. As with wind power and grid upgrades, the future benefits are paid for today."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Cash-strapped Thames Water has agreed a payment plan with regulators to cover off a record fine that threatened to exacerbate its financial difficulties. Britain's biggest supplier was to pay Â£24.5m of the Â£122.7m sum by 30 September under the agreement. Ofwat, which imposed the penalty in May for breaches of its rules over sewage discharges and dividend payments, said the balance would be due once a rescue financing deal was agreed or if it was placed into a special administration regime by the government. Money latest: Should I fix? Reaction to energy price cap shift Sky News revealed earlier this month that Steve Reed, the environment secretary, had signed off on the appointment of FTI Consulting to assist with contingency planning for putting Thames into a special administration regime. It further meant that FTI was the frontrunner to act as the company's administrator, should Thames fail to secure its private sector bailout. Sky's City editor Mark Kleinman said that the deal on the table, that would see Thames's lenders injecting about Â£5bn of new capital and writing off roughly Â£12bn of value across its capital structure, was potentially dependent on Ofwat's handling of the water firm's fines. \n                  Consumers could get new roles in effort to rebuild trust in water companies\n                 \n                  Thames Water crisis: Ministers line up administrator for utility giant\n                 \n                  Does water's 'Great Stink' moment pass the sniff test? \n                  Thames has argued it needs financial space to guarantee its turnaround. Thames initially had until 20 August to pay the Â£122.7m sum, but it requested the agreement of a payment plan. Ofwat's deal with Thames only kicks the can down the road.

Thames Water said the fines would not be paid for out of customer bills. It added: \"The company continues to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led recapitalisation which delivers for customers and the environment as soon as practicable.\" The agreement was announced as the water watchdog prepares to be abolished under government plans to bolster oversight of the industry. Lynn Parker, senior director of enforcement at Ofwat, said: \"This payment plan continues to hold Thames Water to account for their failures but also recognises the ongoing equity raise and recapitalisation process. \"Our focus remains on ensuring that the company takes the right steps to deliver a turnaround in its operational performance and strengthen its financial resilience to the benefit of customers.\""

A vigil was held opposite Downing Street on Wednesday for the nearly 200 journalists killed in Gaza since the war began in October 2023. Ahead of the gathering, the National Union of Journalists' (NUJ) London freelance branch handed a letter to Number 10 calling on the prime minister to clarify what steps the government is taking to protect journalists in Gaza and to ensure they have safe access to food, water and necessary equipment. They also asked what the government is doing to get international journalists into Gaza to report freely. Currently, Israel only allows them in under IDF supervision. At least 189 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). It is the deadliest period for journalists since the CPJ started gathering data in 1992. Israel has repeatedly denied targeting reporters and accused some of those killed of being terrorists, including prominent Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif, who was killed two weeks ago. The latest attack happened on Monday, when five journalists were among 21 people killed at Nasser Hospital in a \"double tap\" strike. Benjamin Netanyahu described it as a \"tragic mishap\". Journalists at the vigil held up placards with the names of Gazan journalists, many of whom were freelance, who have been killed. They read their names out.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @serenabarksing\n Reform's plan was meant to be detailed. Instead, there's more confusion. The party had grown weary of the longstanding criticism that their tough talk on immigration did not come with a full proposal for what they would do to tackle small boats if they came to power. So, after six months of planning, yesterday they attempted to put flesh on the bones of their flagship policy. At an expensive press conference in a vast air hanger in Oxford, the headline news was clear: Reform UK would deport anyone who comes here by small boat, arresting, detaining and then deporting up to 600,000 people in the first five years of governing. They would leave international treaties and repeal the Human Rights Act to do it But, one day later, that policy is clear as mud when it comes to who this would apply to. I asked Farage at the time of the announcement whether this would apply to women and girls - an important question - as the basis for their extreme policy seemed to hinge on the safety of women and girls in the UK. He was unequivocal: \"Yes, women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained. \"And I've accepted already that how we deal with children is a much more complicated and difficult issue.\" But a day later, he appeared to row back on this stance at a press conference in Scotland, saying Reform is \"not even discussing women and children at this stage\". Read more:Farage's new 'leave' campaign - how could it work? He later clarified that if a single woman came by boat, then they could fall under the policy, but if \"a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do\". A third clarification in the space of 24 hours on a flagship policy they worked on over six months seems like a pretty big gaffe, and it only feeds into the Labour criticism that these plans aren't yet credible. If they had hoped to pivot from rhetoric to rigour, this announcement showed serious pitfalls. But party strategists probably will not be tearing out too much hair over this, with polling showing Reform UK still as the most trusted party on the issue of immigration overall."

        "Content": " Nigel Farage has appeared to row back on his claim that women and children would be detained and deported if they arrived in the UK on small boats, saying it was not Reform's \"priority\". The Reform UK leader gave a news conference on Tuesday in which he outlined plans to deport around 600,000 illegal migrants in the first five years of his government if he wins the next election. Politics latest: Most Britons back asylum hotel protests, polling suggests He did not recoil from including women and children in his deportation plans, which could see those arriving on small boats sent back to countries with poor human rights records, including Afghanistan and Eritrea. Asked initially by Sky News' political correspondent Serena Barker-Singh whether women with children and unaccompanied minors would be included in his plans, the Reform UK leader admitted that the question of \"how we deal with children is much more complicated\", but added: \"Women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained.\" The justification Mr Farage gave for sending people back to countries where they face mistreatment and torture was that his priority was the safety of people in Britain, which he argued had been undermined by \"undocumented males\" entering the country. However, holding another news conference in Scotland on Wednesday to announce the defection of a member of Scottish parliament from the Tories to Reform, Mr Farage claimed it was \"not true\" that he had \"committed to sending women and girls back to countries where they can be raped, tortured and killed\". Mr Farage told the reporter: \"I was very, very clear yesterday in what I said, that deportation of illegal immigrants - we are not even discussing women and children at this stage - there are so many illegal males in Britain, and the news reports that said that after my conference yesterday were wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.\" Asked whether women and children would be \"exempt\" from deportation, the Reform UK leader added: \"I didn't say exempt forever, but at this stage it's not part of our plan for the next five years.\" On Tuesday, senior Reform figure Zia Yusuf said \"phase one\" of the party's plans would focus on adults, with unaccompanied children being removed \"towards the latter half of that five years\". But asked to clarify his comments further, the Reform leader appeared to say women and children were not \"top of our list\" for deportation. \"Deporting children is a very difficult thing to do - who do they go to, what are the wards of care,\" he said.  \"Women and children intimating families that have been here illegally for some years: are they top of our list? No. So there's a slight confusion over this. Pressed on what his plan was for \"women and children who come to claim asylum\", Mr Farage said: \"If a single woman...comes to Britain, they will be detained and deported. If a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do. \"But the big message here is that the vast majority of those that come are young males, upwards of 75% of those that come are young males. They will not be staying. Any of them.\" Under Reform's \"operation restoring justice programme\" - which has been denounced by opposition parties as \"inflammatory\" and \"unworkable\" - anyone who arrives in the UK illegally via small boat would be detained and deported, and refused permission to stay. Read more:Labour sinks to lowest approval rating of this parliamentFarage's small boats plan put Labour and Tories on the spot Mr Farage said he believed the party would be able to deport around 600,000 asylum seekers in the first parliament of a potential Reform UK government, at an estimated cost of Â£10bn over the five-year period. Illegal migrants would be forced to return to their home countries, something the Reform leader said could be achieved by the UK by choosing not to follow certain human rights laws. The party is planning to repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that such laws have allowed foreign offenders to challenge their own deportation orders through the courts and remain in the UK. It would also disapply the 1951 Refugee Convention and the UN Convention Against Torture, and the Council of Europe's anti-trafficking convention. Instead, under its own Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill, those who come to the UK on small boats will be barred from claiming asylum, and held in detention centres on spare RAF bases rather than taxpayer-funded hotels, which have been subject to a number of protests from local communities in recent months."

Sir Ed, who has been vocal in his disapproval of the US president, said he \"thought and prayed long and hard\" about whether to accept the invitation to the state banquet at Windsor Castle during Mr Trump's historic second visit next month. \"I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse,\" he wrote in The Guardian. The Lib Dem leader said it is an \"enormous honour\" to receive an invitation from the king, and he takes \"very seriously my duty to our sovereign\". \"To refuse an invitation like this goes against all my instincts,\" he added. But, he said he fears Mr Trump will be honoured with a \"lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces and nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation, death, and captivities in Gaza\". \"And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right thing,\" he said. Trump 'has more power than anyone' Sir Ed said Mr Trump \"more than anyone else\" has the power to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, end the famine and get the hostages returned. \"Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace with a two-state solution,\" Sir Ed said. \"But so far, he's decided not to. Instead, he's given Netanyahu his full support.\" Read more:Has Trump ended seven wars as he claims?

The Lib Dem leader made clear that refusing the invitation is not about \"the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree with President Trump\".  'Trump and Starmer can't wish this away' He said he thinks Sir Keir Starmer is right to engage with him, but wishes he would be tougher with Trump \"on everything from tariffs to Vladimir Putin\". Sir Ed pointed out he even argued the UK should use the offer of a state visit as \"leverage\" to persuade Mr Trump \"to do the right thing\". He added: \"Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away.\" Earlier this year, Sir Ed called Mr Trump a \"bully\" and accused him of \"betraying Ukraine\" and \"selling out\" the security of Europe. Last year, after Mr Trump won the election, Sir Ed called it a \"dark, dark day\" as the US would be led \"by a dangerous, destructive demagogue\". Sir Ed is not the first party leader to refuse an invitation to a state dinner with Mr Trump. Then-Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, then-SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and former Speaker of the Commons John Bercow all boycotted the 2019 Trump state dinner."

Sir Keir Starmer's party is currently on 20% of the vote - the lowest level since last year's general election and just three points ahead of the Conservatives on 17% of the vote. Politics latest: Labour goes on the attack against Reform Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which on Tuesday outlined plans to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants if it wins power at the next election, is currently in the lead with 28% of the vote. Asked about the polling, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the EU relations minister, told Sky News' Anna Jones that the government had been forced to take \"very difficult decisions to stabilise the public finances early in this parliament\". He said Labour had acted in the \"national interest\" by securing a reset deal with the EU which lowers costs for supermarkets and shoppers, and which the government hopes to extend. \"That is acting in the national interest, that is not about particular opinion polls you are showing me today,\" he said. \"That is about work the prime minister asked me to do and to prepare for before this government came into office and that is what this government does. It does the hard yards of delivery for the British people.\" He added: \"What Nigel Farage does is to stoke problems and offer empty promises for their solution.\" Mr Thomas-Symonds, who represents Torfaen, took the fight to Mr Farage in a speech today, where he accused the Reform UK leader of wanting to \"reverse our progress\" and of \"dividing communities and stoking anger\". The government wants to get a permanent deal with the EU on food and drink agreed in the next 18 months. The current temporary agreement, which was put in place in June, stopped checks on some fruit and vegetables imported from the EU, which meant no border checks or fees would be paid, and is due to expire in January 2027. Mr Farage has previously called for the agreement between the UK and EU to be torn up, saying in May that the SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] provisions agreed that month would push the UK \"back into the orbit of Brussels, giving away vast amounts of our sovereignty for very little in return\". In his speech, Mr Thomas-Symonds said the Tories and Reform UK only offer \"easy answers and snake oil\" over the UK's relationship with the EU. \"Some will hysterically cry even treason,\" he said. \"Some will say we're surrendering sovereignty or freedoms, but that is nonsense.

When you're tough, decisive and collaborative. That cannot rest on easy answers and snake oil. The Tories [are] completely 2D, stuck with a ghost of Brexit past. And then Nigel Farage, who has pledged to reverse our progress.\" A Reform UK spokesperson said: \"No one has done more damage to British businesses than this Labour government. \"With 157,000 fewer people on payroll since Labour took office, their jobs tax is stifling success and hitting small and medium-sized businesses across the country. \"Cosying up to the EU and leaving us entangled in reams of retained EU law which Kemi Badenoch failed to scrap will not resuscitate Britain's struggling economy.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (Â£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (Â£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter?  Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price capWagamama owner among suitors for Costa  Nvidia itself saw its share price rise more than 40% over the past year. Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (Â£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (Â£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       The parents of a teenage boy who killed himself after speaking to ChatGPT are suing OpenAI over his death.Â  16-year-old Adam Raine died on 11 April after talking about suicide with ChatGPT for months, according to the San Francisco lawsuit. His parents, Matt and Maria, say OpenAI and its chief executive Sam Altman put profit over safety. Warning: This article contains references to suicide that some readers may find distressing. Adam initially used the AI bot to help him with school work, but it quickly \"became Adam's closest confidant, leading him to open up about his anxiety and mental distress\", according to the legal filing. The bot gave the teenager detailed information on how to hide evidence of a failed suicide attempt and validated his suicidal thoughts, according to his parents. ChatGPT even offered to draft a suicide note, according to the lawsuit. \n                  OpenAI releases long-awaited GPT-5 AI chatbot upgrade\n                 \n                  Tech giant OpenAI signs deal with government to boost efficiency in public services\n                 \n                  OpenAI boss Sam Altman denies sister's sexual abuse lawsuit claims\n                 Adam had confided to ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him: \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of his note. \"This tragedy was not a glitch or unforeseen edge case - it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,\" wrote the Raine family's lawyers. Read more on Sky News:Israel 'killing a lot of journalists'Three die in helicopter crashSpaceX completes spectacular test flight An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is saddened by Adam's death and that ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines. \"While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade,\" the spokesperson said. They added that OpenAI will continually improve on its safeguards and did not specifically address the lawsuit's allegations. OpenAI said in a blog post that it is planning to add parental controls and explore ways to connect users in crisis with real-world resources. It is also exploring building a network of licensed professionals who can respond through ChatGPT itself. The case against OpenAI is thought to be the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death and seeks unspecified financial damages. It is being jointly represented by Edelson and the Tech Justice Law Project, a legal advocacy group that last year filed a lawsuit with Character.ai over the death of another teenager.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       A \"weird\", heavily armoured dinosaur just became stranger than palaeontologists even realised, following the discovery of new fossils. The Spicomellus, a 165-million-year-old type of armoured dinosaur famous for its tail weapon, was covered in shields and huge spikes, with some even fused to its skeleton, scientists have discovered. \"We've got this tail weapon, we've this shield over its pelvis, and we've all these crazy spikes,\" Professor Susannah Maidment, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum, told Sky News. \"None of those features would we have predicted to see in the earliest Ankylosaur.\" She co-led the research, which is now published in the science journal Nature. The new fossils, discovered in the Moroccan Atlas mountain town of Boulemane, revealed spikes of up to one metre long around the dinosaur's head, along with plates protecting its throat. On every rib, it had foot-long spikes fused to its skeleton, leading to questions over how its muscles were formed along its ribcage. Its spiked ribs are a protective feature not seen in any other vertebrate, living or extinct, and the dinosaur's distinctive armour may have been used to attract mates, as well as for defence. \"Seeing and studying the Spicomellus fossils for the first time was spine-tingling,\" said the project's co-lead, Professor Richard Butler of the University of Birmingham. \"We just couldn't believe how weird it was and how unlike any other dinosaur, or indeed any other animal we know of alive or extinct. \"It turns much of what we thought we knew about ankylosaurs and their evolution on its head and demonstrates just how much there still is to learn about dinosaurs\". It is an early member of the ankylosaur family and appears to have had a tail weapon around 35 million years earlier than scientists had previously realised. \"We have these really kind of tantalising fragments of ankylosaurs in the Middle Jurassic [period] already,\" said Professor Maidment. \"We knew that they were around, we just have a very poor fossil record from that time period.\" This is the first \"really good\" skeleton of an ankylosaur from that time, according to Professor Maidment. \"The amazing thing about it is that it is absolutely covered in these incredibly elaborate spikes all over its body.\" Professor Maidment was part of the team that excavated the dinosaur, working with the University of Fez in Morocco. When she got to the farmer's house, who had spotted the fossils initially during flash flooding, she thought: \"This is the highlight of my career. I'm never going to see anything as crazy as this ever again.\" Read more on Sky News:Israel 'killing a lot of journalists'Three die in helicopter crashSpaceX completes spectacular test flight The farmer had been pulling out fossils when they appeared, worried that more flooding would wash them away again, and then saving them in his house for the palaeontologists. \"We wouldn't have any fossils at all if it wasn't for him,\" said Professor Maidment. The farmer took her team to the hillside bank where he'd found the fossils, and they began digging. Soon, they found the bone layer and were able to excavate even more of the specimen themselves. This is the only ankylosaur known in Africa, and Professor Maidment says palaeontologists have \"hardly scratched the surface\" of the continent. Because it is a fairly new region to dig in, her team are battling against black market fossil smugglers, excavating and selling precious dinosaur bones without licenses all over the world. \"The last time I went back to the site,\" she said, \"there were huge holes everywhere\", where the illegal diggers had been. \"They had dug huge holes, and we're seeing material pop up on the commercial market.\" Part of the Natural History Museum's plan to find more specimens like the Spicomellus is to work with the local community to build protections for the areas and put an end to illegal fossil smuggling."

        "Content": " SpaceX has successfully launched its biggest ever rocket, named Starship, from Texas after a year of mishaps. Elon Musk's flagship spacecraft, which has been earmarked for future missions to the moon and Mars, took off just after 6.30pm local time on Tuesday. It launched into orbit and deployed eight dummy satellites before splashing down as planned in the Indian Ocean. The aim was to test the 403ft-tall ship's new heat shield tiles and satellite deployment abilities, among hundreds of other upgrades from past iterations. Three minutes into the flight and dozens of miles above ground, the rocket's upper half separated as planned from its Super Heavy booster - the 232ft first stage that normally lands back in its launch tower's giant catch-arms. But this time the booster, which SpaceX said had been fitted with larger and stronger fins for greater stability, targeted the Gulf of Mexico waters to demonstrate an alternate landing strategy. Meanwhile, Starship was launched into space, and deployed its eight dummy Starlink satellites, a key demonstration for a rocket that represents the future of SpaceX's dominant launch business. An hour into the mission, Starship re-entered Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, putting a variety of hexagonal heat shield tiles to the test as it blazed at supersonic speed. More science and tech news:Warning of six million new cancer casesScientists hail treatment for babies with rare condition Spacecraft that return to Earth have historically required new heat shields or repairs after each mission due to damage that occurs from high-speed atmospheric friction. Science correspondent \"A lot was hanging on this test flight, and they nailed it,\" said Sky's science correspondent Thomas Moore.  This was the fourth test flight of the year for the world's largest and most powerful rocket, after the previous three ended in failure. This time, however, the booster came down in the controlled descent as planned - SpaceX decided not to send it to the launch pad for its classic \"chopsticks\" catch. The upper-stage, called the ship, released its satellites, relit its engine and safely made it back through the atmosphere. That's despite the fact that engineers had removed some of the tiles from the heat shield in order to stress-test the structure. They were also testing other ways of cooling down the rocket for \"what is a blistering ride,\" according to Moore. However, even though this test flight has been a success, the rocket hasn't yet proved itself ready to go to the moon and Mars, he said. \"Elon Musk has talked about how difficult it has been designing a heat shield that is robust enough for the really quick turnarounds that he envisages for these rockets,\" said Moore, who said Musk wants the turnaround to be as \"fast as an airliner turns around at an airport\". NASA is \"banking on\" SpaceX to get the Starship ready in just two years to take people and goods to the surface of the moon. Elon Musk has even bigger dreams and has talked about an uncrewed Starship going all the way to Mars by the end of next year. \"Now, at the moment, that looks doubtful, but you'd never bet against SpaceX,\" said Moore. But SpaceX has been trying to create an exterior shield that requires little to no refurbishment after each use. The crewless demo launch came after back-to-back tests in January and March ended just minutes after lift-off, raining wreckage into the ocean, before the most recent test in May ended when the spacecraft tumbling out of control and breaking apart.  That all came after the first Starship exploded minutes into its inaugural test flight in 2023. NASA has ordered two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade, while Mr Musk has ambitious plans to send humans to space in the next few years."

        "Content": "South Korea has passed a bill to ban the use of mobile phones and other digital devices in school classrooms nationwide, amid growing concerns about the effect of social media on young people.Â  The ban, approved on Wednesday and set to take effect in March next year, makes South Korea the latest country to impose restrictions on smartphone and social media use for minors. The country is among the world's most digitally connected nations, with 99% of South Koreans online and 98% owning a smartphone, according to the US-based Pew Research Centre. This is the highest rate among the 27 countries the centre examined in 2022 and 2023. The law enforcing the ban received backing from both sides of parliament in Wednesday's vote. \"Our youth's addiction to social media is at a serious level now,\" said Cho Jung-hun, a politician from the opposition People Power Party and a sponsor of the bill. \"Our kids, their eyes are red every morning.

        "Content": "A Banksy artwork, where a glass police box looks like a tank of piranhas, has been moved into protective storage ahead of its display at the London Museum's new location. The artwork made headlines last summer when it featured as part of the street artist's animal-themed collection in the capital, which concluded with a gorilla appearing to lift up a shutter on the entrance to London Zoo. The piranhas piece is now in the care of the London Museum and will be kept in secure storage before it becomes accessible to the public as part of a permanent display at the museum's Smithfield location, which is opening in 2026. The police box had stood in Ludgate Hill since the 1990s before it was painted to resemble a fish tank. The box was temporarily relocated by the City Of London Corporation to Guildhall Yard, where thousands of visitors viewed it from behind safety barriers, after Banksy confirmed he was responsible for the artwork. It was later moved to Guildhall's South Ambulatory. Banksy's London animals collection was made up of nine works including a rhino seemingly mounting a silver Nissan Micra, two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched out towards each other, and three monkeys that appeared as though they were swinging on a bridge. \n                  This woman won a case against her employer over her ADHD - and firms need to take note\n                 \n                  More than 280,000Â crimes went unrecorded last year, police watchdog finds\n                 \n                  British journalists demand action from PM over war in Gaza\n                 Some of the works, which also included a howling wolf on a satellite dish, were removed, covered up or vandalised, after being painted across the city from 5 to 13 August 2024.

        "Content": " Former Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan has called on men to \"demand\" a prostate cancer test and for the government to actively offer screenings, after his own stage-four diagnosis. Speaking to Anna Jones on Sky News, Murnaghan said he didn't have any of the usual prostate cancer symptoms - such as frequent or urgent urination or the occurrence of blood - but \"fell very ill on a foreign holiday\". Upon being treated by the NHS, he was diagnosed with stage-four cancer. Pointing to how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests are getting more accurate, Murnaghan said they should be offered in the same way as screenings for other cancers are. \"They might cost a little bit more money, but think about the money you save,\" he said. \"Treating people who get to my stage, there's an awful lot of things that are being thrown at me that are costing a lot of money. \"As in so many other cancers, if you are diagnosed much, much earlier, then of course you save money much further down the line.\" According to the NHS, symptoms will usually occur only once the cancer has grown or spread.  People may notice changes to the way they urinate, such as: â¢\tFinding it difficult to start urinating or straining to urinate â¢\tHaving a weak flow of urine â¢\t\"Stop start\" urinating â¢\tNeeding to urinate urgently or often, or both â¢\tFeeling like you still need to urinate when you've just finished â¢\tUrinating during the night Other symptoms can include: â¢\tErectile dysfunction (being unable to get or keep an erection) â¢\tBlood in your urine or blood in your semen â¢\tLower back pain and losing weight without trying to (these may be symptoms of advanced prostate cancer)\n He said he finished chemotherapy in early July and is currently waiting to see what the effect has been. It comes as a coalition of more than 60 cancer charities, known as One Cancer Voice, is warning the government must take urgent steps to tackle cancer care in England - including faster diagnosis targets and better prevention policies. According to analysis carried out by the charities, more than six million new cancer cases could be diagnosed in England between now and 2040. This would equate to a diagnosis every two minutes, which is up from one every four minutes in the 1970s.  Murnaghan said there is \"no formal screening programme\" for prostate cancer and men \"actually have to ask for it rather than be offered it as so often happens with other cancers\". In the absence of a screening programme, he said he would advise men of a certain age to \"go and demand it\". 'A real bolt from the blue' Speaking of how he put off screening, Murnaghan said: \"In my own case, I fell through those gaps. \"I foolishly sat in your [presenter Anna Jones] position for many many years speaking to people about this very issue and talking about men, particularly over the age of 50, men in high risk groups who may have a history of it in their family, to go and ask for this screening... \"And I kept thinking you know 'once I got over that age I will go and do that',\" he said. \"I kept thinking, 'okay well you know I'll get round to it', life intervenes, jobs, children, holidaysâ¦all kinds of things and I never didâ¦ \"So what happened was at the end of last year I fell very ill on a foreign holiday and kind of rushed back here to get treated by a wonderful health service and was diagnosed, a real bolt from the blue.\" Read more:England warned it faces six million new cancer cases by 2040 The former Sky News presenter is planning to join Sir Chris Hoy on a charity bike ride to raise money for cancer charities.

        "Content": "A portrait by an Italian master that was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War may have resurfaced for the first time in 80 years - after it was apparently spotted in a property listing. Argentinian police raided the villa in the coastal town of Mar del Plata, which is around 250 miles (410km) south of Buenos Aires, on Tuesday after they were alerted by Dutch journalists. The 17th-century oil-on-canvas, named Portrait of a Lady, was painted by Baroque artist Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi. The artwork had belonged to Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker before the Nazi takeover of his prominent Amsterdam gallery in May 1940. Reporters working for the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad - who have been carrying out a years-long investigation into high-ranking Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien and the Jewish artefacts he stole - reported how they saw the painting hanging in a room in a property listing on Monday. The home is believed to have been owned by the descendants of Kadgien. The listing was still live late on Tuesday, but the image of the apparent portrait, first seen in a 3D tour of the home's interior, appears to have been removed. Sky News has contacted the estate agents, Robles Casas & Campos, for comment. Federal prosecutor Carlos Martinez has said the painting was not found in the house when police raided, but officers seized \"other items that could be useful for the investigation, such as weapons, some engravings, prints and period reproductions\". He said investigators are examining possible charges of concealment and smuggling. The art of the steal The official Dutch database of missing Second World War art, maintained by the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency, identifies the painting as having originally belonged to Mr Goudstikker. Through outright looting or coercive sales, agents acting on behalf of the Nazis made off with countless artworks from private Dutch-Jewish dealers. Mr Goudstikker's paintings were sold illegally to Hermann Goering, known as Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, after his gallery was taken over by the Nazis. The Dutch database lists \"Portrait of a Lady\" as having later passed into the hands of a man named Kadgien from Berlin. A search of the German Federal Archives records the existence of only one Nazi party member with that surname - Friedrich Gustav Kadgien, who oversaw foreign currency, precious metals and the sale of confiscated property as a financial aide to Mr Goering. Following the German defeat in the Second World War, Mr Kadgien fled to Switzerland, then Argentina, according to a declassified report from the Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr Kadgien was never charged with crimes related to the Nazi regime during decades in Argentina. He died in 1978 in Buenos Aires, according to local media reports. Mr Goudstikker's sole surviving heir, his daughter-in-law Marei von Saher, has long pursued restitution for the art dealer's stolen works. In a landmark 2006 case, the Dutch government agreed to return 202 looted paintings from Mr Goudstikker's collection to Ms von Saher after a protracted legal battle. Argentina's dark past The investigation reopens a shadowy chapter in the history of Argentina, which sheltered scores of Nazis who fled Europe to avoid prosecution for war crimes after World War Two, including high-ranking party members and notorious architects of the Holocaust like Adolf Eichmann. Under the government of Argentine General Juan Peron, whose first tenure lasted from 1946 until his overthrow in 1955, fugitive German fascists brought plundered Jewish property with them from the other side of the world, including gold, bank deposits, paintings, sculptures and furnishings. The fate of those items continues to make news decades later as the process of restitution drags along in Argentina and beyond."

A solar-powered calculator, tree seeds in a bottle and a collection of each British coin up to the value of Â£1 to mark the 20th anniversary of decimalisation were also included in the 1991 collection. The items were chosen by children who suggested eight items representing life in the 1990s for a BBC Blue Peter competition. The then Princess of Wales, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997, buried the container at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London in March 1991. The capsule was dug up early as the construction of a new children's cancer centre begins. Staff at the hospital, either born in 1991 or already working at the hospital that year, helped to remove Diana's capsule. She became the president of GOSH in 1989 and regularly visited the specialist children's hospital. \n                  Kylie Minogue reveals major world tour news - her biggest in more than a decade\n                 \n                  Brit Awards 2024: The rise of Raye, Queen Kylie, and a red carpet giraffe: What everyone's talking about after the Brits\n                 \n                  Raye smashes Brits record for most wins in one year as Kylie Minogue closes show after taking global icon gong\n                 A few months after burying the capsule, Prince William, then eight years old, spent two nights at the hospital with his parents after suffering a fractured skull following a blow to the head from a golf club.
