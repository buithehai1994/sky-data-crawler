        "Content": " The US president has promised to target countries which charge tax on US imports by matching them with a reciprocal tariff. Donald Trump has ordered his team to start calculating duties by early April - increasing fears of a global trade war that could also accelerate US inflation. \"On trade, I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,\" he posted on Truth Social.  It is set to spark negotiations with dozens of countries aimed at lowering their tariffs and trade barriers. The US wants to shrink its goods trade deficit which topped $1.2trn (£954bn) last year. A White House official said that countries with large US trade surpluses could be targeted first. The top five are China, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland and Germany, according to the US Census Bureau. Business and economics correspondent Taken at face value Donald Trump's embrace of reciprocal tariffs is a declaration of total trade war. It would amount to perhaps the single biggest peacetime shock to global commerce. In promising to levy import taxes on any nation that imposes tariffs or VAT on US exports, he is following through on a campaign promise. The aim is to address a near trillion dollar trade deficit - the difference between the value of America's exports and its imports - that he believes amounts to a tax on American jobs. In response, he wants to deploy tariffs to simultaneously ease the US deficit and - in theory - price out imports in favour of domestic production. His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. It is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. Read more from Paul here. UK government minister Pat McFadden told Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge that Britain will take a \"wait and see\" approach when it comes to the tariffs. He refused to say if the government would retaliate. Trump latest: New tariffs signal 'total trade war' \n                  Risk of rising US prices could be biggest brake on Donald Trump's tariff plan\n                 \n                  Donald Trump calls for Russia to return to G7 - as European defence minister warns NATO of 'darkest times' since WW2  \n                 \n                  Ukraine has every reason to be worried after Trump's comments\n                 The UK could be hit with tariffs as high as 24% if Mr Trump follows through on his threats to treat VAT as a tariff, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Although some estimates are lower, he thinks Britain would be the fourth hardest hit, following India (29%), Brazil (28%) and the EU (25%). This is based on VAT rates combined with existing tariffs, but the Trump administration also intends to take into account regulations, government subsidies, digital services taxation policies and exchange rate policies. Read more from Sky News:Trump wants Russia to return to G7Ukraine peace talks risk short-term win \"Most people would consider VAT to be a non-discriminatory tax since it is also applied to domestically-produced goods making a level playing field,\" said Mr Ashworth. But the US still argues that VAT is a form of discriminatory tariff because America applies a much lower average sales tax at state level. On Thursday, Mr Trump also held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agreeing to join forces on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and strategic minerals. During a news conference afterwards, Mr Trump said India has been \"very strong on tariffs\" and \"it's very hard to sell into India\", adding: \"They're going to be purchasing a lot of our oil and gas.\" India's tariff rates are the highest, according to the World Trade Organisation, with a simple average 17% rate for all products compared to 3.3% for the US."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said he would love to have Russia return to the G7 group of advanced economies, and that expelling the country \"was a mistake\". Russia had been a member of the club of industrialised nations, then known as the G8, until it was excluded following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. \"I'd love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out. Look, it's not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia,\" the US president said at the White House. He also said that \"high-level people from Russia\" will attend the Munich Security Conference on Friday. \"Russia is going to be there with our people. Ukraine is also invited,\" the president added. Follow latest: Trump presidency updates During a series of fast-paced announcements, including a series of US trade tariffs, he also said he wants to discuss reducing defence spending with Russia and China, halve domestic defence expenditure and support moves towards getting rid of nuclear weapons. The US president had already announced on Wednesday that he and Vladimir Putin would start peace talks \"immediately\" to end the war in Ukraine. But much of Thursday's focus on global defence and spending came after a fractious NATO meeting in Brussels. It has been an intense 24 hours of diplomacy in Brussels, during which: • Ukraine's president said his country must have a place at the negotiating table. • The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitri Peskov said Ukraine would be involved in peace talks \"one way or another\". • Donald Trump's defence secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the US vow to focus its military might away from Europe - telling NATO allies: \"Trump won't allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker.\"  'Make NATO great again' Mr Hegseth told NATO allies that the US will not guarantee Europe's security and pressured leaders to spend more on their militaries. He told reporters \"we must make NATO great again\" as he called on allies to do \"far more for Europe's defence\". In terms of military spending, as a proportion of a country's GDP, the US defence secretary said: \"2% is a start... but it's not enough. Nor is 3%, nor is 4% - more like 5% - real investment, real urgency.\"  Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone, who was listening to Mr Hegseth's comments, said \"he represents one man, Donald Trump, and he speaks for him\". Stone points out that, whether people will like him or loathe him, he \"is not a man who has experience in the forum he now finds himself in\".

Dovile Sakaliene, Lithuania's defence minister, told reporters: \"China and Russia are going to coordinate their actions and if we are not able to work together as a team for the democratic world, it is going to be the darkest times since the Second World War. \"In a few years, we will be in a situation where Russia - with the speed that it's developing its defence industry and its army - is going to move forward.\" \"We all understand that Ukraine is just the first stage currently of an imperial expansion of Russia.\" She added that NATO partners have a stark choice - rebuild their armed forces and defence industries \"swiftly and very significantly\" or find themselves \"in a very difficult situation to put it diplomatically\". Senior politicians in Moscow crowed over the thawing of relations between Russia and the US after presidents Trump and Putin held a 90-minute phone call on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and current security official, mocked Europe's role on the world stage and said the continent is \"mad with jealousy and rage\" and that \"Europe's time is over\"."

A 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, Farhad N, has been arrested after officers fired a shot at the vehicle. Workers taking part in a union demonstration were walking along a street when the car overtook a police vehicle that was accompanying the group, according to officers in the German city. They said the car then sped up and ploughed into the back of the group, before police opened fire. Latest updates on Munich car crash  Bavaria state premier Markus Soeder said the incident was \"suspected to be an attack\". Some of the victims were seriously injured, and the motive was unclear. Officials believe the protest, by the service workers' union ver.di, was likely targeted at random, according to state interior minister Joachim Herrmann. He said the suspect was known to authorities in connection with theft and drug offences. The man's asylum application had been rejected, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan, said Mr Herrmann.

He must be punished and he must leave the country. \"The government will be starting flights back to Afghanistan despite the lack of diplomatic ties.\"  The incident is not suspected to be connected to the upcoming Munich Security Conference which starts on Friday around a mile away.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is exploring launching private criminal proceedings against NatWest Group over the debanking scandal which resulted in the lender's former chief losing her job. Sky News has learnt that Mr Farage has instructed Chris Daw KC of Lincoln House Chambers to examine whether there are grounds for bringing a criminal case against the high street banking giant. Politics latest: Follow live The move appears to be deliberately timed to coincide with the publication of NatWest's annual results on Friday morning, which will come just weeks before the government is expected to sell its last-remaining shares in the company, nearly 17 years after its £45.5bn taxpayer bailout. Mr Farage confirmed to Sky News on Thursday evening that Grosvenor Law, which is acting for him in separate civil proceedings against the bank, had instructed Mr Daw KC to explore a private criminal prosecution, adding: \"This is unfinished business.\" Dan Morrison, a partner at Grosvenor Law, said in a separate statement: \"Mr Farage is concerned about possible criminal issues arising out of the bank's conduct. \"We do not wish to provide further details. \"We have therefore decided to instruct leading criminal counsel.\" The debanking furore which claimed the scalp of Dame Alison Rose, NatWest's former chief executive, in the summer of 2023 centred on whether the bank's Coutts subsidiary decided to close Mr Farage's accounts for commercial or political reasons. NatWest initially claimed the motivation was commercial before Mr Farage obtained internal evidence from the bank suggesting that his politics had been a pivotal factor in the decision. It sparked a firestorm under the then Conservative government, with Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, the then prime minister and chancellor respectively, indicating to NatWest's board that they had lost faith in Dame Alison's ability to lead the bank. Since then, the City watchdog has instructed banks and other financial firms to do more to ensure that parliamentarians, senior public servants and their families - known as politically exposed persons, or PEPs - are not treated unfairly. Read more from Sky News:PM backs chancellor despite new claimsIn The Style is out of time as administration looms Mr Farage's decision to hire Mr Daw KC threatens a fresh escalation against one of Britain's biggest banks at a time when some argue that he has become the country's most influential politician. He led Reform to a handful of seats at last year's general election, while his party finished in second place in scores of other constituencies. The Reform leader's close ties to Donald Trump, inaugurated last month for the second time as US President, have fuelled the sense that he may play an even more crucial role in shaping the identity of Britain's next government when the country goes to the polls in 2029.  A recent opinion poll for Sky News by YouGov put Reform ahead of both Labour and the Tories for the first time. Since the summer of 2023, tentative discussions between Mr Farage's legal representatives and NatWest about a possible settlement have failed to result in any financial agreement. Mr Farage was expected to seek millions of pounds from the company, alleging that the debanking row had damaged his reputation. Despite the threat of a fresh legal barrage from Mr Farage, NatWest - now run by Paul Thwaite - is in its most robust financial health for decades. The government's stake in the bank is now below 8%, and a full exit is expected during the spring. A NatWest spokesperson said it did not comment on individual customers."

Michael Steele, who is now in his 80s, was jailed for life in 1998, alongside Jack Whomes, for the murders of Patrick Tate, 37, Tony Tucker, 38, and Craig Rolfe, 26. They were shot dead at point-blank range in a Range Rover on an isolated farm track at Rettendon, Essex, in December 1995 in what prosecutors said was a row over a drug deal. The gangland executions, also known as the Rettendon Murders or the Range Rover Murders, inspired the 2000 film Essex Boys, starring Sean Bean, as well as The Rise Of The Footsoldier franchise. All three of the victims were known to police. Mr Tucker ran security for Raquels, the nightclub where Leah Betts had taken the ecstasy tablet that led to her death less than a month before the murders. Steele and Whomes maintained their innocence following their convictions, which were based in part on the evidence of \"supergrass\" Darren Nicholls, who said he had been the getaway driver. Their appeals were rejected and in 2006 Lord Justice Kay said there was no \"element of unsafety\" over the original convictions. The case has also been reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) and a decision was made in January 2023 not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal.

Una Crown, a retired postmistress, was found dead at her home in the Wisbech area of Cambridgeshire on 13 January 2013. She had sustained stab wounds to her chest, her throat was cut and her clothes set on fire. Initially, her death was not considered suspicious by police, which prosecutor John Price described as a \"grave error of judgement\". David Newton, 70, was charged with Mrs Crown's murder last year but he denied the offence. On Thursday at Cambridge Crown Court, he appeared open-mouthed as the foreman returned the jury's guilty verdict.

He had driven to her address to collect her for Sunday lunch at their house. Prosecuting, Mr Price told the jury that Mrs Crown was killed the day before and that male DNA matching David Newton's profile was discovered by scientists in 2023. The prosecution said the reason why Newton went to Mrs Crown's home and killed her were \"not matters that the prosecution need prove\". But the trial heard the defendant was on state benefits in 2013 - his only source of regular income - and that he was \"spending freely\" on 13 January.

Newton is due to be sentenced at the same court on February 14."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is exploring launching private criminal proceedings against NatWest Group over the debanking scandal which resulted in the lender's former chief losing her job. Sky News has learnt that Mr Farage has instructed Chris Daw KC of Lincoln House Chambers to examine whether there are grounds for bringing a criminal case against the high street banking giant. Politics latest: Follow live The move appears to be deliberately timed to coincide with the publication of NatWest's annual results on Friday morning, which will come just weeks before the government is expected to sell its last-remaining shares in the company, nearly 17 years after its £45.5bn taxpayer bailout. Mr Farage confirmed to Sky News on Thursday evening that Grosvenor Law, which is acting for him in separate civil proceedings against the bank, had instructed Mr Daw KC to explore a private criminal prosecution, adding: \"This is unfinished business.\" Dan Morrison, a partner at Grosvenor Law, said in a separate statement: \"Mr Farage is concerned about possible criminal issues arising out of the bank's conduct. \"We do not wish to provide further details. \"We have therefore decided to instruct leading criminal counsel.\" The debanking furore which claimed the scalp of Dame Alison Rose, NatWest's former chief executive, in the summer of 2023 centred on whether the bank's Coutts subsidiary decided to close Mr Farage's accounts for commercial or political reasons. NatWest initially claimed the motivation was commercial before Mr Farage obtained internal evidence from the bank suggesting that his politics had been a pivotal factor in the decision. It sparked a firestorm under the then Conservative government, with Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, the then prime minister and chancellor respectively, indicating to NatWest's board that they had lost faith in Dame Alison's ability to lead the bank. Since then, the City watchdog has instructed banks and other financial firms to do more to ensure that parliamentarians, senior public servants and their families - known as politically exposed persons, or PEPs - are not treated unfairly. Read more from Sky News:PM backs chancellor despite new claimsIn The Style is out of time as administration looms Mr Farage's decision to hire Mr Daw KC threatens a fresh escalation against one of Britain's biggest banks at a time when some argue that he has become the country's most influential politician. He led Reform to a handful of seats at last year's general election, while his party finished in second place in scores of other constituencies. The Reform leader's close ties to Donald Trump, inaugurated last month for the second time as US President, have fuelled the sense that he may play an even more crucial role in shaping the identity of Britain's next government when the country goes to the polls in 2029.  A recent opinion poll for Sky News by YouGov put Reform ahead of both Labour and the Tories for the first time. Since the summer of 2023, tentative discussions between Mr Farage's legal representatives and NatWest about a possible settlement have failed to result in any financial agreement. Mr Farage was expected to seek millions of pounds from the company, alleging that the debanking row had damaged his reputation. Despite the threat of a fresh legal barrage from Mr Farage, NatWest - now run by Paul Thwaite - is in its most robust financial health for decades. The government's stake in the bank is now below 8%, and a full exit is expected during the spring. A NatWest spokesperson said it did not comment on individual customers."

        "Content": "One of the men convicted of the notorious \"Essex Boys\" murders will be released from prison on licence after 27 years. Michael Steele, who is now in his 80s, was jailed for life in 1998, alongside Jack Whomes, for the murders of Patrick Tate, 37, Tony Tucker, 38, and Craig Rolfe, 26. They were shot dead at point-blank range in a Range Rover on an isolated farm track at Rettendon, Essex, in December 1995 in what prosecutors said was a row over a drug deal. The gangland executions, also known as the Rettendon Murders or the Range Rover Murders, inspired the 2000 film Essex Boys, starring Sean Bean, as well as The Rise Of The Footsoldier franchise. All three of the victims were known to police. Mr Tucker ran security for Raquels, the nightclub where Leah Betts had taken the ecstasy tablet that led to her death less than a month before the murders. Steele and Whomes maintained their innocence following their convictions, which were based in part on the evidence of \"supergrass\" Darren Nicholls, who said he had been the getaway driver. Their appeals were rejected and in 2006 Lord Justice Kay said there was no \"element of unsafety\" over the original convictions. The case has also been reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) and a decision was made in January 2023 not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal.

After hearing evidence, it said there had been a \"marked improvement\" in his behaviour while in prison and keeping him locked up was no longer necessary to protect the public.

        "Content": "NHS dentists are \"very weak\" and \"not fit for purpose\", England's chief medical officer has warned. Professor Sir Chris Whitty has told MPs that a lack of NHS dentistry access for children will set them up for \"lifelong poor dental health\". Speaking at the Public Accounts Committee in Parliament, Sir Chris said: \"The NHS dental system is very weak and has got weaker over time. \"I think we would all say this is a problem, particularly for those who find it difficult to get dental services when they need them in states of emergency. \"So I think everyone should agree that the NHS dentistry is in a much weaker state than most other areas of the NHS.\" Sir Chris added: \"The last time I think most people in the country would consider that NHS dentistry was operating as they would anticipate it should do was probably in the early 1990s and the changes since then have all tended to either do nothing or make things worse.\" Sir Chris, who is also the interim permanent secretary at the Department for Health and Social Care, stressed that early prevention \"is absolutely critical\". However, he added the \"very sad reality\" was the opposite. The professor also warned that a \"common procedure\" among children in hospital is the \"destruction of teeth\" due to tooth decay - which sets them up \"for lifelong poor dental health\". Data shows as many as six in 10 children have rotting teeth by the age of five - with stark differences between the poorer regions of England, and the more affluent. For example, the number of five-year-olds with poor dental hygiene was on the rise in London, the North East and the South West. Sir Chris, and other NHS leaders, criticised the NHS 'recovery plan' put in place by the previous Conservative government for failing to deliver new dentists or more appointments.

It promised to introduce 1.5 million new treatments for patients. But when asked if the plan was on track, Sir Chris said: \"The very short answer is no.\" The committee also heard that while the number of dentists has risen, the number providing discounted NHS care has decreased."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n This might seem like history repeating itself at the Home of Cricket. A big announcement of a windfall to revitalise the sport in England. It was 17 years ago that Allen Stanford landed at Lord's on a helicopter accompanied by a treasure chest of dollar bills. They turned out to be fake and the tycoon was exposed as a fraudster and jailed. The American was promising lucrative Twenty20 competitions - the shorter format designed to attract new audiences. But India created a more dynamic and lucrative competition from the English invention. So the England and Wales Cricket Board tried again with even shorter matches - each team simply batting for 100 balls. And four years after the launch of The Hundred, the eight teams have been valued at £975m after an ECB auction. Not bad for a competition only played for one month every year. And the array of tech investors and Indian Premier League owners buying into The Hundred don't even own the venues. Lifeblood of domestic cricket These are the grounds home to counties that have been the lifeblood of domestic cricket since 1890. But this is now the era of franchise cricket where owners are building a network of clubs that could see the best players sent around the world to star in shorter competitions. It is a revolution resisted by some traditionalists seeing the erosion of longer forms of the sport, up to five-day international tests. But this is all about trying to attract new, younger audiences - and lure them from the most popular sport. 'More accessible and more fun' \"Over the last five to 10 years, cricket has grown and the variety of formats that we've got just makes it more accessible, more fun and creates more positive noise,\" ECB chief executive Richard Gould told Sky News. \"I think it's time for us to muscle in on football. And I think that's one of our ambitions. \"When you look at the share of either broadcast revenue or attendees, we want to increase our market share. So certainly we've got football in our in our sights.\" Football investors banking on cricket success Football wants a part too, banking on a boom. Chelsea's American co-owner Todd Boehly is part of the group paying £40m for 49% of the Trent Rockets. The same deal was secured for Birmingham Phoenix by the Birmingham FC ownership, Knighthead Capital Management, which features NFL legend Tom Brady. Four of the investors also own teams in the Indian Premier League T20 competition including India's richest family the Ambani's who are paying £60m for 49% of the Oval Invincibles. And Silicon Valley wants in with the CEOs of Google and Microsoft among a consortium of tech billionaires paying the most for a team - £145m for almost half of the London Spirit. It's a premium to play at Lord's, the most iconic of venues. Can The Hundred replicate 'exciting' IPL franchise? Nikesh Arora, chief executive of cyber security firm Palo Alto, told Sky Sports: \"IPL has turned out into an amazing franchise because at the end you've got to the heartstrings of people and you built a product that they're really excited about. \"And the question is, can we replicate that collectively in the UK? Because that's the home of cricket. \"This is the current sort of genre of cricket which is popular, so we like that idea. We like the idea that this is in a country where there's a natural demand for cricket and aspiration for cricket.\" Read more on Sky News:Children among injured in Munich 'suspected attack'Warnings NHS dentists 'very weak'Ryanair scrapping some European routes And this time the ECB insists there has been full due diligence of the investors - seeing the franchises' sell-off as a golden opportunity to safeguard the future of cricket. The windfall will be split between the 18 county teams and the Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns Lord's and is seen as the guardians of the laws of the sport. Grassroots to benefit There's also set to be £50m for the grassroots game. But will the jackpot be justified when The Hundred's men's and women's teams only play a month a year? And if it does boom - will the price be international tests and the domestic country competitions fading? \"It is certainly a really important opportunity for us in history, I think will judge how important it ranks,\" Mr Gould said. \"But we know that we've got a lot of hard work ahead of us, a lot of exciting work. \"We've got eight new investors coming into the gate and we want to make sure that we can match and exceed their own ambitions.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The UK government is facing increasing pressure to call on China to release jailed pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai as it seeks closer trading ties with Beijing. Media tycoon Mr Lai is currently on trial in Hong Kong facing charges under the city's national security law, imposed by Beijing in 2020 in response to mass pro-democracy protests. Mr Lai's imprisonment and trial have become a sticking point for the British government in their dealings with China. Chinese foreign secretary Wang Yi met Mr Lammy, and Sir Keir Starmer briefly, in London on Thursday, and pressure was on the UK foreign secretary to raise Mr Lai's situation and call for his release. Why is Jimmy Lai a British issue? The 77-year-old has lived in Hong Kong since he was 12 years old, after stowing away on a fishing boat from China and working as a child labourer in a garment factory. He built up fashion empire Giordano and after becoming a democracy advocate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, he set up a magazine in Hong Kong. \n                  'Big opportunity' for Chinese electric carmakers in the UK, newest entrant XPENG tells Sky News\n                 \n                  In China's Silicon Valley, where founder of DeepSeek Liang Wenfeng keeps a low profile\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 Ahead of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China, he started Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily in an attempt to maintain freedom of speech. Around the same time, in 1994, he became a full British citizen. He has never held a Chinese or Hong Kong passport but because he was born in mainland China, Hong Kong authorities deem him to be a Chinese citizen. Mr Lai has homes all over the world, including in London, Paris, Taipei and Kyoto. But his sole passport is British.  Why is he in jail? During the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Lai's Apple Daily adopted the position of the protesters, criticising the government. In June 2021, Apple Daily was raided by the police, who seized documents, froze its accounts and arrested its executives, leading to its closure. Mr Lai was arrested and charged under the newly introduced national security law with collusion with foreign forces, as well as sedition under colonial-era laws.

The media tycoon has been found guilty of various other charges, including attending a Tiananmen vigil, which has meant he has been in a high-security jail since December 2020. What about his trial? In December 2023, Mr Lai's national security law trial, where he faces charges of collusion with foreign forces and conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications, started after years of delay. After seven months, the court refused to dismiss the charges and adjourned the trial before Mr Lai could testify. He was kept in solitary confinement and the trial resumed in November last year, when he first took to the stand. The media tycoon has now testified for more than 40 days, facing questioning about his editorial control over Apple Daily, links to activists in Hong Kong, the UK and US and meetings with US politicians. In December, he told the trial he believed the UK had a \"moral responsibility\" to lead international support of Hong Kong, but denied requesting the UK government engaged in hostile activities against China and Hong Kong. What has the British government done? Boris Johnson  When Mr Lai was charged under the national security law in 2020, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the UK was \"deeply concerned\". This prompted the Chinese embassy in London to express \"grave concern\" about the \"irresponsible remarks\" which they said were an \"act of interference\". However, any pressure from the government appeared to drop after that for a few years.  A lack of engagement A handful of \"China hawks\" in parliament, including former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Tory foreign affairs committee chair Alicia Kearns, Lord Alton and Labour MP Catherine West, have consistently raised Mr Lai's case in parliament. Mr Lai's son, Sebastien, and his father's international legal team called several times for a meeting with Liz Truss and James Cleverly when they were foreign secretaries but that never happened, although they did meet with a foreign minister. James Cleverly Rhetoric then ratcheted up, with Mr Cleverly raising Mr Lai's case directly with Chinese vice president Han Zheng as well as at the \"highest levels with the Hong Kong authorities\". Mr Cleverly accused Hong Kong in May 2023 of \"deliberately targeting prominent pro-democracy figures, journalists and politicians in an effort to silence and discredit them\", adding: \"Detained British dual national Jimmy Lai is one such figure.\" Lord Cameron and Rishi Sunak Lord Cameron, as foreign secretary, called for Mr Lai's charges to be dropped at the end of 2023, and for his immediate release. In a January 2024 letter to the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, Rishi Sunak called Mr Lai's trial \"politically motivated\" and vowed to keep raising the case with Beijing as a priority. However, Mr Sunak dodged questions about whether he had personally raised his case with the Chinese government. Starmer government With a change of government, Mr Lai's family and supporters hoped there would be a more concerted effort. Three months after winning the general election, Sir Keir said securing the release of Mr Lai was a \"priority\" for his government and said it would \"continue\" to raise the case with China. Sebastien Lai welcomed his words but asked the PM to \"put word to action to save my father's life and bring him home\". Ahead of his first trip to China as foreign secretary in October, Mr Lammy was urged by MPs sanctioned by Beijing to raise the case of political prisoners in Hong Kong, including Mr Lai. The Foreign Office said he pressed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Mr Lai's detention, and Mr Lammy said he \"was able to have dialogue with the Chinese on areas where we disagree, areas like Hong Kong\". Mr Lammy then joined Chancellor Rachel Reeves on a trip to revive economic ties after \"years of tension\". She said she raised Mr Lai's imprisonment with every minister she met in China. During the latest meeting of Mr Lammy and Mr Yi, Number 10 said Sir Keir also met him briefly and told him he wants \"consistent and respectful relations\" and to deepen trade relations with China. It did not say if he brought up Mr Lai, but the foreign secretary said ahead of the meeting: \"We will also discuss issues where the UK and China do not always see eye to eye. In some cases, the UK does have significant concerns.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Sir Keir Starmer says he has full confidence in Rachel Reeves after questions were raised about inaccuracies in her CV and her use of expenses in a previous job. The chancellor has been accused by former employees of being involved in an \"expenses scandal\" while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) from 2006 to 2009, according to the BBC. She has also been accused of saying she worked for the Bank of England for longer than she did. Politics latest: PM ditches visit after tractors bypass gates Downing Street said the PM believes he can trust the chancellor. Ms Reeves' spokesperson said she was \"not aware of an investigation, nor was she interviewed\". Her lawyer has denied the allegations. Jayne Wayper, former HR business partner for HBOS, said: \"I do not recognise any of the accusations or claims that have been made against Rachel Reeves.\" One ex-colleague told the BBC she nearly got sacked after an investigation into three senior managers accused of \"signing off each other's expenses\". This included spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. A whistleblower said there was also concern about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. In a Facebook group of former HBOS employees seen by the BBC, several people referred to Ms Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending. Sir Keir's official spokesman said it was \"correct\" the prime minister has \"no concerns whatsoever\" about the chancellor's conduct and has confidence in her. He also said: \"I can't speak to her time prior to government. \"The PM works hand in hand and has full faith in the chancellor.\" Sir Keir later said she has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from questions about her career before becoming an MP. Ms Weyper, former HBOS' HR, said there was an \"extensive oversight\" of all expense policies, receipts were signed off by line managers and in her role she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded\". \"I cannot speak for the motivations behind those who have been making these claims about Rachel Reeves. However, I do not recognise them and understand she left the bank on good terms,\" she added. Reeves was 'not aware of an investigation' A spokesperson for Ms Reeves said: \"Rachel is proud of the work she did at HBOS and the teams that she led, it is 16 years since she left the bank and the first time she was made aware of these claims was when approached by journalists. \"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way. \"Several former colleagues from her time at the bank, including HBOS' former HR business partner, have corroborated this account. \"Rachel left HBOS in 2009 on good terms.\" Ms Reeves's lawyer while she was leaving HBOS said she left HBOS with a \"standard-style agreement\" after a \"mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\". David Sorensen, a managing partner at Morrish Solicitors, added: \"My clear understanding at the time was that my client, who was in a senior role, left on good terms when HBOS plc was acquired in 2009, as evidenced by the payments made to her, the retention of her company car and other benefits for a six-month period, and a favourable reference. \"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process.\" Read more:Judge 'wrong' to let Gaza family settle in UK under Ukraine scheme, PM saysTreasury launches inquiry into leak of growth forecasts  LinkedIn dates questioned Questions have also been raised about Ms Reeves' online CV, as her LinkedIn profile said she stayed at the Bank of England nine months longer than she actually did, the BBC has reported. She has publicly said she spent a decade there, but her LinkedIn profile claimed she worked at the bank from September 2000 to December 2006. However, she is understood to have left by March 2006, when she started working at HBOS. That means she spent five and a half years at the bank, including nearly a year studying. Ms Reeves' spokesman, in a comment given to the BBC, said the dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by her team. They said the chancellor had not seen it before it was published. The chancellor's LinkedIn profile has now been updated to reflect she left the bank in March 2006. Ms Reeves has repeatedly said she spent 10 years at the Bank of England, citing her time as an economist there as why she can be trusted with the UK's finances."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Taken at face value Donald Trump's embrace of reciprocal tariffs is a declaration of total trade war, that would amount to perhaps the single biggest peacetime shock to global commerce. In promising to levy import taxes on any nation that imposes tariffs or VAT on US exports, he is following through on a campaign promise to address a near trillion dollar trade deficit - the difference between the value of America's exports and its imports - that he believes amounts to a tax on American jobs. In response, he wants to deploy tariffs as an \"external revenue service\", simultaneously easing the US deficit and, so the theory goes, pricing out imports in favour of domestic production. Follow latest: Trump's trading tariffs With a promise to reestablish industries, from chip production lost to Taiwan, and car and pharmaceutical manufacturing to Europe, he is promising a country-by-country tailored assault on the status quo.  Risk to Britain remains uncertain His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. Mexico and Canada, the European Union (whose 10% tariff on US cars is a particular irritation), as well as the 'BRICS' nations - Brazil, Russia, India (which imposes 9% tariffs on US imports), China and South Africa. What it means for the UK will not be certain until the details are revealed in April, but it is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. To begin with, the US runs a trade surplus with the UK - in a quirk of statistics, the UK thinks it has a surplus too - and Brexit has placed it outside the EU bloc with the ability at least in theory to be more agile. The UK also imposes direct tariffs on very few US goods following a deal in 2021, brokered by then trade secretary Liz Truss, that removed tariffs on denim and motorcycles bound for Britain, and cashmere and Scotch whisky heading the other way. But we do add VAT to imports, and Mr Trump's threat to treat the sales tax as a tariff by another name will chill British exporters. Read more from Sky News:Trump wants Russia to return to G7Fears Ukraine has been 'betrayed'Farage explores NatWest legal action Tariffs set to raise prices in US Analysts have estimated tariffs could add 21% to the cost of exports, amounting to a £24bn blow to national income. Pharmaceuticals, cars, chemicals, scientific instruments and the aerospace industry - the main components of our £182bn US export trade - will all be potentially affected. But the pain will certainly be shared. Tariffs are paid by the importer, not the exporter, and even Mr Trump accepts they will be inflationary. Rising prices on Main Street could yet be the biggest brake on the president's tariff plan."

On Thursday, Mr Trump also held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agreeing to join forces on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and strategic minerals. During a news conference afterwards, Mr Trump said India has been \"very strong on tariffs\" and \"it's very hard to sell into India\", adding: \"They're going to be purchasing a lot of our oil and gas.\" India's tariff rates are the highest, according to the World Trade Organisation, with a simple average 17% rate for all products compared to 3.3% for the US."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  You should always give peace a chance. That US President Donald Trump \"thinks out of the box\" is already the cliche of the moment. And he may bring a fresh way of thinking and a new energy to ending Russia's war in Ukraine where others have failed. But there are some ominous signs already, bolstering fears Ukraine has been betrayed before the talks have even started. Mr Trump could not bring himself on Wednesday even to say Ukraine and Russia were equal partners in any future negotiations. Follow updates: Ukraine war latest Asked if they were, he said: \"Hmm, that's an interesting question.\" The Ukrainians, he said, \"will have to make peace\". \"Their people are being killed, and I think they should make peace,\" he added. More worryingly, he seems as prepared as ever to trust Vladimir Putin. He seems happy to take the word of a man who sent agents to Britain to kill with chemical weapons, who lied repeatedly about his plans to invade Ukraine, and who has murdered in cold blood every rival who dared to challenge him. \"He insisted that if it (the conflict) ends, he wants it to end,\" Mr Trump said, as if that was all there is to it. \"He does not want to end it and then go back to war in six months.\" In the same way, Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich in 1938 waving a piece of paper declaring \"peace in our time\" after winning what he thought were similar assurances from Adolf Hitler. For Ukrainians, the parallels with 1938 do not end there.  They are being told even before negotiations start that they will have to give up some of their land that has been taken by brutal force. Ukrainians compare that with Czechoslovakia being forced to hand over the Sudetenland to Hitler. Chamberlain believed that would be enough to appease Hitler. We all know what followed. They have every reason to be worried. Read more from Sky News:Sky's correspondents give views on Trump's call with PutinHamas says it will release Israeli hostages as planned There is nothing in what the Russian president has said to make anyone believe giving him a fifth of Ukraine will be enough to appease him either. In fact, in speeches, he has been emphatically and explicitly clear time and time again. He wants all of Ukraine because he believes it is part of Russia. And then he wants the security architecture of Europe refashioned. And Mr Trump seems to be caving into Mr Putin on that as well, giving into one of the key pre-war demands he made in 2021 before invading his neighbour, the reduction of America's footprint in NATO in Europe that was declared by US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth in Brussels yesterday. Trump is surrendering much of the leverage he had over the Russians before talks have even begun. This is from a man who declared in his book The Art of the Deal that leverage is everything in negotiations. \"Don't make deals without it.\"  It is curious and inexplicable. Except that Mr Putin has always appeared to have some kind of hold over Mr Trump. When they last met in Helsinki, the president sided with Mr Putin over his own spies on the question of Russian election interference. As a spy in east Germany, Mr Putin was trained in KGB techniques of understanding your enemy and deceiving them. He has used those skills all his career, not least with George W Bush who famously naively said: \"I looked into his eyes and I saw a soul. I trusted him.\" If Mr Trump is persuaded to side with Mr Putin over Ukraine, a dictator will have been rewarded for invading his neighbour. Aggression will have prevailed. A precedent will have been set that has alarming implications for other countries neighbouring Russia and further afield. In the east, as he ponders how to seize Taiwan by force, China's Xi Jinping will be learning lessons too. The outcome of all this may well not be peace in our time. Quite the opposite."

        "Content": " At least 30 people have been injured, including children, after a car was driven into a crowd in a \"suspected attack\" in Munich, authorities said. A 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, Farhad N, has been arrested after officers fired a shot at the vehicle. Workers taking part in a union demonstration were walking along a street when the car overtook a police vehicle that was accompanying the group, according to officers in the German city. They said the car then sped up and ploughed into the back of the group, before police opened fire. Latest updates on Munich car crash  Bavaria state premier Markus Soeder said the incident was \"suspected to be an attack\". Some of the victims were seriously injured, and the motive was unclear. Officials believe the protest, by the service workers' union ver.di, was likely targeted at random, according to state interior minister Joachim Herrmann. He said the suspect was known to authorities in connection with theft and drug offences. The man's asylum application had been rejected, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan, said Mr Herrmann.

She said: \"There is a person lying on the street and a young man was taken away by the police. People were sitting on the ground, crying and shaking.\" A 'terrible attack' The incident happened at a square near downtown Munich, close to the city's central train station at around 10.30am (9.30am UK time), police said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the events \"horrible\" and a \"terrible attack\", saying \"an Afghan perpetrator has severely injured people, and that is not something that we can tolerate or accept\". \"This perpetrator cannot hope for any leniency. He must be punished and he must leave the country. \"The government will be starting flights back to Afghanistan despite the lack of diplomatic ties.\"  The incident is not suspected to be connected to the upcoming Munich Security Conference which starts on Friday around a mile away. Security has been in sharp focus in Germany following a spate of attacks involving migrants in recent months and ahead of a federal election later in February.

The killings followed knife attacks in Mannheim and in Solingen last year in which the suspects were migrants from Afghanistan and Syria, respectively - in the latter case, also a rejected asylum seeker who was supposed to have left the country. A Saudi doctor known to authorities was the suspect in December when a car rammed people at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing six."

        "Content": " At least 28 people are injured after a car drove into a crowd in Munich, police have said. The incident took place at a square near downtown Munich, close to the city's central train station at around 10.30am (9.30am UK time), officials said. Munich latest: Car ramming was 'suspected attack' Here is everything we know: What happened?  The car was driven into the crowd on a street called Seidlstrasse in the central area of the city. The crowd was taking part in a demonstration organised by a trade union, and a police car was following them as they walked, deputy police chief Christian Huber said. \"Then a vehicle approached it from behind,\" he added. \"It approached the police car to overtake it, and then accelerated and drove into the back of the demonstration.\" A badly damaged cream-coloured Mini could be seen after the attack along with debris including shoes. Bavarian governor Markus Soeder said it was \"probably an attack\". A man was arrested at the scene and police said a shot was fired as the arrest was made, but have not added any further details. What we know about the victims Children were among those hurt, Munich mayor Dieter Reiter said, and local police said at least two people are \"very seriously injured\". The premier of Bavaria - the region where Munich is located - said a total of at least 28 people were injured and said some were critically hurt. Posting on social media, Munich police added: \"Caring for the injured is currently the top priority.\" Who is the suspect - and do we know the motive? Police say the man arrested was a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker. They added he is being held and does not pose any further threat. The motives have not been confirmed by officials yet. Attention has been drawn to the fact the incident happened about 1.5km away from where the Munich Security Conference is set to take place on the weekend, with international figures such as US vice president JD Vance already arriving for it. But police have said the incident is not thought to be related to the conference. Incident comes amid immigration tensions Security has been in sharp focus in Germany ahead of a federal election next week and following a string of violent attacks. Immigration has been a major talking point, with far-right party AfD doing well in polls. German chancellor Olaf Scholz described the incident as a \"terrible attack\" and said the perpetrator \"must be punished and he must leave the country\".

He added: \"We have already organized such a flight with criminals... we are also in the process of doing this in other cases. And not just once, but on an ongoing basis. \"This perpetrator cannot count on any leniency, he must be punished and he must leave the country.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The UK government is facing increasing pressure to call on China to release jailed pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai as it seeks closer trading ties with Beijing. Media tycoon Mr Lai is currently on trial in Hong Kong facing charges under the city's national security law, imposed by Beijing in 2020 in response to mass pro-democracy protests. Mr Lai's imprisonment and trial have become a sticking point for the British government in their dealings with China. Chinese foreign secretary Wang Yi met Mr Lammy, and Sir Keir Starmer briefly, in London on Thursday, and pressure was on the UK foreign secretary to raise Mr Lai's situation and call for his release. Why is Jimmy Lai a British issue? The 77-year-old has lived in Hong Kong since he was 12 years old, after stowing away on a fishing boat from China and working as a child labourer in a garment factory. He built up fashion empire Giordano and after becoming a democracy advocate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, he set up a magazine in Hong Kong. \n                  'Big opportunity' for Chinese electric carmakers in the UK, newest entrant XPENG tells Sky News\n                 \n                  In China's Silicon Valley, where founder of DeepSeek Liang Wenfeng keeps a low profile\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 Ahead of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China, he started Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily in an attempt to maintain freedom of speech. Around the same time, in 1994, he became a full British citizen. He has never held a Chinese or Hong Kong passport but because he was born in mainland China, Hong Kong authorities deem him to be a Chinese citizen. Mr Lai has homes all over the world, including in London, Paris, Taipei and Kyoto. But his sole passport is British.  Why is he in jail? During the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Lai's Apple Daily adopted the position of the protesters, criticising the government. In June 2021, Apple Daily was raided by the police, who seized documents, froze its accounts and arrested its executives, leading to its closure. Mr Lai was arrested and charged under the newly introduced national security law with collusion with foreign forces, as well as sedition under colonial-era laws.

The media tycoon has been found guilty of various other charges, including attending a Tiananmen vigil, which has meant he has been in a high-security jail since December 2020. What about his trial? In December 2023, Mr Lai's national security law trial, where he faces charges of collusion with foreign forces and conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications, started after years of delay. After seven months, the court refused to dismiss the charges and adjourned the trial before Mr Lai could testify. He was kept in solitary confinement and the trial resumed in November last year, when he first took to the stand. The media tycoon has now testified for more than 40 days, facing questioning about his editorial control over Apple Daily, links to activists in Hong Kong, the UK and US and meetings with US politicians. In December, he told the trial he believed the UK had a \"moral responsibility\" to lead international support of Hong Kong, but denied requesting the UK government engaged in hostile activities against China and Hong Kong. What has the British government done? Boris Johnson  When Mr Lai was charged under the national security law in 2020, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the UK was \"deeply concerned\". This prompted the Chinese embassy in London to express \"grave concern\" about the \"irresponsible remarks\" which they said were an \"act of interference\". However, any pressure from the government appeared to drop after that for a few years.  A lack of engagement A handful of \"China hawks\" in parliament, including former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Tory foreign affairs committee chair Alicia Kearns, Lord Alton and Labour MP Catherine West, have consistently raised Mr Lai's case in parliament. Mr Lai's son, Sebastien, and his father's international legal team called several times for a meeting with Liz Truss and James Cleverly when they were foreign secretaries but that never happened, although they did meet with a foreign minister. James Cleverly Rhetoric then ratcheted up, with Mr Cleverly raising Mr Lai's case directly with Chinese vice president Han Zheng as well as at the \"highest levels with the Hong Kong authorities\". Mr Cleverly accused Hong Kong in May 2023 of \"deliberately targeting prominent pro-democracy figures, journalists and politicians in an effort to silence and discredit them\", adding: \"Detained British dual national Jimmy Lai is one such figure.\" Lord Cameron and Rishi Sunak Lord Cameron, as foreign secretary, called for Mr Lai's charges to be dropped at the end of 2023, and for his immediate release. In a January 2024 letter to the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, Rishi Sunak called Mr Lai's trial \"politically motivated\" and vowed to keep raising the case with Beijing as a priority. However, Mr Sunak dodged questions about whether he had personally raised his case with the Chinese government. Starmer government With a change of government, Mr Lai's family and supporters hoped there would be a more concerted effort. Three months after winning the general election, Sir Keir said securing the release of Mr Lai was a \"priority\" for his government and said it would \"continue\" to raise the case with China. Sebastien Lai welcomed his words but asked the PM to \"put word to action to save my father's life and bring him home\". Ahead of his first trip to China as foreign secretary in October, Mr Lammy was urged by MPs sanctioned by Beijing to raise the case of political prisoners in Hong Kong, including Mr Lai. The Foreign Office said he pressed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Mr Lai's detention, and Mr Lammy said he \"was able to have dialogue with the Chinese on areas where we disagree, areas like Hong Kong\". Mr Lammy then joined Chancellor Rachel Reeves on a trip to revive economic ties after \"years of tension\". She said she raised Mr Lai's imprisonment with every minister she met in China. During the latest meeting of Mr Lammy and Mr Yi, Number 10 said Sir Keir also met him briefly and told him he wants \"consistent and respectful relations\" and to deepen trade relations with China. It did not say if he brought up Mr Lai, but the foreign secretary said ahead of the meeting: \"We will also discuss issues where the UK and China do not always see eye to eye. In some cases, the UK does have significant concerns.\""

It had previously threatened to delay the next release of hostages after accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters, and delaying Palestinians' return to the north of Gaza.

But Hamas has now indicated three more Israeli hostages would be freed on Saturday. Egyptian and Qatari mediators have affirmed they will work to \"remove all hurdles\" to ensure the ceasefire holds, the group added in a statement. Israel is yet to comment on the Hamas announcement.

Negotiations have been further complicated in recent weeks by Mr Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians so the US can take over Gaza. When Mr Trump hosted Jordan's king on Tuesday, he reiterated his controversial idea, saying the enclave's population of over two million would not be able to return but would have a better, safer future elsewhere. Mr Trump said: \"It's a war-torn area, we're going to hold it, we're going to take it… Gaza the way it is, civilisation has been wiped out in Gaza. It's going to be a great economic development.\" Much of Gaza lies in ruins after Israel's war to destroy Hamas. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage when Hamas launched its massacre in Israel on 7 October 2023."

        "Content": " The US president has promised to target countries which charge tax on US imports by matching them with a reciprocal tariff. Donald Trump has ordered his team to start calculating duties by early April - increasing fears of a global trade war that could also accelerate US inflation. \"On trade, I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,\" he posted on Truth Social.  It is set to spark negotiations with dozens of countries aimed at lowering their tariffs and trade barriers. The US wants to shrink its goods trade deficit which topped $1.2trn (£954bn) last year. A White House official said that countries with large US trade surpluses could be targeted first. The top five are China, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland and Germany, according to the US Census Bureau. Business and economics correspondent Taken at face value Donald Trump's embrace of reciprocal tariffs is a declaration of total trade war. It would amount to perhaps the single biggest peacetime shock to global commerce. In promising to levy import taxes on any nation that imposes tariffs or VAT on US exports, he is following through on a campaign promise. The aim is to address a near trillion dollar trade deficit - the difference between the value of America's exports and its imports - that he believes amounts to a tax on American jobs. In response, he wants to deploy tariffs to simultaneously ease the US deficit and - in theory - price out imports in favour of domestic production. His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. It is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. Read more from Paul here. UK government minister Pat McFadden told Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge that Britain will take a \"wait and see\" approach when it comes to the tariffs. He refused to say if the government would retaliate.

Although some estimates are lower, he thinks Britain would be the fourth hardest hit, following India (29%), Brazil (28%) and the EU (25%). This is based on VAT rates combined with existing tariffs, but the Trump administration also intends to take into account regulations, government subsidies, digital services taxation policies and exchange rate policies. Read more from Sky News:Trump wants Russia to return to G7Ukraine peace talks risk short-term win \"Most people would consider VAT to be a non-discriminatory tax since it is also applied to domestically-produced goods making a level playing field,\" said Mr Ashworth. But the US still argues that VAT is a form of discriminatory tariff because America applies a much lower average sales tax at state level. On Thursday, Mr Trump also held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agreeing to join forces on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and strategic minerals. During a news conference afterwards, Mr Trump said India has been \"very strong on tariffs\" and \"it's very hard to sell into India\", adding: \"They're going to be purchasing a lot of our oil and gas.\" India's tariff rates are the highest, according to the World Trade Organisation, with a simple average 17% rate for all products compared to 3.3% for the US."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Taken at face value Donald Trump's embrace of reciprocal tariffs is a declaration of total trade war, that would amount to perhaps the single biggest peacetime shock to global commerce. In promising to levy import taxes on any nation that imposes tariffs or VAT on US exports, he is following through on a campaign promise to address a near trillion dollar trade deficit - the difference between the value of America's exports and its imports - that he believes amounts to a tax on American jobs. In response, he wants to deploy tariffs as an \"external revenue service\", simultaneously easing the US deficit and, so the theory goes, pricing out imports in favour of domestic production. Follow latest: Trump's trading tariffs With a promise to reestablish industries, from chip production lost to Taiwan, and car and pharmaceutical manufacturing to Europe, he is promising a country-by-country tailored assault on the status quo.  Risk to Britain remains uncertain His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. Mexico and Canada, the European Union (whose 10% tariff on US cars is a particular irritation), as well as the 'BRICS' nations - Brazil, Russia, India (which imposes 9% tariffs on US imports), China and South Africa. What it means for the UK will not be certain until the details are revealed in April, but it is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. To begin with, the US runs a trade surplus with the UK - in a quirk of statistics, the UK thinks it has a surplus too - and Brexit has placed it outside the EU bloc with the ability at least in theory to be more agile. The UK also imposes direct tariffs on very few US goods following a deal in 2021, brokered by then trade secretary Liz Truss, that removed tariffs on denim and motorcycles bound for Britain, and cashmere and Scotch whisky heading the other way. But we do add VAT to imports, and Mr Trump's threat to treat the sales tax as a tariff by another name will chill British exporters. Read more from Sky News:Trump wants Russia to return to G7Fears Ukraine has been 'betrayed'Farage explores NatWest legal action Tariffs set to raise prices in US Analysts have estimated tariffs could add 21% to the cost of exports, amounting to a £24bn blow to national income. Pharmaceuticals, cars, chemicals, scientific instruments and the aerospace industry - the main components of our £182bn US export trade - will all be potentially affected. But the pain will certainly be shared. Tariffs are paid by the importer, not the exporter, and even Mr Trump accepts they will be inflationary. Rising prices on Main Street could yet be the biggest brake on the president's tariff plan."

Russia had been a member of the club of industrialised nations, then known as the G8, until it was excluded following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. \"I'd love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out. Look, it's not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia,\" the US president said at the White House.

Ukraine is also invited,\" the president added. Follow latest: Trump presidency updates During a series of fast-paced announcements, including a series of US trade tariffs, he also said he wants to discuss reducing defence spending with Russia and China, halve domestic defence expenditure and support moves towards getting rid of nuclear weapons. The US president had already announced on Wednesday that he and Vladimir Putin would start peace talks \"immediately\" to end the war in Ukraine. But much of Thursday's focus on global defence and spending came after a fractious NATO meeting in Brussels. It has been an intense 24 hours of diplomacy in Brussels, during which: • Ukraine's president said his country must have a place at the negotiating table. • The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitri Peskov said Ukraine would be involved in peace talks \"one way or another\". • Donald Trump's defence secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the US vow to focus its military might away from Europe - telling NATO allies: \"Trump won't allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker.\"  'Make NATO great again' Mr Hegseth told NATO allies that the US will not guarantee Europe's security and pressured leaders to spend more on their militaries. He told reporters \"we must make NATO great again\" as he called on allies to do \"far more for Europe's defence\". In terms of military spending, as a proportion of a country's GDP, the US defence secretary said: \"2% is a start... but it's not enough. Nor is 3%, nor is 4% - more like 5% - real investment, real urgency.\"  Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone, who was listening to Mr Hegseth's comments, said \"he represents one man, Donald Trump, and he speaks for him\".

Senior politicians in Moscow crowed over the thawing of relations between Russia and the US after presidents Trump and Putin held a 90-minute phone call on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and current security official, mocked Europe's role on the world stage and said the continent is \"mad with jealousy and rage\" and that \"Europe's time is over\"."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  You should always give peace a chance. That US President Donald Trump \"thinks out of the box\" is already the cliche of the moment. And he may bring a fresh way of thinking and a new energy to ending Russia's war in Ukraine where others have failed. But there are some ominous signs already, bolstering fears Ukraine has been betrayed before the talks have even started. Mr Trump could not bring himself on Wednesday even to say Ukraine and Russia were equal partners in any future negotiations. Follow updates: Ukraine war latest Asked if they were, he said: \"Hmm, that's an interesting question.\" The Ukrainians, he said, \"will have to make peace\". \"Their people are being killed, and I think they should make peace,\" he added. More worryingly, he seems as prepared as ever to trust Vladimir Putin. He seems happy to take the word of a man who sent agents to Britain to kill with chemical weapons, who lied repeatedly about his plans to invade Ukraine, and who has murdered in cold blood every rival who dared to challenge him. \"He insisted that if it (the conflict) ends, he wants it to end,\" Mr Trump said, as if that was all there is to it. \"He does not want to end it and then go back to war in six months.\" In the same way, Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich in 1938 waving a piece of paper declaring \"peace in our time\" after winning what he thought were similar assurances from Adolf Hitler. For Ukrainians, the parallels with 1938 do not end there.  They are being told even before negotiations start that they will have to give up some of their land that has been taken by brutal force. Ukrainians compare that with Czechoslovakia being forced to hand over the Sudetenland to Hitler. Chamberlain believed that would be enough to appease Hitler. We all know what followed. They have every reason to be worried. Read more from Sky News:Sky's correspondents give views on Trump's call with PutinHamas says it will release Israeli hostages as planned There is nothing in what the Russian president has said to make anyone believe giving him a fifth of Ukraine will be enough to appease him either. In fact, in speeches, he has been emphatically and explicitly clear time and time again. He wants all of Ukraine because he believes it is part of Russia. And then he wants the security architecture of Europe refashioned. And Mr Trump seems to be caving into Mr Putin on that as well, giving into one of the key pre-war demands he made in 2021 before invading his neighbour, the reduction of America's footprint in NATO in Europe that was declared by US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth in Brussels yesterday. Trump is surrendering much of the leverage he had over the Russians before talks have even begun. This is from a man who declared in his book The Art of the Deal that leverage is everything in negotiations. \"Don't make deals without it.\"  It is curious and inexplicable. Except that Mr Putin has always appeared to have some kind of hold over Mr Trump. When they last met in Helsinki, the president sided with Mr Putin over his own spies on the question of Russian election interference. As a spy in east Germany, Mr Putin was trained in KGB techniques of understanding your enemy and deceiving them. He has used those skills all his career, not least with George W Bush who famously naively said: \"I looked into his eyes and I saw a soul. I trusted him.\" If Mr Trump is persuaded to side with Mr Putin over Ukraine, a dictator will have been rewarded for invading his neighbour. Aggression will have prevailed. A precedent will have been set that has alarming implications for other countries neighbouring Russia and further afield. In the east, as he ponders how to seize Taiwan by force, China's Xi Jinping will be learning lessons too. The outcome of all this may well not be peace in our time. Quite the opposite."

The sub vanished on its way to visit the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended when authorities said the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors. The wreckage was eventually found on the ocean floor around 300m from the Titanic, according to officials.

Mr Farage confirmed to Sky News on Thursday evening that Grosvenor Law, which is acting for him in separate civil proceedings against the bank, had instructed Mr Daw KC to explore a private criminal prosecution, adding: \"This is unfinished business.\" Dan Morrison, a partner at Grosvenor Law, said in a separate statement: \"Mr Farage is concerned about possible criminal issues arising out of the bank's conduct. \"We do not wish to provide further details. \"We have therefore decided to instruct leading criminal counsel.\" The debanking furore which claimed the scalp of Dame Alison Rose, NatWest's former chief executive, in the summer of 2023 centred on whether the bank's Coutts subsidiary decided to close Mr Farage's accounts for commercial or political reasons. NatWest initially claimed the motivation was commercial before Mr Farage obtained internal evidence from the bank suggesting that his politics had been a pivotal factor in the decision. It sparked a firestorm under the then Conservative government, with Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, the then prime minister and chancellor respectively, indicating to NatWest's board that they had lost faith in Dame Alison's ability to lead the bank. Since then, the City watchdog has instructed banks and other financial firms to do more to ensure that parliamentarians, senior public servants and their families - known as politically exposed persons, or PEPs - are not treated unfairly.

He led Reform to a handful of seats at last year's general election, while his party finished in second place in scores of other constituencies. The Reform leader's close ties to Donald Trump, inaugurated last month for the second time as US President, have fuelled the sense that he may play an even more crucial role in shaping the identity of Britain's next government when the country goes to the polls in 2029.  A recent opinion poll for Sky News by YouGov put Reform ahead of both Labour and the Tories for the first time. Since the summer of 2023, tentative discussions between Mr Farage's legal representatives and NatWest about a possible settlement have failed to result in any financial agreement. Mr Farage was expected to seek millions of pounds from the company, alleging that the debanking row had damaged his reputation. Despite the threat of a fresh legal barrage from Mr Farage, NatWest - now run by Paul Thwaite - is in its most robust financial health for decades. The government's stake in the bank is now below 8%, and a full exit is expected during the spring. A NatWest spokesperson said it did not comment on individual customers."

        "Content": " The US president has promised to target countries which charge tax on US imports by matching them with a reciprocal tariff. Donald Trump has ordered his team to start calculating duties by early April - increasing fears of a global trade war that could also accelerate US inflation. \"On trade, I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,\" he posted on Truth Social.  It is set to spark negotiations with dozens of countries aimed at lowering their tariffs and trade barriers. The US wants to shrink its goods trade deficit which topped $1.2trn (£954bn) last year. A White House official said that countries with large US trade surpluses could be targeted first. The top five are China, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland and Germany, according to the US Census Bureau. Business and economics correspondent Taken at face value Donald Trump's embrace of reciprocal tariffs is a declaration of total trade war. It would amount to perhaps the single biggest peacetime shock to global commerce. In promising to levy import taxes on any nation that imposes tariffs or VAT on US exports, he is following through on a campaign promise. The aim is to address a near trillion dollar trade deficit - the difference between the value of America's exports and its imports - that he believes amounts to a tax on American jobs. In response, he wants to deploy tariffs to simultaneously ease the US deficit and - in theory - price out imports in favour of domestic production. His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. It is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. Read more from Paul here. UK government minister Pat McFadden told Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge that Britain will take a \"wait and see\" approach when it comes to the tariffs. He refused to say if the government would retaliate.

Although some estimates are lower, he thinks Britain would be the fourth hardest hit, following India (29%), Brazil (28%) and the EU (25%). This is based on VAT rates combined with existing tariffs, but the Trump administration also intends to take into account regulations, government subsidies, digital services taxation policies and exchange rate policies.

On Thursday, Mr Trump also held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agreeing to join forces on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and strategic minerals. During a news conference afterwards, Mr Trump said India has been \"very strong on tariffs\" and \"it's very hard to sell into India\", adding: \"They're going to be purchasing a lot of our oil and gas.\" India's tariff rates are the highest, according to the World Trade Organisation, with a simple average 17% rate for all products compared to 3.3% for the US."

Risk to Britain remains uncertain His primary targets appear to be the major trading partners with whom the trading deficit is greatest. Mexico and Canada, the European Union (whose 10% tariff on US cars is a particular irritation), as well as the 'BRICS' nations - Brazil, Russia, India (which imposes 9% tariffs on US imports), China and South Africa. What it means for the UK will not be certain until the details are revealed in April, but it is a blow to the emerging view in Whitehall that Britain might wriggle through the chaos relatively unscathed. To begin with, the US runs a trade surplus with the UK - in a quirk of statistics, the UK thinks it has a surplus too - and Brexit has placed it outside the EU bloc with the ability at least in theory to be more agile. The UK also imposes direct tariffs on very few US goods following a deal in 2021, brokered by then trade secretary Liz Truss, that removed tariffs on denim and motorcycles bound for Britain, and cashmere and Scotch whisky heading the other way. But we do add VAT to imports, and Mr Trump's threat to treat the sales tax as a tariff by another name will chill British exporters.

Pharmaceuticals, cars, chemicals, scientific instruments and the aerospace industry - the main components of our £182bn US export trade - will all be potentially affected. But the pain will certainly be shared. Tariffs are paid by the importer, not the exporter, and even Mr Trump accepts they will be inflationary. Rising prices on Main Street could yet be the biggest brake on the president's tariff plan."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Yes there are all sorts of provisos. The UK economy is still flatlining. A 0.1% expansion is about as close as you can get to zero. Gross domestic product per head - a better measure of our living standards - is shrinking (indeed, it's been shrinking for two quarters). And the UK remains far weaker than the leading G7 economy - the United States. But even after taking all that into account, it's hard not to conclude that the chancellor will be celebrating today's GDP figures. After all, economists had expected the economy to shrink by 0.1%. Thanks to a late spurt in growth in December, it actually grew. Moreover, up until today's figures, the profile of economic growth in the UK was frankly pretty dismal. There was zero cumulative growth since last year's election. Now, thanks to that jump in December - an unexpected late Christmas gift for the chancellor - cumulative growth since the election is now up to 0.4%. Of course, none of this changes the bigger economic picture. The UK economy is still stuck in a rut. The enormous growth in migration in recent years means that, once you take into account the growing population, there is considerably less income floating around for every family than there was a few years ago. And vast swathes of the UK economy are in desperate trouble. Most notably, the industrial sectors that used to power much of the country's growth are contracting at a rapid rate. That is not just a UK problem - indeed, it's shared with much of Europe. In Germany, the economy has contracted for two successive years. This deindustrialisation is one of the most significant issues facing the continent. \n                  Farage explores criminal claim over NatWest debanking\n                 \n                  The Bank of England gold rush that's pushing up the price\n                 \n                  Donald Trump triggers prospect of global trade war over 'reciprocal' tariff plan - increasing risk of tensions and inflation\n                 And that's before one considers a few other awkward issues: the real impact of last October's budget have yet to be felt in the economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to slash its growth forecasts next month, which could prompt the chancellor to further trim spending in the coming years. Read more from Sky News:The hospital outperforming most - but still on its kneesSky News' correspondents give views on Trump's call with Putin Then there are other, even more profound challenges. What happens if and when the US imposes far-reaching tariffs on UK imports? How will the UK afford the dramatic increases in defence spending the White House is demanding? Now, more than ever before, it's quite plausible that outside events could cause outsized impacts on the UK economy. In short, while today's numbers will be a relief in Downing Street, it's not altogether clear how long that sense of relief will last."

The government's stake in the bank is now below 8%, and a full exit is expected during the spring. A NatWest spokesperson said it did not comment on individual customers."

Sir Keir Starmer was in Buckinghamshire to announce more than 100 new towns could be built under the government's plans for the \"largest house building programme since the post-war era\". Politics latest: Follow live reaction to PM cutting short visit As he spoke to workers at a housing development in Milton Keynes, a group of farmers gathered in about a dozen tractors outside the site. They sounded musical horns, disrupting the announcement shortly after Sir Keir arrived. The prime minister cut the visit short following the protest, driving off before he was set to do media interviews. Farmers have staged several protests since the October budget, when the government introduced a 20% inheritance tax on farms worth more than £1m from April 2026. They have accused the government of failing to listen to them and said the tax will mean some will have to sell off land or their entire farms to pay for it, which could affect food production. Sir Keir later said his government had made a \"political choice\" to grow the economy and bring NHS waiting lists down instead of maintaining \"the tax break for farmers\". \"People watching this will understand that that is a choice. They will know what they would prefer,\" he said. \"Do they want their waiting lists to come down, do they want their mortgages to come down, the economy to start working for everyone? \"That is what we are trying to achieve. \"Or do we want to give tax breaks for farmers? We can't have both.\" Farmer Phillip Weston told Sky News' Dan Whitehead at the protest: \"He's not coming to us to talk, so we're coming to him.\" As Sir Keir was driven away from the site, farmers could be heard shouting \"just talk to us\". Farmer Richard Miles, who travelled from Welford, Northamptonshire, said: \"We are not being listened to at all, that's why we feel we have to come and see him in person.\" Read more from Sky News:PM backs chancellor despite expenses allegationsSurprise growth for economy at end of 2024Hundreds attend PC's funeral  A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: \"Thames Valley Police facilitated a peaceful protest off the A509 and liaised with the protesters at the scene. \"Officers from the local policing team engaged with the protesters. \"No arrests were made or necessary.

The chancellor has been accused by former employees of being involved in an \"expenses scandal\" while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) from 2006 to 2009, according to the BBC. She has also been accused of saying she worked for the Bank of England for longer than she did. Politics latest: PM ditches visit after tractors bypass gates Downing Street said the PM believes he can trust the chancellor. Ms Reeves' spokesperson said she was \"not aware of an investigation, nor was she interviewed\". Her lawyer has denied the allegations. Jayne Wayper, former HR business partner for HBOS, said: \"I do not recognise any of the accusations or claims that have been made against Rachel Reeves.\" One ex-colleague told the BBC she nearly got sacked after an investigation into three senior managers accused of \"signing off each other's expenses\". This included spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. A whistleblower said there was also concern about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. In a Facebook group of former HBOS employees seen by the BBC, several people referred to Ms Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending. Sir Keir's official spokesman said it was \"correct\" the prime minister has \"no concerns whatsoever\" about the chancellor's conduct and has confidence in her. He also said: \"I can't speak to her time prior to government. \"The PM works hand in hand and has full faith in the chancellor.\" Sir Keir later said she has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" from questions about her career before becoming an MP. Ms Weyper, former HBOS' HR, said there was an \"extensive oversight\" of all expense policies, receipts were signed off by line managers and in her role she \"would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded\". \"I cannot speak for the motivations behind those who have been making these claims about Rachel Reeves. However, I do not recognise them and understand she left the bank on good terms,\" she added. Reeves was 'not aware of an investigation' A spokesperson for Ms Reeves said: \"Rachel is proud of the work she did at HBOS and the teams that she led, it is 16 years since she left the bank and the first time she was made aware of these claims was when approached by journalists. \"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way. \"Several former colleagues from her time at the bank, including HBOS' former HR business partner, have corroborated this account. \"Rachel left HBOS in 2009 on good terms.\" Ms Reeves's lawyer while she was leaving HBOS said she left HBOS with a \"standard-style agreement\" after a \"mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\". David Sorensen, a managing partner at Morrish Solicitors, added: \"My clear understanding at the time was that my client, who was in a senior role, left on good terms when HBOS plc was acquired in 2009, as evidenced by the payments made to her, the retention of her company car and other benefits for a six-month period, and a favourable reference. \"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process.\" Read more:Judge 'wrong' to let Gaza family settle in UK under Ukraine scheme, PM saysTreasury launches inquiry into leak of growth forecasts  LinkedIn dates questioned Questions have also been raised about Ms Reeves' online CV, as her LinkedIn profile said she stayed at the Bank of England nine months longer than she actually did, the BBC has reported. She has publicly said she spent a decade there, but her LinkedIn profile claimed she worked at the bank from September 2000 to December 2006. However, she is understood to have left by March 2006, when she started working at HBOS. That means she spent five and a half years at the bank, including nearly a year studying. Ms Reeves' spokesman, in a comment given to the BBC, said the dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by her team. They said the chancellor had not seen it before it was published. The chancellor's LinkedIn profile has now been updated to reflect she left the bank in March 2006. Ms Reeves has repeatedly said she spent 10 years at the Bank of England, citing her time as an economist there as why she can be trusted with the UK's finances."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n To Opposition MPs, she's \"Rachel from Accounts\". But as well as being accused of embellishing her CV, she's now being challenged about her own accounts - her expenses claims. The chancellor has been accused of being involved in an \"expenses scandal\" when she worked at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). It's claimed she spent hundreds of pounds on handbags, earrings, wine, taxis, a Christmas party and - yes - even perfume. They're the sort of allegations that don't appear to pass the smell test, though she insists she wasn't aware of an investigation and wasn't interviewed. Not surprisingly, however, Kemi Badenoch is demanding she comes clean \"not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS\". Her solicitor says his \"clear understanding at the time\" was that Ms Reeves left on good terms, kept her company car and other benefits for six months and was given a \"favourable reference\". \"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" insists David Sorenson of Leeds-based Morrish Solicitors. And a former HR boss at HBOS, Jayne Wayper, also insists: \"I do not recognise any of the accusations or claims that have been made against Rachel Reeves.\" All this comes on top of more \"CV-gate\" allegations, suggesting \"Rachel from Accounts\" is less \"Rachel from the Bank of England\" and more \"Rachel from HBOS\" than she claimed. It has been quite a day for Ms Reeves. It's her 46th birthday. That's nice. New figures showed the economy grew slightly at the end of last year. That was a relief.  But the latest accusations mean MPs are once again questioning whether she'll survive Sir Keir Starmer's first big reshuffle, in the spring or summer. Not good. We'd already learned that \"Rachel from Economics\" was also \"Rachel from Retail Banking\", \"Rachel from IT\" and \"Rachel from Administration\". This time it's claimed she exaggerated how long she spent at the Bank of England. Now it's getting even more confusing. Read more:Treasury launches inquiry into leak of growth forecastsMore than 100 new towns being considered by ministers The chancellor originally claimed she worked at the Bank of England for \"the best part of a decade\", then she said it was from September 2000 until December 2006. Now it's emerged she left the Bank in March 2006, after she was photographed with HBOS colleagues at a Council of Mortgage Lenders lunch in March 2006. Whoops! Political opponents - and some Labour MPs too - are an unforgiving lot and once again the woman who likes to be thought of as an \"iron chancellor\", in the Gordon Brown mould, is looking badly tarnished again. Her big problem is that she has constantly boasted about how her time as a Bank of England economist and her banking experience means voters can trust her with the nation's finances. That leads to a second problem. If everything in the economy was going swimmingly right now it would be easier for her to dismiss the accusations about her CV and her expenses. But critics claim the economy is heading for the rocks and that she's to blame for many of the government's problems: winter fuel payments, national insurance increases, inheritance tax on farmers, and so on.  So after a new year fightback after a previous bout of speculation about her future, the balance sheet for \"Rachel from Accounts\" is looking pretty negative again. What she desperately needs is better economic news, some of that growth that's proving so elusive. Otherwise, despite Sir Keir's backing for her so far, she'll be \"Rachel for the Reshuffle\". Or worse."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The UK government is facing increasing pressure to call on China to release jailed pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai as it seeks closer trading ties with Beijing. Media tycoon Mr Lai is currently on trial in Hong Kong facing charges under the city's national security law, imposed by Beijing in 2020 in response to mass pro-democracy protests. Mr Lai's imprisonment and trial have become a sticking point for the British government in their dealings with China. Chinese foreign secretary Wang Yi met Mr Lammy, and Sir Keir Starmer briefly, in London on Thursday, and pressure was on the UK foreign secretary to raise Mr Lai's situation and call for his release. Why is Jimmy Lai a British issue? The 77-year-old has lived in Hong Kong since he was 12 years old, after stowing away on a fishing boat from China and working as a child labourer in a garment factory. He built up fashion empire Giordano and after becoming a democracy advocate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, he set up a magazine in Hong Kong. \n                  'Big opportunity' for Chinese electric carmakers in the UK, newest entrant XPENG tells Sky News\n                 \n                  In China's Silicon Valley, where founder of DeepSeek Liang Wenfeng keeps a low profile\n                 \n                  Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs target a deeper issue - but risk job losses and higher prices\n                 Ahead of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China, he started Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily in an attempt to maintain freedom of speech. Around the same time, in 1994, he became a full British citizen. He has never held a Chinese or Hong Kong passport but because he was born in mainland China, Hong Kong authorities deem him to be a Chinese citizen. Mr Lai has homes all over the world, including in London, Paris, Taipei and Kyoto. But his sole passport is British.  Why is he in jail? During the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Lai's Apple Daily adopted the position of the protesters, criticising the government. In June 2021, Apple Daily was raided by the police, who seized documents, froze its accounts and arrested its executives, leading to its closure. Mr Lai was arrested and charged under the newly introduced national security law with collusion with foreign forces, as well as sedition under colonial-era laws.

The media tycoon has been found guilty of various other charges, including attending a Tiananmen vigil, which has meant he has been in a high-security jail since December 2020. What about his trial? In December 2023, Mr Lai's national security law trial, where he faces charges of collusion with foreign forces and conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications, started after years of delay. After seven months, the court refused to dismiss the charges and adjourned the trial before Mr Lai could testify. He was kept in solitary confinement and the trial resumed in November last year, when he first took to the stand. The media tycoon has now testified for more than 40 days, facing questioning about his editorial control over Apple Daily, links to activists in Hong Kong, the UK and US and meetings with US politicians. In December, he told the trial he believed the UK had a \"moral responsibility\" to lead international support of Hong Kong, but denied requesting the UK government engaged in hostile activities against China and Hong Kong. What has the British government done? Boris Johnson  When Mr Lai was charged under the national security law in 2020, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the UK was \"deeply concerned\". This prompted the Chinese embassy in London to express \"grave concern\" about the \"irresponsible remarks\" which they said were an \"act of interference\". However, any pressure from the government appeared to drop after that for a few years.  A lack of engagement A handful of \"China hawks\" in parliament, including former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Tory foreign affairs committee chair Alicia Kearns, Lord Alton and Labour MP Catherine West, have consistently raised Mr Lai's case in parliament. Mr Lai's son, Sebastien, and his father's international legal team called several times for a meeting with Liz Truss and James Cleverly when they were foreign secretaries but that never happened, although they did meet with a foreign minister. James Cleverly Rhetoric then ratcheted up, with Mr Cleverly raising Mr Lai's case directly with Chinese vice president Han Zheng as well as at the \"highest levels with the Hong Kong authorities\". Mr Cleverly accused Hong Kong in May 2023 of \"deliberately targeting prominent pro-democracy figures, journalists and politicians in an effort to silence and discredit them\", adding: \"Detained British dual national Jimmy Lai is one such figure.\" Lord Cameron and Rishi Sunak Lord Cameron, as foreign secretary, called for Mr Lai's charges to be dropped at the end of 2023, and for his immediate release. In a January 2024 letter to the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, Rishi Sunak called Mr Lai's trial \"politically motivated\" and vowed to keep raising the case with Beijing as a priority. However, Mr Sunak dodged questions about whether he had personally raised his case with the Chinese government. Starmer government With a change of government, Mr Lai's family and supporters hoped there would be a more concerted effort. Three months after winning the general election, Sir Keir said securing the release of Mr Lai was a \"priority\" for his government and said it would \"continue\" to raise the case with China. Sebastien Lai welcomed his words but asked the PM to \"put word to action to save my father's life and bring him home\". Ahead of his first trip to China as foreign secretary in October, Mr Lammy was urged by MPs sanctioned by Beijing to raise the case of political prisoners in Hong Kong, including Mr Lai. The Foreign Office said he pressed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Mr Lai's detention, and Mr Lammy said he \"was able to have dialogue with the Chinese on areas where we disagree, areas like Hong Kong\". Mr Lammy then joined Chancellor Rachel Reeves on a trip to revive economic ties after \"years of tension\". She said she raised Mr Lai's imprisonment with every minister she met in China. During the latest meeting of Mr Lammy and Mr Yi, Number 10 said Sir Keir also met him briefly and told him he wants \"consistent and respectful relations\" and to deepen trade relations with China. It did not say if he brought up Mr Lai, but the foreign secretary said ahead of the meeting: \"We will also discuss issues where the UK and China do not always see eye to eye. In some cases, the UK does have significant concerns.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Shell is in court today facing allegations it is responsible for oil pollution in Nigeria that left thousands without clean water and ruined farming and fishing. Lawyers claim hundreds of leaks and spills from Shell's pipelines and infrastructure have devastated the environment of the Bille and Ogale communities in the Niger Delta. Shell argues that the vast majority of the pollution came from criminals sabotaging pipelines, stealing oil and illegally refining it. The company says it is not liable for pollution caused by others, but that its regional arm, SPDC, cleans up all spills, \"regardless of the cause\", including those being scrutinised in court. Lawyers representing 13,000 local Nigerians claim Shell and its subsidiary \"failed to take basic steps\" to stop the oil theft and other activity that caused the spill, and that there has \"barely\" been a clean-up. Law firm Leigh Day argues the pollution breached people's right to clean and healthy surroundings. The initial trial, starting today in the High Court in London, will decide whether Shell can be held liable for pollution caused in the course of theft and illegal activity. The full trial will begin next year. It will also assess whether oil pollution by a private company can be a violation of a community's fundamental human rights under the Nigerian Constitution and African Charter on Human and People's Rights. Leigh Day says if the case succeeds, it would be the first time a UK multinational had been found to have breached human rights by polluting the environment. Ogale and Bille residents have been fighting for a clean-up \"to international standards\" and compensation since 2015, after they say pollution left them without clean water and unable to farm and fish.  Chief Bennett Okpoki, leader of the Bille community, said: \"It has been a long, hard fight to get here, but we are happy to see Shell finally facing trial\". \"Once we relied on fishing for our livelihoods - now, because of the pollution, our rivers and waterways are devastated, and the fish are gone\".

Oil is being stolen on an industrial scale in the Niger Delta. This criminality is a major source of pollution and is the cause of the majority of spills in the Bille and Ogale claims. \"The SPDC joint venture manages these challenges, working closely with the Nigerian government, its government-owned partner NNPC Ltd, local communities and other key stakeholders using its expertise in spill prevention, response and clean-up. Regardless of the cause of a spill, SPDC cleans up the areas affected by spills originating from its facilities and in the event of an operational spill, SPDC compensates any affected people and communities. \"We believe Leigh Day's litigation does little to address the real problem in the Niger Delta: oil spills due to theft, illegal refining and sabotage, which cause the most environmental damage.\""

        "Content": "Elon Musk's X has agreed to pay Donald Trump about $10m (£8m) after suspending his accounts following the 2021 US Capitol riot by his supporters, according to reports. The payment follows a $25m (£20m) deal the US president's lawyers struck with Meta Platforms - the owner of Facebook and Instagram - last month. Mr Trump sued the social media platforms, along with Google's owner Alphabet Inc, as well as their chief executives, in San Francisco over what he claimed was unlawful silencing of conservative opinions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Twitter had cited the risk of Mr Trump inciting further violence related to his effort to remain in the White House following his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 election as the reason for suspending his account.  👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 Mr Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, has become a fierce supporter of Mr Trump, giving $250m (£202m) to his 2024 election campaign. The tech billionaire has been chosen by the president to head the new US Department of Government Efficiency - shortened to DOGE - whose purpose is to radically shrink federal bureaucracy. Mr Trump's legal team considered dropping the case given the platform's change of ownership and how close the two men have become, before agreeing to the settlement, the Journal reported - quoting people familiar with the matter. Lawyers are expected to pursue a similar agreement with Alphabet, which banned Mr Trump from YouTube after the Capitol riot.

Mr Trump has pardoned about 1,500 supporters charged over the violence on 6 January 2021, which saw people storm the Capitol building in Washington to try to stop Joe Biden's 2020 election victory being signed off. Sky News has contacted X for comment."

The 43-year-old American, who is the daughter of musician John Mellencamp, wrote on Instagram on Wednesday that she was undergoing immediate surgery to remove two of the tumours. She added the remaining smaller tumours would be dealt with via radiation at a later date. \"For the last several weeks I've been dealing with severe and debilitating headaches. Yesterday the pain was unbearable and required hospitalisation,\" she wrote. \"After a CT scan and MRI, doctors found multiple tumours on my brain, which they believe have been growing for at least 6 months.\" She said was \"blessed to be surrounded by my children, family, friends, doctors, nurses and surgeons\" and thanked \"everybody who has reached out\" and \"supported me along this journey\". The update comes after Mellencamp, who starred on The Real Housewives for three seasons, revealed she'd been diagnosed with stage two melanoma in 2022. She has had regular treatment to remove the skin cancer.

        "Content": " Grimes has criticised former partner Elon Musk's decision to bring their son to an Oval Office news conference. The 36-year-old singer, who has had an on-off relationship with Mr Musk since 2018, apparently only learned via social media that he had taken X Æ A-12 - or X for short - to the briefing with Donald Trump on Tuesday. In response to a comment on X about her son being \"very polite\", Grimes said: \"He should not be in public like this. I did not see this, thank u for alerting me. But I'm glad he was polite. Sigh.\" Mr Musk, 53, carried the four-year-old on his shoulders as he spoke to reporters about his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). X Æ A-12 also stood beside his billionaire father and Mr Trump as they spoke, at one point appearing to attempt to address the president as Mr Musk answered questions. He also interrupted his dad at times as he was quizzed over accusations he is orchestrating a \"hostile takeover\" of government in a non-transparent way. While photographers took pictures, Mr Trump said: \"X are you ok? This is X and he is a great guy, high IQ.

And the \"A-12\" is their \"favourite aircraft\". X is one of three children Mr Musk and Grimes share, alongside his younger siblings Exa Dark Sideræl and Techno Mechanicus, or Tau for short. The Tesla owner is father to 12 children but lost his firstborn child from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) when he was just 10 weeks old."

        "Content": "Audrey Hepburn and glam rock musician Marc Bolan are among the stars being honoured with blue plaques celebrating their \"profound impact\". Plaques will also honour novelist Barbara Pym, artist Graham Sutherland, ballerina Alicia Markova and Jamaican writer and campaigner Una Marson. The blue plaque scheme has been running since 1866. Hepburn's plaque will go up in Mayfair, a high-end neighbourhood of London where the actress landed her Oscar-winning role as Princess Anne in 1953 romance film Roman Holiday, starring alongside Gregory Peck. The actress was sent to a boarding school in England by her parents, Irish-English businessman James Hepburn Ruston and a Dutch-Hungarian-French noblewoman, Baroness Ella Van Heemstra. She has four Academy Award best actress nods for romantic comedies Sabrina and Breakfast At Tiffany's, drama The Nun's Story, and horror Wait Until Dark. Shortly before she died aged 63 in 1993, she was presented the British Academy's Special Award by the Princess Royal. English Heritage curatorial director, Matt Thompson, said: \"2025 marks an exciting year for the Blue Plaques Scheme as we honour these outstanding individuals who transformed the cultural fabric of London. \"From literature and art to dance and music, these figures helped shape the London we know today. \"Their contributions not only had a profound impact on their fields but also continue to inspire generations.\" T Rex frontman Bolan will be marked with a plaque at one of his west London addresses, while English National Ballet co-founder Markova is set to be honoured at her childhood home in Muswell Hill. Get It On hitmaker Bolan died aged 29 in 1977 when his car smashed into a tree in south-west London. The location for a plaque commemorating Jamaican writer Marson, claimed by the BBC to be its first black producer on the payroll who would go on to develop Caribbean Voices, part of the Calling The West Indies series, is yet to be chosen. The blue plaques, which need the owner of the building to approve them, are set to be installed throughout this year.
