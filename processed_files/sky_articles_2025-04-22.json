        "Content": " Mourners will be able to view the body of Pope Francis lying in state in St Peter's Basilica from Wednesday, ahead of his funeral this weekend. Tens of thousands of people are expected to travel to the Vatican over the next three days to pay their respects to the pontiff, who died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. After his funeral on Saturday morning (9am UK time) there will be a nine-day period of mourning, known as the \"novendiali\", after which the secretive meeting - called the conclave - will begin to elect a new pope. Pope Francis: Follow the latest The conclave to choose his successor must start between 5 and 10 May. The first images of his body were released on Tuesday, showing him in red vestments and his bishop's mitre in a wooden casket. The Vatican secretary of state was shown praying over him in the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where he lived and died. \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  The Vatican is in mourning for the Pope - and yet St Peter's Square is full of smiles\n                 \n                  Pope Francis's final moments reveal how quickly he deteriorated before death\n                 Previous popes were entombed in three coffins: the first made of wood, another of lead and a third, again made of wood. But in 2024, Francis changed the rules and said that only one coffin, a wooden one lined in zinc, should be used. In a break from tradition, he will be buried in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (St Mary Major), according to his wishes.  Following the pope's death, from a stroke and heart failure, world leaders have praised his moral leadership and compassion. On Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer described him as \"a quite remarkable man, and the work and commitment that he put into fairness over so many years, and globally, I think will be a real lasting legacy\". by Barbara Serra, Sky News presenter in Rome An institution like the Catholic Church, which is more than 2,000 years old and has changed leadership 266 times, is well-versed in managing transition. But while the steps that follow a pope's death may be strictly dictated by tradition, the mood is often very different, depending on the pope that is being replaced. The word Catholic means universal, and it's a good reminder of the challenge facing any pope - leading a congregation 1.4 billion strong from all over the world, with differing ideas about if and how change should happen, is far from easy.  The global demographics of Catholicism are changing rapidly. Pope Francis was keenly aware of this.  We often talk about him as progressive, but a more accurate term to describe his papacy would be \"inclusive\".

In 2023, around 50,000 people attended the funeral of Benedict XVI, according to the Washington Post. In 2005, around 300,000 went to the funeral of John Paul II. Once the conclave begins, cardinals vote in secret sessions in the Sistine Chapel. After voting sessions, the ballots are burned in a special stove. Black smoke indicates that no pope has been elected, while white smoke indicates that the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  With the death of Pope Francis, cardinals from around the world will soon gather in the Vatican to choose a new pontiff. Francis, of course, hailed from Argentina - but could the next pope be British? It's been 866 years since the papacy of Britain's only ever pontiff (Pope Adrian IV) ended in 1159, and the history of the Catholic Church in the UK since then has been turbulent, with King Henry VIII perhaps the main culprit. There are currently four British cardinals, three of whom are young enough to vote in the conclave. And while none of them are considered odds-on favourites for the top job, it's true that surprises do happen behind the shuttered doors of the secretive congregation of cardinals. So who are the British cardinals, and could one of them be the next pope? Head of the Catholic Church in England and WalesCardinal Vincent Nichols, 79 Born in Crosby near Liverpool, as a child Cardinal Vincent Nichols hoped to be a lorry driver but as a teenager reportedly felt the calling to join the priesthood while watching Liverpool FC. \n                  Tens of thousands of the faithful to pay their respects to the Pope as he lies in state\n                 \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  The Vatican is in mourning for the Pope - and yet St Peter's Square is full of smiles\n                 He has served as the Archbishop of Westminster since 2009, the most senior position in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Before that he was the Archbishop of Birmingham. As cardinal, he is known for leading the church's work tackling human trafficking and modern slavery, for which he received the UN Path to Peace Award. He was criticised by the UK's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which said he \"demonstrated a lack of understanding\" of the impact of abuse and \"seemingly put the reputation of the church first\". Cardinal Nichols, responding to the findings, told Sky News he was \"ashamed at what has happened in the context of the Catholic Church\" and promised to improve the church's response. \"He has quite a reputation,\" says religious historian and writer Catherine Pepinster. \"But I don't think anybody has suggested he should be made pope.\" He himself has appeared to rule himself out of the running as well, telling reporters he was \"too old, not capable\". Read more:Inside Vatican City at moment of high tensionWho will be at the Pope's funeral - and who won't be The Francis allyCardinal Timothy Radcliffe, 79  Born in London in 1945, Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe entered the Dominican Order of preachers in 1965 and was ordained as a priest in 1971. As Master of the Dominican Order - the first Englishman in its 800-year history - he was popular for his speeches around the monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the modern world. He was appointed cardinal just last year, on 7 December 2024, and is viewed as an ally of Pope Francis who could vote for a candidate who would continue his work. He's a popular figure, says Michael Walsh, an expert on Catholic issues, but his age likely rules him out from serious consideration, he added. \"Timothy Radcliffe is an interesting one,\" says Ms Pepinster. \"There are a lot of people who listen to what he says. \"He has a reputation for speaking very well so possibly (he could be considered), but he's nearly 80.\" Like Cardinal Nichols, however, Cardinal Radcliffe appears to have confirmed he does not want the job, telling reporters he believed the Holy Spirit was \"far too wise to even think of me (as pope) for the shortest moment\". The diplomatCardinal Michael Fitzgerald, 87 Made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2019, Michael Fitzgerald has been one of the leading experts on Christian-Muslim relations and served as one of the Catholic Church's delegates to the Arab League of nations. His ministry saw him spend time in Africa and he was appointed titular archbishop of Nepte in Tunisia. He is known for engaging with other faiths and wrote a booklet to help Catholics understand and support Muslims during Ramadan. He also served as apostolic nuncio to Egypt, a diplomatic role similar to an ambassador. At 87, he is too old to vote for the next pope but can still play a key role behind the scenes in discussions before the conclave starts. It's also not technically impossible for him to be elected pontiff himself, despite being too old to cast his own vote, though it isn't likely. The Vatican insiderCardinal Arthur Roche, 75 Born in West Yorkshire in 1950, Cardinal Arthur Roche was ordained a priest at the age of 25 in the Diocese of Leeds. Within the church, some have regarded him as a cleric who was being fast-tracked to hold high office. His time as Bishop of Leeds was not without controversy, both for liturgical reasons and also for his programme of closures and mergers of churches in his diocese. He has held various posts in the Vatican and was made an Archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012, before being made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022. Dr Walsh says that Cardinal Roche isn't viewed as a \"significant character\", while Ms Pepinster suggested that his tenure as a Vatican official could work against him when it comes to cardinals coming in from all over the world.  A British pope? Maybe not this time \"I don't think there's anything against having an English pope at all,\" says Mr Walsh, when asked how Britain was viewed generally. But with all four British cardinals now 75 or older, age may make them unlikely candidates to be pope, he said. \"I think they will look for someone younger,\" he added. There's also a growing consensus that, like with Francis, the next pope should come from beyond Europe, Ms Pepinster added. Many believe that, as the Church has expanded beyond its Catholic heartlands, the next pope should come from elsewhere. However, Sky News understands there are whispers around the Vatican that suggest the next pope will indeed be from Europe, and likely from Italy. Asked about the next pope, Cardinal Radcliffe said: \"I think that we always open ourselves to be surprised. All recent popes have been quite different from each other.\""

It comes after first-quarter profits at Tesla sank as the company grapples with falling sales, partly due to President Trump's tariffs. As a special government employee, Mr Musk was limited to 130 days in his role at DOGE, which is primarily aimed at slashing federal spending. In April, he dismissed reports suggesting he would leave his role in the coming months, calling the rumours \"fake news\". But the cuts, which included axing government jobs, have divided the country and prompted a backlash against his company, including protests and attacks on Tesla showrooms. Donald Trump labelled the vandals \"terrorists\".  Tesla said on Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 71% to $409m (£306.77m) from $1.39bn (£1.04bn) in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues were also well below forecasts, dropping 9% to $19.3bn (£14.5bn) between January and March. The company's share price has plummeted by more than 50% since reaching a record high in mid-December. \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  Trump v Powell: What's behind their spat?\n                 \n                  Harvard University sues over $2.2bn funding freeze after rejecting demands from Donald Trump's administration\n                 Share price plummets Tesla's value has tumbled following the financial market turbulence caused by the global trade war tariffs, competition from Chinese EV rivals and concern over Mr Musk's ability to give the firm the attention it requires. Mr Musk's role as chief executive of the company was among the most common questions shareholders were asking about in a question-and-answer portal ahead of an investor call on Tuesday evening. As well as his role at the top of Tesla, he is also the CEO of space exploration company SpaceX and owns social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk has 'lost focus' An early Tesla investor Ross Gerber said in a recent interview with Sky's Business Live that Mr Musk had lost his focus and was now too \"divisive\". There has been no clear sign of improvement at Tesla as much-awaited updates on making affordable cars and developing driverless technology left some questions unanswered.

Production of Tesla's self-driving robotaxi, named Cybercab, is scheduled to start in 2026. Uncertainty was also evident in the outlook statement, which pointed to the harm tariffs could pose to the business. While Teslas are made in the US, there are also factories in China and Germany. Under the tariff regime, those car parts are subject to additional taxes when they enter America."

        "Content": "Talks to try to end the Birmingham bin strike that has seen piles of black rubbish bags fill the pavements of the city will resume today. Mounds of waste remain uncollected, while residents have started to take matters into their own hands. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident on 31 March, saying the \"regrettable\" move was taken in response to public health concerns, as picket lines were blocking depots and preventing waste vehicles from collecting rubbish. The all-out strike started on 11 March, but waste collections have been disrupted since January. Here is everything you need to know. How long have workers been striking? More than 350 workers of the Unite union began a series of walkouts in January and decided to escalate into indefinite strike action on 11 March, citing fear over further attacks on their jobs, pay and conditions. The union has said that the removal of the role of waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) role will leave about 150 workers £8,000 worse off - as the number of workers working on bin lorries will be reduced from four to three. The council said it scrapped the WRCO role to put the city's waste operations in line with national practice and to improve its waste collection service. It said all workers have been offered alternative employment at the same pay, driver training or voluntary redundancy and that offer remains open. Three military planners are understood to have been assigned to the city to provide logistical support to Birmingham's council for a short period of time. What are the impacts? Normally, the city's waste teams would make more than half a million collections in a week with 200 vehicles deployed over eight-hour daily shifts. This has been reduced to just over 26,000 since the start of April, according to the latest council figures.  The cost of the ongoing clean-up could cause even more damage to the council, which effectively declared bankruptcy in 2023. One waste management agency told Sky News that totally clearing the backlog could cost more than £200m. The strike has become one of the longest the UK has seen in recent years. Back in 1978-79, the winter of discontent led to rubbish piling up on the streets of London, as the waste collection industry joined other trade unions in demanding larger pay rises in response to government caps. More recently, more than 200 bin workers in the Wirral went on a week-long strike in 2022, eventually securing a 15% pay rise. In the same year, a similar dispute over pay saw rubbish pile up in Edinburgh during the city's busy festival season. Why is it taking so long to settle the dispute? Unite, the union representing striking workers, and the city council have failed to reach an agreement since the strike began in March, with Unite holding firm on the strike action despite pressure from the government.  Members rejected the council's latest offer on 14 April by 97% on 60% turnout, saying it was \"totally inadequate\" and did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. The union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the rejection was \"no surprise\" as \"workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision\". Meanwhile, the government and council said it was a \"significantly improved\" offer. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons on 22 April, communities minister Jim McMahon said \"significant progress\" had been made in dealing with the remaining tonnes of rubbish. He said through \"a concerted effort\" and with the assistance of other councils, private operators and workers, 26,000 tonnes of excess waste had been removed, and the levels were \"approaching normal\". Council leader John Cotton told Sky News' Midlands correspondent Lisa Dowd on 16 April that it \"pains\" him to see pictures of mounds of rubbish and rats feeding off the mess being broadcast around the world. He said the only way for the normal waste collection schedule to resume was for the strike to end - but added the cash-strapped council has \"red lines\" that it will not cross during negotiations. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner visited the city on 10 April and urged the union to end the \"misery and disruption\" by accepting a pay deal. How have residents been affected? Mounting rubbish has led to residents complaining of a risk to public health, with rotting food attracting foxes, cockroaches and rats. Rashid Campbell, a local resident who is part of a volunteer litter-picking team from the Birmingham Central Mosque, told Sky's Shamaan Freeman-Powell that 12 members of his team collected 24 bags of rubbish from two Birmingham streets on Easter Sunday. \"If we don't [litter-pick], we're just going to be drowning in rubbish,\" he said. Latifat Abdul Majed Isah said even in some places where bins have been taken away, the street remained \"dirty, unpalatable and unpleasant to see\".  Joseph McHale, a rat-catcher from Vergo Pest Management, told Sky News at the beginning of April that discarded bin bags provide vermin with \"somewhere to hide, somewhere to feed, somewhere to stay warm\". He said his business had seen a 60% increase in people from Birmingham calling them for help. By declaring a major incident, the council was able to free up an additional 35 vehicles and crews to clear rubbish and fly-tipping from the streets. The limited number of waste trucks are deployed each morning from three depots across the city and cover multiple different routes.  Residents are also able to dispose of household general waste and bulky items at the council's mobile household waste centres, without prebooking. To recycle household items, locals are required to book a slot at one of the council's household recycling centres. Could it spread to other areas? The union's general secretary has warned the strikes could \"absolutely\" spread to other areas. \"If other councils decide to make low-paid workers pay for bad decisions that they did not make, workers paying the price yet again, then absolutely, of course, we all have to take action in those other areas,\" Sharon Graham told LBC. The union's national lead officer Onay Kasab agreed, telling BBC Four: \"Well, if other local authorities look to cut the pay of essential public service workers, then there is the potential for strike action spreading. \"That's why different political choices need to be made.\" Ms Graham also criticised the government, saying it had taken them \"a huge amount of time to get involved in the dispute\"."

In a sobering set of projections, the Washington-based organisation said it was grappling with \"extremely high levels of policy uncertainty\" - and the global economy would slow even if countries manage to negotiate a permanent reduction in tariffs from the US. Echoing earlier warnings about the risks to the global financial system, the IMF said stock markets could fall even more sharply than they did in the aftermath of Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement, when US and UK indices recorded some of their largest one-day falls since the pandemic. It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to meet her US counterpart Scott Bessent at the IMF's spring gathering in Washington this week. She is hoping to negotiate a reduction to the 10% baseline tariff the US president has applied to all UK goods. Steel, aluminium and car exports face an additional 25% tariff. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm Business and economics correspondent The IMF served us an important reminder today: there is no easy way out of the globally integrated economy.  Even if Trump makes his 90-day tariff pause permanent, while the world's two largest economies are at war, there will be spillovers. The US and China account for 43% of the global economy.  If demand in either nation slows, that has ripple effects elsewhere. Tariff or no tariff, exporters to those markets will be hurt. If China redirects its goods elsewhere, that could hurt domestic industries - jobs could be at stake. US and Chinese investors might pause global projects and stock market devaluations could hurt confidence. Against that backdrop, it is difficult to predict with certainty what would happen to the UK but, even if we sweet talk our way out of tariffs, the dark clouds of the global economy are moving in every direction. Britain is open and highly trade-sensitive (our trade-to-GDP ratio is around 65%). Global spillovers will rain on us. Then there are the spillovers from the financial markets. The IMF warned that rising government borrowing costs were weighing on growth.  This is, in part, a reflection of investor unease over the UK's growth and inflation outlook, but it also reflects anxiety over the US trajectory. It's worth bearing all of this in mind if Rachel Reeves emerges from Washington with a deal.\n Yes, a reduction in tariffs could make a big difference to some industries, especially our car manufacturers who are currently grappling with a 25% levy on goods to their largest export market.  However, it would not immunise us from a global slowdown and it would not solve our problems. In fact, many of those problems, right now at least, are homegrown. The IMF said higher inflation because of rising energy bills was causing more damage to the UK than tariffs.  Previous government estimates suggest a US free trade deal would boost UK growth by just 0.16% over the next 15 years. And overall GDP does matter.  The chancellor desperately needs economic growth to support the country's ailing public finances (when the economy grows, so do tax receipts).  Reeves will know better than most that the prize the US has to offer is comparatively small, so she should weigh up the costs of any deal carefully and turn her attention to problems back at home.\n The IMF presented a range of forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook. Its main case looked at the period up to 4 April, after Mr Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries across the world, ratcheting up US protectionism to its highest level in a century. If the president were to revert to this policy framework, global growth would fall from 3.3% last year to 2.8% this year, before recovering to 3% in 2026. In January, the IMF was predicting a rate of 3.3% for both years. Nearly all countries were hit with downgrades, with the US expected to grow by just 1.8% this year, a downgrade of 0.9 percentage points. Mexico was downgraded by 1.7 percentage points, while China and Canada are forecast to slow by 0.6 percentage points and Japan by 0.5 percentage points. The UK economy is expected to grow by just 1.1% this year, down 0.5 percentage points from the 1.6% the IMF was predicting in January. Growth picks up to 1.4% next year, still 0.1 percentage points lower than the January forecast.  Along with recent tariff announcements, the IMF blamed the UK's poor performance on a rise in government borrowing costs, which has in part been triggered by growing unease among investors over the fate of the US economy. When borrowing costs rise, the chancellor has to rein in public spending or raise taxes to meet her fiscal rules. That can weigh on economic growth.  It also pointed to problems in the domestic economy, mainly \"weaker private consumption amid higher inflation as a result of regulated prices and energy costs\". In a blow to the chancellor, the IMF warned that the UK would experience one of the largest upticks in inflation because of utility bill increases that took effect in April. It upgraded its inflation forecast by 0.7 percentage points to 3.1% for 2025, taking it even higher above the Bank of England's 2% target and deepening the dilemma for central bankers who are also grappling with weak growth. Read more:Can Reeves come up trumps in Washington?Trump's tariffs to have major global impact Meanwhile, inflation in the US is likely to jump one percentage point higher than previously forecast to 3% in 2025 on the back of higher tariffs. The IMF forecast period ended on 4 April. That was before the US president paused his reciprocal tariffs on countries across the world while ratcheting up levies on China. In a worrying sign for finance ministers across the world, as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the US administration, the IMF said the global economy would slow just the same if Mr Trump were to make his temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs permanent. That is because higher tariffs between the US and China, which together account for 43% of the global economy, would have spillover effects on the rest of the world that offset the benefits to individual countries. \"The gains from lower effective tariff rates for those countries that were previously subject to higher tariffs would now be offset by poorer growth outcomes in China and the United States - due to the escalating tariff rates - that would propagate through global supply chains,\" the IMF said. In response, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"This forecast shows that the UK is still the fastest-growing European G7 country. The IMF have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK, through our plan for change. \"The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade.\""

Last week, the court unanimously decided that the definition of a \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". The ruling caused consternation among some politicians and tens of thousands of people protested in central London on Saturday against what they said was a \"betrayal\" of the trans community. Rowling - who has been outspoken against transgender women using single-sex spaces - was among several gender critical campaigners who celebrated the ruling, and has now called on the prime minister and government to apologise for previous statements supporting trans women. \"Women have fought (and are still fighting) the single biggest land grab on their rights in my lifetime,\" she said on social media. \"Some have sacrificed their livelihoods and safety to combat a pernicious ideology that has infiltrated elite institutions, including government.\"  Rowling went on to say women \"have been persecuted, harassed, smeared, roughed up and forced to take employers to court for discrimination,\" and then added: \"Do these politicians have any shame?\" \n                  JK Rowling turned down peerage twice - and would not accept if offered again\n                 \n                  Controversial JK Rowling play TERF 'hit by death threats and producer's mother targeted by online trolls'\n                 \n                  Labour to 'simplify tortuous and degrading' gender transition process if elected, Wes Streeting says\n                 She made the remarks under a graphic of Labour officials which showed their previous comments in support of transgender people - including Sir Keir, who previously said \"trans women are women,\" before Downing Street said on Tuesday that he no longer believes that is true.  The Harry Potter author then asked if \"any of them issue an apology\" for supporting trans rights groups, which she says \"had measurable, severe impact on some of society's most vulnerable women\". \"As another public wave of death threats is issued against women because of the Supreme Court ruling, their silence has become deafening,\" she added, referencing incidents where gender critical campaigners had received threats online. \"I'm just one of millions of women disgusted by the lack of accountability or remorse.

        "Content": "By Mark Thompson, health producer   The family of a dog walker killed by a psychiatric patient say they have been 'treated like dirt' by the NHS after learning his attacker has been granted permission to leave hospital. Lewis Stone was stabbed to death by David Fleet in a random attack in Borth, Wales, in 2019, shortly after Mr Fleet had been released into the community. Mr Stone's family were informed of the update to his care just hours after Sky News aired their first TV interview calling for an internal NHS Trust report into its handling of Fleet's case to be released.  Mr Stone's stepdaughter, Vicki Lindsay, told Sky News: \"As victims, we have been treated disgracefully. \"We still do not know why the killer was released 10 days before he attacked Lewis, who made that decision and why, and who is going to be held accountable for it. \"But as if all that were not bad enough, only six years on, we now get to live knowing that the killer is now allowed out at night time.\" Ms Lindsay also told Sky's Sarah-Jane Mee that \"my biggest fear is that it's going to happen again - I can't sleep at night thinking about other families going through what we've gone through\". \n                  River Cleddau: Families pay tribute to paddleboarding tragedy victims at sentencing hearing\n                 \n                  Paria Veisi: Police investigating disappearance of woman in South Wales find her body - as man charged with murder\n                 \n                  Two arrested on suspicion of murder after disappearance of woman in South Wales\n                 Mr Fleet was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after admitting manslaughter with diminished responsibility. He was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and told psychiatrists that if he had not stabbed Mr Stone, the voices in his head \"were going to kill him\". Patients who have committed a mental health-related homicide can be granted permission to leave their hospital under Section 17 of the Mental Health Act. It is considered part of the patient's rehabilitation and preparation for eventual discharge. What has the MoJ said? A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We understand this decision will be difficult for the Stone family, and our thoughts are with them. \"Any decision to approve access to the community is only made after a thorough risk assessment and with strict safeguards in place.\" The Hywel Dda health board says it does not intend to release an internal report into Fleet's care. Sharon Daniel, the interim executive director for nursing, quality and patient experience, said: \"The duty of candour for patients came into force in Wales in April 2023. \"At the time of this incident and concern, we fulfilled our duties to be open.\" A senior NHS official has called the decision not to release the internal report \"callous and uncaring\". Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said: \"On the face of it, this family has been failed multiple times over. \"Of course, there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the family and the rights of the person detained, but the basic lack of transparency and consideration here undermines the duty of candour.\" Freedom of Information requests made by the victim's support organisation Hundred Families have found that nearly 400 people were killed by former mental health patients between 2018 and 2023. However, this number is expected to be a significant underestimate as a quarter of NHS Mental Health Trusts refused to say how many of their patients went on to kill, as they don't want to risk identifying offenders.

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @laurenvrussell\n It is rare for art to imitate life quite so literally as Conclave does in the wake of the death of Pope Francis. The papal drama, which is based on Robert Harris's book of the same name and directed by Edward Berger, is a fictional take on the closed-door process of appointing a new pontiff, known as a conclave, which is set to begin for real in the Vatican on 5 May. Cardinals from across the world - depicted in the 2024 film by stars including Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci - will descend on Rome, where they will be cut off from the outside world until a new pope is chosen. Pope Francis dies: Follow live updates As with anything given the Hollywood treatment, some elements of the film were added for dramatic effect. The biggest twists (don't worry, you are safe from major spoilers) were read by some as anti-Catholic propaganda. But on the whole, Conclave - which took home four BAFTA Awards, including best film, and best adapted screenplay at the Oscars - now feels bizarrely prescient, having been released months before cardinals first became concerned for Pope Francis's health. And it seems viewers are lapping it up. According to Luminate, which tracks viewership of streaming content, interest spiked 283% on Monday. with 6.9 million minutes viewed. So how accurately does it depict the highly secretive conclave process? The basics On the basics, the film does an accurate job of depicting what we know an actual conclave involves. Cardinals are seen living, eating and socialising together at a version of the purpose-built Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse on the grounds of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City, which is what will happen at the beginning of next month. The film also shows the Sistine Chapel - the famous Vatican hall decorated with the works of Michelangelo - being swept for listening devices before the start of the highly classified morning and evening voting sessions, where cardinals write down the name of the person they wish to become pope. Berger's thriller also accurately depicts cardinals putting their votes inside a sealed container - which in real life is a silver urn. Once all votes have been cast, a Vatican dignitary reads the votes aloud.  If a two-thirds majority has not been reached, the votes are threaded together and burnt with an additive to produce black smoke, only showing white smoke when enough cardinals agree on a candidate to take over the papacy - details also true to the real process.  Internal politics The film shows clear factions within the group of voting cardinals, with some clearly backing particular candidates more than others, largely depending on their beliefs. Cardinal Aldo Bellini (played by Tucci) is depicted as the leading liberal candidate, who seeks to reform the church and follow in the footsteps of the late pope. Whereas Cardinal Goffredo Tedesco (played by Sergio Castellitto) is an Italian who represents the church's conservative wing. It is true that every pope will have their own beliefs, some of which are seen as more liberal or conservative than others. Pope Francis in fact diverged from his predecessors on many contentious issues within the Church. He more openly embraced LGBTQ individuals (although stopped short of full acceptance), decried climate change, and called publicly for a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking to Sky News' Katie Spencer in February after the film's release, Fiennes said it is \"human\" how the cardinals are seen positioning themselves for the top role. \"They're full of pride, ambition, things they've kept hidden and I think that's what's great [is this film] is not cynical and that's what drew me to it.\" But Bill Cavanaugh, a professor of Catholic Studies at DePaul University, told The Guardian that the politicisation of the process in the film is likely \"a little bit exaggerated\". He said cardinals do not often fall \"neatly into progressive and conservative camps\".  The character of Cardinal Lawrence Central to the film is Fiennes' character Cardinal Lawrence, a key dignitary within the Vatican who is tasked with overseeing the fictional conclave. Cardinal Lawrence is depicted in the film, at times, as fulfilling the roles of both the camerlengo, the person who traditionally takes over the Holy See - the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City - after the death of a pope, and the dean of the College of Cardinals. But in reality these are two separate roles. After Pope Francis's death on Monday, Irish-born American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took over the Holy See as camerlengo. The traditional role involves helping to organise the conclave but also includes announcing the pope's death, sealing the papal apartment and breaking the pontiff's fisherman's ring - a sign that there is a vacancy in the Vatican. Cardinal Farrell will also play a key role in the pope's funeral, which will take place in Rome on 26 April. This differs from the dean of the College of Cardinals, who is seen as the \"first among equals\" - essentially the head of the body of cardinals who elect the new pontiff. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re has been in the position since 2020 and will now preside over the general congregation meetings, the gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, which finalises the details of the pontiff's funeral and upcoming conclave. Once a new pontiff is chosen, Cardinal Battista will also be the person to accept the election and ask the newest pope what name he will take. Read more:Pope Francis: A life in picturesFrancis was a champion of the deprivedInside Vatican City at moment of high tension A secret cardinal  One of the film's main characters, Cardinal Vincent Benitez (played by Carlos Diehz), is described as a cardinal in pectore, which refers to the real process of a pope appointing a cardinal in secret. A pope is entitled to keep the name of the newly elected cardinal secret for various reasons, but they are not officially recognised as a cardinal until their name is known publicly. Contrary to what the film depicts, cardinals who have only been named in secret cannot take part in a conclave."

        "Content": "Talks to try to end the Birmingham bin strike that has seen piles of black rubbish bags fill the pavements of the city will resume today. Mounds of waste remain uncollected, while residents have started to take matters into their own hands. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident on 31 March, saying the \"regrettable\" move was taken in response to public health concerns, as picket lines were blocking depots and preventing waste vehicles from collecting rubbish. The all-out strike started on 11 March, but waste collections have been disrupted since January. Here is everything you need to know. How long have workers been striking? More than 350 workers of the Unite union began a series of walkouts in January and decided to escalate into indefinite strike action on 11 March, citing fear over further attacks on their jobs, pay and conditions. The union has said that the removal of the role of waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) role will leave about 150 workers £8,000 worse off - as the number of workers working on bin lorries will be reduced from four to three. The council said it scrapped the WRCO role to put the city's waste operations in line with national practice and to improve its waste collection service. It said all workers have been offered alternative employment at the same pay, driver training or voluntary redundancy and that offer remains open. Three military planners are understood to have been assigned to the city to provide logistical support to Birmingham's council for a short period of time. What are the impacts? Normally, the city's waste teams would make more than half a million collections in a week with 200 vehicles deployed over eight-hour daily shifts. This has been reduced to just over 26,000 since the start of April, according to the latest council figures.  The cost of the ongoing clean-up could cause even more damage to the council, which effectively declared bankruptcy in 2023. One waste management agency told Sky News that totally clearing the backlog could cost more than £200m. The strike has become one of the longest the UK has seen in recent years. Back in 1978-79, the winter of discontent led to rubbish piling up on the streets of London, as the waste collection industry joined other trade unions in demanding larger pay rises in response to government caps. More recently, more than 200 bin workers in the Wirral went on a week-long strike in 2022, eventually securing a 15% pay rise. In the same year, a similar dispute over pay saw rubbish pile up in Edinburgh during the city's busy festival season. Why is it taking so long to settle the dispute? Unite, the union representing striking workers, and the city council have failed to reach an agreement since the strike began in March, with Unite holding firm on the strike action despite pressure from the government.  Members rejected the council's latest offer on 14 April by 97% on 60% turnout, saying it was \"totally inadequate\" and did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. The union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the rejection was \"no surprise\" as \"workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision\". Meanwhile, the government and council said it was a \"significantly improved\" offer. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons on 22 April, communities minister Jim McMahon said \"significant progress\" had been made in dealing with the remaining tonnes of rubbish. He said through \"a concerted effort\" and with the assistance of other councils, private operators and workers, 26,000 tonnes of excess waste had been removed, and the levels were \"approaching normal\". Council leader John Cotton told Sky News' Midlands correspondent Lisa Dowd on 16 April that it \"pains\" him to see pictures of mounds of rubbish and rats feeding off the mess being broadcast around the world. He said the only way for the normal waste collection schedule to resume was for the strike to end - but added the cash-strapped council has \"red lines\" that it will not cross during negotiations. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner visited the city on 10 April and urged the union to end the \"misery and disruption\" by accepting a pay deal. How have residents been affected? Mounting rubbish has led to residents complaining of a risk to public health, with rotting food attracting foxes, cockroaches and rats. Rashid Campbell, a local resident who is part of a volunteer litter-picking team from the Birmingham Central Mosque, told Sky's Shamaan Freeman-Powell that 12 members of his team collected 24 bags of rubbish from two Birmingham streets on Easter Sunday. \"If we don't [litter-pick], we're just going to be drowning in rubbish,\" he said. Latifat Abdul Majed Isah said even in some places where bins have been taken away, the street remained \"dirty, unpalatable and unpleasant to see\".  Joseph McHale, a rat-catcher from Vergo Pest Management, told Sky News at the beginning of April that discarded bin bags provide vermin with \"somewhere to hide, somewhere to feed, somewhere to stay warm\". He said his business had seen a 60% increase in people from Birmingham calling them for help. By declaring a major incident, the council was able to free up an additional 35 vehicles and crews to clear rubbish and fly-tipping from the streets. The limited number of waste trucks are deployed each morning from three depots across the city and cover multiple different routes.  Residents are also able to dispose of household general waste and bulky items at the council's mobile household waste centres, without prebooking. To recycle household items, locals are required to book a slot at one of the council's household recycling centres. Could it spread to other areas? The union's general secretary has warned the strikes could \"absolutely\" spread to other areas. \"If other councils decide to make low-paid workers pay for bad decisions that they did not make, workers paying the price yet again, then absolutely, of course, we all have to take action in those other areas,\" Sharon Graham told LBC. The union's national lead officer Onay Kasab agreed, telling BBC Four: \"Well, if other local authorities look to cut the pay of essential public service workers, then there is the potential for strike action spreading. \"That's why different political choices need to be made.\" Ms Graham also criticised the government, saying it had taken them \"a huge amount of time to get involved in the dispute\"."

It's been 866 years since the papacy of Britain's only ever pontiff (Pope Adrian IV) ended in 1159, and the history of the Catholic Church in the UK since then has been turbulent, with King Henry VIII perhaps the main culprit. There are currently four British cardinals, three of whom are young enough to vote in the conclave. And while none of them are considered odds-on favourites for the top job, it's true that surprises do happen behind the shuttered doors of the secretive congregation of cardinals. So who are the British cardinals, and could one of them be the next pope? Head of the Catholic Church in England and WalesCardinal Vincent Nichols, 79 Born in Crosby near Liverpool, as a child Cardinal Vincent Nichols hoped to be a lorry driver but as a teenager reportedly felt the calling to join the priesthood while watching Liverpool FC. \n                  Tens of thousands of the faithful to pay their respects to the Pope as he lies in state\n                 \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  The Vatican is in mourning for the Pope - and yet St Peter's Square is full of smiles\n                 He has served as the Archbishop of Westminster since 2009, the most senior position in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Before that he was the Archbishop of Birmingham. As cardinal, he is known for leading the church's work tackling human trafficking and modern slavery, for which he received the UN Path to Peace Award. He was criticised by the UK's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which said he \"demonstrated a lack of understanding\" of the impact of abuse and \"seemingly put the reputation of the church first\". Cardinal Nichols, responding to the findings, told Sky News he was \"ashamed at what has happened in the context of the Catholic Church\" and promised to improve the church's response. \"He has quite a reputation,\" says religious historian and writer Catherine Pepinster. \"But I don't think anybody has suggested he should be made pope.\" He himself has appeared to rule himself out of the running as well, telling reporters he was \"too old, not capable\". Read more:Inside Vatican City at moment of high tensionWho will be at the Pope's funeral - and who won't be The Francis allyCardinal Timothy Radcliffe, 79  Born in London in 1945, Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe entered the Dominican Order of preachers in 1965 and was ordained as a priest in 1971. As Master of the Dominican Order - the first Englishman in its 800-year history - he was popular for his speeches around the monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the modern world. He was appointed cardinal just last year, on 7 December 2024, and is viewed as an ally of Pope Francis who could vote for a candidate who would continue his work. He's a popular figure, says Michael Walsh, an expert on Catholic issues, but his age likely rules him out from serious consideration, he added. \"Timothy Radcliffe is an interesting one,\" says Ms Pepinster. \"There are a lot of people who listen to what he says. \"He has a reputation for speaking very well so possibly (he could be considered), but he's nearly 80.\" Like Cardinal Nichols, however, Cardinal Radcliffe appears to have confirmed he does not want the job, telling reporters he believed the Holy Spirit was \"far too wise to even think of me (as pope) for the shortest moment\". The diplomatCardinal Michael Fitzgerald, 87 Made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2019, Michael Fitzgerald has been one of the leading experts on Christian-Muslim relations and served as one of the Catholic Church's delegates to the Arab League of nations. His ministry saw him spend time in Africa and he was appointed titular archbishop of Nepte in Tunisia. He is known for engaging with other faiths and wrote a booklet to help Catholics understand and support Muslims during Ramadan. He also served as apostolic nuncio to Egypt, a diplomatic role similar to an ambassador. At 87, he is too old to vote for the next pope but can still play a key role behind the scenes in discussions before the conclave starts. It's also not technically impossible for him to be elected pontiff himself, despite being too old to cast his own vote, though it isn't likely. The Vatican insiderCardinal Arthur Roche, 75 Born in West Yorkshire in 1950, Cardinal Arthur Roche was ordained a priest at the age of 25 in the Diocese of Leeds. Within the church, some have regarded him as a cleric who was being fast-tracked to hold high office. His time as Bishop of Leeds was not without controversy, both for liturgical reasons and also for his programme of closures and mergers of churches in his diocese. He has held various posts in the Vatican and was made an Archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012, before being made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022. Dr Walsh says that Cardinal Roche isn't viewed as a \"significant character\", while Ms Pepinster suggested that his tenure as a Vatican official could work against him when it comes to cardinals coming in from all over the world.  A British pope? Maybe not this time \"I don't think there's anything against having an English pope at all,\" says Mr Walsh, when asked how Britain was viewed generally. But with all four British cardinals now 75 or older, age may make them unlikely candidates to be pope, he said. \"I think they will look for someone younger,\" he added. There's also a growing consensus that, like with Francis, the next pope should come from beyond Europe, Ms Pepinster added. Many believe that, as the Church has expanded beyond its Catholic heartlands, the next pope should come from elsewhere. However, Sky News understands there are whispers around the Vatican that suggest the next pope will indeed be from Europe, and likely from Italy. Asked about the next pope, Cardinal Radcliffe said: \"I think that we always open ourselves to be surprised. All recent popes have been quite different from each other.\""

        "Content": "By Mark Thompson, health producer   The family of a dog walker killed by a psychiatric patient say they have been 'treated like dirt' by the NHS after learning his attacker has been granted permission to leave hospital. Lewis Stone was stabbed to death by David Fleet in a random attack in Borth, Wales, in 2019, shortly after Mr Fleet had been released into the community. Mr Stone's family were informed of the update to his care just hours after Sky News aired their first TV interview calling for an internal NHS Trust report into its handling of Fleet's case to be released.  Mr Stone's stepdaughter, Vicki Lindsay, told Sky News: \"As victims, we have been treated disgracefully. \"We still do not know why the killer was released 10 days before he attacked Lewis, who made that decision and why, and who is going to be held accountable for it. \"But as if all that were not bad enough, only six years on, we now get to live knowing that the killer is now allowed out at night time.\" Ms Lindsay also told Sky's Sarah-Jane Mee that \"my biggest fear is that it's going to happen again - I can't sleep at night thinking about other families going through what we've gone through\". \n                  River Cleddau: Families pay tribute to paddleboarding tragedy victims at sentencing hearing\n                 \n                  Paria Veisi: Police investigating disappearance of woman in South Wales find her body - as man charged with murder\n                 \n                  Two arrested on suspicion of murder after disappearance of woman in South Wales\n                 Mr Fleet was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after admitting manslaughter with diminished responsibility. He was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and told psychiatrists that if he had not stabbed Mr Stone, the voices in his head \"were going to kill him\". Patients who have committed a mental health-related homicide can be granted permission to leave their hospital under Section 17 of the Mental Health Act. It is considered part of the patient's rehabilitation and preparation for eventual discharge. What has the MoJ said? A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We understand this decision will be difficult for the Stone family, and our thoughts are with them. \"Any decision to approve access to the community is only made after a thorough risk assessment and with strict safeguards in place.\" The Hywel Dda health board says it does not intend to release an internal report into Fleet's care. Sharon Daniel, the interim executive director for nursing, quality and patient experience, said: \"The duty of candour for patients came into force in Wales in April 2023. \"At the time of this incident and concern, we fulfilled our duties to be open.\" A senior NHS official has called the decision not to release the internal report \"callous and uncaring\". Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said: \"On the face of it, this family has been failed multiple times over. \"Of course, there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the family and the rights of the person detained, but the basic lack of transparency and consideration here undermines the duty of candour.\" Freedom of Information requests made by the victim's support organisation Hundred Families have found that nearly 400 people were killed by former mental health patients between 2018 and 2023. However, this number is expected to be a significant underestimate as a quarter of NHS Mental Health Trusts refused to say how many of their patients went on to kill, as they don't want to risk identifying offenders.

He then hit Louisa Palmisano - known as Lulu - while she was walking with her parents, and fled the scene at around 10am before later being arrested. The three-year-old girl died from her injuries in hospital. On Tuesday, Rehman pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in his Mercedes Sprinter van.

Judge Alan Conrad KC heard it was the prosecution's case that Rehman's drug consumption adversely affected his driving. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement that Rehman ignored stop signs and gave the tram driver no time to react before it struck the side of the van, which then mounted the pavement. Abbie Clarke, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: \"It is clear his driving fell far short of what is expected of a competent and careful driver. \"Rehman failed to take responsibility for his actions.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n  Britain's economy will be among the hardest hit by the global trade war and inflation is set to climb, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned – as it slashed its UK growth forecast by a third. In a sobering set of projections, the Washington-based organisation said it was grappling with \"extremely high levels of policy uncertainty\" - and the global economy would slow even if countries manage to negotiate a permanent reduction in tariffs from the US. Echoing earlier warnings about the risks to the global financial system, the IMF said stock markets could fall even more sharply than they did in the aftermath of Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement, when US and UK indices recorded some of their largest one-day falls since the pandemic. It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to meet her US counterpart Scott Bessent at the IMF's spring gathering in Washington this week. She is hoping to negotiate a reduction to the 10% baseline tariff the US president has applied to all UK goods. Steel, aluminium and car exports face an additional 25% tariff. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm Business and economics correspondent The IMF served us an important reminder today: there is no easy way out of the globally integrated economy.  Even if Trump makes his 90-day tariff pause permanent, while the world's two largest economies are at war, there will be spillovers. The US and China account for 43% of the global economy.  If demand in either nation slows, that has ripple effects elsewhere. Tariff or no tariff, exporters to those markets will be hurt. If China redirects its goods elsewhere, that could hurt domestic industries - jobs could be at stake. US and Chinese investors might pause global projects and stock market devaluations could hurt confidence. Against that backdrop, it is difficult to predict with certainty what would happen to the UK but, even if we sweet talk our way out of tariffs, the dark clouds of the global economy are moving in every direction. Britain is open and highly trade-sensitive (our trade-to-GDP ratio is around 65%). Global spillovers will rain on us. Then there are the spillovers from the financial markets. The IMF warned that rising government borrowing costs were weighing on growth.  This is, in part, a reflection of investor unease over the UK's growth and inflation outlook, but it also reflects anxiety over the US trajectory. It's worth bearing all of this in mind if Rachel Reeves emerges from Washington with a deal.\n Yes, a reduction in tariffs could make a big difference to some industries, especially our car manufacturers who are currently grappling with a 25% levy on goods to their largest export market.  However, it would not immunise us from a global slowdown and it would not solve our problems. In fact, many of those problems, right now at least, are homegrown. The IMF said higher inflation because of rising energy bills was causing more damage to the UK than tariffs.  Previous government estimates suggest a US free trade deal would boost UK growth by just 0.16% over the next 15 years. And overall GDP does matter.  The chancellor desperately needs economic growth to support the country's ailing public finances (when the economy grows, so do tax receipts).  Reeves will know better than most that the prize the US has to offer is comparatively small, so she should weigh up the costs of any deal carefully and turn her attention to problems back at home.\n The IMF presented a range of forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook. Its main case looked at the period up to 4 April, after Mr Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries across the world, ratcheting up US protectionism to its highest level in a century. If the president were to revert to this policy framework, global growth would fall from 3.3% last year to 2.8% this year, before recovering to 3% in 2026. In January, the IMF was predicting a rate of 3.3% for both years. Nearly all countries were hit with downgrades, with the US expected to grow by just 1.8% this year, a downgrade of 0.9 percentage points. Mexico was downgraded by 1.7 percentage points, while China and Canada are forecast to slow by 0.6 percentage points and Japan by 0.5 percentage points. The UK economy is expected to grow by just 1.1% this year, down 0.5 percentage points from the 1.6% the IMF was predicting in January. Growth picks up to 1.4% next year, still 0.1 percentage points lower than the January forecast.  Along with recent tariff announcements, the IMF blamed the UK's poor performance on a rise in government borrowing costs, which has in part been triggered by growing unease among investors over the fate of the US economy. When borrowing costs rise, the chancellor has to rein in public spending or raise taxes to meet her fiscal rules. That can weigh on economic growth.  It also pointed to problems in the domestic economy, mainly \"weaker private consumption amid higher inflation as a result of regulated prices and energy costs\". In a blow to the chancellor, the IMF warned that the UK would experience one of the largest upticks in inflation because of utility bill increases that took effect in April. It upgraded its inflation forecast by 0.7 percentage points to 3.1% for 2025, taking it even higher above the Bank of England's 2% target and deepening the dilemma for central bankers who are also grappling with weak growth. Read more:Can Reeves come up trumps in Washington?Trump's tariffs to have major global impact Meanwhile, inflation in the US is likely to jump one percentage point higher than previously forecast to 3% in 2025 on the back of higher tariffs. The IMF forecast period ended on 4 April. That was before the US president paused his reciprocal tariffs on countries across the world while ratcheting up levies on China. In a worrying sign for finance ministers across the world, as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the US administration, the IMF said the global economy would slow just the same if Mr Trump were to make his temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs permanent. That is because higher tariffs between the US and China, which together account for 43% of the global economy, would have spillover effects on the rest of the world that offset the benefits to individual countries. \"The gains from lower effective tariff rates for those countries that were previously subject to higher tariffs would now be offset by poorer growth outcomes in China and the United States - due to the escalating tariff rates - that would propagate through global supply chains,\" the IMF said. In response, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"This forecast shows that the UK is still the fastest-growing European G7 country. The IMF have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK, through our plan for change. \"The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade.\""

LSEG data early on Tuesday had shown an 82% likelihood of a reduction from 4.5% to 4.25% on 8 May. But the doubt disappeared shortly after remarks on inflation by a member of the rate-setting committee. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm  Megan Greene, who voted with the majority for a hold at the last meeting in March, told Bloomberg that US trade tariffs are more likely to push down on UK inflation than raise the pace of price increases. Her argument is essentially that the UK's decision not to respond to Trump's import duties through reciprocal tariffs could make the UK a destination for cheaper goods from Asia and Europe. \"The tariffs represent more of a disinflationary risk than an inflationary risk,\" she said, adding: \"There's a ton of uncertainty around this, but there are both inflationary and disinflationary forces.\" \n                  Bank of England cautious as inflationary tiger stalks weak economy\n                 \n                  Bank of England holds interest rate at 4.5% amid trade war uncertainty\n                 \n                  Inflation rise unlikely to shift Bank of England's stance on interest rates\n                 Ms Greene also said that a recent surge in the value of the pound against the US dollar could also help ease inflation but cautioned that it was early days to determine the likely currency path. The Bank is expecting inflation to rise this year despite a greater than expected dip witnessed in March largely due to the impact of rising energy prices but also the effects of tax rises on businesses from April. Read more:UK will be among 'hardest hit' in trade war  The trade war is widely tipped to weigh on economic activity globally. It poses a problem for the Bank as rising inflation curbs policymakers' ability to help boost growth through interest rate cuts. The LSEG data further showed that financial markets are expecting three Bank of England rate cuts by the year's end. The Bank's counterpart for the euro area has been cutting rates at a faster pace as inflation has allowed, due to the dire performance of its collective economy. Like in the UK, the US central bank has also been taking a cautious approach to rate cuts recently due to the spectre of domestic inflation arising from the Trump trade war.  A perceived failure of the Federal Reserve to address an anticipated growth slowdown, largely arising from the imposition of tariffs, has angered the president. Mr Trump declared last week that the bank's chair, Jay Powell, should be fired and demanded a rate cut \"NOW\" in a social media post. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in Washington this week for a series of meetings but is expected to hold discussions with her US counterpart on a trade agreement to nullify the need for US/UK tariffs. Any rate cut by the Bank of England would be a welcome boost in her push for economic growth in troubled times for the world trade order."

Rowling - who has been outspoken against transgender women using single-sex spaces - was among several gender critical campaigners who celebrated the ruling, and has now called on the prime minister and government to apologise for previous statements supporting trans women. \"Women have fought (and are still fighting) the single biggest land grab on their rights in my lifetime,\" she said on social media. \"Some have sacrificed their livelihoods and safety to combat a pernicious ideology that has infiltrated elite institutions, including government.\"  Rowling went on to say women \"have been persecuted, harassed, smeared, roughed up and forced to take employers to court for discrimination,\" and then added: \"Do these politicians have any shame?\" \n                  JK Rowling turned down peerage twice - and would not accept if offered again\n                 \n                  Controversial JK Rowling play TERF 'hit by death threats and producer's mother targeted by online trolls'\n                 \n                  Labour to 'simplify tortuous and degrading' gender transition process if elected, Wes Streeting says\n                 She made the remarks under a graphic of Labour officials which showed their previous comments in support of transgender people - including Sir Keir, who previously said \"trans women are women,\" before Downing Street said on Tuesday that he no longer believes that is true.  The Harry Potter author then asked if \"any of them issue an apology\" for supporting trans rights groups, which she says \"had measurable, severe impact on some of society's most vulnerable women\". \"As another public wave of death threats is issued against women because of the Supreme Court ruling, their silence has become deafening,\" she added, referencing incidents where gender critical campaigners had received threats online. \"I'm just one of millions of women disgusted by the lack of accountability or remorse. We will not forget.\" Read more:Why the definition of a woman has caused so much controversyWhy Labour LGBT+ WhatsApp messages raise uncomfortable questionsGender ruling will have immediate real-world consequences Last Wednesday's decision was the result of a case brought against the Scottish government by campaign group For Women Scotland, supported by Rowling."

But both will attend the Pope's funeral. After all, Catholics are the second biggest religious group in both countries, with six million in the UK and more than 50 million in the US. Here in the UK, regular church going is reported to be up from 8% to 12%, while the US president said after Pope Francis's death \"we're bringing religion back\" to America.  Pope dies latest - funeral details announced Politicians - and indeed church leaders - take note. Yet Catholics are relatively under-represented in the House of Commons, even more so after last year's Labour landslide when several prominent Catholic Tories were defeated. Surprisingly, Boris Johnson was the UK's first Catholic prime minister, converting after almost two years in Number 10 before marrying his Catholic bride, Carrie Symonds. \n                  Elon Musk says his time working for Donald Trump's administration will 'drop significantly' next month - as Tesla profits sink\n                 \n                  Trump v Powell: What's behind their spat?\n                 \n                  Harvard University sues over $2.2bn funding freeze after rejecting demands from Donald Trump's administration\n                 Tony Blair, who in his early life was a Durham Cathedral chorister, became a Catholic after leaving Downing Street. His wife Cherie is Catholic. That was despite his spin doctor Alastair Campbell notoriously telling an interviewer who asked about Mr Blair's faith: \"We don't do God.\" Gordon Brown was famously a \"son of the manse\" - his father was a Presbyterian minister - and Theresa May's father was a Church of England vicar.  Another former prime minister, David Cameron, on the other hand, rather irreverently once described his faith as coming and going \"like Magic FM in the Chilterns\". But despite Sir Keir regularly being described as an atheist, two senior members of his cabinet, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, are Catholics. \"For me, being Catholic has always been about a wider sense of social justice, social action, the value and worth of every individual,\" Ms Phillipson has said, though she added: \"I part company on issues around abortion, contraception…\" Mr McFadden, the son of Irish Catholic parents, paid tribute to the Pope after his death: \"Pope Francis served until the very end, including this Easter time. May God rest his soul.\"  The most openly religious senior Labour minister is the foreign secretary, David Lammy, who has said Jesus Christ was the inspiration for his politics as well as his lifelong faith. Rachel Reeves and Wes Streeting are practising Anglicans, Jonathan Reynolds chairs a group called Christians on the Left, and Stephen Timms is an evangelical Christian. Among the Conservatives, last year's crushing defeat saw several senior Catholic Tories, including serving and former cabinet ministers, lose their seats. The casualties included cabinet ministers Gillian Keegan, Mark Harper, Therese Coffey, Liam Fox, Damian Green and Jacob Rees-Mogg, along with junior ministers Maria Caulfield and Paul Maynard and senior backbenchers Damian Collins and Daniel Kawczynski.  That leaves just the Father of the House Sir Edward Leigh, former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and former cabinet minister Damian Hinds as the only remaining senior Tory Catholics left in the Commons. Backbencher Danny Kruger, who is leading the fight against the controversial assisted dying legislation, the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, says he's an evangelical Christian. For world leaders like Sir Keir and Mr Trump, however, attending funerals of world statesmen or the great and the good is about more than paying their respects. They are an opportunity for official or unofficial meetings with other world leaders, known in the jargon of international diplomacy as a 'bilateral', a 'brush-by' or a 'walk-and-talk'.

Tens of thousands of people are expected to travel to the Vatican over the next three days to pay their respects to the pontiff, who died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. After his funeral on Saturday morning (9am UK time) there will be a nine-day period of mourning, known as the \"novendiali\", after which the secretive meeting - called the conclave - will begin to elect a new pope. Pope Francis: Follow the latest The conclave to choose his successor must start between 5 and 10 May.

But in 2024, Francis changed the rules and said that only one coffin, a wooden one lined in zinc, should be used. In a break from tradition, he will be buried in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (St Mary Major), according to his wishes.  Following the pope's death, from a stroke and heart failure, world leaders have praised his moral leadership and compassion. On Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer described him as \"a quite remarkable man, and the work and commitment that he put into fairness over so many years, and globally, I think will be a real lasting legacy\". by Barbara Serra, Sky News presenter in Rome An institution like the Catholic Church, which is more than 2,000 years old and has changed leadership 266 times, is well-versed in managing transition. But while the steps that follow a pope's death may be strictly dictated by tradition, the mood is often very different, depending on the pope that is being replaced. The word Catholic means universal, and it's a good reminder of the challenge facing any pope - leading a congregation 1.4 billion strong from all over the world, with differing ideas about if and how change should happen, is far from easy.  The global demographics of Catholicism are changing rapidly. Pope Francis was keenly aware of this.  We often talk about him as progressive, but a more accurate term to describe his papacy would be \"inclusive\".

Once the conclave begins, cardinals vote in secret sessions in the Sistine Chapel. After voting sessions, the ballots are burned in a special stove. Black smoke indicates that no pope has been elected, while white smoke indicates that the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church."

Francis, of course, hailed from Argentina - but could the next pope be British? It's been 866 years since the papacy of Britain's only ever pontiff (Pope Adrian IV) ended in 1159, and the history of the Catholic Church in the UK since then has been turbulent, with King Henry VIII perhaps the main culprit. There are currently four British cardinals, three of whom are young enough to vote in the conclave. And while none of them are considered odds-on favourites for the top job, it's true that surprises do happen behind the shuttered doors of the secretive congregation of cardinals. So who are the British cardinals, and could one of them be the next pope? Head of the Catholic Church in England and WalesCardinal Vincent Nichols, 79 Born in Crosby near Liverpool, as a child Cardinal Vincent Nichols hoped to be a lorry driver but as a teenager reportedly felt the calling to join the priesthood while watching Liverpool FC. \n                  Tens of thousands of the faithful to pay their respects to the Pope as he lies in state\n                 \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  The Vatican is in mourning for the Pope - and yet St Peter's Square is full of smiles\n                 He has served as the Archbishop of Westminster since 2009, the most senior position in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Before that he was the Archbishop of Birmingham. As cardinal, he is known for leading the church's work tackling human trafficking and modern slavery, for which he received the UN Path to Peace Award. He was criticised by the UK's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which said he \"demonstrated a lack of understanding\" of the impact of abuse and \"seemingly put the reputation of the church first\". Cardinal Nichols, responding to the findings, told Sky News he was \"ashamed at what has happened in the context of the Catholic Church\" and promised to improve the church's response. \"He has quite a reputation,\" says religious historian and writer Catherine Pepinster. \"But I don't think anybody has suggested he should be made pope.\" He himself has appeared to rule himself out of the running as well, telling reporters he was \"too old, not capable\".

As Master of the Dominican Order - the first Englishman in its 800-year history - he was popular for his speeches around the monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the modern world. He was appointed cardinal just last year, on 7 December 2024, and is viewed as an ally of Pope Francis who could vote for a candidate who would continue his work. He's a popular figure, says Michael Walsh, an expert on Catholic issues, but his age likely rules him out from serious consideration, he added. \"Timothy Radcliffe is an interesting one,\" says Ms Pepinster. \"There are a lot of people who listen to what he says. \"He has a reputation for speaking very well so possibly (he could be considered), but he's nearly 80.\" Like Cardinal Nichols, however, Cardinal Radcliffe appears to have confirmed he does not want the job, telling reporters he believed the Holy Spirit was \"far too wise to even think of me (as pope) for the shortest moment\". The diplomatCardinal Michael Fitzgerald, 87 Made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2019, Michael Fitzgerald has been one of the leading experts on Christian-Muslim relations and served as one of the Catholic Church's delegates to the Arab League of nations. His ministry saw him spend time in Africa and he was appointed titular archbishop of Nepte in Tunisia. He is known for engaging with other faiths and wrote a booklet to help Catholics understand and support Muslims during Ramadan. He also served as apostolic nuncio to Egypt, a diplomatic role similar to an ambassador. At 87, he is too old to vote for the next pope but can still play a key role behind the scenes in discussions before the conclave starts. It's also not technically impossible for him to be elected pontiff himself, despite being too old to cast his own vote, though it isn't likely. The Vatican insiderCardinal Arthur Roche, 75 Born in West Yorkshire in 1950, Cardinal Arthur Roche was ordained a priest at the age of 25 in the Diocese of Leeds. Within the church, some have regarded him as a cleric who was being fast-tracked to hold high office. His time as Bishop of Leeds was not without controversy, both for liturgical reasons and also for his programme of closures and mergers of churches in his diocese. He has held various posts in the Vatican and was made an Archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012, before being made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022. Dr Walsh says that Cardinal Roche isn't viewed as a \"significant character\", while Ms Pepinster suggested that his tenure as a Vatican official could work against him when it comes to cardinals coming in from all over the world.  A British pope? Maybe not this time \"I don't think there's anything against having an English pope at all,\" says Mr Walsh, when asked how Britain was viewed generally. But with all four British cardinals now 75 or older, age may make them unlikely candidates to be pope, he said. \"I think they will look for someone younger,\" he added. There's also a growing consensus that, like with Francis, the next pope should come from beyond Europe, Ms Pepinster added. Many believe that, as the Church has expanded beyond its Catholic heartlands, the next pope should come from elsewhere. However, Sky News understands there are whispers around the Vatican that suggest the next pope will indeed be from Europe, and likely from Italy. Asked about the next pope, Cardinal Radcliffe said: \"I think that we always open ourselves to be surprised. All recent popes have been quite different from each other.\""

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @laurenvrussell\n It is rare for art to imitate life quite so literally as Conclave does in the wake of the death of Pope Francis. The papal drama, which is based on Robert Harris's book of the same name and directed by Edward Berger, is a fictional take on the closed-door process of appointing a new pontiff, known as a conclave, which is set to begin for real in the Vatican on 5 May. Cardinals from across the world - depicted in the 2024 film by stars including Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci - will descend on Rome, where they will be cut off from the outside world until a new pope is chosen. Pope Francis dies: Follow live updates As with anything given the Hollywood treatment, some elements of the film were added for dramatic effect. The biggest twists (don't worry, you are safe from major spoilers) were read by some as anti-Catholic propaganda. But on the whole, Conclave - which took home four BAFTA Awards, including best film, and best adapted screenplay at the Oscars - now feels bizarrely prescient, having been released months before cardinals first became concerned for Pope Francis's health. And it seems viewers are lapping it up. According to Luminate, which tracks viewership of streaming content, interest spiked 283% on Monday. with 6.9 million minutes viewed. So how accurately does it depict the highly secretive conclave process? The basics On the basics, the film does an accurate job of depicting what we know an actual conclave involves. Cardinals are seen living, eating and socialising together at a version of the purpose-built Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse on the grounds of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City, which is what will happen at the beginning of next month. The film also shows the Sistine Chapel - the famous Vatican hall decorated with the works of Michelangelo - being swept for listening devices before the start of the highly classified morning and evening voting sessions, where cardinals write down the name of the person they wish to become pope. Berger's thriller also accurately depicts cardinals putting their votes inside a sealed container - which in real life is a silver urn. Once all votes have been cast, a Vatican dignitary reads the votes aloud.  If a two-thirds majority has not been reached, the votes are threaded together and burnt with an additive to produce black smoke, only showing white smoke when enough cardinals agree on a candidate to take over the papacy - details also true to the real process.  Internal politics The film shows clear factions within the group of voting cardinals, with some clearly backing particular candidates more than others, largely depending on their beliefs. Cardinal Aldo Bellini (played by Tucci) is depicted as the leading liberal candidate, who seeks to reform the church and follow in the footsteps of the late pope. Whereas Cardinal Goffredo Tedesco (played by Sergio Castellitto) is an Italian who represents the church's conservative wing. It is true that every pope will have their own beliefs, some of which are seen as more liberal or conservative than others. Pope Francis in fact diverged from his predecessors on many contentious issues within the Church. He more openly embraced LGBTQ individuals (although stopped short of full acceptance), decried climate change, and called publicly for a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking to Sky News' Katie Spencer in February after the film's release, Fiennes said it is \"human\" how the cardinals are seen positioning themselves for the top role. \"They're full of pride, ambition, things they've kept hidden and I think that's what's great [is this film] is not cynical and that's what drew me to it.\" But Bill Cavanaugh, a professor of Catholic Studies at DePaul University, told The Guardian that the politicisation of the process in the film is likely \"a little bit exaggerated\". He said cardinals do not often fall \"neatly into progressive and conservative camps\".  The character of Cardinal Lawrence Central to the film is Fiennes' character Cardinal Lawrence, a key dignitary within the Vatican who is tasked with overseeing the fictional conclave. Cardinal Lawrence is depicted in the film, at times, as fulfilling the roles of both the camerlengo, the person who traditionally takes over the Holy See - the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City - after the death of a pope, and the dean of the College of Cardinals. But in reality these are two separate roles. After Pope Francis's death on Monday, Irish-born American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took over the Holy See as camerlengo. The traditional role involves helping to organise the conclave but also includes announcing the pope's death, sealing the papal apartment and breaking the pontiff's fisherman's ring - a sign that there is a vacancy in the Vatican. Cardinal Farrell will also play a key role in the pope's funeral, which will take place in Rome on 26 April. This differs from the dean of the College of Cardinals, who is seen as the \"first among equals\" - essentially the head of the body of cardinals who elect the new pontiff. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re has been in the position since 2020 and will now preside over the general congregation meetings, the gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, which finalises the details of the pontiff's funeral and upcoming conclave. Once a new pontiff is chosen, Cardinal Battista will also be the person to accept the election and ask the newest pope what name he will take. Read more:Pope Francis: A life in picturesFrancis was a champion of the deprivedInside Vatican City at moment of high tension A secret cardinal  One of the film's main characters, Cardinal Vincent Benitez (played by Carlos Diehz), is described as a cardinal in pectore, which refers to the real process of a pope appointing a cardinal in secret. A pope is entitled to keep the name of the newly elected cardinal secret for various reasons, but they are not officially recognised as a cardinal until their name is known publicly. Contrary to what the film depicts, cardinals who have only been named in secret cannot take part in a conclave."

Kristi Noem was eating at a Washington DC burger restaurant with family when a man in a face covering sat near her table and stole her purse, according to two people familiar with the theft. Officials confirmed the theft to Sky News' US partner NBC News on Monday. The cabinet secretary was carrying $3,000 (£2,243) in cash because \"her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren\", Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NBC. \"She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.\" Just before 8pm, a man wearing an N-95 mask walked into the restaurant and up a few stairs to where Ms Noem was eating dinner.

At least two on-duty members of the US Secret Service were in the restaurant - between Ms Noem and the front doors - according to a source who witnessed the meal. They said the restaurant wasn't very busy at the time. The purse also contained credit cards, blank cheques, her passport, driver's licence and a set of keys. It's unclear whether Ms Noem was specifically targeted - and investigators are looking into whether the man knew who the purse belonged to. When asked about the incident, Ms Noem said: \"I don't think I can comment on it yet. It's not resolved yet.\" She said the Secret Service was aware but said she hadn't spoken to agency personnel about what happened.

        "Content": " At least 26 tourists have been killed after gunmen opened fire at a beauty spot in Indian-controlled Kashmir, police say. Officers described the shooting near the resort town of Pahalgam on Tuesday as a \"terror attack\" and blamed it on militants fighting Indian rule. Two senior officers said at least four gunmen fired at dozens of tourists from close range on Tuesday. Analysis: Kashmir terror attack one of the worst in recent times At least three dozen others were injured, with many in serious condition, according to the officers, who said most of the tourists killed were Indian. Gunmen fired on tourists visiting Baisaran meadow, about three miles (5km) from Pahalgam. Omar Abdullah, the region's main elected official, said: \"This attack is much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years. \"The death toll is still being ascertained.\" A manhunt for the attackers has been launched by police and soldiers. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"strongly\" condemned the attack. He wrote on X: \"Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest. All possible assistance is being provided to those affected. \"Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice... they will not be spared! Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakeable and it will get even stronger.\" The atrocity coincided with US vice president JD Vance's four-day visit to India. President Donald Trump said India has the full support of the US following the deadly shooting. He wrote on Truth Social: \"Deeply disturbing news out of Kashmir. The United States stands strong with India against Terrorism. We pray for the souls of those lost, and for the recovery of the injured. \"Prime Minister Modi, and the incredible people of India, have our full support and deepest sympathies.\" Hundreds of tourists flock to Baisaran meadow - a top sightseeing destination surrounded by snow-capped mountains - every day. Kashmir has drawn thousands of summer visitors after militant violence eased in recent years. Amit Shah, India's home affairs minister, said he was \"anguished by the terror attack\". He added on X: \"Those involved in this dastardly act of terror will not be spared, and we will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences.\" Mr Shah said he had briefed Mr Modi and was heading to Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, for an \"urgent security meeting with all the agencies\". Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a key Kashmiri resistance leader, condemned what he described as a \"cowardly attack on tourists\". He said on X: \"Such violence is unacceptable and against the ethos of Kashmir which welcomes visitors with love and warmth.

It comes after first-quarter profits at Tesla sank as the company grapples with falling sales, partly due to President Trump's tariffs. As a special government employee, Mr Musk was limited to 130 days in his role at DOGE, which is primarily aimed at slashing federal spending. In April, he dismissed reports suggesting he would leave his role in the coming months, calling the rumours \"fake news\". But the cuts, which included axing government jobs, have divided the country and prompted a backlash against his company, including protests and attacks on Tesla showrooms. Donald Trump labelled the vandals \"terrorists\".  Tesla said on Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 71% to $409m (£306.77m) from $1.39bn (£1.04bn) in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues were also well below forecasts, dropping 9% to $19.3bn (£14.5bn) between January and March.

Mr Musk's role as chief executive of the company was among the most common questions shareholders were asking about in a question-and-answer portal ahead of an investor call on Tuesday evening. As well as his role at the top of Tesla, he is also the CEO of space exploration company SpaceX and owns social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk has 'lost focus' An early Tesla investor Ross Gerber said in a recent interview with Sky's Business Live that Mr Musk had lost his focus and was now too \"divisive\".

        "Content": "By Mark Stone, US correspondent, and Paul Kelso, business and economics correspondent  Tensions between US President Donald Trump and US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell have hit a new high.  But why has the pair's relationship deteriorated so badly? And what are the issues behind their spat? Sky News correspondents Mark Stone and Paul Kelso take a closer look... Mark Stone, US correspondent The feud between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell is as predictable as it is serious. Jerome 'Jay' Powell holds one of the most powerful and influential positions in the world. As chair of the US Federal Reserve, he wields the levers which control global economic stability, such is the power of the US dollar. The position comes with a huge amount of autonomy. Fed independence is seen to be paramount. For a full-control-obsessed president like Donald Trump, that's a problem. Read more:UK 'will be among hardest hit' by trade warHow Trump changed his mind on tariffs The American president cannot tell the Federal Reserve chair what to do - and that is by design. But Trump could fire Powell if he chose to - unprecedented as that would be. You only need to look at the market reaction to Trump's language about Powell for a hint at how his firing would impact the global economy. \"Powell's termination can't come fast enough,\" Trump said last week. On Monday, he called Powell a \"major loser\". This schoolyard language has global economic implications. The markets - including the all-important bond markets - reacted with sell-offs at the end of the day. Powell is a registered Republican. Trump hired him as Fed Reserve Chair during his first term but the relationship became fractious, fast. Yet Trump did not remove him back then. The position has a four-year term and President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term in 2022. That gives him until 2026. Trump sees Powell increasingly as a barrier to his agenda. Trump's 'burn hot' economy ideology does not align with Powell's more pragmatic centrist ideology. Read more: Trump's tariffs could affect globalisationDHL suspends some shipments to US He is unable to influence and bend Powell in the way that he has done with his own cabinet and members of Congress. In his first term, Trump was talked out of removing Powell. But we know this second term is wholly different. He was talked away from the edge on many issues during his first term. This time, in many areas, he's jumped. Remember, Trump forced out two FBI directors - one in each term - because neither was considered to be loyal enough. The FBI, like the Federal Reserve, is considered traditionally to be independent.  Of course, the Federal Reserve has a profound global influence in a way the FBI, as an institution, does not. The fed chair, with his role in setting interest rates and so much more, is arguably the last powerful, independent pillar of the economic policy structure in the US. Congress has largely devolved its role to Trump and the executive branch, as illustrated by his tariff plans (which Congress could have influenced but chose not to). Donald Trump's removal of Jay Powell and replacement with a compliant loyalist could fundamentally shake the global economy. Paul Kelso, business and economics correspondent Donald Trump's disparagement of Jay Powell as a \"major loser\" is not the first time he has insulted the man he appointed as chair of the US Federal Reserve in 2018. The president appears to have had buyer's remorse from the moment he approved the former investment banker to fill a post that is fundamental to US economic stability. Trump was calling for the Fed to cut rates and stimulate the economy long before he was re-elected, but online barbs have more consequence when fired from the Oval Office than the campaign trail. Equivalent to the Governor of the Bank of England, the chair of the Federal Reserve ultimately directs US monetary policy, including the setting of short-term interest rates, with the aim of maintaining high employment and stable inflation. That makes Powell a crucial figure amid the chaos and incoherence of Trump's economic policy, which in less than 90 days has shattered the certainties that made America the world's largest economy, and the dollar the global reserve currency. The market reaction to Trump's venting against Powell, and briefing that his administration is considering ways to remove him from office, suggests investors fear it will make a bad situation worse. As traders returned from the Easter weekend with the president's criticism of Powell ringing in their ears, the \"Trump slump\" deepened. US stocks and the dollar fell, while yields on US Treasuries - the mechanism by which the government borrows money - rose, indicative of falling bond prices as investors dumped US debt. Gold prices, meanwhile, hit a record $3,500 an ounce as investors piled into what remains the pre-eminent \"safe haven\" asset in times of uncertainty. The combination of falling equity, currency and bond prices is a toxic trifecta more usually associated with emerging economies in political crisis, not the mighty United States. We saw something similar here in 2022, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's unfunded tax cuts, presented without an independent assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility, caused a run on the gilt market. Then it was the Bank of England that stepped in to stabilise the bond market.  What's happening in the US is both bigger and more consequential. Trump's tariff program, seemingly imposed and withdrawn by presidential whim, has already proved disastrous for market sentiment, with expectations of higher inflation and lower growth, at home and globally, set to be confirmed by the International Monetary Fund in Washington this week. Powell and the Fed are among the few reliable actors in this drama, with markets betting their next meeting in May will see rates held, in part because of inflationary policy made in the White House. The prospect of Powell being replaced by a more pliant figure hand-picked by Trump would pull another block from the wobbling Jenga tower of US economic credibility. The independence of the Fed is one of the foundations of American stability, an assumption that underpins the $29 trillion Treasuries market that makes the world's debt go round. If investors large and small, state and private, fear that the US is not good for that debt, it could be calamitous for American pre-eminence and the global economy. Powell's term ends in 2026 and he believes he cannot be removed by presidential decree. That does not mean he will not face more pressure to stand aside."

        "Content": " Harvard University is suing Donald Trump's administration after it rejected a list of demands from the White House and had $2.2bn (£1.6bn) of government funding frozen. It is the first major hurdle the Trump administration faces in its crackdown on \"inappropriate\" ideologies on campuses. The Ivy League institution, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is accused of ideological bias and allowing antisemitism during campus protests last year against Israel's war in Gaza. The Trump administration, which began a review of $9bn (£6.7bn) in federal grants for Harvard in March, had demanded the university screen international students for those \"hostile to the American values\" and the end of all diversity, equality and inclusion programmes. The university's president Alan Garber has remained defiant and rejected those and other reforms, prompting the US president to question whether the university should lose its tax-exempt status. Mr Trump accused the institution of pushing what he called \"political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\" in a post on Truth Social. Harvard has seen student-led protests in recent days calling on the institution to resist interference by the federal government. \n                  Elon Musk says his time working for Donald Trump's administration will 'drop significantly' next month - as Tesla profits sink\n                 \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  Trump v Powell: What's behind their spat?\n                 Harvard's lawsuit, filed in Boston, described the research funding freeze as \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violating its First Amendment rights. \"The government has not - and cannot - identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,\" the court documents revealed. On Monday, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields issued a defiant response to the lawsuit: \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. \"Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\" The Trump administration has also paused some funding for universities including Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Northwestern and Brown over the campus protests. But protesters, including some Jewish groups, say their criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza is wrongly associated with antisemitism. Mr Garber said the institution would continue to fight hate and fully comply with anti-discrimination laws. Trump's college crackdown For the Trump administration, Harvard's pushback is the first major hurdle in its crackdown on colleges it says are hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. On the campaign trail last year, Mr Trump vowed to pursue federal cuts for schools that push \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content\". Six of the seven universities impacted by the administration's cuts are Ivy League schools. Princeton University was recently hit with $4m (£3m) in cuts in part for promoting what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described as \"climate anxiety\" through a lab that develops atmospheric and oceanic models. The university launched a lawsuit with three other institutions against the Department of Energy over the cuts.

The American Council on Education, a non-profit organisation with more than 1,600 member colleges and universities, supported the legal action by Harvard. \"It has been clear for weeks that the administration's actions violated due process and the rule of law. We applaud Harvard for taking this step.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Elon Musk has said the time he spends with Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will \"drop significantly\" from May and he will allocate more time to Tesla. It comes after first-quarter profits at Tesla sank as the company grapples with falling sales, partly due to President Trump's tariffs. As a special government employee, Mr Musk was limited to 130 days in his role at DOGE, which is primarily aimed at slashing federal spending. In April, he dismissed reports suggesting he would leave his role in the coming months, calling the rumours \"fake news\". But the cuts, which included axing government jobs, have divided the country and prompted a backlash against his company, including protests and attacks on Tesla showrooms. Donald Trump labelled the vandals \"terrorists\".  Tesla said on Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 71% to $409m (£306.77m) from $1.39bn (£1.04bn) in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues were also well below forecasts, dropping 9% to $19.3bn (£14.5bn) between January and March.

Mr Musk's role as chief executive of the company was among the most common questions shareholders were asking about in a question-and-answer portal ahead of an investor call on Tuesday evening. As well as his role at the top of Tesla, he is also the CEO of space exploration company SpaceX and owns social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk has 'lost focus' An early Tesla investor Ross Gerber said in a recent interview with Sky's Business Live that Mr Musk had lost his focus and was now too \"divisive\". There has been no clear sign of improvement at Tesla as much-awaited updates on making affordable cars and developing driverless technology left some questions unanswered.

Production of Tesla's self-driving robotaxi, named Cybercab, is scheduled to start in 2026. Uncertainty was also evident in the outlook statement, which pointed to the harm tariffs could pose to the business. While Teslas are made in the US, there are also factories in China and Germany.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n  Britain's economy will be among the hardest hit by the global trade war and inflation is set to climb, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned – as it slashed its UK growth forecast by a third. In a sobering set of projections, the Washington-based organisation said it was grappling with \"extremely high levels of policy uncertainty\" - and the global economy would slow even if countries manage to negotiate a permanent reduction in tariffs from the US. Echoing earlier warnings about the risks to the global financial system, the IMF said stock markets could fall even more sharply than they did in the aftermath of Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement, when US and UK indices recorded some of their largest one-day falls since the pandemic. It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to meet her US counterpart Scott Bessent at the IMF's spring gathering in Washington this week. She is hoping to negotiate a reduction to the 10% baseline tariff the US president has applied to all UK goods. Steel, aluminium and car exports face an additional 25% tariff. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm Business and economics correspondent The IMF served us an important reminder today: there is no easy way out of the globally integrated economy.  Even if Trump makes his 90-day tariff pause permanent, while the world's two largest economies are at war, there will be spillovers. The US and China account for 43% of the global economy.  If demand in either nation slows, that has ripple effects elsewhere. Tariff or no tariff, exporters to those markets will be hurt. If China redirects its goods elsewhere, that could hurt domestic industries - jobs could be at stake. US and Chinese investors might pause global projects and stock market devaluations could hurt confidence. Against that backdrop, it is difficult to predict with certainty what would happen to the UK but, even if we sweet talk our way out of tariffs, the dark clouds of the global economy are moving in every direction. Britain is open and highly trade-sensitive (our trade-to-GDP ratio is around 65%). Global spillovers will rain on us. Then there are the spillovers from the financial markets. The IMF warned that rising government borrowing costs were weighing on growth.  This is, in part, a reflection of investor unease over the UK's growth and inflation outlook, but it also reflects anxiety over the US trajectory. It's worth bearing all of this in mind if Rachel Reeves emerges from Washington with a deal.\n Yes, a reduction in tariffs could make a big difference to some industries, especially our car manufacturers who are currently grappling with a 25% levy on goods to their largest export market.  However, it would not immunise us from a global slowdown and it would not solve our problems. In fact, many of those problems, right now at least, are homegrown. The IMF said higher inflation because of rising energy bills was causing more damage to the UK than tariffs.  Previous government estimates suggest a US free trade deal would boost UK growth by just 0.16% over the next 15 years. And overall GDP does matter.  The chancellor desperately needs economic growth to support the country's ailing public finances (when the economy grows, so do tax receipts).  Reeves will know better than most that the prize the US has to offer is comparatively small, so she should weigh up the costs of any deal carefully and turn her attention to problems back at home.\n The IMF presented a range of forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook. Its main case looked at the period up to 4 April, after Mr Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries across the world, ratcheting up US protectionism to its highest level in a century. If the president were to revert to this policy framework, global growth would fall from 3.3% last year to 2.8% this year, before recovering to 3% in 2026. In January, the IMF was predicting a rate of 3.3% for both years. Nearly all countries were hit with downgrades, with the US expected to grow by just 1.8% this year, a downgrade of 0.9 percentage points. Mexico was downgraded by 1.7 percentage points, while China and Canada are forecast to slow by 0.6 percentage points and Japan by 0.5 percentage points. The UK economy is expected to grow by just 1.1% this year, down 0.5 percentage points from the 1.6% the IMF was predicting in January. Growth picks up to 1.4% next year, still 0.1 percentage points lower than the January forecast.  Along with recent tariff announcements, the IMF blamed the UK's poor performance on a rise in government borrowing costs, which has in part been triggered by growing unease among investors over the fate of the US economy. When borrowing costs rise, the chancellor has to rein in public spending or raise taxes to meet her fiscal rules. That can weigh on economic growth.  It also pointed to problems in the domestic economy, mainly \"weaker private consumption amid higher inflation as a result of regulated prices and energy costs\". In a blow to the chancellor, the IMF warned that the UK would experience one of the largest upticks in inflation because of utility bill increases that took effect in April. It upgraded its inflation forecast by 0.7 percentage points to 3.1% for 2025, taking it even higher above the Bank of England's 2% target and deepening the dilemma for central bankers who are also grappling with weak growth. Read more:Can Reeves come up trumps in Washington?Trump's tariffs to have major global impact Meanwhile, inflation in the US is likely to jump one percentage point higher than previously forecast to 3% in 2025 on the back of higher tariffs. The IMF forecast period ended on 4 April. That was before the US president paused his reciprocal tariffs on countries across the world while ratcheting up levies on China. In a worrying sign for finance ministers across the world, as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the US administration, the IMF said the global economy would slow just the same if Mr Trump were to make his temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs permanent. That is because higher tariffs between the US and China, which together account for 43% of the global economy, would have spillover effects on the rest of the world that offset the benefits to individual countries. \"The gains from lower effective tariff rates for those countries that were previously subject to higher tariffs would now be offset by poorer growth outcomes in China and the United States - due to the escalating tariff rates - that would propagate through global supply chains,\" the IMF said. In response, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"This forecast shows that the UK is still the fastest-growing European G7 country. The IMF have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK, through our plan for change. \"The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade.\""

Banking sources said a definitive deal with a buyer could be announced as soon as Wednesday morning.

One banker said the company had had a number of approaches from suitors following the maelstrom caused by recent volatility in currency markets, with the pound gaining strongly against the Euro and the dollar in recent weeks. President Trump's series of tariff announcements has shaken financial markets across the world, with trillions of dollars wiped off equity prices in recent weeks. \"The company also has the support of its principal liquidity provider and is in discussions with them regarding ways to further strengthen its liquidity position given the ongoing macro uncertainty, noting the likelihood of continued volatility in the currency markets and the associated exposure presented within the Company's FX forward and options books,\" Argentex's statement on Tuesday morning added. \"In the event that the volatility in currency markets worsens materially, then the company's financial liquidity position, if not strengthened in the near term, would be significantly stretched.\" IFX is based in London, with offices in Dubai and Warsaw. It is run by chief executive Will Marwick, its former chief operating officer. The identity of the other parties which had expressed an interest in buying Argentex was unclear.

LSEG data early on Tuesday had shown an 82% likelihood of a reduction from 4.5% to 4.25% on 8 May. But the doubt disappeared shortly after remarks on inflation by a member of the rate-setting committee. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm  Megan Greene, who voted with the majority for a hold at the last meeting in March, told Bloomberg that US trade tariffs are more likely to push down on UK inflation than raise the pace of price increases. Her argument is essentially that the UK's decision not to respond to Trump's import duties through reciprocal tariffs could make the UK a destination for cheaper goods from Asia and Europe. \"The tariffs represent more of a disinflationary risk than an inflationary risk,\" she said, adding: \"There's a ton of uncertainty around this, but there are both inflationary and disinflationary forces.\" \n                  Bank of England cautious as inflationary tiger stalks weak economy\n                 \n                  Bank of England holds interest rate at 4.5% amid trade war uncertainty\n                 \n                  Inflation rise unlikely to shift Bank of England's stance on interest rates\n                 Ms Greene also said that a recent surge in the value of the pound against the US dollar could also help ease inflation but cautioned that it was early days to determine the likely currency path. The Bank is expecting inflation to rise this year despite a greater than expected dip witnessed in March largely due to the impact of rising energy prices but also the effects of tax rises on businesses from April. Read more:UK will be among 'hardest hit' in trade war  The trade war is widely tipped to weigh on economic activity globally. It poses a problem for the Bank as rising inflation curbs policymakers' ability to help boost growth through interest rate cuts. The LSEG data further showed that financial markets are expecting three Bank of England rate cuts by the year's end. The Bank's counterpart for the euro area has been cutting rates at a faster pace as inflation has allowed, due to the dire performance of its collective economy. Like in the UK, the US central bank has also been taking a cautious approach to rate cuts recently due to the spectre of domestic inflation arising from the Trump trade war.  A perceived failure of the Federal Reserve to address an anticipated growth slowdown, largely arising from the imposition of tariffs, has angered the president. Mr Trump declared last week that the bank's chair, Jay Powell, should be fired and demanded a rate cut \"NOW\" in a social media post. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in Washington this week for a series of meetings but is expected to hold discussions with her US counterpart on a trade agreement to nullify the need for US/UK tariffs. Any rate cut by the Bank of England would be a welcome boost in her push for economic growth in troubled times for the world trade order."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The new owner of WH Smith’s high street arm is drawing up plans which could result in the closure of nearly a quarter of the stores operated by Hobbycraft, the arts and crafts chain. Sky News has learnt that Modella Capital, a private investment firm which specialises in taking over troubled retailers, is preparing to launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) at Hobbycraft as soon as Wednesday. People close to the proposals said that nine of its shops would be closed, with the loss of roughly 100 jobs, and that 18 more would remain open only if negotiations with landlords over rent cuts concluded successfully. A further 97 stores will remain unaffected by the CVA, the people added, protecting 1,800 jobs. Money latest: Trump's 'major loser' attack on Fed chair sparks market alarm If the talks with landlords do not progress as envisaged and the 18 affected stores are also earmarked for closure, at least 150 more redundancies could be triggered based on Hobbycraft's average number of employees per store. Some job losses are also expected at the company's head office and distribution operations, according to insiders. The Hobbycraft CVA is expected to be launched shortly before Modella also pursues a restructuring at The Original Factory Shop (TOFS), the discount chain it acquired just two months ago. One industry source speculated that as many as between 30 and 40 TOFS outlets could close, resulting in hundreds more layoffs. The dual restructuring processes will raise questions about whether Modella plans a similar cull of shops and workers at WH Smith, which it has said will be renamed TG Jones following the takeover. In a statement, a Modella spokesman said: \"Modella Capital is absolutely committed to bricks and mortar retail, at a time when the sector is coming under increasing pressure. \"[Modella] understands that high streets provide a vital service to consumers, are an essential source of employment and are key to the future success of local economies. \"Modella Capital believes that many retailers can thrive on the high street; particularly those with a distinctive offer and a loyal customer base. \"Where necessary, Modella Capital has the skills and experience to restructure retailers that require it, in order to ensure they create profitable, ongoing businesses that will continue to serve communities and employ thousands of people across the UK.\" FRP, the professional services firm, is overseeing the Hobbycraft CVA, while Interpath Advisory is working on the equivalent process at TOFS. CVAs - a widely used tool in the retail and hospitality sectors in recent years - are frequently utilised to facilitate store closures and rent cuts from landlords. Modella bought Hobbycraft, which was founded in 1995, from the private equity firm Bridgepoint last summer."

        "Content": "\n          Money live reporter\n              @JournoJess97\n Every Tuesday in our Money blog, we answer questions about your financial problems or consumer disputes. This week, a reader asked what her rights were after Ryanair refused to pay her expenses after cancelling her flight. Elaine asked: \"My flight from Cork to La Rochelle was cancelled due to a storm. I had to book a hotel and fly to a different destination, and Ryanair is refusing to pay for all my expenses. Are you able to help me?\" Our Money live reporter Jess Sharp says... When Elaine got in touch with Money, she also told us that there wasn't another flight to her destination for four days, so she opted to fly to a different destination on an earlier flight (but still two days later). She said a member of Ryanair staff had recommended that she take a taxi into Cork's city centre and stay in a specific hotel because the one at the airport was full, and reassured her that the airline would cover her additional costs. She said she submitted a claim for the following, totalling €435.70: Ryanair responded to her claim, saying that it had been deemed \"expensive\" by its policy and that it would only reimburse her €273.70. \n                  Elon Musk says his time working for Donald Trump's administration will 'drop significantly' next month - as Tesla profits sink\n                 \n                  UK economy will be among hardest hit by global trade war, IMF warns\n                 \n                  British Steel to end consultation on up to 2,700 redundancies after government intervention\n                 Ryanair's response My first port of call was to go to Ryanair to see what it had to say. A spokesperson confirmed Elaine's flight had been cancelled due to Storm Ashley and that all passengers were notified and advised of their options to either change their flight free of charge or to receive a full refund. \"Ryanair has not 'ignored' this passenger - on 23 Oct, Ms Foster submitted an expense claim to the value of €435.70 and was reimbursed for all reasonable receipted expenses (€273.70) submitted,\" they said. \"This was confirmed to Ms Foster via email, in which we explained why the remainder of her expenses did not qualify for reimbursement.\" The amount refunded was for part of Elaine's hotel stay (€240), €13.70 for meals and €20 in taxi expenses. In an email to Elaine, Ryanair said it couldn't refund the meals she had at the hotel as they were not itemised, and the other €20 taxi costs were not covered by Ryanair's policy. Passenger rights, what counts as 'reasonable' and making sure you always get everything in writing Under EU regulation EU261, passengers whose flights are cancelled are entitled to rights of care, including \"reasonable\" expenses for overnight accommodation and meals. However, it does not give a definition of what is considered to be \"reasonable\" - leaving consumers in a tough spot when it comes to fighting back. Ryanair did not give me an answer when I asked its spokesperson how it defined the term. Consumer expert Helen Dewdney offered her expertise, saying the airline must provide customers with food, drinks, access to communications, a hotel and travel to and from it, if a flight is delayed or cancelled overnight. She explained that \"reasonable comes down to what the average person would deem as reasonable\", and this could be backed up with evidence showing hotel availability and typical prices for the area. Read more from this series:'I was kicked off plane for having nut allergy''Parking fine went to my old address and I missed court date - what should I do?' Passengers must do their best to keep costs down but \"if the airline has suggested the hotel, then this cost should be accepted. It is always a good idea to get anything like this in writing in case there are issues later,\" she added. Dewdney advised Elaine to explain to the airline that this was what was recommended by the staff, with a name if this was taken and the time of day the advice was given. \"You will need evidence of all costs, but it doesn't have to be a receipt; it could be a credit card bill, which would clearly show the meal bought on the date and time of the stay,\" Dewdney said. If this fails, she suggested complaining to Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary by obtaining his email address from ceoemail.com. \"Although he won't respond personally, it will get the matter escalated and provide more evidence should you need to take the matter further,\" she said. If Ryanair continues not to budge The Irish Aviation Authority's website states: \"If your air carrier does not resolve the complaint, then you should forward it for the attention of the appropriate enforcement body. \"To make a complaint, register with the IAA's online customer platform (MySRS). Once registered, complete the online complaint form.\" If this doesn't work, Dewdney said, another option could be to seek redress through an approved alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service. ADR can help resolve consumer disputes without court action being taken through means such as mediation and arbitration. Different airlines are signed up to different schemes - Ryanair is a member of AviationADR - and you can file a complaint with them here. If all that fails, Dewdney said there was always the option of taking the matter to the small claims court. Conclusion The law does provide protection for consumers in these kinds of cases but what this example shows us is that evidence is key - show that you have kept costs down, clearly itemise all expenses and get any promises made in writing. Failure to do so gives wriggle room for the likes of Ryanair - meaning you may have to show a lot of perseverance to get the recourse you feel you are due. This feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about. Submit your dilemma or consumer dispute via:"

        "Content": " Harvard University is suing Donald Trump's administration after it rejected a list of demands from the White House and had $2.2bn (£1.6bn) of government funding frozen. It is the first major hurdle the Trump administration faces in its crackdown on \"inappropriate\" ideologies on campuses. The Ivy League institution, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is accused of ideological bias and allowing antisemitism during campus protests last year against Israel's war in Gaza. The Trump administration, which began a review of $9bn (£6.7bn) in federal grants for Harvard in March, had demanded the university screen international students for those \"hostile to the American values\" and the end of all diversity, equality and inclusion programmes. The university's president Alan Garber has remained defiant and rejected those and other reforms, prompting the US president to question whether the university should lose its tax-exempt status. Mr Trump accused the institution of pushing what he called \"political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\" in a post on Truth Social. Harvard has seen student-led protests in recent days calling on the institution to resist interference by the federal government. \n                  Elon Musk says his time working for Donald Trump's administration will 'drop significantly' next month - as Tesla profits sink\n                 \n                  Pope's funeral an opportunity for world leaders to do more than pay their respects - the PM was always bound to go\n                 \n                  Trump v Powell: What's behind their spat?\n                 Harvard's lawsuit, filed in Boston, described the research funding freeze as \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violating its First Amendment rights. \"The government has not - and cannot - identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,\" the court documents revealed. On Monday, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields issued a defiant response to the lawsuit: \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. \"Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\" The Trump administration has also paused some funding for universities including Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Northwestern and Brown over the campus protests. But protesters, including some Jewish groups, say their criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza is wrongly associated with antisemitism. Mr Garber said the institution would continue to fight hate and fully comply with anti-discrimination laws. Trump's college crackdown For the Trump administration, Harvard's pushback is the first major hurdle in its crackdown on colleges it says are hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. On the campaign trail last year, Mr Trump vowed to pursue federal cuts for schools that push \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content\". Six of the seven universities impacted by the administration's cuts are Ivy League schools. Princeton University was recently hit with $4m (£3m) in cuts in part for promoting what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described as \"climate anxiety\" through a lab that develops atmospheric and oceanic models. The university launched a lawsuit with three other institutions against the Department of Energy over the cuts. Read more from Sky News:Turkish student detained at universityIs Trump's deportation policy firm or cruel?Anti-Trump protests sweep America More than 100 university, college and scholarly society presidents published a joint statement on Tuesday opposing the Trump administration's treatment of higher education institutions after Harvard said the administration was threatening its independence. The American Council on Education, a non-profit organisation with more than 1,600 member colleges and universities, supported the legal action by Harvard. \"It has been clear for weeks that the administration's actions violated due process and the rule of law. We applaud Harvard for taking this step.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Sir Keir Starmer says he doesn't believe in God and US President Donald Trump rarely speaks of religion. But both will attend the Pope's funeral. After all, Catholics are the second biggest religious group in both countries, with six million in the UK and more than 50 million in the US. Here in the UK, regular church going is reported to be up from 8% to 12%, while the US president said after Pope Francis's death \"we're bringing religion back\" to America.  Pope dies latest - funeral details announced Politicians - and indeed church leaders - take note. Yet Catholics are relatively under-represented in the House of Commons, even more so after last year's Labour landslide when several prominent Catholic Tories were defeated. Surprisingly, Boris Johnson was the UK's first Catholic prime minister, converting after almost two years in Number 10 before marrying his Catholic bride, Carrie Symonds. \n                  Elon Musk says his time working for Donald Trump's administration will 'drop significantly' next month - as Tesla profits sink\n                 \n                  Trump v Powell: What's behind their spat?\n                 \n                  Harvard University sues over $2.2bn funding freeze after rejecting demands from Donald Trump's administration\n                 Tony Blair, who in his early life was a Durham Cathedral chorister, became a Catholic after leaving Downing Street. His wife Cherie is Catholic. That was despite his spin doctor Alastair Campbell notoriously telling an interviewer who asked about Mr Blair's faith: \"We don't do God.\" Gordon Brown was famously a \"son of the manse\" - his father was a Presbyterian minister - and Theresa May's father was a Church of England vicar.  Another former prime minister, David Cameron, on the other hand, rather irreverently once described his faith as coming and going \"like Magic FM in the Chilterns\". But despite Sir Keir regularly being described as an atheist, two senior members of his cabinet, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, are Catholics. \"For me, being Catholic has always been about a wider sense of social justice, social action, the value and worth of every individual,\" Ms Phillipson has said, though she added: \"I part company on issues around abortion, contraception…\" Mr McFadden, the son of Irish Catholic parents, paid tribute to the Pope after his death: \"Pope Francis served until the very end, including this Easter time. May God rest his soul.\"  The most openly religious senior Labour minister is the foreign secretary, David Lammy, who has said Jesus Christ was the inspiration for his politics as well as his lifelong faith. Rachel Reeves and Wes Streeting are practising Anglicans, Jonathan Reynolds chairs a group called Christians on the Left, and Stephen Timms is an evangelical Christian. Among the Conservatives, last year's crushing defeat saw several senior Catholic Tories, including serving and former cabinet ministers, lose their seats. The casualties included cabinet ministers Gillian Keegan, Mark Harper, Therese Coffey, Liam Fox, Damian Green and Jacob Rees-Mogg, along with junior ministers Maria Caulfield and Paul Maynard and senior backbenchers Damian Collins and Daniel Kawczynski.  That leaves just the Father of the House Sir Edward Leigh, former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and former cabinet minister Damian Hinds as the only remaining senior Tory Catholics left in the Commons. Backbencher Danny Kruger, who is leading the fight against the controversial assisted dying legislation, the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, says he's an evangelical Christian. For world leaders like Sir Keir and Mr Trump, however, attending funerals of world statesmen or the great and the good is about more than paying their respects. They are an opportunity for official or unofficial meetings with other world leaders, known in the jargon of international diplomacy as a 'bilateral', a 'brush-by' or a 'walk-and-talk'. So expect plenty of these on Saturday. Read more:Is the Conclave movie accurate?Pope Francis: A life in picturesFrancis was a champion of the deprivedInside Vatican City at moment of high tension After all, besides Sir Keir and the US president, the leaders of France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, the European Commission and indeed Ukraine's President Zelenskyy have already announced they're going. It could be one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders outside an official G7, G20, EU or other international summit. So, of course, Sir Keir and President Trump will be there."

Commenting publicly for the first time on last Wednesday's decision, the prime minister said the judgment provided \"clarity\" that \"a woman is an adult female\".

Read more: Why the definition of a woman has caused so much controversy  Asked if he believed a transwoman should be considered a woman, Sir Keir told ITV West Country: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\" Later on Tuesday, after addressing troops at a Wiltshire Army base, he said: \"I welcome the court's decision and ruling. \"I think it's very important that we've now got real clarity, which is going to be really helpful for, I think, everybody going forward, particularly those that have to deal with putting in place guidance.\" The prime minister said the decision will enable the government and service providers to ensure guidance \"is in the right place\". \"And to reaffirm something that I long for, which is about safe spaces for women,\" he added. \"That's always been really important. And so that's contained within the ruling as well. So I welcome all of it.\" Sir Keir's position appears to have evolved over the years. In 2020, he said the LGBT+ Labour campaign had his full support, including a pledge to introduce a gender self-declaration process and to support that \"trans women are women, that trans men are men\". Then in September 2021, Sir Keir went up against one of his MPs, Rosie Duffield (now an independent after quitting the party) when he said it was \"not right\" to say only women have a cervix. But in 2023, Labour performed a U-turn when it ruled out introducing a self-ID system. Last Wednesday's decision was the result of a case brought against the Scottish government by campaign group For Women Scotland. Scotland's social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said on Tuesday the Scottish government accepts the judgement. \"It is a significant legal ruling and it is right that we take time to consider it,\" she told MSPs in Holyrood. She added that it was \"important to recognise the tone and the temperature of the surrounding debate\"."

        "Content": "A former judge has been appointed to chair a public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks two years ago. Her Honour Deborah Taylor, a former circuit court judge who retired in 2022, was appointed by Lord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood on Tuesday to \"undertake a thorough, independent assessment of the events that culminated in these brutal attacks\". She will provide recommendations to prevent similar incidents and will have the power to examine all agencies involved, including the Crown Prosecution Service and Nottinghamshire Police. Students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and 65-year-old caretaker Ian Coates were killed by Valdo Calocane in June 2023. He then attempted to kill three other people in a spate of attacks in Nottingham. Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in January last year after admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility and attempted murder. Prosecutors accepted a plea of manslaughter after experts agreed his schizophrenia meant he was not fully responsible for his actions. The families said recently he had \"got away with murder\". In a statement, the Lord Chancellor said: \"The bereaved families and survivors of the Nottingham Attack, who have suffered so much, deserve to know how these horrific attacks were able to happen. \"I am pleased to appoint Her Honour Deborah Taylor as the Chair of this inquiry. \"She brings deep experience to the role, and I know she will undertake a fearless and thorough examination of the facts.\" While a judge at Southwark Crown Court, Ms Taylor sentenced former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker to two-and-a-half years in prison in 2022 over hiding £2.5m of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts when bankrupt. She also sentenced Aravindan Balakrishnan, a Maoist cult leader who raped followers and held his daughter captive for three decades, to 23 years in prison in 2016.

It comes after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) also announced it would reopen a probe into Leicestershire Police after allegations of assault by Calocane on two co-workers in May 2023."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @laurenvrussell\n It is rare for art to imitate life quite so literally as Conclave does in the wake of the death of Pope Francis. The papal drama, which is based on Robert Harris's book of the same name and directed by Edward Berger, is a fictional take on the closed-door process of appointing a new pontiff, known as a conclave, which is set to begin for real in the Vatican on 5 May. Cardinals from across the world - depicted in the 2024 film by stars including Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci - will descend on Rome, where they will be cut off from the outside world until a new pope is chosen. Pope Francis dies: Follow live updates As with anything given the Hollywood treatment, some elements of the film were added for dramatic effect. The biggest twists (don't worry, you are safe from major spoilers) were read by some as anti-Catholic propaganda. But on the whole, Conclave - which took home four BAFTA Awards, including best film, and best adapted screenplay at the Oscars - now feels bizarrely prescient, having been released months before cardinals first became concerned for Pope Francis's health. And it seems viewers are lapping it up. According to Luminate, which tracks viewership of streaming content, interest spiked 283% on Monday. with 6.9 million minutes viewed. So how accurately does it depict the highly secretive conclave process? The basics On the basics, the film does an accurate job of depicting what we know an actual conclave involves. Cardinals are seen living, eating and socialising together at a version of the purpose-built Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse on the grounds of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City, which is what will happen at the beginning of next month. The film also shows the Sistine Chapel - the famous Vatican hall decorated with the works of Michelangelo - being swept for listening devices before the start of the highly classified morning and evening voting sessions, where cardinals write down the name of the person they wish to become pope. Berger's thriller also accurately depicts cardinals putting their votes inside a sealed container - which in real life is a silver urn. Once all votes have been cast, a Vatican dignitary reads the votes aloud.  If a two-thirds majority has not been reached, the votes are threaded together and burnt with an additive to produce black smoke, only showing white smoke when enough cardinals agree on a candidate to take over the papacy - details also true to the real process.  Internal politics The film shows clear factions within the group of voting cardinals, with some clearly backing particular candidates more than others, largely depending on their beliefs. Cardinal Aldo Bellini (played by Tucci) is depicted as the leading liberal candidate, who seeks to reform the church and follow in the footsteps of the late pope. Whereas Cardinal Goffredo Tedesco (played by Sergio Castellitto) is an Italian who represents the church's conservative wing. It is true that every pope will have their own beliefs, some of which are seen as more liberal or conservative than others. Pope Francis in fact diverged from his predecessors on many contentious issues within the Church. He more openly embraced LGBTQ individuals (although stopped short of full acceptance), decried climate change, and called publicly for a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking to Sky News' Katie Spencer in February after the film's release, Fiennes said it is \"human\" how the cardinals are seen positioning themselves for the top role. \"They're full of pride, ambition, things they've kept hidden and I think that's what's great [is this film] is not cynical and that's what drew me to it.\" But Bill Cavanaugh, a professor of Catholic Studies at DePaul University, told The Guardian that the politicisation of the process in the film is likely \"a little bit exaggerated\". He said cardinals do not often fall \"neatly into progressive and conservative camps\".  The character of Cardinal Lawrence Central to the film is Fiennes' character Cardinal Lawrence, a key dignitary within the Vatican who is tasked with overseeing the fictional conclave. Cardinal Lawrence is depicted in the film, at times, as fulfilling the roles of both the camerlengo, the person who traditionally takes over the Holy See - the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City - after the death of a pope, and the dean of the College of Cardinals. But in reality these are two separate roles. After Pope Francis's death on Monday, Irish-born American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took over the Holy See as camerlengo. The traditional role involves helping to organise the conclave but also includes announcing the pope's death, sealing the papal apartment and breaking the pontiff's fisherman's ring - a sign that there is a vacancy in the Vatican. Cardinal Farrell will also play a key role in the pope's funeral, which will take place in Rome on 26 April. This differs from the dean of the College of Cardinals, who is seen as the \"first among equals\" - essentially the head of the body of cardinals who elect the new pontiff. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re has been in the position since 2020 and will now preside over the general congregation meetings, the gathering of the cardinals currently in Rome, which finalises the details of the pontiff's funeral and upcoming conclave. Once a new pontiff is chosen, Cardinal Battista will also be the person to accept the election and ask the newest pope what name he will take.

A pope is entitled to keep the name of the newly elected cardinal secret for various reasons, but they are not officially recognised as a cardinal until their name is known publicly. Contrary to what the film depicts, cardinals who have only been named in secret cannot take part in a conclave."
