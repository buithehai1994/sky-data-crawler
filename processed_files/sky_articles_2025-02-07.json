        "Content": "Hamas has released the names of three Israeli hostages it says it will release on Saturday in the fifth such swap of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. The hostages are Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, Hamas armed wing spokesperson Abu Obeida said in a Telegram post. An Israeli official confirmed Israel had received the three names from Hamas. In return for the captives' release, Hamas said it expects 183 Palestinian prisoners to be released. Both Mr Ami, 56, and Mr Sharabi, 52, were taken from Kibbutz Be'eri during the 7 October attack. The cross-border attack saw around 1,200 Israelis killed and around 250 people taken hostage. Mr Levy, 34, was abducted from the Nova music festival. Of the Palestinian prisoners being freed, 18 have been serving life sentences, 54 were serving long sentences and the vast majority, 111, were detained in Gaza during the war. Eli Sharabi Mr Sharabi's wife Lianne Sharabi was born in Bristol. She, along with their children, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were killed in the 7 October attack. His brother Yossi was also killed after being taken hostage. In a statement after news he would be released was announced, Mr Sharabi's lawyers said: \"The Sharabi family has already lost too much,\". It added: \"It is long past time to bring Eli home.\" Or Levy Mr Levy was captured by militants from a bomb shelter near the Nova music festival. His wife Einav was killed during the 7 October attack. Their son Almog, a toddler, is staying with his grandparents. Mr Levy is from the city of Rishon Lezion, where he worked as a computer programmer.  Some of Mr Levy's family previously spoke about his kidnapping and the death of his wife. Speaking around Hanukkah last year, his brother Michael Levy told Sky News's Yousra Elbagir: \"I have three little girls but it won't be the same. Hanukkah is a happy holiday - you light candles, you sing and eat all sorts of things but for us it is not a real holiday without Or.\" Ohad Ben Ami Mr Ben Ami, a father of three, was taken hostage with his wife Raz, who was released during the brief ceasefire period in November. His daughter Ella Ben Ami previously spoke to Sky News about missing her dad Mr Ami, as she pleaded for his release. \"On the eve of Christmas, on the 24 December, it will be his birthday, and I don't want to celebrate it without him,\" she told Sky News in 2023. Ms Ami was previously one of the first to tell the world what happened on 7 October, calling an Israeli TV channel while hiding.  Row over aid access Earlier on Friday, Hamas accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire accord and held off announcing the names of the Israeli hostages until the deadline had passed. The militant group claimed Israel delayed the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying food and other humanitarian supplies agreed under the truce deal and held back all but a fraction of the tents and mobile homes needed to provide people shelter in the devastated enclave. \"This demonstrates clear manipulation of relief and shelter priorities,\" Hamas said in a statement.  ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ COGAT, the Israeli military agency that is overseeing the aid deliveries into Gaza, denied the accusation. It added Israel would \"not tolerate violations by Hamas\". The claims and counter-claims highlight the fragility and uncertainty of the ceasefire.  This has been heightened by US President Donald Trump recently saying the US could take over Gaza and move the Palestinian population out. Israel's air and ground war in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced the majority of the strip's population.

Five Thai hostages have also been released. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been released in exchange, often returning to large crowds. Work on the second stage of the agreement, aimed at the release of around 60 male hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, has begun. An Israeli negotiating team was expected to fly to Doha on Saturday, according to media reports."

        "Content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Donald Trump \"let's do a deal\" as he offered the US a partnership over Ukraine's stores of rare earth and minerals. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he wanted Ukraine to supply the US with critical resources in exchange for financial support in its war with Russia. In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"If we are talking about a deal, then let's do a deal, we are only for it.\" While emphasising that Kyiv was not proposing \"giving away\" its resources, he said he was open to a mutually beneficial partnership to develop them jointly.

Showing a map of Ukraine's mineral deposits, he then said Russia currently has control of less than 20% of the country's mineral resources - but that includes about half its rare earth deposits. \"Putin is not just grabbing them [minerals] along with the land, he is already thinking about how to get other partners in his alliance - North Korea, Iran... and he will give them access,\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"This is very rich land. This does not mean that we are giving it away to anyone, even to strategic partners. We are talking about partnership... \"Let's develop this together, make money, and most importantly, it's about the security of the Western world.\" The Ukrainian president added that Kyiv and the White House were discussing the idea of using the country's underground gas storage sites to store American liquefied natural gas, calling it \"very interesting\". He also said he would like to discuss the US having priority when it came to rebuilding Ukraine, saying it would amount to \"a lot of money for business\". 'Not accepting Russia's ultimatums' He also insisted that Mr Trump must meet with him before he meets with the Russian president, \"otherwise it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine\". He added: \"I don't know what compromises can be discussed at the negotiating table, we have not reached that point... \"It is important for people to understand that Ukraine is negotiating, not accepting ultimatums from Russia.\" He also stressed Ukraine's need for security guarantees from its allies as part of any settlement. It comes as Mr Trump said he may meet with Mr Zelenskyy in the White House as early as next week. The two last met in New York in September last year. Mr Trump also repeated his interest in meeting the Russian president with whom he said he always had a \"good relationship\". Speaking to reporters while meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Mr Trump said: \"I'd like to see it end, just on a human basis. I'd like to see that end. It's a ridiculous war.\" Read more:Ukraine peacekeeping force without US troops would be 'mistake'Lammy promises Â£55m for Ukraine during visit Mr Zelenskyy also told Reuters in his interview that thousands of North Korean soldiers have now returned to fight Kyiv's forces in the Kursk region of Russia.

The commander, who went by the codename \"Puls,\" claimed the forces had been seen blowing themselves up with grenades rather than risk capture."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       Apple has reportedly been ordered by the UK government to allow it access to encrypted data stored by the company's users worldwide in its cloud service. At the moment, only the Apple account holder can access such data - not even the US technology giant can see it. Apple, which makes iPhones, iPads and iMacs, has been issued with a Technical Capability Notice (TCN), the Washington Post and BBC are reporting. This order, which does not get published, is said to require a blanket ability for the government to view people's encrypted data - both in the UK and abroad. The Home Office will not confirm or deny the existence of the order. Apple has been approached for comment. Getting technology companies to break encryption has long been a contentious issue in the UK government. Ministers have argued they want to use it for purposes like protecting children, identifying criminals and keeping the public safe. \n                  Apple suspends AI-generated news summaries after criticism over misleading notifications\n                 \n                  Apple AI feature 'must be revoked' over notifications misleading users, say journalists\n                 \n                  Severance star Adam Scott on balancing Hollywood fame with family life: 'Everything's a challenge at some point'\n                 What are the concerns? Opponents say it is a breach of privacy. They also highlight the risk to whistleblowers and journalists, and point out that any tool the government has to break into people's information has a danger of being hijacked by bad actors. There are also concerns that, if implemented, the UK's order could lead nations like China to force Western companies to break their users' privacy. 'Advanced Data Protection' On Apple products, users have the option to use Advanced Data Protection (ADP). The UK government's demand applies to all content stored using ADP, which means certain data can only be decrypted by the user. Apple promises that even a cloud data breach would not make the information readable. Users are also told that Apple cannot see the data due to the end-to-end encryption used to share the information. End-to-end encryption means that messages and data sent between two devices can only be read by the person they are sent to - and are scrambled if anyone else tries to intercept or access them. The debate stretches as far back as 2017, when then home secretary Amber Rudd stated that \"I don't need to understand how encryption works\" to want it broken. The order from the UK government was made under the UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016, according to The Washington Post. The act says the orders can be applied to companies outside the UK. There are avenues for Apple to appeal against the TCN, but this process would not be made public. Read more:Encryption 'put children at risk'A 'disaster' for counter-terrorism The Labour government has been outspoken in its desire to target social media and technology companies while in power. This includes recently trumpeting its plans to be the first country in the world to create a new AI sexual abuse offence to punish those generating and facilitating the creation of AI child sexual abuse images. And Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has criticised social media companies for not being fast enough to take down videos previously viewed by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. Last year, Apple provided written evidence to MPs on its many oppositions to the Investigatory Powers Act and TCNs. It noted that the law gives the UK government the power to \"act as the world's regulator\" of security technology - something which could put it at odds with authorities like the European Union and the United States. Order would 'undermine human rights' The American company also said that an order to force decryption would \"undermine fundamentally human rights\" and potentially put the UK at odds with the European Court of Human Rights. \"There is no reason why the [UK government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption,\" Apple said. It added: \"Moreover, any attempt by the [secretary of state] to use its extraterritorial powers to compel technology companies to weaken encryption technology will only strengthen the hands of malicious actors who seek to steal and exploit personal data for nefarious purposes.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ A spokesperson for privacy and civil liberty campaign group Big Brother Watch said: \"We urge the UK government to immediately rescind this draconian order and cease attempts to employ mass surveillance in lieu of the targeted powers already at their disposal.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\""

        "Content": "A teenager has been found guilty of killing a 15-year-old boy in east London after he confessed to a girl he knew online while she was in Nando's. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey on Friday. He had chased and stabbed former friend Pharrell Garcia once in the heart with a multi-tool pocketknife in Stellman Close, Hackney, on 23 July last year. After Pharrell collapsed in the street, the killer fled and threw away the knife, the court heard. Members of the public and paramedics had tried to save the 15-year-old, but he died at the scene. The teenager then told a girl he knew online that he killed Pharrell by \"accident\".

He had also messaged his mother after the attack to say he could not go home, to remove certain items from their home, and to ask if he could go to Portugal. The teenager admitted stabbing the 15-year-old but claimed it was in self-defence after getting the knife off him - a claim detectives and the jury disputed. In a prepared statement he gave to police after his arrest, the teenager said Pharrell \"approached me on Tuesday and told me, again, he had a problem with me. He pulled a knife out of his sock and went to attack me\". \"I was scared for my life and acted instinctively to defend myself.\" The jury found the teenager not guilty of murder. Judge Philip Katz KC remanded him into custody ahead of sentencing on 17 April."

The 42-year-old, who has not been named, has been accused of giving the applicants an \"unfair advantage\" in the Life in the UK test, the Home Office said. It is alleged she completed the tests at a number of centres across the UK, disguising herself and doctoring ID documents to evade detection from authorities. The test is a requirement for anyone seeking to obtain indefinite leave to remain or naturalisation as a British citizen. It consists of 24 questions aimed at proving the applicant has sufficient knowledge of British values, history, and society. The Home Office said fraudsters completing the test for others could result in people being wrongly granted the right to remain in the country without proper due diligence, \"potentially putting the public at risk\".

Josephine Maurice, 61, of Enfield in north London, has been charged with 15 counts of fraud by false representation and two counts of possession of false documents in connection to the incident. She is currently remanded in custody."

        "Content": "A small plane which crashed in western Alaska with 10 people on board has been found and the US Coast Guard (USCG) says there were no survivors. The Bering Air flight left Unalakleet at 2.38pm on Thursday but contact was lost less than an hour later, the firm's operations director David Olson said. On Saturday, in a post on X, the coastguard said: \"USCG has ended its search for the missing plane after the aircraft was located approx 34 miles southeast of Nome. 3 individuals were found inside and reported to be deceased. \"The remaining 7 people are believed to be inside the aircraft but are currently inaccessible due to the condition of the plane. Our heartfelt condolences are with those affected by this tragic incident.\" The Cessna 208B Grand Caravan - carrying a pilot and nine adult passengers - was flying across Norton Sound when tracking site Flightradar24 reported it at 5,300ft before contact was lost. It was travelling from Unalakleet, a community of about 690 people in western Alaska, to Nome, a gold rush town just south of the Arctic Circle. The flight time is normally just under an hour. Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the US Coast Guard, said rescuers were searching the aircraft's last known location by helicopter when they spotted the wreckage. They lowered two rescue swimmers to investigate. In a post on Facebook, Nome's fire department issued an update: \"The Nome Search and Rescue Team is spooling up with assistance from the Alaska Air National Guard with recovery efforts. \"From reports we have received, the crash was not survivable. Our thoughts are with the families at this time.\" On Friday, Lieutenant Benjamin McIntyre-Coble, from the Alaskan coastguard, explained that the plane suffered a rapid loss of altitude and speed, according to radar data, but did not expand on the potential cause.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       Apple has reportedly been ordered by the UK government to allow it access to encrypted data stored by the company's users worldwide in its cloud service. At the moment, only the Apple account holder can access such data - not even the US technology giant can see it. Apple, which makes iPhones, iPads and iMacs, has been issued with a Technical Capability Notice (TCN), the Washington Post and BBC are reporting. This order, which does not get published, is said to require a blanket ability for the government to view people's encrypted data - both in the UK and abroad. The Home Office will not confirm or deny the existence of the order. Apple has been approached for comment. Getting technology companies to break encryption has long been a contentious issue in the UK government. Ministers have argued they want to use it for purposes like protecting children, identifying criminals and keeping the public safe. \n                  Apple suspends AI-generated news summaries after criticism over misleading notifications\n                 \n                  Apple AI feature 'must be revoked' over notifications misleading users, say journalists\n                 \n                  Severance star Adam Scott on balancing Hollywood fame with family life: 'Everything's a challenge at some point'\n                 What are the concerns? Opponents say it is a breach of privacy. They also highlight the risk to whistleblowers and journalists, and point out that any tool the government has to break into people's information has a danger of being hijacked by bad actors. There are also concerns that, if implemented, the UK's order could lead nations like China to force Western companies to break their users' privacy. 'Advanced Data Protection' On Apple products, users have the option to use Advanced Data Protection (ADP). The UK government's demand applies to all content stored using ADP, which means certain data can only be decrypted by the user. Apple promises that even a cloud data breach would not make the information readable. Users are also told that Apple cannot see the data due to the end-to-end encryption used to share the information. End-to-end encryption means that messages and data sent between two devices can only be read by the person they are sent to - and are scrambled if anyone else tries to intercept or access them. The debate stretches as far back as 2017, when then home secretary Amber Rudd stated that \"I don't need to understand how encryption works\" to want it broken. The order from the UK government was made under the UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016, according to The Washington Post. The act says the orders can be applied to companies outside the UK. There are avenues for Apple to appeal against the TCN, but this process would not be made public. Read more:Encryption 'put children at risk'A 'disaster' for counter-terrorism The Labour government has been outspoken in its desire to target social media and technology companies while in power. This includes recently trumpeting its plans to be the first country in the world to create a new AI sexual abuse offence to punish those generating and facilitating the creation of AI child sexual abuse images. And Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has criticised social media companies for not being fast enough to take down videos previously viewed by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. Last year, Apple provided written evidence to MPs on its many oppositions to the Investigatory Powers Act and TCNs. It noted that the law gives the UK government the power to \"act as the world's regulator\" of security technology - something which could put it at odds with authorities like the European Union and the United States. Order would 'undermine human rights' The American company also said that an order to force decryption would \"undermine fundamentally human rights\" and potentially put the UK at odds with the European Court of Human Rights. \"There is no reason why the [UK government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption,\" Apple said. It added: \"Moreover, any attempt by the [secretary of state] to use its extraterritorial powers to compel technology companies to weaken encryption technology will only strengthen the hands of malicious actors who seek to steal and exploit personal data for nefarious purposes.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ A spokesperson for privacy and civil liberty campaign group Big Brother Watch said: \"We urge the UK government to immediately rescind this draconian order and cease attempts to employ mass surveillance in lieu of the targeted powers already at their disposal.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\""

An immigration tribunal heard how Dominic Hampshire displayed a \"lack of common sense\" when he agreed to give evidence for Yang Tengbo, who was banned from the UK in 2023 due to security concerns. The court heard how the intelligence services had contacted Mr Hampshire about Mr Yang back in 2022. Mr Yang was a \"close confidante\" of the Duke of York. The pair worked together but also met socially, including at events held at royal residences. Mr Yang helped set up Pitch@Palace China, a branch of the duke's scheme to help young entrepreneurs. Judges banned Mr Yang from the UK, saying his association with a senior royal had made Prince Andrew \"vulnerable\" and posed a threat to national security.

Detective Sergeant Richard Mills, 42, was found guilty of assaulting the women while working at Greater Manchester Police (GMP) on two separate occasions over the past 10 years. He had worked at the force since 2006. Judge David Swinnerton said during sentencing that the officer was \"enabled\" and \"emboldened\" by a culture in the lower ranks of the force where \"you don't report bobbies\". He added on Friday the women had their \"mental health, careers and their lives blighted\" by Mills's actions. The judge then said: \"When police officers commit offences like this, or any other sort of offence, you undermine every other officer because it does damage public trust in police.\" Liverpool Crown Court heard Mills, a father-of-two whose wife was in the public gallery during sentencing, describe the office environment within the GMP as one where a number of people joked with \"sexualised banter\".

The victim had told others about the incident but did not support an investigation into Mills at the time. He was then given a verbal warning and no misconduct hearing took place. On a separate occasion, a second victim said she \"froze\" when Mills put her hand on his crotch while in a room with other people. \"That added to her sense of shame and embarrassment that you felt enabled to do that in that room believing she would not say anything,\" the judge said. In a statement, read by prosecutor Robert Dudley, one of the victims told the court: \"How do you call the police about the police? \"I used to be such a happy, smiley and bubbly character and I feel the complete opposite.

He added: \"He would say that what he saw as acceptable banter at the time he now appreciates was unacceptable, particularly in the modern environment, and he will change his approach.\" Speaking after the sentencing, GMP Detective Superintendent David Jones said that Mills \"gravely abused his position of trust and authority within the force\". He then praised the victims, adding: \"Their tenacity and strength shown throughout our investigation and legal proceedings is commendable and should be recognised as the driving force behind reaching today's outcome, whereby Mills is starting a jail term as a convicted sex offender.\""

At the event at East Scryne Farm, he met local members of the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs.

He said: \"I love the countryside and I love farming as well. \"And I am conscious that it's an area that needs maybe a little bit of support and understanding that there is access and support out there for young farmers, as well as making sure we are breaking down any taboos and stigmas around mental health. \"Because I think in the farming world it's maybe not talked about as much as in other sectors - and yet we know it exists. \"So, I particularly wanted to hear a little bit today about how all of you felt and hear it from the horse's mouth whether we're getting better at talking about it, whether you feel the support is out there, what your recollections and feelings are about rural isolation and mental health.\" The Duchy of Cornwall and Prince William launched a new mental health strategy for Duchy tenants in 2023 designed to prioritise farmers' mental health and de-stigmatise the issue within the sector. Stephanie Berkeley, manager of the Farm Safety Foundation (also known as Yellow Wellies), said the charity is a small organisation and it was wonderful to have the prince take an interest. She said: \"The young farmers are so enthusiastic and hard-working and they should be celebrated, so it's lovely to have someone like the prince come and listen. \"He was very interested in everything that the young farmers wanted to talk about.\""

        "Content": "Gino D'Acampo has \"firmly\" denied allegationsÂ of inappropriate and intimidating behaviour on the sets of his TV shows. The chef's actions, over a period of more than 12 years, were described by dozens of people as \"unacceptable\", \"distressing\" and \"horrendous\", according to an investigation by ITV News. Denying all the allegations, D'Acampo told ITV he \"would not do anything that I thought would upset or distress anyone\". He added: \"I am a father, husband... the suggestion that I have acted in an improper way against is deeply upsetting.\" With over 25 years of presenting experience, D'Acampo is one of the most recognisable chefs on TV. He also has numerous cookbooks and restaurants to his name. But how has his career unfolded? Who is he? Born in Torre del Greco, Naples, in southern Italy, D'Acampo learned to cook from his grandfather, according to his official website. He went on to train at Luigi De Medici catering college in Florence and made the move to London at the age of 18. His love of food led to him starting and co-owning Bonta Italia in 2003, which imports Italian produce to restaurants, supermarkets and manufacturers in the UK. This led to him appearing as a guest on the Good Food television channel and since 2009, he has been a regular on cooking segments on ITV's This Morning. Using what his website describes as \"cheeky wit\", the chef soon became known for his risquÃ© comments and sexual innuendos. Also in 2009 the chef headed into the Australian jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, where he was crowned king of the jungle, narrowly beating TV personality Kim Woodburn. Family life D'Acampo has been married to Jessica Stellina Morrison for nearly 25 years. The pair reportedly met when they were teenagers while they were both working at a restaurant in Marbella. They have three children together - Luciano, Rocci, and Mia. Television career Proving popular with viewers, D'Acampo started to host his own cookery shows, including Gino's Italian Escape, which over a number of series, sees him travelling around Italy in search of authentic recipes from his homeland. He also paired up with model Melanie Sykes for ITV's Lets Do Lunch in 2011, which saw him cook three recipes each episode while a celebrity guest be interviewed. In 2017, D'Acampo went head-to-head with fellow chef Gordon Ramsay and maitre d'hotel Fred Sirieix to produce a festive menu for people who work in the emergency services. The trio were a hit and reunited for travel and food series Gordon, Gino and Fred's Ultimate Road Trip. Subsequent series of the show saw them travel across America, Greece and Spain. Most recently, the trio became a duo, with D'Acampo and Sirieix returning for Gino & Fred: Emission Impossible, which sees the pair visit Austria to track down sustainable produce and immerse themselves in environmentally friendly lifestyles. In 2020, the chef became the face of long-running game show Family Fortunes, after it was revived after 17 years. The latest series, which was filmed in 2023, is not currently scheduled for broadcast and ITV has no plans to work with D'Acampo, ITV News reported. Restaurants and cookbooks Away from presenting, D'Acampo has seven restaurants across the UK including in Manchester, London, Liverpool and Leeds. Read more from Sky News:Buffy The Vampire Slayer is backTaylor Swift's Eras Tour was 'excruciating' on her body and mind Throughout his career he has published 20 cookbooks, ranging from one directly aimed at getting children into cooking and another which uses recipes that can all be made using an air fryer. The chef also partnered with supermarket chain Asda in 2021 to release a range of 75 products including cookware, homeware, and appliances."

        "Content": "Hamas has released the names of three Israeli hostages it says it will release on Saturday in the fifth such swap of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. The hostages are Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, Hamas armed wing spokesperson Abu Obeida said in a Telegram post. An Israeli official confirmed Israel had received the three names from Hamas. In return for the captives' release, Hamas said it expects 183 Palestinian prisoners to be released. Both Mr Ami, 56, and Mr Sharabi, 52, were taken from Kibbutz Be'eri during the 7 October attack. The cross-border attack saw around 1,200 Israelis killed and around 250 people taken hostage. Mr Levy, 34, was abducted from the Nova music festival. Of the Palestinian prisoners being freed, 18 have been serving life sentences, 54 were serving long sentences and the vast majority, 111, were detained in Gaza during the war. Eli Sharabi Mr Sharabi's wife Lianne Sharabi was born in Bristol. She, along with their children, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were killed in the 7 October attack. His brother Yossi was also killed after being taken hostage. In a statement after news he would be released was announced, Mr Sharabi's lawyers said: \"The Sharabi family has already lost too much,\". It added: \"It is long past time to bring Eli home.\" Or Levy Mr Levy was captured by militants from a bomb shelter near the Nova music festival. His wife Einav was killed during the 7 October attack. Their son Almog, a toddler, is staying with his grandparents. Mr Levy is from the city of Rishon Lezion, where he worked as a computer programmer.  Some of Mr Levy's family previously spoke about his kidnapping and the death of his wife. Speaking around Hanukkah last year, his brother Michael Levy told Sky News's Yousra Elbagir: \"I have three little girls but it won't be the same. Hanukkah is a happy holiday - you light candles, you sing and eat all sorts of things but for us it is not a real holiday without Or.\" Ohad Ben Ami Mr Ben Ami, a father of three, was taken hostage with his wife Raz, who was released during the brief ceasefire period in November. His daughter Ella Ben Ami previously spoke to Sky News about missing her dad Mr Ami, as she pleaded for his release. \"On the eve of Christmas, on the 24 December, it will be his birthday, and I don't want to celebrate it without him,\" she told Sky News in 2023. Ms Ami was previously one of the first to tell the world what happened on 7 October, calling an Israeli TV channel while hiding.  Row over aid access Earlier on Friday, Hamas accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire accord and held off announcing the names of the Israeli hostages until the deadline had passed. The militant group claimed Israel delayed the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying food and other humanitarian supplies agreed under the truce deal and held back all but a fraction of the tents and mobile homes needed to provide people shelter in the devastated enclave. \"This demonstrates clear manipulation of relief and shelter priorities,\" Hamas said in a statement.  ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ COGAT, the Israeli military agency that is overseeing the aid deliveries into Gaza, denied the accusation. It added Israel would \"not tolerate violations by Hamas\". The claims and counter-claims highlight the fragility and uncertainty of the ceasefire.  This has been heightened by US President Donald Trump recently saying the US could take over Gaza and move the Palestinian population out. Israel's air and ground war in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced the majority of the strip's population.

Work on the second stage of the agreement, aimed at the release of around 60 male hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, has begun. An Israeli negotiating team was expected to fly to Doha on Saturday, according to media reports."

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he wanted Ukraine to supply the US with critical resources in exchange for financial support in its war with Russia. In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"If we are talking about a deal, then let's do a deal, we are only for it.\" While emphasising that Kyiv was not proposing \"giving away\" its resources, he said he was open to a mutually beneficial partnership to develop them jointly.

This does not mean that we are giving it away to anyone, even to strategic partners. We are talking about partnership... \"Let's develop this together, make money, and most importantly, it's about the security of the Western world.\" The Ukrainian president added that Kyiv and the White House were discussing the idea of using the country's underground gas storage sites to store American liquefied natural gas, calling it \"very interesting\". He also said he would like to discuss the US having priority when it came to rebuilding Ukraine, saying it would amount to \"a lot of money for business\". 'Not accepting Russia's ultimatums' He also insisted that Mr Trump must meet with him before he meets with the Russian president, \"otherwise it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine\". He added: \"I don't know what compromises can be discussed at the negotiating table, we have not reached that point... \"It is important for people to understand that Ukraine is negotiating, not accepting ultimatums from Russia.\" He also stressed Ukraine's need for security guarantees from its allies as part of any settlement. It comes as Mr Trump said he may meet with Mr Zelenskyy in the White House as early as next week. The two last met in New York in September last year. Mr Trump also repeated his interest in meeting the Russian president with whom he said he always had a \"good relationship\".

        "Content": "One hundred and two venomous snakes have been removed from a suburban back garden in Sydney. David Stein called experts after seeing six snakes moving around in a pile of mulch and discovered that red-belly blacks pile on top of each other before giving birth. Snake catcher Dylan Cooper was drafted in the same afternoon and bagged up five adults and 97 babies. Reptile Relocation Sydney said two of the adults gave birth to 29 snakes in the bag while the clean-up was still taking place. Company owner Cory Kerewaro said the highest number he'd heard about in a similar job was 30 non-venomous carpet pythons. However, that snake hatches from an egg whereas red-belly blacks give birth. \"You can get a decent number like that when the babies are hatching,\" Mr Kerewaro said. \"But to have this many venomous snakes, no one's come across it.\" The species normally has a litter of between four and 35 young. Snake expert and author Scott Eipper said the snakes might have grouped together for safety or due to a shortage of suitable habitats to give birth. \"This is an isolated incident. It's certainly a very rare occurrence,\" he said. The snakes have started a new life in an undisclosed national park after authorities granted permission for them to be released.

Meanwhile, Mr Stein has vowed to get rid of the mulch as soon as possible after being warned the snakes could return if it's not shifted."

        "Content": " American football star Travis Kelce has praised girlfriend Taylor Swift's work ethic, saying her record-breaking Eras Tour was \"excruciating\" on the singer's body and mind. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl, Kelce, who is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, was asked by reporters what he has learnt about Swift's dedication to her craft. \"What I saw on that [Eras Tour] last year was pretty remarkable,\" Kelce replied. \"To see the week in, week out, travelling from one country to the next, how excruciating it is on her body and on her mind. \"It's not just her, it was her entire tour. It was the dancers, it was the band, the singers, it was everybody involved. \"It was an absolute machine, and it was something I could admire watching, and I think about it all the time.\" Spanning five continents, Swift's Eras Tour became the highest-grossing of all time and the second most attended, seen by 10.1 million fans worldwide. The singer played a total of 149 shows, each running for around three hours, the elaborate performance also featured multiple costume changes and a set list of more than 40 songs. Kelce, who has been dating the singer since September 2023, attended multiple shows and even delighted fans when he joined Swift on stage at London's Wembley Arena. Swift's support and possible proposal? Although focus is firmly on Kelce as the Chiefs prepare to take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a bid to win an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title, questions about his love life have dominated the build up to the game. The 14-time Grammy Award-winning singer was born in Philadelphia - the largest city in Pennsylvania - but when asked what team would get her full support, Kelce said he thinks this year she will be \"wearing red\" (the colour of the Chiefs). \"I know her father is an Eagles fan,\" he said, adding: \"But she'll be all for the Chiefs this time around for sure.\" The footballer was also quick to shut down questions on whether he plans to give Swift an engagement ring, should the Chiefs win a three in a row. When asked, he simply responded: \"A Super Bowl ring? Next question.\" Swift has become a regular feature at Chiefs games, last seen cheering Kelce and his teammates on as they beat the Bills in the AFC Championship game that secured their place in the Super Bowl, and came on to the field at the Arrowhead Stadium after their victory to kiss him as confetti fell behind them.

There has been no assessment of whether the programme to capture and store carbon from the atmosphere is affordable for billpayers, said a report from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of MPs. The financial impact on households of funding the project has not been examined by government at all, the PAC said. Money blog: Greggs taking on KFC with new range Even if the state's investment pays off, the technology is successful and makes money, there is no way for profits to be shared to bring down bills, it added. Private sector investors, however, would recoup investment, according to committee chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. \"All early progress will be underwritten by taxpayers, who currently do not stand to benefit if these projects are successful,\" he said. \"Any private sector funding for such a project would expect to see significant returns when it becomes a success.\" That's despite the vast majority (two-thirds) of the Â£21.7bn investment coming from levies on consumers \"who are already facing some of the highest energy bills in the world\", it said. But there is no evidence to say the programme will be successful despite the government \"gambling\" its legally mandated net zero targets on the tech, committee chair Sir Geoffrey added.  There are no examples of carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) operating at scale in the UK, according to the PAC report. As part of its work, the PAC heard the technology may not capture as much carbon as expected. International examples show the government's expectations for its performance are \"far from guaranteed\", it heard as part of its inquiry.

It is now \"unclear\" how the government will reach its goal, the PAC report said. \"Our committee was left unconvinced that CCUS is the silver bullet government is apparently betting on\", Sir Geoffrey said. The Â£22bn investment was due to be made over 25 years and into five CCUS projects."

The Home Office will not confirm or deny the existence of the order. Apple has been approached for comment.

Opponents say it is a breach of privacy.

There are also concerns that, if implemented, the UK's order could lead nations like China to force Western companies to break their users' privacy. 'Advanced Data Protection' On Apple products, users have the option to use Advanced Data Protection (ADP). The UK government's demand applies to all content stored using ADP, which means certain data can only be decrypted by the user. Apple promises that even a cloud data breach would not make the information readable. Users are also told that Apple cannot see the data due to the end-to-end encryption used to share the information. End-to-end encryption means that messages and data sent between two devices can only be read by the person they are sent to - and are scrambled if anyone else tries to intercept or access them. The debate stretches as far back as 2017, when then home secretary Amber Rudd stated that \"I don't need to understand how encryption works\" to want it broken. The order from the UK government was made under the UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016, according to The Washington Post. The act says the orders can be applied to companies outside the UK. There are avenues for Apple to appeal against the TCN, but this process would not be made public.

And Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has criticised social media companies for not being fast enough to take down videos previously viewed by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. Last year, Apple provided written evidence to MPs on its many oppositions to the Investigatory Powers Act and TCNs. It noted that the law gives the UK government the power to \"act as the world's regulator\" of security technology - something which could put it at odds with authorities like the European Union and the United States.

Sky News has learnt that Advent International, the buyout firm which bought Cobham for Â£4bn in 2020 and then swooped on London-listed Ultra Electronics in a Â£2.6bn deal the following year, is in detailed negotiations to offload Ultra Electronic Warfare Simulation Technology (EWST). Money blog: Greggs taking on KFC with new range The division provides \"training and performance validation capabilities\" to its customers, and - according to the company - \"specialises in market-leading, multi-spectral threat and countermeasure simulators that are designed to strengthen naval, air force, army and the defence industry's electronic warfare testing, evaluation and training\". One bidder who explored a bid at an earlier stage of the sale process said on Friday that the EWST business was unlikely to command a significant price. A change of control may nevertheless require approval under the government's National Security and Investment Act, given the nature of the division's operations. The EWST division is part of Ultra Intelligence & Communications, which is itself a subsidiary of the broader group. Alvarez & Marsal, the professional services firm, has been drafted in to manage the auction, the source added. Advent has overseen a wholesale break-up of the enlarged Cobham group - a controversial process which drew opposition from members of the company's founding family as well as politicians and commentators. Among the assets already sold was Paris-based Cobham Aerospace Communications to the French group Thales, which fetched Â£850m in 2023. Advent's spokesman did not respond to enquiries about the remaining elements of the original Cobham business in its ownership but declined to comment on the EWST sale process."

Ministers have argued they want to use it for purposes like protecting children, identifying criminals and keeping the public safe. \n                  Apple suspends AI-generated news summaries after criticism over misleading notifications\n                 \n                  Apple AI feature 'must be revoked' over notifications misleading users, say journalists\n                 \n                  Severance star Adam Scott on balancing Hollywood fame with family life: 'Everything's a challenge at some point'\n                 What are the concerns? Opponents say it is a breach of privacy. They also highlight the risk to whistleblowers and journalists, and point out that any tool the government has to break into people's information has a danger of being hijacked by bad actors. There are also concerns that, if implemented, the UK's order could lead nations like China to force Western companies to break their users' privacy. 'Advanced Data Protection' On Apple products, users have the option to use Advanced Data Protection (ADP). The UK government's demand applies to all content stored using ADP, which means certain data can only be decrypted by the user. Apple promises that even a cloud data breach would not make the information readable. Users are also told that Apple cannot see the data due to the end-to-end encryption used to share the information. End-to-end encryption means that messages and data sent between two devices can only be read by the person they are sent to - and are scrambled if anyone else tries to intercept or access them. The debate stretches as far back as 2017, when then home secretary Amber Rudd stated that \"I don't need to understand how encryption works\" to want it broken. The order from the UK government was made under the UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016, according to The Washington Post. The act says the orders can be applied to companies outside the UK. There are avenues for Apple to appeal against the TCN, but this process would not be made public.

This includes recently trumpeting its plans to be the first country in the world to create a new AI sexual abuse offence to punish those generating and facilitating the creation of AI child sexual abuse images. And Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has criticised social media companies for not being fast enough to take down videos previously viewed by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana. Last year, Apple provided written evidence to MPs on its many oppositions to the Investigatory Powers Act and TCNs. It noted that the law gives the UK government the power to \"act as the world's regulator\" of security technology - something which could put it at odds with authorities like the European Union and the United States. Order would 'undermine human rights' The American company also said that an order to force decryption would \"undermine fundamentally human rights\" and potentially put the UK at odds with the European Court of Human Rights. \"There is no reason why the [UK government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption,\" Apple said. It added: \"Moreover, any attempt by the [secretary of state] to use its extraterritorial powers to compel technology companies to weaken encryption technology will only strengthen the hands of malicious actors who seek to steal and exploit personal data for nefarious purposes.\" ðŸ‘‰ Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ A spokesperson for privacy and civil liberty campaign group Big Brother Watch said: \"We urge the UK government to immediately rescind this draconian order and cease attempts to employ mass surveillance in lieu of the targeted powers already at their disposal.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\""

        "Content": "\n          Wales reporter\n              @TomosGruffydd\n Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the former leader of Plaid Cymru, has died at the age of 78. Lord Elis-Thomas also served as the Welsh government's culture, sport and tourism minister from 2017 to 2021. He served as his party's leader between 1984 and 1991 and as MP for Merioneth, later Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, from 1974 to 1992. He then became a member of the House of Lords when he was made a life peer the same year. Lord Elis-Thomas was a member of the first Senedd, then known as the Welsh Assembly, in 1999 and played a key role as its first presiding officer - a role he held until 2011. He quit Plaid Cymru in 2016 and continued to sit as an independent member of the Senedd for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, until he stepped down at the 2021 election. 'Senedd's founding father' Plaid's current leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said Lord Elis-Thomas's death was \"a huge loss to Welsh politics and the civic life of Wales\". Mr ap Iorwerth said his predecessor was \"unquestionably one of the most influential figures of his generation\". As the inaugural presiding officer, he made \"a priceless contribution in laying the firm foundations of devolution\", Mr ap Iorwerth added. He said the party's \"sincerest condolences\" were with Lord Elis-Thomas's family. Elin Jones, the Senedd's current presiding officer, known as the Llywydd, said it was \"hard to imagine Welsh political life without [him]\". She said he was \"omnipresent\" in Welsh politics, having served in the House of Commons, House of Lords and the Senedd. Ms Jones said he was \"keen to establish a modern democracy from the start\" in his role as presiding officer and could \"rightly be called [the] Senedd's founding father\". Wales's first minister Eluned Morgan said he was \"a true giant of Welsh politics\" and \"helped shape the Wales we know today\". Baroness Morgan added that Wales was \"immeasurably richer for his lifetime of service\". Lord Elis-Thomas's successor as Senedd member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said the news had come as an \"enormous blow\", and that he had made a \"priceless contribution to Welsh politics\". Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens also paid tribute, saying he had \"dedicated his life to serving Wales in Westminster, Cardiff Bay, and his constituency\". Elsewhere, Scotland's first minister John Swinney said he was \"a great friend to Scotland and a fine servant of Wales\".

        "Content": " American football star Travis Kelce has praised girlfriend Taylor Swift's work ethic, saying her record-breaking Eras Tour was \"excruciating\" on the singer's body and mind. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl, Kelce, who is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, was asked by reporters what he has learnt about Swift's dedication to her craft. \"What I saw on that [Eras Tour] last year was pretty remarkable,\" Kelce replied. \"To see the week in, week out, travelling from one country to the next, how excruciating it is on her body and on her mind. \"It's not just her, it was her entire tour. It was the dancers, it was the band, the singers, it was everybody involved. \"It was an absolute machine, and it was something I could admire watching, and I think about it all the time.\" Spanning five continents, Swift's Eras Tour became the highest-grossing of all time and the second most attended, seen by 10.1 million fans worldwide. The singer played a total of 149 shows, each running for around three hours, the elaborate performance also featured multiple costume changes and a set list of more than 40 songs. Kelce, who has been dating the singer since September 2023, attended multiple shows and even delighted fans when he joined Swift on stage at London's Wembley Arena. Swift's support and possible proposal? Although focus is firmly on Kelce as the Chiefs prepare to take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a bid to win an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title, questions about his love life have dominated the build up to the game. The 14-time Grammy Award-winning singer was born in Philadelphia - the largest city in Pennsylvania - but when asked what team would get her full support, Kelce said he thinks this year she will be \"wearing red\" (the colour of the Chiefs). \"I know her father is an Eagles fan,\" he said, adding: \"But she'll be all for the Chiefs this time around for sure.\" The footballer was also quick to shut down questions on whether he plans to give Swift an engagement ring, should the Chiefs win a three in a row. When asked, he simply responded: \"A Super Bowl ring? Next question.\" Swift has become a regular feature at Chiefs games, last seen cheering Kelce and his teammates on as they beat the Bills in the AFC Championship game that secured their place in the Super Bowl, and came on to the field at the Arrowhead Stadium after their victory to kiss him as confetti fell behind them.

The actress, who played Buffy Summers, has shared details about why she decided to return to her days as a slayer, almost 22 years after the show ended. The series, created by writer and director Joss Whedon, featured Gellar, 47, as one in a long line of young women chosen by fate to battle evil forces in the fictional US town of Sunnydale. Now the star has posted a message on Instagram confirming her involvement in a revival of the drama, although did not reveal if it will be a reboot or sequel. She described a conversation three years ago with director Chloe Zhao \"to hear her take on a potential 'Buffy' revival\". \"Our twenty minute coffee quickly turned into a four hour adventure. We laughed, we cried, but mostly we both talked about how much this show means to us,\" she wrote, adding that at the time she didn't agree to continue Buffy's story.

The US entertainment news outlet also said it had been told by sources that the sequel \"is nearing a pilot order at [US streaming network] Hulu\". Buffy The Vampire Slayer ran for seven seasons from 1997, with its finale episode airing in May 2003. It also featured British actor Anthony Stewart Head who starred as Giles, Buffy's Watcher, along with her schoolfriends Willow and Xander from Sunnydale High, played by Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon respectively. The show was so successful that the character Angel - a cursed vampire who is Buffy's love interest - got his own spin-off series. The actor who played him, David Boreanaz, also went on to star in the long-running police series, Bones. Gellar wrote that she has always listened to the fans and heard their desires to revisit Buffy and her world. \"But it was not something I could do unless I was sure we would get it right. This has been a long process, and it's not over yet,\" she added. \"I promise you, we will only make this show if we know we can do it right.

        "Content": "Gino D'Acampo has \"firmly\" denied allegationsÂ of inappropriate and intimidating behaviour on the sets of his TV shows. The chef's actions, over a period of more than 12 years, were described by dozens of people as \"unacceptable\", \"distressing\" and \"horrendous\", according to an investigation by ITV News. Denying all the allegations, D'Acampo told ITV he \"would not do anything that I thought would upset or distress anyone\". He added: \"I am a father, husband... the suggestion that I have acted in an improper way against is deeply upsetting.\" With over 25 years of presenting experience, D'Acampo is one of the most recognisable chefs on TV. He also has numerous cookbooks and restaurants to his name. But how has his career unfolded? Who is he? Born in Torre del Greco, Naples, in southern Italy, D'Acampo learned to cook from his grandfather, according to his official website. He went on to train at Luigi De Medici catering college in Florence and made the move to London at the age of 18. His love of food led to him starting and co-owning Bonta Italia in 2003, which imports Italian produce to restaurants, supermarkets and manufacturers in the UK. This led to him appearing as a guest on the Good Food television channel and since 2009, he has been a regular on cooking segments on ITV's This Morning. Using what his website describes as \"cheeky wit\", the chef soon became known for his risquÃ© comments and sexual innuendos. Also in 2009 the chef headed into the Australian jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, where he was crowned king of the jungle, narrowly beating TV personality Kim Woodburn. Family life D'Acampo has been married to Jessica Stellina Morrison for nearly 25 years. The pair reportedly met when they were teenagers while they were both working at a restaurant in Marbella. They have three children together - Luciano, Rocci, and Mia. Television career Proving popular with viewers, D'Acampo started to host his own cookery shows, including Gino's Italian Escape, which over a number of series, sees him travelling around Italy in search of authentic recipes from his homeland. He also paired up with model Melanie Sykes for ITV's Lets Do Lunch in 2011, which saw him cook three recipes each episode while a celebrity guest be interviewed. In 2017, D'Acampo went head-to-head with fellow chef Gordon Ramsay and maitre d'hotel Fred Sirieix to produce a festive menu for people who work in the emergency services. The trio were a hit and reunited for travel and food series Gordon, Gino and Fred's Ultimate Road Trip. Subsequent series of the show saw them travel across America, Greece and Spain. Most recently, the trio became a duo, with D'Acampo and Sirieix returning for Gino & Fred: Emission Impossible, which sees the pair visit Austria to track down sustainable produce and immerse themselves in environmentally friendly lifestyles. In 2020, the chef became the face of long-running game show Family Fortunes, after it was revived after 17 years. The latest series, which was filmed in 2023, is not currently scheduled for broadcast and ITV has no plans to work with D'Acampo, ITV News reported. Restaurants and cookbooks Away from presenting, D'Acampo has seven restaurants across the UK including in Manchester, London, Liverpool and Leeds. Read more from Sky News:Buffy The Vampire Slayer is backTaylor Swift's Eras Tour was 'excruciating' on her body and mind Throughout his career he has published 20 cookbooks, ranging from one directly aimed at getting children into cooking and another which uses recipes that can all be made using an air fryer. The chef also partnered with supermarket chain Asda in 2021 to release a range of 75 products including cookware, homeware, and appliances."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        Here we go again. Another broadcaster following pretty much the same recipe card as the last one. What's the best way to distance yourself from the alleged bad behaviour of a top celebrity chef that's making headlines? Distance yourself by pointing the finger of blame at the independent production company that makes his shows, then simply repeat the term \"robust duty of care policies\" until everything's cooled down. The only problem is this kind of approach tends to leave a bad taste in the mouth. Those who both pay for and air the shows where staff claim to have been too scared to \"speak up\", it seems to often end up trading responsibility just because they weren't the ones pressing record. Gino D'Acampo \"firmly denies\" claims made about his behaviour off-set and there will be those who cry \"but what's he actually done wrong?\" While ITV is now clearly distancing itself from its former star - shelving an entire new series of Family Fortunes and saying it has no plans to work with him again - the onus really needs to be on the broadcaster to follow-up. \n                  A look at Gino D'Acampo's meteoric rise - as he denies allegations against him\n                 \n                  TV chef Gino D'Acampo denies dozens of allegations of inappropriate behaviour\n                 Read more: A look at D'Acampo's meteoric rise In a position of power, was D'Acampo able to say and do anything he liked? An anonymous woman quoted in the ITV News investigation claims talent was \"furiously protected\" because they brought in the cash. At the very least, going forward, while ITV says it makes sure production companies know what standards it expects, bosses need to get the message that if you're airing a show where one of its stars regularly gets his junk out on screen in pursuit of a cheap laugh, it might just be worth checking-in a little more on the wellbeing of those who're filming it."

        "Content": "One hundred and two venomous snakes have been removed from a suburban back garden in Sydney. David Stein called experts after seeing six snakes moving around in a pile of mulch and discovered that red-belly blacks pile on top of each other before giving birth. Snake catcher Dylan Cooper was drafted in the same afternoon and bagged up five adults and 97 babies. Reptile Relocation Sydney said two of the adults gave birth to 29 snakes in the bag while the clean-up was still taking place. Company owner Cory Kerewaro said the highest number he'd heard about in a similar job was 30 non-venomous carpet pythons. However, that snake hatches from an egg whereas red-belly blacks give birth. \"You can get a decent number like that when the babies are hatching,\" Mr Kerewaro said. \"But to have this many venomous snakes, no one's come across it.\" The species normally has a litter of between four and 35 young. Snake expert and author Scott Eipper said the snakes might have grouped together for safety or due to a shortage of suitable habitats to give birth. \"This is an isolated incident. It's certainly a very rare occurrence,\" he said. The snakes have started a new life in an undisclosed national park after authorities granted permission for them to be released.

Meanwhile, Mr Stein has vowed to get rid of the mulch as soon as possible after being warned the snakes could return if it's not shifted."
