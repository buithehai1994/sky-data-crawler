        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer promised \"bold changes\" as he announced he will relax rules around electric vehicles after carmakers were hit by Donald Trump's tariffs.  The prime minister said \"global trade is being transformed\" after the US president's 25% levy on imported cars, and 10% tariff on other products, came into force. Jaguar Land Rover has said the firm will \"pause\" shipments to the US as it looks to \"address the new trading terms\". Trump adviser explains why tariffs put on island inhabited only by penguins Labour made a manifesto pledge to restore a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after it had been rolled back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak's Conservative government. Sir Keir will officially confirm the ban in an announcement on Monday but regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will be altered, to help firms in the transition. Luxury supercar firms such as Aston Martin and McLaren will still be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond the 2030 date, because they only manufacture a small number of vehicles per year. \n                  International stock markets tumble as Trump calls tariffs 'medicine'\n                 \n                  Starmer to announce more support for businesses as Trump tariffs take hold\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer pledges to protect UK companies from Trump tariff 'storm'\n                  Petrol and diesel vans will also be allowed to be sold until 2035, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars. The government is also going to make it easier for manufacturers who do not comply with the government's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which sets sales targets, to avoid fines, and the levies will be reduced. Sir Keir said: \"I am determined to back British brilliance. \"Now more than ever UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside. \"That means action, not words.\" Officials have said support for the car industry will continue to be kept under review as the full impact of the tariffs announced last week becomes clear. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the industry deserves \"clarity\" in the economic context. She said: \"Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs, making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs, all the while meeting our core manifesto commitment to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.\" Read more:Starmer pledges to shelter UK business from tariff stormJaguar Land Rover decision sparks anxiety in car-making hub Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government had \"recognised the intense pressure manufacturers are under\", while Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the ZEV mandate is a \"global success story\" in driving a surge in sales of electric vehicles. Some 62% of UK firms with trade exposure to the US are being negatively impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. Its survey of more than 600 businesses also found 32% of firms with trade exposure to the US said they will increase prices in response. The survey also found 41% of firms with no exposure to the USA said they would be negatively impacted by the tariffs. Some 44% of firms with exposure to the US said the UK should seek to negotiate a closer trade relationship with the US, while 43% said they wanted closer trade with other markets. Just under a quarter (21%) said they thought the UK should impose retaliatory tariffs. The survey also found that 40% of firms considered the 10% tariffs to be better than they had expected. It comes as KPMG warned US tariffs on UK exports could see GDP growth fall to 0.8% in 2025 and 2026. The accountancy firm said higher tariffs on specific categories, such as cars, aluminium and steel, would more than offset the exemption on pharmaceutical exports, leaving the effective tariffs imposed on UK exports at around 12%. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"Given the economic impact that tariffs would cause, there is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs. The UK automotive manufacturing sector is particularly exposed given the complex supply chains of some producers.\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  Until five weeks ago, Arturo SuarezÂ was a professional singer, performing in the United States as he waited for his asylum claim to be processed. Originally from Venezuela, he had entered the US through proper, legal channels. But he is now imprisoned in a notorious jail in El Salvador, sent there by the Trump administration, despite seemingly never having faced trial or committed any crime. The White House claims he is a gang member but has not provided evidence to support this allegation. His brother, Nelson Suarez, told Sky News he believes his brother's only \"crime\" is being Venezuelan and having tattoos. \"He is not a gang member,\" Nelson says, adamantly, \"I've come to the conclusion that it has to be because of the tattoos. If you don't have a criminal record, you haven't committed any crime in the United States, what other reason could there be? Because you're Venezuelan?\" Arturo, 34, was recording a music video inside a house in March when he was arrested by immigration agents. He was first taken to a deportation centre in El Paso, Texas, and then, it appears, put on to a military flight to El Salvador. \n                  International stock markets tumble as Trump calls tariffs 'medicine'\n                 \n                  Starmer to announce more support for businesses as Trump tariffs take hold\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer pledges to protect UK companies from Trump tariff 'storm'\n                 His family have not heard from him since. Lawyers and immigrant rights groups have been unable to make contact with any of the more than 200 Venezuelan men sent to the CECOT prison, which holds members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs. Tattoo clue to Arturo Suarez's whereabouts Nelson learned his brother is - most likely - in CECOT only because of a photograph he spotted on a news website of a group of inmates, with their hands and feet cuffed, heads shaved and bodies shackled together. \"You can see the hummingbird tattoo on his neck,\" Nelson says, pointing to the picture. He says Arturo wanted a hummingbird in memory of their late mother. Arturo has 33 tattoos in total, including a piano, poems and verses from the Bible. It could be that one, or more, of those tattoos landed him at the centre of President Trump's anti-immigration showpiece. Nelson shows me documents which indicate that Arturo did not have a criminal record in Venezuela, Chile, Colombia or the United States, the four countries he has lived in. Sky News contacted the White House, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a response to Arturo's case but have not heard back. In March, Donald Trump signed the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 which has been invoked just three times before, in wartime. It allows the president to detain and deport immigrants living legally in the US if they are from countries deemed \"enemies\" of the government. In this instance, Mr Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had \"infiltrated the United States\" and was \"conducting irregular warfare\". Gang symbol tattoos Immigration officials have centred on certain tattoos being gang symbols. Immigration officers were provided with a document called the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\", according to a court filing from the American Civil Liberties Union. The document provides a point-based system to determine if an immigrant in custody \"may be validated\" as a gang member. Migrants who score six points and higher may be designated as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, according to the document. Tattoos which fall under a \"symbolism\" category score four points and social media posts \"displaying\" gang symbols are two points. Tattoos considered suspicious, according to the document, include crowns, stars and the Michael Jordan Jumpman logo. Jerce Reyes Barrios's story Another of the men sent to CECOT prison is 36-year-old Jerce Reyes Barrios, who fled Venezuela last year after marching in anti-government protests. He is a former footballer and football coach. His lawyer, Linette Tobin, told Sky News that Reyes Barrios entered the US legally after waiting in Mexico for four months for an immigration appointment and then presenting himself at the border. She says he was detained in a maximum security prison in the US while awaiting his asylum appointment. But before that appointment happened, he was flown to the El Salvador prison. Ms Tobin says the DHS deported Reyes Barrios because they designated him a Tren De Aragua gang member based on two pieces of evidence. The first, she says, is a tattoo of the Real Madrid football team logo surrounded by rosary beads. She has since obtained a declaration from the tattoo artist stating that Reyes Barrios just wanted an image which depicted his favourite team. The second piece of evidence, she says, is a photograph, which she shows me, of Reyes Barrios in a hot tub with friends when he was a college student 13 years ago. He is making a gesture which could be interpreted as \"rock and roll\", but which she says has been interpreted as a gang symbol. Distraught family in despair Reyes Barrios has no criminal record in his home country. \"I've never known anything like this,\" Ms Tobin says. \"My client was deported to a third country and we have no way of getting in touch with him. His family are distraught and in despair, they cry a lot, not knowing what is going on with him. We want him returned to the United States to have a hearing and due process.\" Ms Tobin says she and other lawyers representing men sent to the El Salvador prison are trying to establish a UN working group on enforced disappearances to do a wellness check on them because the prison is completely \"incommunicado\".  Sky News contacted the DHS for comment about Reyes Barrios's case but did not receive a response. The DHS previously issued a statement declaring that \"DHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang-affiliated tattoos. This man's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua\". Reyes Barrios has an immigration hearing scheduled for 17 April, Ms Tobin says, which the Trump administration is trying to dismiss on the grounds that he is not in the US anymore. In the meantime, children he used to coach football for in his hometown of Machiques in Venezuela have been holding a prayer vigil for him and calling for his release. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, visited CECOT last month and posed for photos standing in front of inmates behind bars. \"Do not come to our country illegally,\" she said, \"you will be removed, and you will be prosecuted.\" Donald Trump had promised during his election campaign to clamp down on immigration, railing against undocumented immigrants and claiming immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". I ask Arturo Suarez's brother, Nelson, how he felt watching Ms Noem posing in the prison, knowing that his brother might be close by. \"I feel bad,\" he says, \"I feel horrible, because in those images we only see criminals. With my brother, I feel it is more a political issue. They needed numbers, they said, these are the numbers, and now, let's throw them to the lions.\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story The Trump administration has admitted that at least one man sent to the El Salvador jail was sent by \"administrative error\". Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was living in Maryland, was sent to CECOT despite a judge's earlier ruling in 2019 that granted him legal protection to stay in the US. The White House has alleged Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers argued there is no evidence to prove this. ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð A federal judge has ordered Garcia must be returned to the US by Monday 7 April. In a post on X, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to the judge as a \"Marxist\", who \"now thinks she's president of El Salvador\". White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We suggest the judge contact President Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.\""

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Marine Le Pen made one thing abundantly clear. She is not going quietly. She may have been disgraced in a Paris courtroom, convicted of embezzlement, sentenced and barred from office for five years. But there was no sense of shame or regret in her speech to the party faithful. Nor would you expect there to be. She is the victim of an establishment stitch-up, she believes, or claims to, and the crowds watching her speak in the French capital heartily agreed. The hard-right National Rally party's leader was found guilty of being part of a huge and orchestrated campaign to swindle the European parliament and its taxpayers, using phony accounts to raise millions.  The judge in the case saw a politician who had long campaigned for tougher penalties for corrupt politicians and decided it only fitting to throw the book at her. For political foes, watching their most feared enemy sent off the pitch, is all very welcome. Former prime minister Gabriel Attal told supporters at another rally she stole money and should do the punishment. But even Le Pen's rivals are queasy about the five-year ban from office. Some legal observers believe the judge went too far. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the case, it does nothing to ease the country's political crisis. Nothing to address the festering sense of un-enfranchised grievance on the fringes of society that helped propel Le Pen to such popularity in the first place.

Not surprisingly, her speech was preceded by a series of short videos from other rightist populists, from Mateo Salvini in Italy to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. In America, Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk have also pitched in. Le Pen may have been banished into the political wilderness but can still cause enormous trouble from there."

On Wednesday, the King and Queen will also mark their 20th wedding anniversary, as the guests of honour at the traditional state banquet - some would say a far cry from the mixed reception their relationship received in the 1980s and 1990s.

        "Content": "The King and Queen have begun a three-day state visit to Italy, where they will celebrate the Catholic jubilee year, an event that only happens every 25 years.Â  The trip will see Charles and Camilla attend a series of public and diplomatic events in the capital, Rome, and the city of Ravenna. This year, Rome expects to welcome three times its normal number of visitors - between 30 and 32 million, compared to an average of 10 million - as Catholics travel to the city for the jubilee, which marks a time of pilgrimage, reflection, and spiritual renewal. The jubilee, also known as the holy year, officially began on 24 December 2024 and will run until 6 January 2026. With major events throughout the year, Rome will be particularly busy - so much so that the UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for tourists planning to travel there. Here is everything you need to know. What is a jubilee? A jubilee year is a time for Catholics to \"re-establish a proper relationship with God, one another and with all of creation\", according to the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Each jubilee year starts with the Pope opening the Holy Doors at St Peter's Basilica on Christmas Eve in the Vatican City. This represents the passage from sin to grace and new beginnings. The pontiff then opens a further four Holy Doors which remain open for the entire year. This jubilee year, the Pope opened San Giovanni in Laterano (St John Lateran) on 29 December, Santa Maria Maggiore (St Mary Major) on 1 January and St Paul's Outside the Walls on 5 January. For the first time, he also opened a Holy Door at a prison. He opened one at Rebibbia new complex prison in Rome on 26 December as a gesture of hope for prisoners. As the pontiff, the Pope has the authority to proclaim any church door as a Holy Door. The goal of pilgrims who travel to Rome during a jubilee year is to pass through at least one of the Holy Doors. Why are the royals going? Despite being head of the Church of England, the King was set to meet the Pope to mark the jubilee year, a meeting that would have also marked \"a significant step forward in relations between the Catholic Church and Church of England\", according to Buckingham Palace. However, due to the 88-year-old pontiff recovering from pneumonia, the private meeting between the two has been postponed. Instead of going to the Holy See - the government of the Roman Catholic Church located in the Vatican - Charles and Camilla will make a historic visit to the Papal Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls and the King will become the first British monarch to address a joint session of the Italian parliament. During the last jubilee, in the year 2000, Queen Elizabeth II met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Can I still travel to Italy this year? Rome is expected to be \"very busy\" throughout this year, particularly when bigger jubilee events take place, the UK Foreign Office (FCDO) has said. In an update on 17 March, it advised Britons wanting to head to Italy, particularly the capital, to plan ahead. The US Embassy in Italy has also updated its website to say: \"Be prepared for crowds and extended wait times for transportation and entry into locations. \"You should book accommodations, transportation, and attraction tickets well in advance of arrival. Rome's public transportation system will be under strain, and regular routes and schedules may change.\" There are events taking place nearly every month, with the most listed for May and June. Events targeted towards specific groups of people, including families, workers, entrepreneurs and disabled people will take place, as well as concerts and special exhibitions in Rome's museums. The FCDO says people wanting to take part in the jubilee or organise a pilgrimage will need a Pilgrim's card. This is free to download and can be obtained on the jubilee website or through the official app. Despite Italy being busier than usual, Rome and other parts of the country are set to look their best for the jubilee, having been under construction nearly all of last year. The capital pulled together billions of euros of state and European funds to overhaul tourist sites, transport hubs, parks, streets and even its rubbish bins. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told Reuters last year that the jubilee was an \"unmissable opportunity to make structural changes... and transform Rome\". A record 3,200 public construction works were scheduled to take place, including 322 projects that were deemed essential for the jubilee. Tips from a tour guide Livia, a European tour guide for operator Scott Dunn, said for people planning to visit the Italian capital this year, \"timing is everything\". She recommends tourists visit major sites such as the Vatican and Colosseum earlier in the morning rather than in the afternoon and on weekdays rather than weekends. Read more:Pope arrives back at VaticanKing returns to official duties Livia added that visiting \"lesser-known neighbourhoods to see some of the more local areas\" will also give tourists a more authentic Roman experience without huge crowds. \"Wander the quiet, charming streets of Garbatella, and lose yourself in Monti, home to eclectic boutiques and traditional Roman trattorias,\" she said."

        "Content": "From today, drivers using London's Blackwall Tunnel will have to pay a toll. The charge is being implemented the same day the new Silvertown Tunnel - which will link east London to southeast London - also opens to drivers. For car drivers, a return journey at peak times will cost Â£8, jumping up to Â£13 for large vans. Here is everything you need to know about the new tunnel, the tolls and the decision behind its implementation. What is the Silvertown Tunnel? The 1.4km (just under one mile) long tunnel stretches from Silvertown in Newham, east London, to the Greenwich Peninsula in southeast London. It will run adjacent to the Victorian-era Blackwall Tunnel which takes drivers near The O2 Arena under the River Thames to the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall. The project, which has cost Â£2.2bn, was approved by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, having been first proposed back in 2012. It is being funded through private finance and Transport for London (TfL) will pay back Â£100m a year through money made on the toll. Why was it built? Put simply, the Silvertown Tunnel aims to reduce congestion that currently builds up on the approach to the Blackwall Tunnel - with TfL claiming it will shave 20 minutes off journeys. The government body says the Blackwall Tunnel was never designed to carry the levels of traffic it currently does, leading to more frequent incidents that cause traffic to tailback for miles and negatively impacting air quality. As well as private vehicles, around 21 buses will travel through the new tunnel every hour from 7am until 7pm Monday to Friday, which TfL has said will help to offer new routes for more people. A dedicated bike bus shuttle service will also transport cyclists and their bikes across the river. How much will it cost and how do you pay? Charges will apply to both the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels. How much it costs depends on what you are driving and at what time. Peak hours through the northbound tunnel (going towards central London) will run from 6am to 10am Monday to Friday. For the southbound tunnel (going away from central London) peak hours are 4pm until 7pm Monday to Friday. All other times will be classed as off-peak, including weekends. Take a look at the table below to see the full breakdown of charges. Both tunnels will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll has to be paid by phone or online. The TfL website states the easiest way to pay is to use Auto Pay, which allows people to link their payment cards to an account that will automatically take payment. From Monday, local residents will be able to use cross-river bus routes for free for a year. Residents who are on certain benefits and live in local boroughs will also be eligible for a 50% discount. Why is it so controversial? Ever since the Silvertown Tunnel was given the green light, it has been met with criticism from opposition parties and campaign groups. The Liberal Democrats have argued against the project from the start, claiming Mr Khan hasn't listened to environmental concerns. The party says more roads will lead to more people using them, creating bottlenecks through areas including Greenwich, Blackheath and Eltham.

But TfL maintains the project will \"help to reduce congestion at the Blackwall Tunnel, deliver faster journeys during peak times, help manage overall air quality and allow for better cross-river public transport\"."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer promised \"bold changes\" as he announced he will relax rules around electric vehicles after carmakers were hit by Donald Trump's tariffs.  The prime minister said \"global trade is being transformed\" after the US president's 25% levy on imported cars, and 10% tariff on other products, came into force. Jaguar Land Rover has said the firm will \"pause\" shipments to the US as it looks to \"address the new trading terms\". Trump adviser explains why tariffs put on island inhabited only by penguins Labour made a manifesto pledge to restore a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after it had been rolled back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak's Conservative government. Sir Keir will officially confirm the ban in an announcement on Monday but regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will be altered, to help firms in the transition. Luxury supercar firms such as Aston Martin and McLaren will still be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond the 2030 date, because they only manufacture a small number of vehicles per year. \n                  International stock markets tumble as Trump calls tariffs 'medicine'\n                 \n                  Starmer to announce more support for businesses as Trump tariffs take hold\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer pledges to protect UK companies from Trump tariff 'storm'\n                  Petrol and diesel vans will also be allowed to be sold until 2035, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars. The government is also going to make it easier for manufacturers who do not comply with the government's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which sets sales targets, to avoid fines, and the levies will be reduced. Sir Keir said: \"I am determined to back British brilliance. \"Now more than ever UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside. \"That means action, not words.\" Officials have said support for the car industry will continue to be kept under review as the full impact of the tariffs announced last week becomes clear. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the industry deserves \"clarity\" in the economic context. She said: \"Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs, making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs, all the while meeting our core manifesto commitment to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.\" Read more:Starmer pledges to shelter UK business from tariff stormJaguar Land Rover decision sparks anxiety in car-making hub Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government had \"recognised the intense pressure manufacturers are under\", while Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the ZEV mandate is a \"global success story\" in driving a surge in sales of electric vehicles. Some 62% of UK firms with trade exposure to the US are being negatively impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. Its survey of more than 600 businesses also found 32% of firms with trade exposure to the US said they will increase prices in response. The survey also found 41% of firms with no exposure to the USA said they would be negatively impacted by the tariffs. Some 44% of firms with exposure to the US said the UK should seek to negotiate a closer trade relationship with the US, while 43% said they wanted closer trade with other markets. Just under a quarter (21%) said they thought the UK should impose retaliatory tariffs. The survey also found that 40% of firms considered the 10% tariffs to be better than they had expected. It comes as KPMG warned US tariffs on UK exports could see GDP growth fall to 0.8% in 2025 and 2026. The accountancy firm said higher tariffs on specific categories, such as cars, aluminium and steel, would more than offset the exemption on pharmaceutical exports, leaving the effective tariffs imposed on UK exports at around 12%. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"Given the economic impact that tariffs would cause, there is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs. The UK automotive manufacturing sector is particularly exposed given the complex supply chains of some producers.\""

        "Content": "By Laura Bundock, health correspondent   The suspended surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge has been named as paediatric consultant Kuldeep Stohr. Eight hundred patients operated on by Ms Stohr are having their cases urgently re-examined, after an external review found nine children whose care fell below expected standards. The initial review was ordered after concerns were raised by her colleagues. Sky News has seen a copy of the interim report which details several issues relating to complex hip surgeries performed by the surgeon. One of the parents whose child was identified in the review showed us a recent letter from the hospital which reported \"problems with both judgement and technique\" in her child's surgery. Ms Stohr, who has been suspended since the end of January, said in a statement: \"I always strive to provide the highest standards of care to all my patients. \"I am co-operating fully with the trust investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\" Left in agonising pain Tammy Harrison, 12, has cerebral palsy and had surgeries carried out by Ms Stohr. Her operations didn't work, leaving her in agonising pain. She said: \"My first one was just like trauma. I couldn't get out of bed for eight weeks. I was either stuck in bed or stuck on the sofa. It was hell.\" Her mum, Lynn, told Sky News: \"There is nothing that can put Tammy back to where she was now and that's the sad thing. \"If I could just click my fingers and have the child back that I had I would do it with a blink of an eye.\" So far, there's been no confirmation of any wrongdoing in Tammy's care. But her family have a meeting at the hospital this week to find out more. Read more from Sky News:Who are the two MPs deported by Israel?Father and daughter who died in caravan park fire named The trust has asked a panel of specialist clinicians to review all the planned operations carried out by Ms Stohr at Addenbrooke's. One hundred emergency trauma cases will also be looked at. Addenbrooke's is a major regional trauma centre and treats serious emergency patients from all over the region. One clinician at the hospital told Sky News that the review of so many patients was \"creating a lot of extra work\", which was \"slowing things down\" for other patients awaiting treatment. At least one extra locum consultant has been helping the team, as they work through the caseload. Trust apologises Sky News has been told Cambridge University Hospitals Trust had wanted to identify Ms Stohr before but had been threatened with a legal injunction. The trust has apologised unreservedly to families and patients. But what's troubling many is the fact concerns were raised about Ms Stohr a decade ago. Chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, Roland Sinker, has set up another review to examine whether opportunities were missed, and action could have been taken sooner. The Department of Health described the ongoing situation as \"incredibly concerning.\""

        "Content": "An elderly British couple being held in a high security prison in Afghanistan have \"never heard one accusation or one charge\", their son has told Sky News.  Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were detained by the Taliban's interior ministry on 1 February. The couple married in Kabul in 1970 and have lived in Afghanistan for the last 18 years. They run Rebuild, an organisation that provides education and training programmes. Last month, they were moved to a maximum security prison in Kabul. Their son Jonathan, speaking from Chicago, told Sky News that nine weeks on, he cannot say why the couple are still being held, but he and his siblings are extremely worried for their welfare and are asking for help from any possible source. The Taliban's motives in locking his parents up remain unclear, he added. While they have been able to speak to their parents a \"number of times from a pay phone within the prison\" it's been a \"rollercoaster of emotions\", Mr Reynolds said. He explained that within the Afghan prison system, women are fed only once a day, while there is more food for the men. In addition, the women \"have to pay for their own food\". The Qatari government has been able to get medicine and money to the couple - who are being held separately - and Mr Reynolds said he was extremely grateful for the Qataris' help. Regarding possible reasons for the incarceration, Mr Reynolds said: \"I believe there have been 29 investigative interviews with staff members - people they have served and supported - and everything has come up as no credible charges. \"They took a short flight to pick up a Chinese-American friend who has visited multiple times. \"Originally they (authorities) said they didn't have the right paperwork to have a chartered plane, which was incorrect and it was all produced. \"So that was dropped.\" Asked whether his parents had been naive, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think anyone who goes in their 60s and 70s to live and become Afghan citizens is probably not naive to the dangers of it. \"If they wanted to live a quiet, retired life and be around their grandkids they could have done that. \"They are under a deep conviction from back in the late 60s when they married in Afghanistan in 1970 that they were going to give their life for a bright future for Afghanistan.\" He added that when the Taliban took over, the British government offered to get them out, but they replied: \"Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?\" The Reynolds' daughter Sarah says it is the longest they have gone without speaking to each other since becoming \"sweethearts in the 1960s\". While Sarah said her father had lost weight, she added that he can \"find light in the darkest of places\". At the end of February, the Taliban claimed the arrests happened because of a \"misunderstanding\" that the Reynolds had fake Afghan passports. The day before that, the BBC reported the Taliban as saying they would endeavour to release the couple \"as soon as possible\"."

        "Content": "From today, drivers using London's Blackwall Tunnel will have to pay a toll. The charge is being implemented the same day the new Silvertown Tunnel - which will link east London to southeast London - also opens to drivers. For car drivers, a return journey at peak times will cost Â£8, jumping up to Â£13 for large vans. Here is everything you need to know about the new tunnel, the tolls and the decision behind its implementation. What is the Silvertown Tunnel? The 1.4km (just under one mile) long tunnel stretches from Silvertown in Newham, east London, to the Greenwich Peninsula in southeast London. It will run adjacent to the Victorian-era Blackwall Tunnel which takes drivers near The O2 Arena under the River Thames to the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall. The project, which has cost Â£2.2bn, was approved by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, having been first proposed back in 2012. It is being funded through private finance and Transport for London (TfL) will pay back Â£100m a year through money made on the toll. Why was it built? Put simply, the Silvertown Tunnel aims to reduce congestion that currently builds up on the approach to the Blackwall Tunnel - with TfL claiming it will shave 20 minutes off journeys. The government body says the Blackwall Tunnel was never designed to carry the levels of traffic it currently does, leading to more frequent incidents that cause traffic to tailback for miles and negatively impacting air quality. As well as private vehicles, around 21 buses will travel through the new tunnel every hour from 7am until 7pm Monday to Friday, which TfL has said will help to offer new routes for more people. A dedicated bike bus shuttle service will also transport cyclists and their bikes across the river. How much will it cost and how do you pay? Charges will apply to both the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels. How much it costs depends on what you are driving and at what time. Peak hours through the northbound tunnel (going towards central London) will run from 6am to 10am Monday to Friday. For the southbound tunnel (going away from central London) peak hours are 4pm until 7pm Monday to Friday. All other times will be classed as off-peak, including weekends. Take a look at the table below to see the full breakdown of charges. Both tunnels will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll has to be paid by phone or online. The TfL website states the easiest way to pay is to use Auto Pay, which allows people to link their payment cards to an account that will automatically take payment. From Monday, local residents will be able to use cross-river bus routes for free for a year. Residents who are on certain benefits and live in local boroughs will also be eligible for a 50% discount. Why is it so controversial? Ever since the Silvertown Tunnel was given the green light, it has been met with criticism from opposition parties and campaign groups. The Liberal Democrats have argued against the project from the start, claiming Mr Khan hasn't listened to environmental concerns. The party says more roads will lead to more people using them, creating bottlenecks through areas including Greenwich, Blackheath and Eltham.

But TfL maintains the project will \"help to reduce congestion at the Blackwall Tunnel, deliver faster journeys during peak times, help manage overall air quality and allow for better cross-river public transport\"."

        "Content": "The King and Queen have begun a three-day state visit to Italy, where they will celebrate the Catholic jubilee year, an event that only happens every 25 years.Â  The trip will see Charles and Camilla attend a series of public and diplomatic events in the capital, Rome, and the city of Ravenna. This year, Rome expects to welcome three times its normal number of visitors - between 30 and 32 million, compared to an average of 10 million - as Catholics travel to the city for the jubilee, which marks a time of pilgrimage, reflection, and spiritual renewal. The jubilee, also known as the holy year, officially began on 24 December 2024 and will run until 6 January 2026. With major events throughout the year, Rome will be particularly busy - so much so that the UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for tourists planning to travel there. Here is everything you need to know. What is a jubilee? A jubilee year is a time for Catholics to \"re-establish a proper relationship with God, one another and with all of creation\", according to the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Each jubilee year starts with the Pope opening the Holy Doors at St Peter's Basilica on Christmas Eve in the Vatican City. This represents the passage from sin to grace and new beginnings. The pontiff then opens a further four Holy Doors which remain open for the entire year. This jubilee year, the Pope opened San Giovanni in Laterano (St John Lateran) on 29 December, Santa Maria Maggiore (St Mary Major) on 1 January and St Paul's Outside the Walls on 5 January. For the first time, he also opened a Holy Door at a prison. He opened one at Rebibbia new complex prison in Rome on 26 December as a gesture of hope for prisoners. As the pontiff, the Pope has the authority to proclaim any church door as a Holy Door. The goal of pilgrims who travel to Rome during a jubilee year is to pass through at least one of the Holy Doors. Why are the royals going? Despite being head of the Church of England, the King was set to meet the Pope to mark the jubilee year, a meeting that would have also marked \"a significant step forward in relations between the Catholic Church and Church of England\", according to Buckingham Palace. However, due to the 88-year-old pontiff recovering from pneumonia, the private meeting between the two has been postponed. Instead of going to the Holy See - the government of the Roman Catholic Church located in the Vatican - Charles and Camilla will make a historic visit to the Papal Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls and the King will become the first British monarch to address a joint session of the Italian parliament. During the last jubilee, in the year 2000, Queen Elizabeth II met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Can I still travel to Italy this year? Rome is expected to be \"very busy\" throughout this year, particularly when bigger jubilee events take place, the UK Foreign Office (FCDO) has said. In an update on 17 March, it advised Britons wanting to head to Italy, particularly the capital, to plan ahead. The US Embassy in Italy has also updated its website to say: \"Be prepared for crowds and extended wait times for transportation and entry into locations. \"You should book accommodations, transportation, and attraction tickets well in advance of arrival. Rome's public transportation system will be under strain, and regular routes and schedules may change.\" There are events taking place nearly every month, with the most listed for May and June. Events targeted towards specific groups of people, including families, workers, entrepreneurs and disabled people will take place, as well as concerts and special exhibitions in Rome's museums. The FCDO says people wanting to take part in the jubilee or organise a pilgrimage will need a Pilgrim's card. This is free to download and can be obtained on the jubilee website or through the official app. Despite Italy being busier than usual, Rome and other parts of the country are set to look their best for the jubilee, having been under construction nearly all of last year. The capital pulled together billions of euros of state and European funds to overhaul tourist sites, transport hubs, parks, streets and even its rubbish bins. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told Reuters last year that the jubilee was an \"unmissable opportunity to make structural changes... and transform Rome\". A record 3,200 public construction works were scheduled to take place, including 322 projects that were deemed essential for the jubilee. Tips from a tour guide Livia, a European tour guide for operator Scott Dunn, said for people planning to visit the Italian capital this year, \"timing is everything\". She recommends tourists visit major sites such as the Vatican and Colosseum earlier in the morning rather than in the afternoon and on weekdays rather than weekends.

On Wednesday, the King and Queen will also mark their 20th wedding anniversary, as the guests of honour at the traditional state banquet - some would say a far cry from the mixed reception their relationship received in the 1980s and 1990s.

Lithgow, 79, played Roald Dahl in Giant, which is about the children's author wondering whether to make a public apology. While accepting his award he appeared to reference the current controversy over Donald Trump's second term as US president.

His co-star, English actor Elliot Levey, took best actor in a supporting role. Giant was also named best new play. Manville, 69, was honoured for her performance in the Greek tragedy Oedipus at the Wyndham's Theatre. She said she felt \"emotional\" while accepting her statuette because it was a production she had \"felt very strongly about being\" in. Manville, who played Princess Margaret in The Crown, added that she was taking an early flight to Dublin on Monday to do some filming, and would not be getting \"much sleep tonight\". Best actress in a supporting role went to Romola Garai for her performance in The Years, based on a memoir by French writer Annie Ernaux. Garai, whose film credits include Scoop and Atonement, was nominated in the same category for Giant. Dame Imelda Staunton won a fifth Olivier, for best actress in a musical for the London revival of classic musical Hello, Dolly!

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  Until five weeks ago, Arturo SuarezÂ was a professional singer, performing in the United States as he waited for his asylum claim to be processed. Originally from Venezuela, he had entered the US through proper, legal channels. But he is now imprisoned in a notorious jail in El Salvador, sent there by the Trump administration, despite seemingly never having faced trial or committed any crime. The White House claims he is a gang member but has not provided evidence to support this allegation. His brother, Nelson Suarez, told Sky News he believes his brother's only \"crime\" is being Venezuelan and having tattoos. \"He is not a gang member,\" Nelson says, adamantly, \"I've come to the conclusion that it has to be because of the tattoos. If you don't have a criminal record, you haven't committed any crime in the United States, what other reason could there be? Because you're Venezuelan?\" Arturo, 34, was recording a music video inside a house in March when he was arrested by immigration agents. He was first taken to a deportation centre in El Paso, Texas, and then, it appears, put on to a military flight to El Salvador. \n                  International stock markets tumble as Trump calls tariffs 'medicine'\n                 \n                  Starmer to announce more support for businesses as Trump tariffs take hold\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer pledges to protect UK companies from Trump tariff 'storm'\n                 His family have not heard from him since. Lawyers and immigrant rights groups have been unable to make contact with any of the more than 200 Venezuelan men sent to the CECOT prison, which holds members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs. Tattoo clue to Arturo Suarez's whereabouts Nelson learned his brother is - most likely - in CECOT only because of a photograph he spotted on a news website of a group of inmates, with their hands and feet cuffed, heads shaved and bodies shackled together. \"You can see the hummingbird tattoo on his neck,\" Nelson says, pointing to the picture. He says Arturo wanted a hummingbird in memory of their late mother. Arturo has 33 tattoos in total, including a piano, poems and verses from the Bible. It could be that one, or more, of those tattoos landed him at the centre of President Trump's anti-immigration showpiece. Nelson shows me documents which indicate that Arturo did not have a criminal record in Venezuela, Chile, Colombia or the United States, the four countries he has lived in. Sky News contacted the White House, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a response to Arturo's case but have not heard back. In March, Donald Trump signed the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 which has been invoked just three times before, in wartime. It allows the president to detain and deport immigrants living legally in the US if they are from countries deemed \"enemies\" of the government. In this instance, Mr Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had \"infiltrated the United States\" and was \"conducting irregular warfare\". Gang symbol tattoos Immigration officials have centred on certain tattoos being gang symbols. Immigration officers were provided with a document called the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\", according to a court filing from the American Civil Liberties Union. The document provides a point-based system to determine if an immigrant in custody \"may be validated\" as a gang member. Migrants who score six points and higher may be designated as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, according to the document. Tattoos which fall under a \"symbolism\" category score four points and social media posts \"displaying\" gang symbols are two points. Tattoos considered suspicious, according to the document, include crowns, stars and the Michael Jordan Jumpman logo. Jerce Reyes Barrios's story Another of the men sent to CECOT prison is 36-year-old Jerce Reyes Barrios, who fled Venezuela last year after marching in anti-government protests. He is a former footballer and football coach. His lawyer, Linette Tobin, told Sky News that Reyes Barrios entered the US legally after waiting in Mexico for four months for an immigration appointment and then presenting himself at the border. She says he was detained in a maximum security prison in the US while awaiting his asylum appointment. But before that appointment happened, he was flown to the El Salvador prison. Ms Tobin says the DHS deported Reyes Barrios because they designated him a Tren De Aragua gang member based on two pieces of evidence. The first, she says, is a tattoo of the Real Madrid football team logo surrounded by rosary beads. She has since obtained a declaration from the tattoo artist stating that Reyes Barrios just wanted an image which depicted his favourite team. The second piece of evidence, she says, is a photograph, which she shows me, of Reyes Barrios in a hot tub with friends when he was a college student 13 years ago. He is making a gesture which could be interpreted as \"rock and roll\", but which she says has been interpreted as a gang symbol. Distraught family in despair Reyes Barrios has no criminal record in his home country. \"I've never known anything like this,\" Ms Tobin says. \"My client was deported to a third country and we have no way of getting in touch with him. His family are distraught and in despair, they cry a lot, not knowing what is going on with him. We want him returned to the United States to have a hearing and due process.\" Ms Tobin says she and other lawyers representing men sent to the El Salvador prison are trying to establish a UN working group on enforced disappearances to do a wellness check on them because the prison is completely \"incommunicado\".  Sky News contacted the DHS for comment about Reyes Barrios's case but did not receive a response. The DHS previously issued a statement declaring that \"DHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang-affiliated tattoos. This man's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua\". Reyes Barrios has an immigration hearing scheduled for 17 April, Ms Tobin says, which the Trump administration is trying to dismiss on the grounds that he is not in the US anymore. In the meantime, children he used to coach football for in his hometown of Machiques in Venezuela have been holding a prayer vigil for him and calling for his release. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, visited CECOT last month and posed for photos standing in front of inmates behind bars. \"Do not come to our country illegally,\" she said, \"you will be removed, and you will be prosecuted.\" Donald Trump had promised during his election campaign to clamp down on immigration, railing against undocumented immigrants and claiming immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". I ask Arturo Suarez's brother, Nelson, how he felt watching Ms Noem posing in the prison, knowing that his brother might be close by. \"I feel bad,\" he says, \"I feel horrible, because in those images we only see criminals. With my brother, I feel it is more a political issue. They needed numbers, they said, these are the numbers, and now, let's throw them to the lions.\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story The Trump administration has admitted that at least one man sent to the El Salvador jail was sent by \"administrative error\". Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was living in Maryland, was sent to CECOT despite a judge's earlier ruling in 2019 that granted him legal protection to stay in the US. The White House has alleged Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers argued there is no evidence to prove this. ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð A federal judge has ordered Garcia must be returned to the US by Monday 7 April. In a post on X, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to the judge as a \"Marxist\", who \"now thinks she's president of El Salvador\". White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We suggest the judge contact President Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.\""

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  Marine Le Pen made one thing abundantly clear. She is not going quietly. She may have been disgraced in a Paris courtroom, convicted of embezzlement, sentenced and barred from office for five years. But there was no sense of shame or regret in her speech to the party faithful. Nor would you expect there to be. She is the victim of an establishment stitch-up, she believes, or claims to, and the crowds watching her speak in the French capital heartily agreed. The hard-right National Rally party's leader was found guilty of being part of a huge and orchestrated campaign to swindle the European parliament and its taxpayers, using phony accounts to raise millions.  The judge in the case saw a politician who had long campaigned for tougher penalties for corrupt politicians and decided it only fitting to throw the book at her. For political foes, watching their most feared enemy sent off the pitch, is all very welcome. Former prime minister Gabriel Attal told supporters at another rally she stole money and should do the punishment. But even Le Pen's rivals are queasy about the five-year ban from office. Some legal observers believe the judge went too far. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the case, it does nothing to ease the country's political crisis. Nothing to address the festering sense of un-enfranchised grievance on the fringes of society that helped propel Le Pen to such popularity in the first place.

Not surprisingly, her speech was preceded by a series of short videos from other rightist populists, from Mateo Salvini in Italy to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. In America, Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk have also pitched in. Le Pen may have been banished into the political wilderness but can still cause enormous trouble from there."

Despite being head of the Church of England, the King was set to meet the Pope to mark the jubilee year, a meeting that would have also marked \"a significant step forward in relations between the Catholic Church and Church of England\", according to Buckingham Palace. However, due to the 88-year-old pontiff recovering from pneumonia, the private meeting between the two has been postponed. Instead of going to the Holy See - the government of the Roman Catholic Church located in the Vatican - Charles and Camilla will make a historic visit to the Papal Basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls and the King will become the first British monarch to address a joint session of the Italian parliament. During the last jubilee, in the year 2000, Queen Elizabeth II met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Can I still travel to Italy this year? Rome is expected to be \"very busy\" throughout this year, particularly when bigger jubilee events take place, the UK Foreign Office (FCDO) has said. In an update on 17 March, it advised Britons wanting to head to Italy, particularly the capital, to plan ahead. The US Embassy in Italy has also updated its website to say: \"Be prepared for crowds and extended wait times for transportation and entry into locations. \"You should book accommodations, transportation, and attraction tickets well in advance of arrival. Rome's public transportation system will be under strain, and regular routes and schedules may change.\" There are events taking place nearly every month, with the most listed for May and June. Events targeted towards specific groups of people, including families, workers, entrepreneurs and disabled people will take place, as well as concerts and special exhibitions in Rome's museums. The FCDO says people wanting to take part in the jubilee or organise a pilgrimage will need a Pilgrim's card. This is free to download and can be obtained on the jubilee website or through the official app. Despite Italy being busier than usual, Rome and other parts of the country are set to look their best for the jubilee, having been under construction nearly all of last year. The capital pulled together billions of euros of state and European funds to overhaul tourist sites, transport hubs, parks, streets and even its rubbish bins. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told Reuters last year that the jubilee was an \"unmissable opportunity to make structural changes... and transform Rome\". A record 3,200 public construction works were scheduled to take place, including 322 projects that were deemed essential for the jubilee. Tips from a tour guide Livia, a European tour guide for operator Scott Dunn, said for people planning to visit the Italian capital this year, \"timing is everything\". She recommends tourists visit major sites such as the Vatican and Colosseum earlier in the morning rather than in the afternoon and on weekdays rather than weekends.

        "Content": " The Pope has appeared before cheering crowds at the Vatican. It was the pontiff's first official public appearance since he was released from hospital a fortnight ago. Pope Francis, 88, had spent five weeks in Rome's Gemelli hospital as he was treated by doctors for a life-threatening bout of double pneumonia. The Pope, in what was a previously unannounced move, entered St Peter's Square in a wheelchair shortly before noon local time at the end of the celebration of a mass for the Catholic Church's Jubilee year. In front of the main altar for the service, Francis waved to applauding crowds, before briefly talking. Speaking in a frail voice while receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula, he said: \"Happy Sunday to everyone. Thank you so much.\" A message prepared by the Pope and released by the Vatican said he felt the \"caring touch\" of God. \n                  Catholic jubilee: What is it, why are the King and Queen going and should you still travel to Italy?\n                 \n                  King and Queen's state visit to Vatican postponed as Pope recovers from illness, palace says\n                 \n                  After Pope's balcony appearance, it's clear the papacy will never be the same again\n                 \"On the day of the jubilee of the sick and the world of healthcare, I ask the Lord that this touch of his love may reach those who suffer and encourage those who care for them,\" it read. \"And I pray for doctors, nurses and health workers, who are not always helped to work in adequate conditions and are sometimes even victims of aggression.\" Read more from Sky News:Furious row after Labour MPs denied entry to IsraelArrest over wildfire that triggered 'major incident' in Northern Ireland Francis had been out of public view since 23 March, when he had given a short greeting before being discharged from hospital. The pontiff's voice sounded stronger this time than when he addressed well-wishers outside Gemelli and struggled to speak. Francis usually offers a weekly noon-time prayer in St Peter's Square on Sundays. But he has not been able to do this since 9 February, before going to hospital. He was admitted to Gemelli on 14 February for a bout of bronchitis that developed into double pneumonia. This is a particularly serious condition for him as he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed."

        "Content": "An elderly British couple being held in a high security prison in Afghanistan have \"never heard one accusation or one charge\", their son has told Sky News.  Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were detained by the Taliban's interior ministry on 1 February. The couple married in Kabul in 1970 and have lived in Afghanistan for the last 18 years. They run Rebuild, an organisation that provides education and training programmes. Last month, they were moved to a maximum security prison in Kabul. Their son Jonathan, speaking from Chicago, told Sky News that nine weeks on, he cannot say why the couple are still being held, but he and his siblings are extremely worried for their welfare and are asking for help from any possible source. The Taliban's motives in locking his parents up remain unclear, he added. While they have been able to speak to their parents a \"number of times from a pay phone within the prison\" it's been a \"rollercoaster of emotions\", Mr Reynolds said. He explained that within the Afghan prison system, women are fed only once a day, while there is more food for the men. In addition, the women \"have to pay for their own food\". The Qatari government has been able to get medicine and money to the couple - who are being held separately - and Mr Reynolds said he was extremely grateful for the Qataris' help. Regarding possible reasons for the incarceration, Mr Reynolds said: \"I believe there have been 29 investigative interviews with staff members - people they have served and supported - and everything has come up as no credible charges. \"They took a short flight to pick up a Chinese-American friend who has visited multiple times. \"Originally they (authorities) said they didn't have the right paperwork to have a chartered plane, which was incorrect and it was all produced. \"So that was dropped.\" Asked whether his parents had been naive, Mr Reynolds said: \"I think anyone who goes in their 60s and 70s to live and become Afghan citizens is probably not naive to the dangers of it. \"If they wanted to live a quiet, retired life and be around their grandkids they could have done that. \"They are under a deep conviction from back in the late 60s when they married in Afghanistan in 1970 that they were going to give their life for a bright future for Afghanistan.\" He added that when the Taliban took over, the British government offered to get them out, but they replied: \"Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?\" The Reynolds' daughter Sarah says it is the longest they have gone without speaking to each other since becoming \"sweethearts in the 1960s\". While Sarah said her father had lost weight, she added that he can \"find light in the darkest of places\". At the end of February, the Taliban claimed the arrests happened because of a \"misunderstanding\" that the Reynolds had fake Afghan passports. The day before that, the BBC reported the Taliban as saying they would endeavour to release the couple \"as soon as possible\"."

South Sudan's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment by the Reuters news agency. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, but the world's youngest nation has been plagued by conflict and instability ever since. Its political landscape remains fragile and recent violence between government troops and armed opposition groups has escalated tensions. In late March, the country's opposition leader Riek Machar was arrested by President Salva Kiir's government forces in a move that the United Nations has warned could risk fresh civil war. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged regional and international leaders to prevent the country falling \"over the abyss\". African Union mediators arrived in the capital Juba this week to try to avert the crisis. Mr Machar was placed under house arrest after fighting in the north of the country between the White Army - an armed group he has been linked to - and government forces. Many of his senior allies have also been arrested by the security forces, which Mr Machar's supporters described as a \"grave violation\" of the 2018 peace deal that ended the last civil war. Earlier this year, tensions reached boiling point when the White Army stormed a military base in Upper Nile state and attacked a UN helicopter. Government forces responded with air strikes.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  Until five weeks ago, Arturo SuarezÂ was a professional singer, performing in the United States as he waited for his asylum claim to be processed. Originally from Venezuela, he had entered the US through proper, legal channels. But he is now imprisoned in a notorious jail in El Salvador, sent there by the Trump administration, despite seemingly never having faced trial or committed any crime. The White House claims he is a gang member but has not provided evidence to support this allegation. His brother, Nelson Suarez, told Sky News he believes his brother's only \"crime\" is being Venezuelan and having tattoos. \"He is not a gang member,\" Nelson says, adamantly, \"I've come to the conclusion that it has to be because of the tattoos. If you don't have a criminal record, you haven't committed any crime in the United States, what other reason could there be? Because you're Venezuelan?\" Arturo, 34, was recording a music video inside a house in March when he was arrested by immigration agents. He was first taken to a deportation centre in El Paso, Texas, and then, it appears, put on to a military flight to El Salvador. \n                  International stock markets tumble as Trump calls tariffs 'medicine'\n                 \n                  Starmer to announce more support for businesses as Trump tariffs take hold\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer pledges to protect UK companies from Trump tariff 'storm'\n                 His family have not heard from him since. Lawyers and immigrant rights groups have been unable to make contact with any of the more than 200 Venezuelan men sent to the CECOT prison, which holds members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs. Tattoo clue to Arturo Suarez's whereabouts Nelson learned his brother is - most likely - in CECOT only because of a photograph he spotted on a news website of a group of inmates, with their hands and feet cuffed, heads shaved and bodies shackled together. \"You can see the hummingbird tattoo on his neck,\" Nelson says, pointing to the picture. He says Arturo wanted a hummingbird in memory of their late mother. Arturo has 33 tattoos in total, including a piano, poems and verses from the Bible. It could be that one, or more, of those tattoos landed him at the centre of President Trump's anti-immigration showpiece. Nelson shows me documents which indicate that Arturo did not have a criminal record in Venezuela, Chile, Colombia or the United States, the four countries he has lived in. Sky News contacted the White House, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a response to Arturo's case but have not heard back. In March, Donald Trump signed the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 which has been invoked just three times before, in wartime. It allows the president to detain and deport immigrants living legally in the US if they are from countries deemed \"enemies\" of the government. In this instance, Mr Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had \"infiltrated the United States\" and was \"conducting irregular warfare\". Gang symbol tattoos Immigration officials have centred on certain tattoos being gang symbols. Immigration officers were provided with a document called the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\", according to a court filing from the American Civil Liberties Union. The document provides a point-based system to determine if an immigrant in custody \"may be validated\" as a gang member. Migrants who score six points and higher may be designated as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, according to the document. Tattoos which fall under a \"symbolism\" category score four points and social media posts \"displaying\" gang symbols are two points. Tattoos considered suspicious, according to the document, include crowns, stars and the Michael Jordan Jumpman logo. Jerce Reyes Barrios's story Another of the men sent to CECOT prison is 36-year-old Jerce Reyes Barrios, who fled Venezuela last year after marching in anti-government protests. He is a former footballer and football coach. His lawyer, Linette Tobin, told Sky News that Reyes Barrios entered the US legally after waiting in Mexico for four months for an immigration appointment and then presenting himself at the border. She says he was detained in a maximum security prison in the US while awaiting his asylum appointment. But before that appointment happened, he was flown to the El Salvador prison. Ms Tobin says the DHS deported Reyes Barrios because they designated him a Tren De Aragua gang member based on two pieces of evidence. The first, she says, is a tattoo of the Real Madrid football team logo surrounded by rosary beads. She has since obtained a declaration from the tattoo artist stating that Reyes Barrios just wanted an image which depicted his favourite team. The second piece of evidence, she says, is a photograph, which she shows me, of Reyes Barrios in a hot tub with friends when he was a college student 13 years ago. He is making a gesture which could be interpreted as \"rock and roll\", but which she says has been interpreted as a gang symbol. Distraught family in despair Reyes Barrios has no criminal record in his home country. \"I've never known anything like this,\" Ms Tobin says. \"My client was deported to a third country and we have no way of getting in touch with him. His family are distraught and in despair, they cry a lot, not knowing what is going on with him. We want him returned to the United States to have a hearing and due process.\" Ms Tobin says she and other lawyers representing men sent to the El Salvador prison are trying to establish a UN working group on enforced disappearances to do a wellness check on them because the prison is completely \"incommunicado\".  Sky News contacted the DHS for comment about Reyes Barrios's case but did not receive a response. The DHS previously issued a statement declaring that \"DHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang-affiliated tattoos. This man's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua\". Reyes Barrios has an immigration hearing scheduled for 17 April, Ms Tobin says, which the Trump administration is trying to dismiss on the grounds that he is not in the US anymore. In the meantime, children he used to coach football for in his hometown of Machiques in Venezuela have been holding a prayer vigil for him and calling for his release. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, visited CECOT last month and posed for photos standing in front of inmates behind bars. \"Do not come to our country illegally,\" she said, \"you will be removed, and you will be prosecuted.\" Donald Trump had promised during his election campaign to clamp down on immigration, railing against undocumented immigrants and claiming immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". I ask Arturo Suarez's brother, Nelson, how he felt watching Ms Noem posing in the prison, knowing that his brother might be close by. \"I feel bad,\" he says, \"I feel horrible, because in those images we only see criminals. With my brother, I feel it is more a political issue. They needed numbers, they said, these are the numbers, and now, let's throw them to the lions.\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story The Trump administration has admitted that at least one man sent to the El Salvador jail was sent by \"administrative error\". Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was living in Maryland, was sent to CECOT despite a judge's earlier ruling in 2019 that granted him legal protection to stay in the US. The White House has alleged Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers argued there is no evidence to prove this. ð Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app ð A federal judge has ordered Garcia must be returned to the US by Monday 7 April. In a post on X, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to the judge as a \"Marxist\", who \"now thinks she's president of El Salvador\". White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We suggest the judge contact President Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.\""

        "Content": " Sir Keir Starmer has said his government stands ready to use industrial policy to \"shelter British business from the storm\" after Donald Trump's new 10% tariff kicked in. The UK was among a number of countries hit with the lowest import duty rate following the president's announcement on 2 April - which he called 'Liberation Day', while other nations, such as Vietnam, Cambodia and China face much higher US levies. But a global trade war will hurt the UK's open economy. The prime minister said \"these new times demand a new mentality\", after the 10% tax on British imports into America came into force on Saturday. A 25% US levy on all foreign car imports was introduced on Thursday. It comes as Jaguar Land Rover announced it would \"pause\" shipments to the US for a month, as firms grapple with the new taxes. On Saturday, the car manufacturer said it was working to \"address the new trading terms\" and was looking to \"develop our mid to longer-term plans\".  Referring to the tariffs, Sir Keir said \"the immediate priority is to keep calm and fight for the best deal\". Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he said that in the coming days \"we will turbocharge plans that will improve our domestic competitiveness\", adding: \"We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm.\" It is believed a number of announcements could be made soon as ministers look to encourage growth. NI contribution rate for employers goes up From Sunday, the rate of employer NICs (national insurance contributions) increased from 13.8% to 15%. At the same time, firms will also pay more because the government lowered the salary threshold at which companies start paying NICs from Â£9,100 to Â£5,000. Also, the FTSE 100 of leading UK companies had its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic on Friday, with banks among some of the firms to suffer the sharpest losses. Sir Keir said: \"This week, the government will do everything necessary to protect Britain's national interest. Because when global economic sands are shifting, our laser focus on delivering for Britain will not. And these new times demand a new mentality.\"  UK spared highest tariff rates Some of the highest rates have been applied to \"worst offender\" countries including some in Southeast Asia. Imports from Cambodia will be subject to a 49% tariff, while those from Vietnam will face a 46% rate. Chinese goods will be hit with a 34% tariff. Imports from France will have a 20% tariff, the rate which has been set for European Union nations. These will come into effect on 9 April.

Some 62% of UK firms with trade exposure to the US are being negatively impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. Its survey of more than 600 businesses also found 32% of firms with trade exposure to the US said they will increase prices in response. The survey also found 41% of firms with no exposure to the USA said they would be negatively impacted by the tariffs. Some 44% of firms with exposure to the US said the UK should seek to negotiate a closer trade relationship with the US, while 43% said they wanted closer trade with other markets. Just under a quarter (21%) said they thought the UK should impose retaliatory tariffs. The survey also found that 40% of firms considered the 10% tariffs to be better than they had expected. It comes as KPMG warned US tariffs on UK exports could see GDP growth fall to 0.8% in 2025 and 2026. The accountancy firm said higher tariffs on specific categories, such as cars, aluminium and steel, would more than offset the exemption on pharmaceutical exports, leaving the effective tariffs imposed on UK exports at around 12%. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"Given the economic impact that tariffs would cause, there is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs. The UK automotive manufacturing sector is particularly exposed given the complex supply chains of some producers.\""

Sky News understands that Ecotricity, Mr Vince's company, has hired KPMG to explore talks with prospective investors or buyers for the project at Heckington Fen in Lincolnshire. The development was approved by Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, earlier this year, and when completed it is expected to generate roughly 600MW of solar power. It has been designated a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project by the government. Heckington Fen will also provide 400MW of battery storage capacity. According to documents circulated to potential bidders, Ecotricity is prioritising the sale of 100% of the project, but is open to retaining a minority stake. The company wants to complete a deal during the third quarter of the year. \n                  Starmer promises 'bold changes' to rules over electric cars in wake of Trump's tariffs\n                 \n                  Tariffs latest: Trump economic adviser explains why US put tariffs on islands only inhabited by penguins\n                 \n                  Tolls on Blackwall Tunnel and new Silvertown Tunnel begin - what you need to know\n                 Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, Mr Vince said: \"Heckington Fen is a fabulous opportunity; it's also a massive one, possibly the biggest onshore renewable initiative in Britain. \"The project is shovel-ready with a grid connection in 2028 - something which is increasingly hard to find these days. \"Whilst this is a great project which is going to go ahead, the sums of money required to build this alone in a short timeframe, means we're looking for investors or partners to help make this happen.\""

        "Content": "From today, drivers using London's Blackwall Tunnel will have to pay a toll. The charge is being implemented the same day the new Silvertown Tunnel - which will link east London to southeast London - also opens to drivers. For car drivers, a return journey at peak times will cost Â£8, jumping up to Â£13 for large vans. Here is everything you need to know about the new tunnel, the tolls and the decision behind its implementation. What is the Silvertown Tunnel? The 1.4km (just under one mile) long tunnel stretches from Silvertown in Newham, east London, to the Greenwich Peninsula in southeast London. It will run adjacent to the Victorian-era Blackwall Tunnel which takes drivers near The O2 Arena under the River Thames to the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall. The project, which has cost Â£2.2bn, was approved by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, having been first proposed back in 2012. It is being funded through private finance and Transport for London (TfL) will pay back Â£100m a year through money made on the toll. Why was it built? Put simply, the Silvertown Tunnel aims to reduce congestion that currently builds up on the approach to the Blackwall Tunnel - with TfL claiming it will shave 20 minutes off journeys. The government body says the Blackwall Tunnel was never designed to carry the levels of traffic it currently does, leading to more frequent incidents that cause traffic to tailback for miles and negatively impacting air quality. As well as private vehicles, around 21 buses will travel through the new tunnel every hour from 7am until 7pm Monday to Friday, which TfL has said will help to offer new routes for more people. A dedicated bike bus shuttle service will also transport cyclists and their bikes across the river. How much will it cost and how do you pay? Charges will apply to both the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels. How much it costs depends on what you are driving and at what time. Peak hours through the northbound tunnel (going towards central London) will run from 6am to 10am Monday to Friday. For the southbound tunnel (going away from central London) peak hours are 4pm until 7pm Monday to Friday. All other times will be classed as off-peak, including weekends. Take a look at the table below to see the full breakdown of charges. Both tunnels will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll has to be paid by phone or online. The TfL website states the easiest way to pay is to use Auto Pay, which allows people to link their payment cards to an account that will automatically take payment. From Monday, local residents will be able to use cross-river bus routes for free for a year. Residents who are on certain benefits and live in local boroughs will also be eligible for a 50% discount. Why is it so controversial? Ever since the Silvertown Tunnel was given the green light, it has been met with criticism from opposition parties and campaign groups. The Liberal Democrats have argued against the project from the start, claiming Mr Khan hasn't listened to environmental concerns. The party says more roads will lead to more people using them, creating bottlenecks through areas including Greenwich, Blackheath and Eltham.

But TfL maintains the project will \"help to reduce congestion at the Blackwall Tunnel, deliver faster journeys during peak times, help manage overall air quality and allow for better cross-river public transport\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce more support for businesses after Donald Trump's 10% tariffs kicked in on Saturday, a senior minister has told Sky News. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: \"There'll be further announcements from the prime minister this week on support for British business.\" Mr Jones said Sir Keir has been \"clear that he's unhappy about the tariffs\" but it is essential the UK reacts in a \"cool-headed and calm way\". He added the prime minister was clear in an article he wrote for The Sunday Telegraph he thinks globalisation has failed in the current context, and the government needs to go \"further and faster\" in supporting British industry and the economy. Sir Keir promised to \"shelter British business from the storm\" and wrote \"these new times demand a new mentality\". The government has said it is continuing to negotiate with the US after it failed to come to an agreement by Wednesday last week, when Mr Trump placed 10% tariffs on all UK exports to the US. Many other countries fared worse, with the European Union having 20% tariffs imposed on goods, and China 34%. Mr Jones said while many other countries were also given 10% tariffs, \"other large, complex economies\" like the UK were given much higher tariffs. He said that was down to Sir Keir having a \"good relationship\" with Mr Trump and trade teams negotiating for months beforehand. \"It was a vindication of our engagement with the United States in the run up to the president's announcements,\" he said. \"But clearly we don't like tariffs. We're not happy about that.\" Mr Trump had suggested Sir Keir was \"very happy\" with the 10% tariffs, but Mr Jones said he thought the president was referring to the fact the UK had lower tariffs than others. Tariffs are Brexit dividend The minister said he believes the UK can broker a good deal with both the US and the EU. He admitted it was a \"Brexit dividend\" that meant the UK got off better than the EU. \"It's good, but what we're not going to do is pick or trade off the United States or the European Union,\" he said. Read more:Furious row after Labour MPs deported from IsraelStarmer pledges to shelter British business from the tariff storm  No chlorinated chicken The minister was also insistent the UK would not allow less strict US food standards as part of a deal. \"I have been really clear we will not have chlorinated chicken in the UK,\" he said. Sir Keir earlier this week said \"nothing is off the table\" in reference to potential retaliatory tariffs, however, Mr Jones appeared confident a deal could be made. Global markets fall On Friday, China introduced 34% additional tariffs on all goods imported from the US after calling the 34% duty placed on its goods \"bullying\". The tariffs have caused global markets to plummet, with the UK's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closing more than 7% lower on Friday than Monday - it's worst day of trading since the start of the COVID pandemic. Almost $5tn (Â£4tn) was wiped off the value of global stock markets since Mr Trump's announcement on Wednesday, analysts calculated."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n De La Rue, the Bank of England's currency printer, is closing in on the Â£300m sale of one of its two core businesses â a move that will pave the way for a takeover of its remaining operations.\n Sky News has learnt that De La Rue is expected to announce to the London Stock Exchange as soon as Monday morning that it has received agreement on a binding offer for its authentication arm from Crane NXT, the US-listed group. Banking sources said the deal - first announced last October - was now expected to be completed at the end of this month. The sale of the authentication division, which works with government clients by providing traceability software to help detect fraud, will leave De La Rue locked in talks with potential buyers of its market-leading currency printing business. De La Rue is running a formal sale process under Takeover Panel rules, with a string of parties said to have expressed an interest in it since the period began late last year. Among its potential suitors has been Edi Truell, the prominent City financier and pensions entrepreneur. De La Rue's directors, led by chairman Clive Whiley, have been exploring several alternatives to maximise value for long-suffering shareholders, including a standalone sale of the currency-printing business or other proposals to acquire the entire company. \n                  Starmer promises 'bold changes' to rules over electric cars in wake of Trump's tariffs\n                 \n                  Tariffs latest: Trump economic adviser explains why US put tariffs on islands only inhabited by penguins\n                 \n                  Eco-tycoon Vince weighs sale of solar energy project\n                 Its balance sheet has been under strain for years. In 2023, De La Rue was forced to seek breathing space from its pension trustees by deferring tens of millions of pounds of payments into its retirement pot. Soon after that, the company parachuted in Mr Whiley, a seasoned corporate troubleshooter, as chairman, with a mandate to repair its battered finances. Since then, its stock has recovered strongly and is up 31% over the last year. Its banknote printing arm is one of the world's market leaders in the sector, and has contracts with leading central banks around the world. In recent years, the British company has been beset by a series of corporate mishaps, including a string of profit warnings, a public row with its auditor and challenges in its operations in countries including India and Kenya. De La Rue traces its roots back to 1813, when Thomas De La Rue established a printing business. Eight years later, he began producing straw hats and then moved into printing stationery, according to an official history of the company. Its first paper money was produced for the government of Mauritius in 1860, and in 1914 it began printing 10-shilling notes for the UK government on the outbreak of the First World War. A De La Rue spokesman declined to comment on Sunday evening."

        "Content": " Two Labour MPs have been left \"astounded\" after they were refused entry to Israel. A political row erupted after news of Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed's deportation broke late on Saturday. The Israeli immigration ministry accused them of planning to \"document the activities of the security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred\". UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the move as \"disgraceful\". Here we look at who the two Labour MPs are - and what they have said about Israel's war in Gaza. Yuan Yang Yuan Yang, 35, moved to the UK from China at the age of four - and is the first China-born MP in the House of Commons. She was a journalist before she was chosen as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the newly created constituency of Earley and Woodley in Berkshire in 2023. Her family had lived there for 14 years beforehand. Ms Yang worked for the Financial Times as their deputy Beijing bureau chief, economics correspondent, and Europe-China correspondent. She also made regular appearances on BBC News. She co-founded Rethinking Economics, a non-profit campaign to promote students being able to choose different schools of thought on economics. She won her seat in the 2024 election by 18,209 votes. Just before she was elected, in May 2024, her book, Private Revolutions, was published about four women born in China in the 1980s and 1990s coming of age in a society changed beyond recognition. She identifies as a Quaker, has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government's 2020 Hong Kong national security law, and backed the rights of Hong Kongers in the UK. What has she said about Israel-Gaza?  Since entering Commons for the first time in July last year - Ms Yang has only spoken on Israel-Gaza once. On 16 January, after a ceasefire deal was declared, she called on the government to ensure journalists could continue to work safely in Gaza. \"The ceasefire deal gives families in Israel and Palestine, as well as their relatives in my constituency, hope for longer-lasting peace and security,\" she said. \"However, there can be no security without accountability, and there is no accountability without scrutiny. This war has been the deadliest on record for journalists, so what can the government do to ensure that all journalists in Palestine, including my former colleagues, can do their job without fear for their lives?\" On 28 February she tweeted on the same issue, claiming \"many\" of her former colleagues have been \"repeatedly denied entry into the region\". She stressed that: \"Palestinian journalists stuck in Gaza have been working in deadly conditions and fear being targeted while working. Media freedom and access is a core part of democracy, and reporters must be allowed into Gaza to be able to accurately report on the continued humanitarian situation.\" She welcomed Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy's intervention on the issue. In December, she met commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) on his visit to Parliament. The Israeli government has strenuously denied targeting journalists during the conflict with Hamas in Gaza.  Abtisam Mohamed Abtisam Mohamed also entered parliament for the first time last year, winning her Sheffield Central seat with a 26.1% majority. Having moved to the UK at the age of two, she is also the first Yemeni woman to be elected as a British MP. She was raised in a conservative family - with traditional views on the place of women and girls. She gained four GCSEs but after finishing school she went back to Yemen and received the qualifications to study further, qualifying as a teacher, then a lawyer. She initially became a community worker then a solicitor, establishing her own human rights and immigration practice working. In 2016,Ms Mohamed became a local councillor and was selected as the Sheffield Central Labour candidate over comedian Eddie Izzard and former BBC Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason. She is a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee.  What has she said on Israel-Gaza? Despite only being in the Commons since July, Ms Mohamed has spoken on Israel-Gaza five times. Most recently she gave a short speech on events in Gaza on the first day of Eid al Fitr - 30 March. She described Israel's actions there as \"war crimes\" and \"crimes against humanity\" and urged ministers to condemn them. Israel has rejected war crime accusations. Ms Mohamed said the world is witnessing \"forced displacement\", \"ethnic cleansing\", \"the complete destruction of Gaza\", and \"permanent occupation of Gaza and the West Bank\". Israel denies ethnic cleansing and says evacuation orders in Gaza are designed to protect civilians from its operations against Hamas. On 17 February, Ms Mohamed tweeted to say she had spearheaded a cross-party call from 61 MPs for a UK ban on Israeli goods. She said: \"The ICJ's [International Court of Justice] advisory opinion has said that third party states shouldn't aid or assist Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. \"Importing goods from settlements gives them legitimacy and further entrenches the occupation.\" The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last year that Israel's settlement policy in occupied Palestinian territories was in breach of international law. Israel did not send a legal team to the hearings but, in written comments, said questions put to the court were prejudiced and failed to address its security concerns. Responding to Donald Trump's plans for a \"Gaza riviera\" in February, Ms Mohamed tweeted a clip of the president with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying: \"What kind of world do we live in when the war crime of forcible displacement/ethnic cleansing is so openly discussed?\" Read more from Sky NewsLabour MP arrested on suspicion of child sex offencesJon Craig: The highs and lows of five-year KeirWhy are Birmingham bin workers striking? In January, she retweeted a news article about Loose Women panellist Nadia Sawalha who \"questioned why the media, celebrities and influencers worldwide have not responded to events in Gaza with the same urgency as they have to the LA fires\". In January, she spoke again in the Commons to say \"ethnic cleansing is taking place before our very eyes, and the world remains silent\" - and to call on the government to urge Israel to allow evacuated Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. Israel has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing or forcible displacement in Gaza. In November last year, Ms Mohamed praised the International Criminal Court (ICC)'s decision to pursue South Africa's case against Israel for crimes against humanity, describing it as a \"crucial step\". Israel denies all the accusations. On 15 October last year, she stood up in the Commons to speak on Gaza for the first time, condemning the \"totally inexcusable\" actions of Israel - blocking food deliveries into northern Gaza and \"using starvation as a weapon of war\". Israel has said Hamas militants use aid deliveries, hospitals, and other civilian targets to hide."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce more support for businesses after Donald Trump's 10% tariffs kicked in on Saturday, a senior minister has told Sky News. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: \"There'll be further announcements from the prime minister this week on support for British business.\" Mr Jones said Sir Keir has been \"clear that he's unhappy about the tariffs\" but it is essential the UK reacts in a \"cool-headed and calm way\". He added the prime minister was clear in an article he wrote for The Sunday Telegraph he thinks globalisation has failed in the current context, and the government needs to go \"further and faster\" in supporting British industry and the economy. Sir Keir promised to \"shelter British business from the storm\" and wrote \"these new times demand a new mentality\". The government has said it is continuing to negotiate with the US after it failed to come to an agreement by Wednesday last week, when Mr Trump placed 10% tariffs on all UK exports to the US. Many other countries fared worse, with the European Union having 20% tariffs imposed on goods, and China 34%. Mr Jones said while many other countries were also given 10% tariffs, \"other large, complex economies\" like the UK were given much higher tariffs. He said that was down to Sir Keir having a \"good relationship\" with Mr Trump and trade teams negotiating for months beforehand. \"It was a vindication of our engagement with the United States in the run up to the president's announcements,\" he said. \"But clearly we don't like tariffs. We're not happy about that.\" Mr Trump had suggested Sir Keir was \"very happy\" with the 10% tariffs, but Mr Jones said he thought the president was referring to the fact the UK had lower tariffs than others. Tariffs are Brexit dividend The minister said he believes the UK can broker a good deal with both the US and the EU. He admitted it was a \"Brexit dividend\" that meant the UK got off better than the EU. \"It's good, but what we're not going to do is pick or trade off the United States or the European Union,\" he said.

Sir Keir earlier this week said \"nothing is off the table\" in reference to potential retaliatory tariffs, however, Mr Jones appeared confident a deal could be made. Global markets fall On Friday, China introduced 34% additional tariffs on all goods imported from the US after calling the 34% duty placed on its goods \"bullying\". The tariffs have caused global markets to plummet, with the UK's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closing more than 7% lower on Friday than Monday - it's worst day of trading since the start of the COVID pandemic. Almost $5tn (Â£4tn) was wiped off the value of global stock markets since Mr Trump's announcement on Wednesday, analysts calculated."

        "Content": "British star Lesley Manville and American actor John Lithgow have won the acting categories at this year's Olivier Awards, which recognise excellence in London theatre.  Lithgow, 79, played Roald Dahl in Giant, which is about the children's author wondering whether to make a public apology. While accepting his award he appeared to reference the current controversy over Donald Trump's second term as US president. The Conclave star quipped: \"It's not always easy to welcome an American into your midst, and at this particular moment, it's probably a little more complicated than usual.\" He also told the audience at the Royal Albert Hall that the \"special relationship is still firmly intact\", despite Mr Trump imposing tariffs on British exports to the US. His co-star, English actor Elliot Levey, took best actor in a supporting role. Giant was also named best new play. Manville, 69, was honoured for her performance in the Greek tragedy Oedipus at the Wyndham's Theatre. She said she felt \"emotional\" while accepting her statuette because it was a production she had \"felt very strongly about being\" in. Manville, who played Princess Margaret in The Crown, added that she was taking an early flight to Dublin on Monday to do some filming, and would not be getting \"much sleep tonight\". Best actress in a supporting role went to Romola Garai for her performance in The Years, based on a memoir by French writer Annie Ernaux. Garai, whose film credits include Scoop and Atonement, was nominated in the same category for Giant. Dame Imelda Staunton won a fifth Olivier, for best actress in a musical for the London revival of classic musical Hello, Dolly! The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button won best new musical, a best actor musical award for Lark Rise To Candleford actor John Dagleish, and the outstanding musical contribution award. The annual event was co-hosted by British singer Beverley Knight and Pose star Billy Porter."
