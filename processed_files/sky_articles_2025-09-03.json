        "Content": " At least 15 people have died and 18 are injured after the iconic Gloria funicular in Lisbon derailed and crashed, emergency services have said. A child is among the injured and five of those who were hurt are in a serious condition, the National Institute for Medical Emergencies said in a statement. Footage from the site showed the tram-like funicular, which is popular with tourists, practically destroyed and emergency workers pulling people out of the wreckage. Authorities would not identify the victims or disclose their nationalities, but said some foreign nationals were among the dead. The UK Foreign Office has said it is in touch with authorities in Lisbon and is ready to \"provide consular assistance if there are any affected British nationals\". Lisbon's mayor Carlos Moedas has said there will be three days of mourning for the victims of the \"tragic accident\". He added: \"I extend my heartfelt condolences to all the families and friends of the victims. Lisbon is in mourning.\" It is not immediately clear what caused the crash which happened at around 6pm - the start of evening rush hour. Carris, the company that operates the funicular, said scheduled maintenance had been carried out. Eyewitnesses told local media that the funicular careered down the hill, apparently out of control. Images show how the yellow and white carriage fell apart as a result of the crash. The Gloria, which can carry more than 40 people, is one of three funiculars in the Portuguese capital and is classified as a national monument. It connects downtown Lisbon with the neighbourhood of Bairro Alto and is commonly used by both residents and tourists. Two carriages attached to the same haulage cable run parallel to each other as they shuttle up and down the hill for a few hundred metres.

Mr Moedas told the Portuguese news site Diario de Noticia: \"It is a tragedy that has never happened in our city. The moment is for action and help. I thank you all for the response in a few minutes. The only thing I can say is that it is a very tragic day.\" It comes as Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has offered his condolences to families affected by the tragedy. The funicular opened in 1885 as the second of its kind in the city.\n It was electrified in 1915 after having originally been powered by water counterweight. The Gloria, like the two other funiculars in Lisbon, was designed by the Portuguese engineer Raoul Mesnier de Ponsard. It is the best-known and most popular funicular in the city and is said to transport around three million people a year. The funicular connects downtown's Restauradores Square to the neighbourhood of Bairro Alto at the top of a hill in just three minutes. It departs every 12 minutes from both sides, starting at 7:15am. The last departure is at 11:55pm.\n The view from Bairro Alto is said by many to be the best in Lisbon. Meanwhile, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has written on X: \"It is with sadness that I learned of the derailment of the famous 'Elevador da Gloria'. My condolences to the families of the victims.\" Portugal's defence minister Nuno Melo said: \"The accident in Lisbon with the Gloria elevator was a tragedy that caused strong commotion and consternation in Portugal and in the world... I express all my solidarity and offer heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.\" An investigation into the cause will begin once the rescue operation is over, the Portuguese government said in a statement."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  To her most savage critics - from Tories to the far left - she's \"Rotten Rayner\", a tax evader, freeloader and a \"low life… on the make\". To her trade union friends, she's a victim of misogyny who right-wing politicians are attempting to hound out because she's working class. And after her tearful interview on Sky News, even among some of her political opponents there's a degree of sympathy for Angela Rayner too. Politics latest: Why the deputy PM nearly resigned But amid the rancorous debate among MPs about whether she should stay or go, there's one part of her defence that is attracting scepticism from friends and foes. That's her claim that she was initially given duff advice by a solicitor. Really? If she has evidence to substantiate that, she may be in the clear, though there'd no doubt be accusations of an establishment stitch-up. But if not - and the city grandee who's the PM's ethics adviser - the Eton and Oxford-educated baronet Sir Laurie Magnus - rejects her defence, she'll almost certainly have to go. And with her resignation - or sacking - would almost certainly go her hopes of succeeding the increasingly unpopular Sir Keir as Labour leader, despite her popularity with the party's activists. When she arrived for Prime Minister's Questions, just half an hour after her bombshell confession, the Labour high command placed a collective arm around her. Sir Keir Starmer, who told MPs he was proud to sit alongside a deputy PM from a working-class background, put his hand on her left shoulder.  Badenoch misses an open goal... Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, sitting the other side of the beleaguered Ms Rayner, did the same on her right shoulder. Rachel Reeves, who also knows all about being beleaguered and shedding tears in public, looked across at her and smiled sympathetically. If Labour feared a brutal PMQs onslaught from Kemi Badenoch, they needn't have worried. \"Why is she still in office?\" the Tory leader began. So far, so good. \"If he had a backbone he would sack her,\" she said in the second of her six questions. But that was it. \"But let us get back to borrowing,\" she continued. Inexplicably, the Tory leader ploughed on with her pre-prepared questions on government borrowing. Labour MPs couldn't believe their luck. Cue numerous jokes about missed open goals. After another dud Kemi-Kaze performance at PMQs, some MPs were even speculating that Ms Rayner's survival prospects - slim, at best - remain better than those of the Tory leader.  ...but others go in studs up But in the cruel world of social media, Ms Rayner was not spared a vicious onslaught from critics from across the political divide. You'd better keep your phone switched off, Angi. From the spiky shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Ms Rayner was \"the property tax dodging, freeloading deputy prime minister\" who had \"finally admitted breaking the law and evading paying taxes owed\". There was more. \"She says that she's sorry,\" said punchy Priti. \"But she's only sorry that she was caught out. Rotten Rayner should go.\" Nadhim Zahawi, who was sacked as Tory chairman in 2023 after an inquiry found he failed to disclose an investigation into his tax affairs, added: \"Did you think about my children Angela Rayner? \"Breaks my heart seeing anybody distressed about their children, but the hypocrisy really does hurt.\" But it wasn't just Tories - who let's not forget were denounced as \"Scum!\" by Ms Rayner back in 2021, in what she described as \"street language\" - who were brutal. The acerbic George Galloway declared: \"She's a lowlife\". For good measure, he claimed she was \"on the make\" and on \"Supermarket Sweep, piling her trolley full\". Read more:Rayner admits she should have paid more stamp dutyRayner came out fighting in Sky interviewRayner's tax affairs statement in full However, from the trade union movement, which campaigned hard for the DPM's workers' rights legislation, there was unequivocal support. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak told Sky News: \"Angela Rayner comes under sustained coverage because she's a working-class woman in a way that frankly Nigel Farage, leading members of the shadow cabinet, never would. \"I think there's a real heavy dose of misogyny when it comes to Angela. \"I wouldn't want to see a hounded out of an important role by right wing politicians and the right wing media who frankly can't handle the fact that a working class woman is our deputy prime minister.\" There was sympathy from one party leader, Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats, who said that as a parent of a disabled child \"I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son's care after we have gone\". 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Shortly after PMQs, opening a Tory debate on, yes, property taxes, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride opted for ridicule and mockery. \"I'm absolutely certain that the deputy prime minister had a good recess,\" he began. \"We saw many photographs of her down at the seaside, just off the coast in a rubber dinghy, rather like many of the other photographs over the summer given the reckless policies this government has towards illegal migration. \"She was probably celebrating the acquisition of another property for her property empire, but perhaps also slightly tinged with that nagging doubt as to whether she had indeed paid enough stamp duty. \"Well, we'll get to the bottom of that in due course.\" Quite so, Mel. We will.  A fight for survival Let's also reflect that on Monday Sir Keir Starmer proudly announced: \"Phase two of my government starts today.\" On Tuesday, he informed MPs, he was \"speaking at length\" to Ms Rayner. Must have been awkward. And on Wednesday, the PM had to watch her tearful confession, just minutes before facing MPs in the Commons. Not a great start to phase two, prime minister. Nor for his embattled and tearful deputy, who's now fighting for political survival."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  China put on a show of military strength and diplomatic pulling power in Beijing this week that should worry us all. At the heart of it was one all-powerful man. Xi Jinping is emerging as the emperor of a rising China bent on reshaping the world in its image. He wears the garb of his communist forebears, but he is much more than just another heir to Chairman Mao. Xi increasingly has more in common with China's imperial past. He has disposed of rivals and term-limit rules, making him potentially ruler for life. Xi believes it is China's destiny to return to its rightful place as the centre of the world. A new world order dominated by China is approaching he believes, hastened by the Trump administration's willingness to dismantle the current Pax Americana and western disarray over Ukraine.  China has a right to assert itself more robustly on the world stage, of course, but it's the manner of that assertion and the risks of collision with the West that should give cause for concern. Xi has ruthlessly crushed dissent at home with quasi genocidal repression in Xinjiang, a cultural holocaust in Tibet and brutal suppression of human rights in Hong Kong. Next in his sights is Taiwan. It is claimed by the Chinese communists as part of their One China project. That opens up one fault line between Xi's rising China and Western nations. China's more and more open support of Putin's war in Ukraine is of course another. Western impotence and failure to bring enough pressure on Russia to end the conflict has allowed it to metastasize into a much bigger one. Read more from Sky News:Xi presents his vision of the futureWho is Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong On one side in the East, authoritarian governments lining up to support Russia. And on the other, democratic countries supporting Ukraine. This week's jamboree of autocrats in Beijing seems to have tipped things more in their favour. Good news for regimes using Orwellian surveillance, censorship, and repression to control their people and keep a grip on power. Bad news for the rest of us who prefer a future organised around democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Dictators rejoice. Democrats beware."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A woman known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" has officially pleaded guilty to selling Friends star Matthew Perry the drug that killed him. Jasveen Sangha initially denied the charges but agreed to change her plea in a signed statement in August, just a few weeks before she had been due to stand trial. The 42-year-old, a dual citizen of the US and the UK, has now appeared in a federal court in Los Angeles to plead guilty to five charges, including supplying the ketamine that led to Perry's death. She faces up to 65 years in prison after admitting one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death. Prosecutors agreed to drop three other counts related to the distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of methamphetamine that was unrelated to the Perry case. In a brief statement when the plea deal was announced, her lawyer Mark Geragos said she was \"taking responsibility for her actions\". The judge is not bound to follow any terms of the plea agreement, but prosecutors have said they will ask for less than the maximum possible sentence. Perry died aged 54 in October 2023. He had struggled with addiction for years, but released a memoir a year before his death during a period of being clean. He had been using ketamine through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, but in the weeks before his death had also started to seek more of the drug illegally. Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 (£4,464) in cash four days before his death, prosecutors said. Read more:The Hollywood drugs network exposed by Perry's deathObituary: The one who made everyone laugh  Sangha, described by prosecutors as the \"Ketamine Queen of North Hollywood\", is now the fifth and final person to plead guilty to charges connected to the supply of drugs to the Friends star. The actor's live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, an acquaintance Erik Fleming, and a physician, Mark Chavez, all agreed to plead guilty when the charges were announced in August 2024. Another doctor, Salvador Plasencia, initially pleaded not guilty and had been due to face trial alongside Sangha, but changed his plea in July. Sangha and Plasencia had been the primary targets of the investigation. The three other defendants: Chavez, Iwamasa and Fleming pleaded guilty in exchange for their co-operation, which included statements implicating Sangha and Plasencia. Perry had bought ketamine from Sangha after he was led to her by Fleming, prosecutors said. On the day of Perry's death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to Sangha's indictment. Sangha is due to be sentenced on 10 December. The other four defendants are also still awaiting sentencing. Perry was one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing in Friends - which ran on NBC between 1994 and 2004. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for all 10 seasons of the show. The Friends stars were among around 20 mourners who attended his funeral in November 2023, according to TMZ."

In one of his posts, Linehan said: \"If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.\" The health secretary told Sky News Breakfast with Wilfred Frost that he can't comment on the specifics of the case, as operational police decisions are \"rightly independent of politicians\". However, Mr Streeting said more generally that the government would rather see \"police on the streets rather than policing tweets\". Politics latest: Badenoch demands Starmer sack Rayner The cabinet member added: \"It's the easiest thing in the world for people to criticise the police, but they are enforcing laws that parliament has passed and asked them to enforce. \"So if we haven't got the balance right, as Parliament over successive governments, that is something that we need to look at because the Home Secretary is very clear about what her priorities are\". He said that those priorities are neighbourhood policing and keeping borders safe. Writing on Substack, Lineham said that after flying into the UK from Arizona, he was detained by five armed officers at Heathrow Airport and put in a cell before being questioned over posts published on X in April. He added that officials became concerned for his health after taking his blood pressure, and he was taken to hospital. His arrest has drawn criticism from opposition politicians. Senior Conservative MP Sir James Cleverly said the arrest looked like a \"real overreaction\" to what was \"self-evidently a joke\".  Meanwhile, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the incident was \"ridiculous and a complete waste of police time\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who is currently in Washington to give evidence to the House Judiciary Committee on free speech in the UK, told Sky News the arrest was a \"huge overreach\". \"We finished up in a situation where a foreigner, somebody with an Irish passport, coming into Heathrow airport is arrested by five police. And that could be an American executive.\" But Sir Keir Starmer would not commit to reviewing the law or police guidelines when asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The prime minister said the police must \"focus on the most serious issues... like anti-social behaviour, knife crime and violence.\" \"We have a long history of free speech in this country.

Another, Representative Jamie Raskin, described Mr Farage's appearance as \"a drive by hit against a Democratic ally to benefit a Donald Trump sycophant and wannabe…\" \n                  Partial release of Epstein files feeds view the whole truth is being covered up\n                 \n                  Trump suffers setback in bid to act as national police chief after chaos on streets of LA\n                 \n                  Trump says 11 dead in strike on Venezuelan drugs boat\n                 Mr Raskin went on to address the British people. \"To the people of the UK who think this Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant will protect freedom in your country, come on over to America and see what Trump and MAGA are doing to destroy our freedom.\"  There is a curiosity around this hearing. The right in Britain (Farage) and the left in America (Raskin et al) are using this moment to warn of what they both see as the erosion of freedom of speech in their own countries. Frankly both are using the moment to score political points for their own side in their own countries - you'd expect nothing less.

Instead he said he was here to warn against the stifling of any free speech; and to warn America of where he thinks it leads: \"'authoritarian Britain\" in his mind. Speaking to the committee, Mr Farage said: \"I've come today as well to be a klaxon, to say to you, don't allow piece by piece, this to happen here in America. \"And you would be doing us and yourselves and all freedom-loving people a favour if your politicians and your businesses said to the British government, 'You've simply got this wrong, at what point did we become North Korea?'\""

        "Content": "A hot mic caught Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin talking about organ transplants and immortality as the leaders walked together on the sidelines of the military parade in Beijing. As the Chinese and Russian presidents made their way toward a raised platform in Tiananmen Square, during celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, state media footage inadvertently aired parts of what appeared to be a private exchange. Accompanied by North Korea's Kim Jong Un, as well as two dozen foreign leaders, Xi and Putin were heard deep in conversation. Putin's interpreter was heard saying in Chinese, \"Biotechnology is continuously developing.\" After a brief inaudible moment, the interpreter continued: \"Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.\" Xi, who was off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: \"Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.\" The unguarded moment was caught during a livestream of the event. China's radio and TV administration reported that national broadcaster CCTV's coverage of the event was watched by over 400 million viewers on television. \n                  At least 15 killed after Lisbon's iconic Gloria funicular derails \n                 \n                  Things are tipping in the autocrats' favour - and it's bad news for the rest of us\n                 \n                  'Miss Palestine' Nadeen Ayoub to compete in global pageant to show 'we are human beings'\n                  The Russian president confirmed later that he and Xi had discussed the subject on Wednesday. \"I think when we went to the parade, the chairman talked about it,\" Putin told reporters in Beijing when asked about the leaked conversation. \"Modern means of health improvement, medical means, even surgical ones related to organ replacement, they allow humanity to hope that active life will continue differently than it does today,\" he said. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and CCTV did not immediately respond to requests for comment. As Xi began speaking, the video switched to a wide shot of Tiananmen Square and the audio faded. Just over 30 seconds later, Xi, Putin and Kim reappeared on camera as they walked on the steps toward the viewing platform for the parade.

Beijing displayed dozens of missiles, tanks, and armoured vehicles during the parade. Among the smaller exhibits were robotic wolves, which, presented alongside other drones, highlighted the evolving landscape of modern warfare. During the summit, Putin and Xi signed more than 20 agreements spanning critical sectors including energy and artificial intelligence. They also agreed to construct a major new gas pipeline, though they did not disclose key details about its financing or gas pricing."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  It's the mother of all break-ups. The life of one of the world's largest and longest lasting icebergs is finally coming to an end after it drifted away from Antarctica nearly 40 years ago. In March, we flew over megaberg A23a after it ran aground off South Georgia, one of the UK's most remote overseas territories. Back then it was a trillion-tonne block of ice more than twice the size of Greater London. There were concerns its collapse close to the island might endanger globally significant populations of penguins, seals and seabirds. But a few months later the iceberg floated free and began drifting again, looping around to the north of South Georgia where now, in the Antarctic spring, it is finally falling apart. \"It's been exposed to warmer waters for quite a long time,\" said Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. \"So it's pretty much rotted through.\" Satellite images from the last few days now reveal \"we've got really big chunks breaking off,\" said Meijers. The largest piece to come away in the last few days is 80 sq km - a colossal iceberg in its own right. A23a is still 1,700sq km - larger than London - but will now rapidly disappear. 'It's not going to last for more than a few weeks' \"It's not going to last in that chunk format for more than a few weeks or a month at most,\" predicts Meijers. As the iceberg breaks up, the surface area of pieces exposed to warmer water increases, accelerating its melting. It's also now caught in a current carrying it northwards, into increasingly milder temperatures. The rapid break-up of A23a means it's unlikely to pose a risk to wildlife on South Georgia but will represent a temporary hazard to shipping - especially as pieces become too small to monitor by satellite. Last week, RAF Operation Cold Stare, using the aircraft that flew us over the iceberg in spring, overflew A23a again. One of its roles is to map icebergs that may threaten shipping - largely fishing vessels and Antarctica-bound cruise ships in a remote corner of the Southern Ocean. During our flight over A23a it was hard to imagine a block of ice so large disappearing so fast. But even then we could see cracks several kilometres long running through it. All along its edges were cathedrals-sized caverns and vast \"terraces\" of ice at sea-level resulting from pounding by waves that rapidly crumble into the ocean. Satellite records of large icebergs don't go back long enough for scientists to know whether they are becoming more frequent as the planet warms. But there's strong evidence the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where A23a and many of its predecessors began their lives, is melting increasingly fast. Antarctica is losing around 150 billion tonnes of water each year, half of which is carried away in the form of icebergs. Read more:The impact of the world's biggest icebergYour iceberg A23a questions answered  Antarctic melting is being closely monitored by scientists concerned about the impact it is having on major ocean currents that underpin global climate - a potential \"tipping-point\" in planetary warming. As it has shrunk, A23a has now ceded its world heavyweight title to the 3000sq km iceberg D15a, which is aground on the coast of Antarctica close to where it broke off in 1992."

        "Content": "\n          Data journalist\n              @joelysantacruz\n  In the few short years since Brexit, numerous rule changes have impacted the number and type of students coming to the UK.  In January 2023, Sami and his two children arrived from India as dependents of his wife, who was accepted to study on a master's course in London. They were among the 657,000 people granted student and dependant visas in the year to June 2023, the highest number in figures collected since 2006. Nearly 200,000 of those - 28% of the total - were from India, making it the top nationality, followed by Nigeria and China. Together, these three nationalities accounted for two thirds of all student visas granted. Sami - which is not his real name - claims that agents in India helped to create fake financial documents to secure the family's visa approval, and that these were used in their application to the Home Office. Sami also says his wife never intended to study. While many of the students who arrive in the UK have legitimate documentation, it is impossible to know exactly how many do not - the Home Office collects figures on detected cases but does not publish them, while Sami's case was allegedly undetected. The number of student visas granted has since fallen by a third from its 2023 peak, to 436,000 in the latest figures for the year ending June 2025, though remains higher than the average 305,000 per year from 2012 to 2021. In 2023, there were 154,000 visas granted for the dependents of students, for example partners and children - more than one dependant for every three main student visas granted. By 2025, the number of had fallen to 18,000. This was largely driven by rule changes introduced by the Conservatives in January 2024, limiting students' ability to bring dependents with them to the UK - meaning this option would now be closed to Sami's family. Be in the audience for our immigration debate. New rules to prevent visa switching  Sami says he paid all his savings to agents in India who told him that he and his wife would easily be able to switch their visas when they arrived and pursue their dream of settling in the UK. Indeed, from around 2019, the practice of visa switching became increasingly common with students more likely to move to a work or other visa either before their course finished or at the end of their studies. They were also more likely to stay in the UK for longer. A quarter of international students who first came to study in 2019 were still in the UK five years later in 2024 with valid leave to remain - the highest proportion since the Home Office began keeping records in 2008. Similarly, students who arrived in 2021 were far more likely to remain in the UK at the end of three years than their predecessors, increasing from around 34% from 2011 to 2018, to 59% by 2021. And those who were still in the UK after three years were for the first time more likely to be working than still studying. The Home Office says the increase can be explained by a larger number of students at master's level transitioning to the graduate and other work routes. Attempts by Sami and his family to switch visa have so far been unsuccessful, as their original visas were cancelled when his wife failed to register on her master's course. Rules brought in by Rishi Sunak's government from July 2023 now prevent people from arriving on student visas switching to work ones before completing their studies. Universities supported closing this \"loophole\", says Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, as it was \"not in the university's interest if individuals come on a study visa and then leave their courses after three months\". The government now plans to reduce the time that graduates can stay on to work after their studies from two years to 18 months. Stricter rules are also in place from this month around visa refusal and course completion rates that universities must meet, with penalties for universities and sponsors that fail to meet targets. \"Effectively, the government is tightening regulation that already exists. That will be challenging for universities, and it will take time, but ultimately those changes are going to be implemented, and we've been working closely with government,\" Mr Arrowsmith told Sky News. Asylum claims Sami and his family have applied for asylum and are currently awaiting a decision on their case, in the hope of securing valid leave to remain in the UK. Sami has told us he wants to be able to work in the UK, but as he is currently without a valid visa or asylum, he's not legally allowed to. The family were assessed as destitute by social services and received support from council and charities. The number of asylum claims from people who originally arrived on student visas has increased more than those on other visa types in recent years, with 14,800 asylum claims in the year ending June 2025, though down from a peak of 16,500 in the year to June 2023. For every 50 student visas granted between 2021 and 2025, one person applied for asylum who had originally held a student visa. There isn't data available on the proportion of those claims that were successful. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has said she wants to \"clamp down\" on people claiming asylum at the end of their study visa, and the government is actively contacting international students to warn them not to overstay their visa. In the year to June 2025, 10,441 people were returned voluntarily, or forcibly removed, who had previously applied for asylum, though not all of those would have applied for asylum within that year. Universities rely on international fees Fee income from international students has been an important part of universities' funding models since 2018/19, says Mr Arrowsmith, as successive governments have chosen not to increase student funding in line with inflation. This has meant that universities have had to make up the shortfall in other ways, which has been mostly through international student fee income. Foreign students' fees contributed 23% of universities total income in 2023/24, at £12.1bn, increasing from 16% of university income in 2018/19. \"We have seen a decline in the last two years of the number of international students coming to the UK, and that does pose challenges for finances of UK universities,\" Mr Arrowsmith said. \"Ultimately what we need is a more sustainable funding settlement for our universities\".

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The leader of Britain's trade unions has urged Labour to fight Reform UK by hitting millionaires, banks and gambling with higher taxes. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, has published an opinion poll of 5,000 adults. He says the results suggest a significant number of Labour voters are leaning to Reform. His call comes ahead of the TUC's annual conference starting in Brighton this weekend, when the high-tax policy is expected to be overwhelmingly approved. \"I've seen first-hand the experience of the wealth tax, the solidarity tax in Spain and it raised billions of euros,\" Mr Nowak said in a pre-conference interview with Sky News. \"It didn't lead to an exodus of millionaires or wealthy people from Spain and Spain now has one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. So I think it's a good example of a wealth tax in action. \"But it's not the only option the government has. They could equalise capital gains tax with income tax. \"They could have a windfall tax on the banks and the financial institutions who have got record profits. \"And they could tax the gambling industry much more fairly.\" He continued: \"The big four banks between them had profits of nearly £46bn last year alone, mainly because we're in a high interest rates environment. \"Under the previous Conservative government, when the energy companies had huge windfall profits, they moved to a windfall tax, extended by Labour. \"We think they should take a similar approach in banking and other sectors where we may see those windfall profits.\" Labour voters 'leaning to Reform' The debate over a wealth tax was triggered by a call by former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, in an interview on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News on 6 July, for a 2% levy on people with assets of more than £10m. Weeks later, it was backed by Labour's former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, on Sky News political editor Beth Rigby's Electoral Dysfunction podcast, but rejected by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Ms Reeves will deliver the budget on 26 November. On the TUC's poll, carried out on 15-19 August, Mr Nowak said 74% of 2024 Labour voters who are now \"leaning to Reform\" backed wealth, gambling, and bank taxes. This was also true for 84% of 2024 Conservative to Labour switchers. Read more:No room for Treasury complacencyDodds says she 'hopes' Reeves considering wealth tax  'A clear dividing line' \"We polled the public on a 2% wealth tax on those with assets of more than £10m,\" Mr Nowak said. \"Most people would recognise, if you've got £10m in assets, you could probably afford to pay a little bit more in tax. \"This is a clear dividing line between the government and Reform, showing you are on the side of working people. \"We know some [union] members voted for Reform at the last general election and clearly Reform was the biggest party at the local elections and union members would have been among those who cast their vote for Reform. \"My job isn't to tell trade union members which way they should vote or not. What we want to do is expose the gap between what Nigel Farage says and what he does. \"He says he stands up for working people and then votes against rights for millions of working people when it's introduced in parliament. \"He says he stands up for British industry and supports Donald Trump and his destructive tariffs. And he talks about tax cuts for the rich when we know that we need those with the broader shoulders to pay their fair share.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Controversial efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in cattle are likely to fail unless there's greater urgency and funding from the government, scientists have warned. The disease has caused bitter divisions between farmers and wildlife groups because of the use of badger culls to reduce transmission of the disease to cattle. The government has vowed to end the cull in 2029 and vaccinate badgers instead, with a target of eliminating the disease in English cattle herds by 2038. Now a scientific review of the strategy has warned it will only succeed if the government rapidly rolls out badger jabs and steps up infection control within cattle herds. Professor Sir Charles Godfray, who led the government-commission review, said: \"We're obviously fully aware of the great pressures of the public finances at the moment. \"Nevertheless, we believe that investment in bovine TB control now will save money in the future.\" A huge cost to farming \n                  One of the world's biggest icebergs is finally breaking up after 40 years\n                 \n                  Hate speech, harassment and free speech: What you can't say online\n                 \n                  Why the EU has banned some gel nail polishes – and when the UK is expected to do the same\n                 TB continues to devastate British farming and wildlife almost halfway through a 25-year strategy to eliminate the disease. In the last decade alone, 274,000 cattle have been compulsorily slaughtered in England, and over 230,000 badgers have been culled since 2013. Last year, compensation paid out for slaughtered cattle was almost £23m. Jeremy Clarkson revealed in July that his farm \"gone down with TB.\" \"Bad news from Diddly Squat,\" he said in a post on X. \"Everyone here is absolutely devastated.\" Genetic tracing of the TB bug shows most cattle are infected by other animals in the herd. But the original source of the disease is likely to be wildlife or the movement of infected cattle from elsewhere. Vaccination of badgers will become a key part of the elimination strategy once culling stops. But the report says there are currently significant challenges, including difficulties in catching sufficient badgers. 'Greater urgency' needed Prof Godfray said: \"Considerable effort will be required to scale up vaccination, so that it comes viable, both economically and logistically.\" But he added better biosecurity and testing was also needed to stop the disease being spread by cattle movements between farms. Hopes are high for a cattle vaccine which is currently being assessed by government veterinary regulators.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Reform UK members will table a motion at their party conference which is expected to call for transgender women to be excluded from men's prisons, Sky News understands. The motion is set to be held this Saturday during Reform's party conference, taking place in Birmingham. Politics latest: Why the deputy prime minister nearly resigned It comes after Nigel Farage faced criticism for initially appearing to back Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor whom he hired as an adviser, when she said some transgender women could be housed in female jails. At a news conference last month, Ms Frake said cases needed to be assessed \"on an individual basis\" and that those calling for a blanket ban \"clearly have never set foot in a prison\". The Reform UK leader originally appeared to echo Ms Frake, saying the issue was about \"risk assessment\" - before later saying he did not agree. Asked if he agreed with his adviser's position, he said: \"I personally never worked in a prison, so I can't answer that. \"But I think you'll find that the answer that you'll get from somebody who has worked in prisons at the highest possible level is, I think basically it's about risk assessment.\" However, the next day, Mr Farage posted on social media that he had \"never supported men in women's prisons\", and reposted a video from April in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that the definition of a woman is based on biological sex. Mr Farage's initial comments have been regarded as a blunder by Reform insiders, who welcomed the motion on Saturday as a chance to clarify the party's position. They also attracted criticism from Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who posted on X: \"Just because huge swathes of the left have revealed themselves to be dripping in misogyny doesn't mean a massive chunk of the right doesn't remain exactly as indifferent to women's rights and issues as it's always been.\" What else is on Reform's agenda? Reform UK's first conference will focus on the cost of living crisis, immigration and net zero. In the wake of Mr Farage's appearance at the House Judiciary Committee in Washington on Wednesday, and the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan at Heathrow on Monday for a series of anti-trans posts, it is also expected that freedom of speech will feature on the conference agenda. Mr Farage raised Mr Linehan's case to the committee on Capitol Hill, saying the arrest involving five police officers was \"authoritarian\". He added: \"At what point did we become North Korea? Well, I think the Irish comedy writer found that out two days ago at Heathrow Airport.\" Read more:Angela Rayner's future is now out of her controlTruss calls for Trump-style 'revolution' in the UK  Farage: Britain has become authoritarian He also referenced the jailing of former childminder and wife of a Conservative councillor Lucy Connolly for inciting racial hatred after the Southport murders last year. She has now been released. \"It doesn't give me any great joy to be sitting in America and describing the really awful authoritarian situation that we have now sunk into,\" Mr Farage added. He described Ms Connolly's post as \"intemperate, it was wrong, but she removed it three and a half hours later. \"Sentenced to 31 months in prison. She's now out, having served 40% of the time. \"I wanted to bring her with me today as living proof of what can go wrong. \"Sadly, the restrictions that have been put on her banned her from making the trip, which is a very, very great shame.\""

        "Content": " Angela Rayner has admitted she did not pay the right amount of stamp duty on the purchase of her second home and has referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards.  Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, the deputy prime minister became tearful as she claimed she received incorrect tax advice and spoke to her family about \"packing it all in\". Ms Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, has been under scrutiny after a report in The Daily Telegraph claimed she avoided £40,000 in stamp duty on a flat in Hove by removing her name from the deeds of another property in Greater Manchester. In a lengthy statement released today, she said it was a \"complex living arrangement\" as her first home was sold to a trust following her divorce to provide stability for her teenage son, who has lifelong disabilities and is the sole beneficiary of the trust. She said initial legal advice was that the standard rate of stamp duty applied, but following media reports, she sought expert counsel who said more tax is due. She added that these matters were confidential but she applied to a court yesterday to get this lifted in the interests of public transparency. In a subsequent interview with Beth Rigby, a visibly upset Ms Rayner said: \"I've been in shock, really, because I thought I'd done everything properly, and I relied on the advice that I received and I'm devastated because I've always upheld the rules and always have felt proud to do that. \"That it is devastating for me and the fact that the reason why those confidential clauses were in place was to protect my son, who, through no fault of his own, he's vulnerable, he's got this life changing, lifelong conditions and I don't want him or anything to do with his day-to-day life, to be subjected to that level of scrutiny.\" Asked if she thought about quitting rather than disclose the details about her son, the cabinet minister added: \"I spoke to my family about it. I spoke to my ex-husband, who has been an incredibly supportive person because he knows that all I've done is try and support my family and help them.\" Allies jump to Rayner's defence  Her comments came shortly before the first PMQs following the summer recess. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Keir Starmer should fire his deputy. \"If he had backbone, he would sack her,\" she said.  However, the prime minister defended Ms Rayner, saying he is \"very proud\" to sit alongside her. \"She's gone over and above in setting out the details, including yesterday afternoon asking a court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son,\" the prime minister said. \"I am very proud to sit alongside a deputy prime minister who is building 1.5m homes, who is bringing the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation, and has come from a working-class background to become deputy prime minister of this country.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also came out in support of Ms Rayner, saying as the parent of a disabled child himself he trusts that she was acting in her family's interests. \"I understand it is normally the role of opposition leaders to jump up and down and call for resignations - as we've seen plenty of from the Conservatives already,\" he said. \"Obviously if the ethics advisor says Angela Rayner has broken the rules, her position may well become untenable. \"But as a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son's care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here. \"Perhaps now is a good time to talk about how we look after disabled people and how we can build a more caring country.\" Ms Rayner was also backed by Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, who told Sky News' chief political correspondent Jon Craig that he thinks attacks against her are driven by a \"heavy dose of misogyny\". He said: \"Angela Rayner comes under sustained coverage because she's a working-class woman in a way that frankly Nigel Farage, leading members of the shadow cabinet, never would. \"I think there's a real heavy dose of misogyny when it comes to Angela. As far as I'm concerned, the prime minister's got faith in her and I think the country's got faith in her as well.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting also came to her defence, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that she acted in \"good faith\" and it would be an \"absolutely travesty\" if she had to resign. Key points from Rayner statement  In her statement, Ms Rayner said that following the divorce from her husband in 2023, they agreed to a nesting arrangement where their children would remain in their family home, in Ashton-under-Lyne, while they alternated living there. She said she sold her interest in that home to a trust earlier this year, before buying the property in Hove. The trust was originally set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons after a \"deeply personal and distressing incident\" as a premature baby that left him with lifelong disabilities The home had been adapted for her son and the sale to the trust was to give him \"the security of knowing the home is his\", Ms Rayner said. She went on to say that she did not own any other home when she bought the flat in Hove, and her understanding \"on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty\". She added: \"However, given the recent allegations in the press I have subsequently sought further advice from a leading tax counsel to review that position and to ensure I am fully compliant with all tax provisions. \"I have now been advised that although I did not own any other property at the time of the purchase, the application of complex deeming provisions which relate to my son's trust gives rise to additional stamp duty liabilities.\" Ms Rayner said she is working with HMRC to establish what is owed, claiming her arrangements \"reflect the reality that family life is rarely straightforward\". She concluded: \"I deeply regret the error that has been made. I am committed to resolving this matter fully and providing the transparency that public service demands. \"It is for that reason I have today referred myself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, and will provide him with my fullest cooperation and access to all the information he requires.\" Watch and listen to the full Electoral Dysfunction interview on Wednesday afternoon - www.podfollow.com/electoraldysfunction"

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n I've interviewed Angela Rayner a number of times and know her to be a robust operator with a very thick skin.  But on Wednesday morning, as she walked into our interview to admit that she had underpaid tax on her Hove home and explain the personal circumstances around that, she was visibly upset. For days, this story has run on and now we have a better picture of why. The deputy prime minister told me she had to ask for court permission to release details of her domestic arrangements to give the background to the tax trouble she now finds herself in. And on Wednesday, she revealed all. Politics latest: Why the deputy PM nearly resigned It is a complicated and personal story, but in essence, her family had a trust set up in 2020 to provide for her son who has lifelong disabilities to ensure that he would be provided for and protected. When she divorced her husband in 2023, some of the interest in the family home was transferred to the trust and then in 2025, she sold her remaining interest in the property to her teenage son's trust. She then used the proceeds from that to buy the new property in Hove, using the money from her family home in Ashton to pay the deposit. \n                  Angela Rayner: 'Victim of misogyny' or 'freeloading' deputy prime minister?\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's explanation for stamp duty error not the end of the matter\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's tax affairs statement in full\n                  Ms Rayner says she was advised that the home she bought was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty. It now turns out that advice was wrong and she owes tens of thousands in underpaid tax, because Hove is classified as her second home rather than her main residence. She says it was a genuine mistake and has referred herself to the PM's independent standards commissioner and informed HMRC. She says she will pay any additional tax owed. The deputy PM was clearly upset in our interview by having to disclose private details about her teenage children. I was left in little doubt that she had felt forced to share information about them that she really didn't want to share. She also admitted that she had discussed packing it all in with her ex-husband and children rather than putting this personal stuff into the public domain, but her family wanted her to go public to answer media reports that she had acted in a \"hypocritical way\". Read more: Angela Rayner a 'great British success story', says PM \"We felt that under the circumstances that having that reputation, for me as their mother, was more damaging than correcting the record on what we were trying to do,\" she said. But this is much more than just trying to save Ms Rayner's reputation. Her political career is on the line, and, at the moment, it is unclear whether she will be able to continue as deputy prime minister. She told me in our interview that the prime minister \"knows the circumstances\" and \"knows the challenges that my son has faced and the background to all of that\", and it is now for the PM's independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to look at the evidence that she was advised she did not have to pay a stamp duty surcharge. He has a reputation for being quick and if he finds Ms Rayner broke the ministerial code, it will be hard to see how Sir Keir Starmer will not accept that advice. On top of that, HMRC is also investigating the deputy prime minister and if she is found to have been careless around her tax, she might face a penalty on top of the stamp duty owed, which will again put her under huge pressure. There is also the political fall out for a politician who has gone in hard on Tories over tax questions for years.  Defending her from the attacks that are now surely to come is going to burn through a lot of political capital of a government already in trouble. Will her colleagues around the cabinet table and on the backbenches have the stomach for it? When I asked her in our interview whether she really believed her position was sustainable, given she had underpaid on tax and that she was the housing minister, she told me that she hoped \"people can see what has happened and see that I wasn't trying to dodge tax\", and when she realised that advice was inaccurate she \"took immediate steps to do the right thing -you should pay the tax that is owed\". \"Hopefully, people can see there isn't any intention to deceive, to avoid, to be hypocritical in the way in which I have conducted myself,\" she said. Ms Rayner is never far from the headlines and has often found herself under fire in her political career, rising to the second most powerful office in the country from the most humble of backgrounds. But she knows too that despite complicated family issues, she has made a very serious error indeed and one which she would have been quick to criticise had the perpetrator been a political opponent. She has come out fighting today, but whether she can survive is now beyond her control."

A child is among the injured and five of those who were hurt are in a serious condition, the National Institute for Medical Emergencies said in a statement. Footage from the site showed the tram-like funicular, which is popular with tourists, practically destroyed and emergency workers pulling people out of the wreckage. Authorities would not identify the victims or disclose their nationalities, but said some foreign nationals were among the dead. The UK Foreign Office has said it is in touch with authorities in Lisbon and is ready to \"provide consular assistance if there are any affected British nationals\". Lisbon's mayor Carlos Moedas has said there will be three days of mourning for the victims of the \"tragic accident\". He added: \"I extend my heartfelt condolences to all the families and friends of the victims. Lisbon is in mourning.\" It is not immediately clear what caused the crash which happened at around 6pm - the start of evening rush hour. Carris, the company that operates the funicular, said scheduled maintenance had been carried out. Eyewitnesses told local media that the funicular careered down the hill, apparently out of control. Images show how the yellow and white carriage fell apart as a result of the crash. The Gloria, which can carry more than 40 people, is one of three funiculars in the Portuguese capital and is classified as a national monument. It connects downtown Lisbon with the neighbourhood of Bairro Alto and is commonly used by both residents and tourists. Two carriages attached to the same haulage cable run parallel to each other as they shuttle up and down the hill for a few hundred metres. Read more from Sky News:Why fears of Russian attack on Europe are not 'hysteria'Putin and Xi caught discussing organ transplants The second carriage was apparently undamaged, but footage aired by CNN Portugal showed it jolting violently, with several passengers jumping out of its windows, when the other one derailed. Mr Moedas told the Portuguese news site Diario de Noticia: \"It is a tragedy that has never happened in our city. The moment is for action and help. I thank you all for the response in a few minutes. The only thing I can say is that it is a very tragic day.\" It comes as Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has offered his condolences to families affected by the tragedy. The funicular opened in 1885 as the second of its kind in the city.\n It was electrified in 1915 after having originally been powered by water counterweight. The Gloria, like the two other funiculars in Lisbon, was designed by the Portuguese engineer Raoul Mesnier de Ponsard. It is the best-known and most popular funicular in the city and is said to transport around three million people a year. The funicular connects downtown's Restauradores Square to the neighbourhood of Bairro Alto at the top of a hill in just three minutes. It departs every 12 minutes from both sides, starting at 7:15am. The last departure is at 11:55pm.\n The view from Bairro Alto is said by many to be the best in Lisbon. Meanwhile, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has written on X: \"It is with sadness that I learned of the derailment of the famous 'Elevador da Gloria'. My condolences to the families of the victims.\" Portugal's defence minister Nuno Melo said: \"The accident in Lisbon with the Gloria elevator was a tragedy that caused strong commotion and consternation in Portugal and in the world... I express all my solidarity and offer heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.\" An investigation into the cause will begin once the rescue operation is over, the Portuguese government said in a statement."

        "Content": "\n          International affairs editor\n              @DominicWaghorn\n  China put on a show of military strength and diplomatic pulling power in Beijing this week that should worry us all. At the heart of it was one all-powerful man. Xi Jinping is emerging as the emperor of a rising China bent on reshaping the world in its image. He wears the garb of his communist forebears, but he is much more than just another heir to Chairman Mao. Xi increasingly has more in common with China's imperial past. He has disposed of rivals and term-limit rules, making him potentially ruler for life. Xi believes it is China's destiny to return to its rightful place as the centre of the world. A new world order dominated by China is approaching he believes, hastened by the Trump administration's willingness to dismantle the current Pax Americana and western disarray over Ukraine.  China has a right to assert itself more robustly on the world stage, of course, but it's the manner of that assertion and the risks of collision with the West that should give cause for concern. Xi has ruthlessly crushed dissent at home with quasi genocidal repression in Xinjiang, a cultural holocaust in Tibet and brutal suppression of human rights in Hong Kong. Next in his sights is Taiwan. It is claimed by the Chinese communists as part of their One China project. That opens up one fault line between Xi's rising China and Western nations. China's more and more open support of Putin's war in Ukraine is of course another. Western impotence and failure to bring enough pressure on Russia to end the conflict has allowed it to metastasize into a much bigger one. Read more from Sky News:Xi presents his vision of the futureWho is Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong On one side in the East, authoritarian governments lining up to support Russia. And on the other, democratic countries supporting Ukraine. This week's jamboree of autocrats in Beijing seems to have tipped things more in their favour. Good news for regimes using Orwellian surveillance, censorship, and repression to control their people and keep a grip on power. Bad news for the rest of us who prefer a future organised around democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Dictators rejoice. Democrats beware."

The image with Mangione's likeness, wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, has since been taken down. Shein, one of the world's biggest fast fashion retailers, told Sky News: \"The image in question was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery. \"We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform.

As news of the image spread across social media on Tuesday, and 'Luigi Mangione Shein' reportedly began trending, many speculated that the picture had been created by AI or photo-shopped.

Mangione denies the state and federal charges against him, including first-degree murder \"in furtherance of an act of terrorism\", two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of stalking and a firearms offence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted, saying Mangione targeted Mr Thompson and that he \"presents a future danger because he expressed an intent to target an entire industry, and rally political and social opposition to that industry, by engaging in an act of lethal violence\". After the killing, Mangione was portrayed as a folk hero by some of those opposed to the US healthcare system.

        "Content": "A hot mic caught Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin talking about organ transplants and immortality as the leaders walked together on the sidelines of the military parade in Beijing. As the Chinese and Russian presidents made their way toward a raised platform in Tiananmen Square, during celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, state media footage inadvertently aired parts of what appeared to be a private exchange. Accompanied by North Korea's Kim Jong Un, as well as two dozen foreign leaders, Xi and Putin were heard deep in conversation. Putin's interpreter was heard saying in Chinese, \"Biotechnology is continuously developing.\" After a brief inaudible moment, the interpreter continued: \"Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.\" Xi, who was off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: \"Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.\" The unguarded moment was caught during a livestream of the event. China's radio and TV administration reported that national broadcaster CCTV's coverage of the event was watched by over 400 million viewers on television. \n                  At least 15 killed after Lisbon's iconic Gloria funicular derails \n                 \n                  Things are tipping in the autocrats' favour - and it's bad news for the rest of us\n                 \n                  'Miss Palestine' Nadeen Ayoub to compete in global pageant to show 'we are human beings'\n                  The Russian president confirmed later that he and Xi had discussed the subject on Wednesday. \"I think when we went to the parade, the chairman talked about it,\" Putin told reporters in Beijing when asked about the leaked conversation. \"Modern means of health improvement, medical means, even surgical ones related to organ replacement, they allow humanity to hope that active life will continue differently than it does today,\" he said. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and CCTV did not immediately respond to requests for comment. As Xi began speaking, the video switched to a wide shot of Tiananmen Square and the audio faded. Just over 30 seconds later, Xi, Putin and Kim reappeared on camera as they walked on the steps toward the viewing platform for the parade.

Beijing displayed dozens of missiles, tanks, and armoured vehicles during the parade. Among the smaller exhibits were robotic wolves, which, presented alongside other drones, highlighted the evolving landscape of modern warfare. During the summit, Putin and Xi signed more than 20 agreements spanning critical sectors including energy and artificial intelligence. They also agreed to construct a major new gas pipeline, though they did not disclose key details about its financing or gas pricing."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  China's status as a military superpower was on full display as Beijing marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Tens of thousands of troops, tanks and armoured vehicles moved through Tiananmen Square on Wednesday, along with a fearsome array of missiles. Fighter jets soared overhead. While ostensibly a day to mark the decades since the end of the world's biggest war, it's clear that Xi Jinping was looking towards the future in the message he sent to the West. \"They want to advertise to the world that they're doing old and new,\" military analyst Michael Clarke told Sky News. \"So they were showing the enormity of what they've got in in traditional terms, but also some of the new things.\" Indeed, the event featured many weapons and equipment that had never been seen in public before. In this story, Sky News looks at what units and military hardware were on display in the Chinese capital. Land forces Huge numbers of soldiers from various wings of China's armed forces made up the bulk of the parade, marching in perfect lockstep in neat rows. As well as the traditional elements from the army and navy, the procession also featured newer pieces like the cyberspace unit. The new unit is in charge of cybersecurity defence measures, the Xinhua state news agency says, and also took part in live-fire drills. Another new unit was the information support force, which was created in 2024 to build network information systems to support military combat readiness. Nuclear triad on display for the first time Also rolling through the square were an array of missiles, including those that form China's strategic nuclear capability. For the first time, Beijing unveiled its nuclear triad of air, land and sea-based missiles. This included the JL-1 air-based long-range missile, JL-3 submarine-launched intercontinental missile, DF-61 land-based intercontinental missile, and the new type DF-31 land-based intercontinental missile. The weapons are China's strategic \"ace\" power to safeguard the country's sovereignty and nation's dignity, according to Xinhua. China is one of four countries known to possess a nuclear triad, along with the US, Russia and India. Other missiles on display included hypersonic anti-ship missiles that China has previously tested against mockups of US aircraft carriers, such as the Yingji-19, Yingji-17 and Yingji-20. \"These are designed to frighten the United States,\" Mr Clarke says, with reference to the Pacific Ocean where US warships patrol from their 7th Fleet headquarters in Japan. Read more:Analysis: President Xi's message to the WestHow China's parade compares to other military spectacles Drones and robot wolves China also put a number of its unmanned weapon systems on display, evidence of the changing nature of modern warfare. Arguably the most interesting were the so-called 'robot wolves'. There were also underwater drones such as the AJX002, a long, black tube-shaped craft that looks like a narrow submarine with a rear propeller. The military also showed off unmanned helicopters that are designed to be launched from ships. Like other militaries, China has also been developing laser weapons to defend against drone attacks - one of which was on display today as well. As attack drones get more advanced - and numerous - a counter drive to develop cheaper ways of shooting them down is ongoing. \"The one that they kept under wraps was this laser gun,\" Mr Clarke said. \"It was all under tarpaulin in the rehearsals - and suddenly there it was. It was like a big searchlight on a vehicle. \"Laser guns, despite James Bond films, are not quite as ground-breaking as people think, but there it was: a new laser gun.\" Air force Beijing has developed a number of advanced aircraft in recent years, and several of them were on display on Wednesday. Soaring above the parade were China's two fifth-generation fighter jets, the Chengdu J-20 and Shenyang J-35A. Both have stealth capabilities and are designed to try to rival the US air force's F-35 jet. China has two of the five fifth-generation fighter jets currently known to operate globally. The others are the American F-35 (also operated by the UK and other allies) and F-22, as well as the Russian Su-57. China showing off its range - and numbers \"What they're showing here is that they've got a full panoply of weapons systems,\" Mr Clarke says, pointing to the various land, sea and air assets. \"Whether they can link them together in combined arms warfare, we don't know, because they haven't fought a major war since the 1950s... but on paper it's extremely impressive.\" He added: \"It's not as big as the American military yet, but it certainly rivals it. And it certainly worries American military planners.\""

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n  Whatever you might think of the politics, the performance was nothing short of perfect. Tens of thousands of service personnel in lines so straight they could almost have been animated. Every flex of the foot, every turn of the head, every cry of allegiance exactly in sync. And the noise, you could feel every bit as much as you could hear. Follow live updates from Beijing  The stamp of boots, the rumble of the tanks and the roar of the jet engines literally reverberated through the stand where we were sitting. \"We serve the people\" came the cries when called on; the passion, of course, had been practised, but it felt authentic too. The security to get here spoke volumes about just how tightly controlled this whole event has been. Our meet time, dictated by the Chinese government, was over seven hours before the start of the parade itself, bussed in at the dead of night, no fewer than three separate rigorous security scans. But once onto Beijing's historic Tiananmen Square, we were free to film in places that are normally strictly off limits. And that is because today, nothing less than China itself, in all its prowess, is on show.  A projection of power While this parade is officially to mark 80 years since the official surrender of Japan in the Second World War, it is about so much more than that. It is about the projection of power, both internally and around the world, too. To the domestic audience, it is about showing just how far China has come since the war. From a country invaded and 'humiliated' by Japan, to a global superpower, all thanks, they say, to the Chinese Communist Party and the vision of President Xi. It is notable that even in official communications to the foreign media, the objective of \"demonstrating loyalty to the party\" was listed as a more important motivation than \"commemorating\" victory in the war and the sacrifices of the Chinese people. But be in no doubt, they know the world is watching too, and this was also about projecting power internationally. Close company That is largely about the military might, of course, the huge array of Chinese-produced, cutting-edge new weaponry was notable. So is the fact that Xi's reorganisation and modernisation of the military has been a key theme. But the messaging was also about the power of China's allegiances and its political heft too. Indeed, today was especially notable not just for what was on show, but also for who was here. No accident at all that Xi Jinping was continually staged with Russia's Vladimir Putin on his right and North Korea's Kim Jong Un to his left. There has been speculation that the recent blossoming alliance between Putin and Kim has irked China somewhat. No sign of that today, the signals were all that this is a trio in lockstep. Indeed, Kim rarely leaves his hermit kingdom, and he has never been to a multilateral event as big as this. His presence speaks volumes about his confidence in this company. All of this comes after four days of intense diplomacy here, where China has hosted leaders from across the world in an attempt to cast itself as a great convener of nations and a preserver of a peaceful global order. Read more analysis on China:China, Russia, and India push for new world orderSummit called 'axis of upheaval' - that feels right when you look at guest listEconomic summit is a show designed to rattle the West It's a message perhaps a little undermined when stood before such a show of military might, with one leader wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and another sanctioned by much of the world for its accumulation of nuclear weapons. But perhaps to many, disillusioned with America, this simply doesn't matter, and that is the gap Xi is successfully exploiting. Not everyone will be buying in, but this was in some ways a vision for a future Xi would like to see, and it is a vision that's centred on Chinese power."

        "Content": "Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong has often been described as the second-most powerful person in North Korea. Ms Kim holds two senior roles in her brother's government and has gained international attention for insulting her South Korean counterpart and other foreign leaders. She is often seen by the supreme leader's side at military demonstrations and international summits - and was spotted with him and Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of their bilateral meeting and China's military parade in Beijing. Like her brother, much of her personal life is shrouded in secrecy - but here is what we know about her.  Quick rise to power after father's death Ms Kim is believed to be in her late 30s and is the only daughter of the five children born to Kim Jong II - Kim Jong Un's father and North Korea's supreme leader from 1994 until his death in 2011. She made her first major public appearance at her father's funeral, quickly asserting her influence in her brother's regime after he took power. She was rumoured to have temporarily replaced him in 2014 during a month-long period when he was not seen in public. She has served as vice director of the ruling Korean Workers' Party's Propaganda and Agitation Department since 2014 and became a member of the country's most senior decision-making body, the State Affairs Commission, in 2021, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. None of her other siblings have gained the same political influence as her. She was part of North Korea's delegation at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018 and has acted as a special envoy at meetings with Seoul officials. She was added to the US sanctions list in 2017 as a result of North Korea's human rights record. Like Mr Kim, she is thought to have spent some of her childhood in Bern, Switzerland, where she attended school, before returning home to study at Kim II Sung University. It has been reported that she is married and has two children, although this has never been officially confirmed. What controversial comments has she made? Ms Kim has flung repeated insults at her counterparts over the border in South Korea. In August 2022, she responded to its offer of economic aid in exchange for denuclearisation by telling former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol to \"shut his mouth\". She also called him \"really simple and still childish\". South Korea's unification minister described her comments as \"disrespectful and indecent\". Read more from Sky NewsHow China's military parade compares to othersWho is the girl who could lead North Korea? That year, she also accused Seoul of bringing coronavirus into North Korea through its campaign of dropping rubbish-filled balloons and propaganda leaflets over the border. \"We have cleared out the virus spread by the South Korean scum,\" she said afterwards. \"We must counter it toughly. We have already considered various counteraction plans but our countermeasure must be a deadly retaliatory one.\" In November 2022, she referred to Mr Yoon's government as \"idiots\" amid speculation Seoul was planning provocation measures against Pyongyang. South Korea described her comments as \"very deplorable\" and accused her of showing \"no basic form of etiquette\". During his time in the White House, Ms Kim referred to then US president Joe Biden as an \"old man with no future\" after the US stepped up support of South Korea. More recently, she has denied claims Pyongyang authorities have removed loudspeakers placed by South Korean propaganda officials at the border. She has also been critical of President Donald Trump for showing what she describes as \"its most hostile and confrontational will\" to North Korea. Since returning to power in January, Mr Trump has expressed a desire to restart talks with Mr Kim after two failed denuclearisation summits during his last term in 2018 and 2019. But Ms Kim has warned the US leader against efforts towards nuclear disarmament or support for the South, saying it makes a \"mockery of the other party [North Korea]\"."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A woman known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" has officially pleaded guilty to selling Friends star Matthew Perry the drug that killed him. Jasveen Sangha initially denied the charges but agreed to change her plea in a signed statement in August, just a few weeks before she had been due to stand trial. The 42-year-old, a dual citizen of the US and the UK, has now appeared in a federal court in Los Angeles to plead guilty to five charges, including supplying the ketamine that led to Perry's death. She faces up to 65 years in prison after admitting one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death. Prosecutors agreed to drop three other counts related to the distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of methamphetamine that was unrelated to the Perry case. In a brief statement when the plea deal was announced, her lawyer Mark Geragos said she was \"taking responsibility for her actions\". The judge is not bound to follow any terms of the plea agreement, but prosecutors have said they will ask for less than the maximum possible sentence. Perry died aged 54 in October 2023. He had struggled with addiction for years, but released a memoir a year before his death during a period of being clean. He had been using ketamine through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, but in the weeks before his death had also started to seek more of the drug illegally. Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 (£4,464) in cash four days before his death, prosecutors said.

The actor's live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, an acquaintance Erik Fleming, and a physician, Mark Chavez, all agreed to plead guilty when the charges were announced in August 2024. Another doctor, Salvador Plasencia, initially pleaded not guilty and had been due to face trial alongside Sangha, but changed his plea in July. Sangha and Plasencia had been the primary targets of the investigation. The three other defendants: Chavez, Iwamasa and Fleming pleaded guilty in exchange for their co-operation, which included statements implicating Sangha and Plasencia. Perry had bought ketamine from Sangha after he was led to her by Fleming, prosecutors said. On the day of Perry's death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to Sangha's indictment. Sangha is due to be sentenced on 10 December. The other four defendants are also still awaiting sentencing. Perry was one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing in Friends - which ran on NBC between 1994 and 2004. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for all 10 seasons of the show. The Friends stars were among around 20 mourners who attended his funeral in November 2023, according to TMZ."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  Nigel Farage knows how to seize on a moment and how to spin a line. He came to Washington to declare that Britain had \"become North Korea.\" I'm not sure if he has been to North Korea, but I have, and I can report that Britain is not North Korea. But then it makes a good headline and Mr Farage knows that. And to underline his point, he was gifted a moment with the news of the arrest of Graham Linehan two days ago at Heathrow. But perhaps Mr Farage met his match over here on the other side of the Atlantic and on the other side of the political divide. At a committee hearing in Washington - examining the perceived threat and impact that UK and EU online safety laws have on free speech - Mr Farage was given what liberals will likely regard as an evisceration by a number of Democratic Party politicians. American politicians know how to drive a sound bite. One lawmaker called Mr Farage a \"fringe politician\". Another, Representative Jamie Raskin, described Mr Farage's appearance as \"a drive by hit against a Democratic ally to benefit a Donald Trump sycophant and wannabe…\" \n                  Partial release of Epstein files feeds view the whole truth is being covered up\n                 \n                  Trump suffers setback in bid to act as national police chief after chaos on streets of LA\n                 \n                  Trump says 11 dead in strike on Venezuelan drugs boat\n                 Mr Raskin went on to address the British people. \"To the people of the UK who think this Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant will protect freedom in your country, come on over to America and see what Trump and MAGA are doing to destroy our freedom.\"  There is a curiosity around this hearing. The right in Britain (Farage) and the left in America (Raskin et al) are using this moment to warn of what they both see as the erosion of freedom of speech in their own countries. Frankly both are using the moment to score political points for their own side in their own countries - you'd expect nothing less.

Instead he said he was here to warn against the stifling of any free speech; and to warn America of where he thinks it leads: \"'authoritarian Britain\" in his mind. Speaking to the committee, Mr Farage said: \"I've come today as well to be a klaxon, to say to you, don't allow piece by piece, this to happen here in America. \"And you would be doing us and yourselves and all freedom-loving people a favour if your politicians and your businesses said to the British government, 'You've simply got this wrong, at what point did we become North Korea?'\""

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n  The deployment of National Guard soldiers on to the streets of LA by Donald Trump was always deeply controversial - and now it has been deemed illegal, too, by a federal judge. In late spring in Los Angeles, I observed as peaceful protests against immigration raids turned confrontational. I watched as Waymos - self-driving cars - were set alight and people waving flags shut down one of the city's busiest freeways. I saw government buildings spray-painted with anti-government sentiment and expletives. Some people even threw bottles at police officers in riot gear. In exchange, I saw law enforcement deploy \"flash bang\" crowd control devices and fire rubber bullets into crowds, indiscriminately, on occasion. It was chaotic at times, violent, even, in a corner of the downtown area of the city. But I didn't witness anything that suggested police were on the brink of being overcome by rioters. I didn't see anything that I believe justified the deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 marines to the heart of America's second-biggest city. But Trump sent them in anyway, against the wishes of the local government. LA mayor Karen Bass condemned the deployment as an act of political theatre and said it risked stoking tensions. The language Trump used was, arguably, inflammatory, too. He described LA as an \"invaded\" and \"occupied city\". He spoke of \"a full-blown assault on peace\", carried out by \"rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of continuing a foreign invasion of our country\".  It didn't reflect reality. The size of the protests were modest, several thousand people marching through a handful of streets in downtown LA, a city which spans 500 square miles and has a population of almost four million. The majority of the soldiers simply stood guard outside government buildings, often looking bored. Some of them are still here, with nothing to do. Now a judge has ruled that the operation was illegal. US District Judge Charles Breyer said the Trump administration \"used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armour) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles\". Read more from Sky News:French government on brink of collapseXi hails 'great regeneration of China' at parade  In a scathing judgement, he effectively accused the White House of turning National Guard soldiers and marines into a \"national police force.\" That breaches a law from 1878, barring the use of soldiers for civilian law enforcement activities. It is a blow to what some view as the president's ambition to federalise Democrat-run cities and deploy the National Guard in other states around the country. He had threatened to send troops to Chicago as part of an initiative he says is cracking down on crime, widening the use of National Guard troops, as seen on the streets of Washington DC.  But since this judge ruled that the deployment of National Guard and marines to LA in June was unlawful in the way it unfolded, Trump may have to be inventive with his rationale for sending soldiers into other US cities in the future. This legal judgement, though, is being appealed and may well be overturned. Either way, it is unlikely to stem the president's ambition to act as national police chief."

Of 33,000 pages released by the US House committee, they said 97% were already public and that, in any case, we're talking about less than 1% of all the files. A lot of figures they insist add up to a lot of nothing. Our US partner network NBC News reports that so far, material released includes Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with Todd Blanche, videos from a search warrant of Epstein's West Palm Beach home and the jail cell where he died, and audio pertaining to Palm Beach Police's initial investigation. None of this is new: It was either already public, or known by NBC and other journalists. The partial release feeds the view that the whole truth is being covered up. Expect to hear it from Epstein victims who will gather for a news conference on Capitol Hill later. They are the survivors at the centre of the story, too often forgotten in its telling, coming together in a powerful spectacle. For them, this affair is about justice, and they are angered by its politics. They smell a strategy designed to protect the guilty, and it piles insult upon injury. When their voice is heard at the seat of power, it'll find an echo on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill. Read more:Maxwell was given 'platform to rewrite history'What you need to know about Trump, Epstein, and the MAGA controversy Amanda Roberts - the sister-in-law of Virginia Roberts, an Epstein victim who died in April - told NBC's Hallie Jackson ahead of the conference that \"as a community, we have to stand up, and we have to say enough is enough\". Another survivor of Epstein's abuse, Wendy Avis, has come forward for the first time in the wake of the Department of Justice's handling of the files. She said: \"I'm making the right choice, and that's powerful to me, because I don't have to second guess myself any more.\" Summer recess hasn't diminished the desire in Congress for a full release of all the Epstein files.  What's the endgame? Republicans have joined Democrats to back a petition aimed at forcing their disclosure, even if there may not be enough to push it through. It is the legislative strand of the Epstein affair, but it is, by no means, the only one. Much of America won't let go of this story, and much of it is the Trump MAGA base. Their endgame is a full release of the Epstein files. If they get their wish, how the game ends for Donald Trump would be the question to follow."

Andrew Bailey told a committee of MPs that the risks around inflation had gone up and he was \"more concerned\" about weakness in the labour market. Bank staff projections expect the main consumer prices index measure of inflation to rise to 4% this year - double the 2% target rate - from its current level of 3.8%. Food prices are proving the main driver currently, with part of the increases blamed on government tax rises on employers. On the prospects for further interest rate reductions this year, Mr Bailey said: \"There is now considerably more doubt about when and exactly how quickly we can make those further steps.\" Money latest: Wetherspoons stops accepting some banknotes in England Interest rates are elevated to help ease the pace of price growth and cut, when able, to help maintain inflation at the 2% target level.

He was speaking as financial markets continued to see a widespread sell-off of long-dated bonds, largely over fears of rising government debt levels in many western economies including the US and UK.  The activity has taken the yield - the effective interest rate demanded by investors - in 30-year gilts to a 27-year high this week. Other shorter dated bonds have also risen sharply. But Mr Bailey urged less of an emphasis on the long-term gilts, as headlines point out that any increase in the cost of servicing government debt is a headache chancellor Rachel Reeves can well do without as she battles to balance the books. He told the MPs: \"It's important not to ... over focus on the 30-year bond rate. Of course, it's a number that gets quoted a lot, it's quite a high number. It is actually not a number that is being used for funding at all at the moment.\" Mr Bailey also waded into the continuing row across the Atlantic that sees the independence of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, threatened by Donald Trump and his quest for interest rate cuts. He has moved to fire a Fed governor over alleged mortgage fraud and make a new appointment but Lisa Cook, who was appointed to the board by Joe Biden, is fighting his bid to oust her in the courts. \"This is a very serious situation\", Mr Bailey said. \"I am very concerned. The Federal Reserve... has built up a very strong reputation for independence and for its decision making,\", adding that trading central bank independence against other government decisions would be a \"very dangerous road to go down\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The cost of long term UK government borrowing has hit a fresh 27-year high but the governor of the Bank of England has talked down its importance as chancellor Rachel Reeves battles challenges to the public finances.. The interest rate demanded by investors on the state's long-dated borrowing (30-year bonds) rose to just below 5.75%, surpassing the 5.72% peak reached on Tuesday, pushing it to a high not seen since May 1998. The latest movements took place a day after the government auctioned off a record series of 10-year loans - and was forced to pay a premium to do so. Issuing bonds is a routine way states raise money. Money blog: Sainsbury's criticised for trialling 'spying' technology As well as meaning the state has to pay more to borrow money, high interest rates on debt can signify reduced investor confidence in the ability of the UK to pay back these loans. It is a reason why the chancellor's budget - set today for late November - has come into such sharp focus in recent weeks. But the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, told a committee of MPs: \"It's important not to... over focus on the 30-year bond rate. \"Of course, it's a number that gets quoted a lot, it's quite a high number, it is actually not a number that is beingused for funding at all at the moment\". The 30-year yield stood at 5.62% soon after his remarks. The benchmark for state borrowing costs, the interest rate on 10-year bonds, also saw rises earlier. The yield rose above 4.8% for the first time since January, before slightly falling back  The spiked borrowing cost also continued to cause a weakening in the pound. After an initial fall to a month-long low against the dollar, one pound again buys $1.34. It means sterling goes less far in dollars than before the latest peak in interest rates on government bonds. On Monday, sterling could buy $1.35. Sterling dropped to equal €1.14 before easing up to €1.15. Just a few months earlier, a pound could buy €1.19 before Donald Trump's April country-specific tariff announcements. So why has this happened?  Government borrowing costs have been rising across the world amid a sell-off in bonds - which prompts investors to look for a higher return to hold them. High inflation and national debts have increased concern about whether states can pay back the money.

UK bond yields tend to follow the US. Key to easing UK borrowing costs was the announcement of the date of the budget on Wednesday morning. Business and economics correspondent The date of this year's autumn budget has been set for 26 November, a month later than the previous one, which was held on 30 October. There might be a number of explanations behind that change, but we shouldn't read too much into the shift.  In 2023, Jeremy Hunt delivered the autumn statement on 22 November.  The year before, it was held on 17 November.  So, 26 November is not wildly out. However, going later rather than sooner does give the Treasury a little more time to prepare for what will undoubtedly be a tricky affair.  Chiefly, the extra month gives them time to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility that its plans will lift growth.  That will feed through to the economic forecasts that underpin her tax and spending plans.  It means we could get a series of growth-enhancing announcements over the coming months, which will be aimed at the OBR as much as they are aimed at the public.  The budget will also most likely have to contain further tax rises if the chancellor is to meet her fiscal rules.  She will have to calibrate these carefully to avoid the perception that she is damaging economic growth.  It will also require more imaginative thinking if she is to maintain the manifesto promise not to raise the big taxes: income tax, VAT and national insurance.  It might involve some knotty changes, and a little extra time could help to get it right.  UK public finances had been a worry for markets as Chancellor Rachel Reeves struggles to stick to her fiscal rules to bring down the debt and balance the budget. Disquiet around comparatively low growth in the UK economy also played a role."

So far, proceeds have gone towards funding mental health support for children, but there are plans to remarket the product to raise money for medical supplies instead.  In solidarity action elsewhere, climate activist Greta Thunberg embarked on her second attempt to reach Gaza by sea on 31 August. The 22-year-old was accompanied by other activists and was cheered on by thousands of supporters as the flotilla set off from Barcelona stocked with aid. Her previous attempt in June saw her and others detained and deported by the Israeli authorities. Reporters Without Borders has also renewed calls to stop the killing of journalists inside the territory after five, from Al Jazeera, the Associated Press, and Reuters, were confirmed dead. Israel vehemently disputes claims its forces have intentionally killed reporters or civilians, saying its sole aim is to destroy Hamas. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, more than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed since the 7 October attacks in 2023, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, mainly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. In the two years since, most of Gaza's population has been displaced, with famine declared in Gaza City."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Angela Rayner's explanation for her failure to pay the correct stamp duty on her home in Hove rests on a claim that she was wrongly advised about her tax exposure when buying the property earlier this year. Following media reports that she had avoided tax of up to £40,000 she took fresh advice and now acknowledges she should have paid the second-home stamp duty surcharge, taking the tax owed on the £800,000 property from £30,000 to £70,000. She says the confusion lies in the complexity of her domestic affairs, arising from arrangements made to care for her son, who has \"lifelong disabilities\" and special educational needs. Politics latest: Angela Rayner facing calls to quit In 2020 an award was made to Ms Rayner's son following what she called \"a deeply personal and distressing incident\" as a premature baby, and a trust was established to manage the award and his interests. She is not explicit in her statement but it is presumed the \"award\" was financial, potentially made in compensation. Ms Rayner says she and her then husband Mark Rayner committed to transfer their interest in the family home in Ashton-under-Lyne to the trust, of which their son is the sole beneficiary. \n                  Angela Rayner: 'Victim of misogyny' or 'freeloading' deputy prime minister?\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner came out fighting in our interview - but her future is now out of her control\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's tax affairs statement in full\n                 In 2023, the couple divorced but agreed that their children would remain in the family home while they routinely moved in and out to care for them, an arrangement known as nesting. At that time, Ms Rayner said some of their interest in the family home passed to her son's trust  In January 2025, the deputy prime minister says she sold her remaining interest in the home to her son's trust and used it as a deposit on a flat in Hove, valued at around £800,000. She took out a mortgage to cover the remainder of the purchase. At the time, she says she took tax advice and was told that, given she no longer owned any other property, she was only required to pay standard stamp duty, which would have totalled around £30,000. Money latest: Wetherspoons stops accepting some banknotes in England  Following media reporting last month she says she sought fresh advice from \"senior tax counsel\" and was told she was in fact liable to pay the second-home stamp duty surcharge, an additional 5% flat charge, because of what she calls \"complex deeming provisions\" relating to her son's trust. Deeming provisions are a legal device that create a \"legal fiction\" to simplify complex issues, often in relation to tax. Ms Rayner gives no details of the provisions, but one explanation is that if she has rights under the terms of the trust to live in the family home for life, it should be treated as her main residence for the purposes of stamp duty. HMRC's guidance on the higher rate of stamp duty states parents of under-18s are treated as the owners of residential property \"even if the property is held through trust and they are not the trustees\". She says that the Ashton-under-Lyne property remains her family home, where she is registered for official, financial and medical purposes.

She had classified this as her second home for council tax purposes, which as a consequence is paid for by the government. The advice that counts now is that which Sir Laurie Magnus gives to the prime minister. The government's independent ethics adviser may want to know if Ms Rayner provided the full facts regarding the trust and her main home to her first tax adviser, or whether by omission the fault lies with her."

Sky News has learnt that Bodycare, which was founded on a Lancashire market stall more than half a century ago, is expected to appoint administrators from Interpath Advisory as soon as Friday. Bodycare, which specialises in selling fragrances, toiletries, cosmetics and skincare products, employs about 1,500 people and trades from nearly 150 stores across the country. The chain's collapse into insolvency proceedings is likely to trigger a further effort by Interpath to find a buyer for parts of the business. The company is owned by Baaj Capital, a family office run by Jas Singh. Baaj, which is considered a likely candidate to buy Bodycare back from the administrators, counts In The Style among its other investments. The firm also attempted to take over The Original Factory Shop earlier this year before its offer was trumped by Modella Capital, another specialist retail investor. Read more from Sky News:Value of pound sinksUK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts Bodycare's deepening crisis comes just weeks after the retailer secured a £7m debt facility to buy it short-term breathing space. The facility was secured against Bodycare's retail inventory, according to a statement in July. Bodycare was established by Graham and Margaret Blackledge in Skelmersdale in 1970, and sells branded products made by the likes of L'Oreal, Nivea and Elizabeth Arden. The chain was profitable before the pandemic, but like many retailers, lost millions of pounds in the financial years immediately after it hit. Bodycare received financial support from the taxpayer in the form of a multimillion-pound loan issued under one of the Treasury's pandemic funding schemes. The chain is run by retail veteran Tony Brown, who held senior roles at BHS and Beales, the now-defunct department store groups. Bodycare is the latest high street chain to face collapse this year, amid intensifying complaints from the industry about tax increases announced in last autumn's Budget. In recent weeks, River Island and Poundland both narrowly avoided administration after winning creditor approval for restructuring plans involving store closures and job losses. Baaj has been contacted for comment, while Interpath declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The American investors who have agreed to become the new owners of The Daily Telegraph have edged closer to gaining control of the newspaper by formally notifying the government of the deal. Sky News understands that lawyers acting for RedBird Capital Partners, which will own a majority stake in the publisher if the deal is approved, submitted their detailed proposals to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in the last few days. The filing means that Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, must decide whether to issue a new Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) which would trigger further investigations into the takeover. The notification by RedBird Capital's lawyers should pave the way for the lifting of an interim enforcement order (IEO) imposed by Lucy Frazer, the then Conservative culture secretary, in December 2023, which prevented the acquirers from exerting any control over the Telegraph. Insiders believe that the removal of the IEO will result in the DCMS issuing a new PIIN, which would prompt investigations by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority into the £500m takeover. A previous PIIN was issued in January 2024 when RedBird intended to buy the Telegraph titles in conjunction with Abu Dhabi state-controlled investor IMI. Following a fraught legislative battle, IMI is now restricted to owning a maximum 15% stake in the newspapers - which it intends to acquire as part of the RedBird-led consortium. Sky News has already revealed that Sir Leonard Blavatnik, owner of the DAZN sports streaming platform, and Daily Mail proprietor Lord Rothermere are preparing to buy minority stakes as part of the RedBird-led transaction. Read more from Sky News:Value of pound sinksUK hit by toxic cocktail of market shifts RedBird said in May that it was \"in discussions with select UK-based minority investors with print media expertise and strong commitment to upholding the editorial values of the Telegraph\". The Telegraph's ownership has been in a state of limbo for nearly two-and-a-half years after its parent company was forced into insolvency by Lloyds Banking Group, which ran out of patience with the Barclay family, the newspaper's long-standing owner. RedBird IMI, a joint venture between the two firms, paid £600m in 2023 to acquire a call option that was intended to convert into ownership of the Telegraph newspapers and The Spectator magazine. The Spectator was sold last year for £100m to Sir Paul Marshall, the hedge fund billionaire, who has installed Lord Gove, the former cabinet minister, as its editor. In July, the House of Lords approved legislation that will allow IMI, which is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and ultimate owner of Manchester City Football Club, to hold a minority stake. Other bidders had tried to gatecrash the Telegraph deal, with the field of rival contenders led by Dovid Efune, the owner of The New York Sun. His key backer - the hedge fund founder Jeremy Hosking - recently told Sky News their bid was \"ready to go\" if the RedBird-led transaction fell apart. Announcing its agreement to acquire the Telegraph titles in May, Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird Capital, said it marked the \"start of a new era\" for two of Britain's most prominent newspapers. Mr Cardinale said after the Lords vote: \"With legislation now in place, we will move quickly and in the forthcoming days work with DCMS to progress to completion and implement new ownership for The Telegraph.\" Senior Telegraph executives and journalists are said to be frustrated at the pace of the process. None of the parties involved in the Telegraph ownership situation would comment, while the DCMS declined to comment."

        "Content": " Angela Rayner has admitted she did not pay the right amount of stamp duty on the purchase of her second home and has referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards.  Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby on the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, the deputy prime minister became tearful as she claimed she received incorrect tax advice and spoke to her family about \"packing it all in\". Ms Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, has been under scrutiny after a report in The Daily Telegraph claimed she avoided £40,000 in stamp duty on a flat in Hove by removing her name from the deeds of another property in Greater Manchester. In a lengthy statement released today, she said it was a \"complex living arrangement\" as her first home was sold to a trust following her divorce to provide stability for her teenage son, who has lifelong disabilities and is the sole beneficiary of the trust. She said initial legal advice was that the standard rate of stamp duty applied, but following media reports, she sought expert counsel who said more tax is due. She added that these matters were confidential but she applied to a court yesterday to get this lifted in the interests of public transparency. In a subsequent interview with Beth Rigby, a visibly upset Ms Rayner said: \"I've been in shock, really, because I thought I'd done everything properly, and I relied on the advice that I received and I'm devastated because I've always upheld the rules and always have felt proud to do that. \"That it is devastating for me and the fact that the reason why those confidential clauses were in place was to protect my son, who, through no fault of his own, he's vulnerable, he's got this life changing, lifelong conditions and I don't want him or anything to do with his day-to-day life, to be subjected to that level of scrutiny.\" Asked if she thought about quitting rather than disclose the details about her son, the cabinet minister added: \"I spoke to my family about it. I spoke to my ex-husband, who has been an incredibly supportive person because he knows that all I've done is try and support my family and help them.\" Allies jump to Rayner's defence  Her comments came shortly before the first PMQs following the summer recess. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Keir Starmer should fire his deputy. \"If he had backbone, he would sack her,\" she said.  However, the prime minister defended Ms Rayner, saying he is \"very proud\" to sit alongside her. \"She's gone over and above in setting out the details, including yesterday afternoon asking a court to lift a confidentiality order in relation to her own son,\" the prime minister said. \"I am very proud to sit alongside a deputy prime minister who is building 1.5m homes, who is bringing the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation, and has come from a working-class background to become deputy prime minister of this country.\" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also came out in support of Ms Rayner, saying as the parent of a disabled child himself he trusts that she was acting in her family's interests. \"I understand it is normally the role of opposition leaders to jump up and down and call for resignations - as we've seen plenty of from the Conservatives already,\" he said. \"Obviously if the ethics advisor says Angela Rayner has broken the rules, her position may well become untenable. \"But as a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son's care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here. \"Perhaps now is a good time to talk about how we look after disabled people and how we can build a more caring country.\" Ms Rayner was also backed by Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, who told Sky News' chief political correspondent Jon Craig that he thinks attacks against her are driven by a \"heavy dose of misogyny\". He said: \"Angela Rayner comes under sustained coverage because she's a working-class woman in a way that frankly Nigel Farage, leading members of the shadow cabinet, never would. \"I think there's a real heavy dose of misogyny when it comes to Angela. As far as I'm concerned, the prime minister's got faith in her and I think the country's got faith in her as well.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting also came to her defence, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that she acted in \"good faith\" and it would be an \"absolutely travesty\" if she had to resign. Key points from Rayner statement  In her statement, Ms Rayner said that following the divorce from her husband in 2023, they agreed to a nesting arrangement where their children would remain in their family home, in Ashton-under-Lyne, while they alternated living there. She said she sold her interest in that home to a trust earlier this year, before buying the property in Hove. The trust was originally set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons after a \"deeply personal and distressing incident\" as a premature baby that left him with lifelong disabilities The home had been adapted for her son and the sale to the trust was to give him \"the security of knowing the home is his\", Ms Rayner said. She went on to say that she did not own any other home when she bought the flat in Hove, and her understanding \"on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty\". She added: \"However, given the recent allegations in the press I have subsequently sought further advice from a leading tax counsel to review that position and to ensure I am fully compliant with all tax provisions. \"I have now been advised that although I did not own any other property at the time of the purchase, the application of complex deeming provisions which relate to my son's trust gives rise to additional stamp duty liabilities.\" Ms Rayner said she is working with HMRC to establish what is owed, claiming her arrangements \"reflect the reality that family life is rarely straightforward\". She concluded: \"I deeply regret the error that has been made. I am committed to resolving this matter fully and providing the transparency that public service demands. \"It is for that reason I have today referred myself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, and will provide him with my fullest cooperation and access to all the information he requires.\" Watch and listen to the full Electoral Dysfunction interview on Wednesday afternoon - www.podfollow.com/electoraldysfunction"

For days, this story has run on and now we have a better picture of why. The deputy prime minister told me she had to ask for court permission to release details of her domestic arrangements to give the background to the tax trouble she now finds herself in. And on Wednesday, she revealed all. Politics latest: Why the deputy PM nearly resigned It is a complicated and personal story, but in essence, her family had a trust set up in 2020 to provide for her son who has lifelong disabilities to ensure that he would be provided for and protected. When she divorced her husband in 2023, some of the interest in the family home was transferred to the trust and then in 2025, she sold her remaining interest in the property to her teenage son's trust. She then used the proceeds from that to buy the new property in Hove, using the money from her family home in Ashton to pay the deposit. \n                  Angela Rayner: 'Victim of misogyny' or 'freeloading' deputy prime minister?\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's explanation for stamp duty error not the end of the matter\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's tax affairs statement in full\n                  Ms Rayner says she was advised that the home she bought was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty. It now turns out that advice was wrong and she owes tens of thousands in underpaid tax, because Hove is classified as her second home rather than her main residence. She says it was a genuine mistake and has referred herself to the PM's independent standards commissioner and informed HMRC. She says she will pay any additional tax owed. The deputy PM was clearly upset in our interview by having to disclose private details about her teenage children. I was left in little doubt that she had felt forced to share information about them that she really didn't want to share. She also admitted that she had discussed packing it all in with her ex-husband and children rather than putting this personal stuff into the public domain, but her family wanted her to go public to answer media reports that she had acted in a \"hypocritical way\". Read more: Angela Rayner a 'great British success story', says PM \"We felt that under the circumstances that having that reputation, for me as their mother, was more damaging than correcting the record on what we were trying to do,\" she said. But this is much more than just trying to save Ms Rayner's reputation. Her political career is on the line, and, at the moment, it is unclear whether she will be able to continue as deputy prime minister. She told me in our interview that the prime minister \"knows the circumstances\" and \"knows the challenges that my son has faced and the background to all of that\", and it is now for the PM's independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to look at the evidence that she was advised she did not have to pay a stamp duty surcharge. He has a reputation for being quick and if he finds Ms Rayner broke the ministerial code, it will be hard to see how Sir Keir Starmer will not accept that advice. On top of that, HMRC is also investigating the deputy prime minister and if she is found to have been careless around her tax, she might face a penalty on top of the stamp duty owed, which will again put her under huge pressure. There is also the political fall out for a politician who has gone in hard on Tories over tax questions for years.  Defending her from the attacks that are now surely to come is going to burn through a lot of political capital of a government already in trouble. Will her colleagues around the cabinet table and on the backbenches have the stomach for it? When I asked her in our interview whether she really believed her position was sustainable, given she had underpaid on tax and that she was the housing minister, she told me that she hoped \"people can see what has happened and see that I wasn't trying to dodge tax\", and when she realised that advice was inaccurate she \"took immediate steps to do the right thing -you should pay the tax that is owed\". \"Hopefully, people can see there isn't any intention to deceive, to avoid, to be hypocritical in the way in which I have conducted myself,\" she said. Ms Rayner is never far from the headlines and has often found herself under fire in her political career, rising to the second most powerful office in the country from the most humble of backgrounds. But she knows too that despite complicated family issues, she has made a very serious error indeed and one which she would have been quick to criticise had the perpetrator been a political opponent. She has come out fighting today, but whether she can survive is now beyond her control."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky\n Reform UK members will table a motion at their party conference which is expected to call for transgender women to be excluded from men's prisons, Sky News understands. The motion is set to be held this Saturday during Reform's party conference, taking place in Birmingham. Politics latest: Why the deputy prime minister nearly resigned It comes after Nigel Farage faced criticism for initially appearing to back Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor whom he hired as an adviser, when she said some transgender women could be housed in female jails. At a news conference last month, Ms Frake said cases needed to be assessed \"on an individual basis\" and that those calling for a blanket ban \"clearly have never set foot in a prison\". The Reform UK leader originally appeared to echo Ms Frake, saying the issue was about \"risk assessment\" - before later saying he did not agree. Asked if he agreed with his adviser's position, he said: \"I personally never worked in a prison, so I can't answer that. \"But I think you'll find that the answer that you'll get from somebody who has worked in prisons at the highest possible level is, I think basically it's about risk assessment.\" However, the next day, Mr Farage posted on social media that he had \"never supported men in women's prisons\", and reposted a video from April in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that the definition of a woman is based on biological sex. Mr Farage's initial comments have been regarded as a blunder by Reform insiders, who welcomed the motion on Saturday as a chance to clarify the party's position. They also attracted criticism from Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who posted on X: \"Just because huge swathes of the left have revealed themselves to be dripping in misogyny doesn't mean a massive chunk of the right doesn't remain exactly as indifferent to women's rights and issues as it's always been.\" What else is on Reform's agenda? Reform UK's first conference will focus on the cost of living crisis, immigration and net zero. In the wake of Mr Farage's appearance at the House Judiciary Committee in Washington on Wednesday, and the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan at Heathrow on Monday for a series of anti-trans posts, it is also expected that freedom of speech will feature on the conference agenda. Mr Farage raised Mr Linehan's case to the committee on Capitol Hill, saying the arrest involving five police officers was \"authoritarian\". He added: \"At what point did we become North Korea? Well, I think the Irish comedy writer found that out two days ago at Heathrow Airport.\" Read more:Angela Rayner's future is now out of her controlTruss calls for Trump-style 'revolution' in the UK  Farage: Britain has become authoritarian He also referenced the jailing of former childminder and wife of a Conservative councillor Lucy Connolly for inciting racial hatred after the Southport murders last year. She has now been released. \"It doesn't give me any great joy to be sitting in America and describing the really awful authoritarian situation that we have now sunk into,\" Mr Farage added. He described Ms Connolly's post as \"intemperate, it was wrong, but she removed it three and a half hours later. \"Sentenced to 31 months in prison.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The leader of Britain's trade unions has urged Labour to fight Reform UK by hitting millionaires, banks and gambling with higher taxes. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, has published an opinion poll of 5,000 adults. He says the results suggest a significant number of Labour voters are leaning to Reform. His call comes ahead of the TUC's annual conference starting in Brighton this weekend, when the high-tax policy is expected to be overwhelmingly approved. \"I've seen first-hand the experience of the wealth tax, the solidarity tax in Spain and it raised billions of euros,\" Mr Nowak said in a pre-conference interview with Sky News. \"It didn't lead to an exodus of millionaires or wealthy people from Spain and Spain now has one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. So I think it's a good example of a wealth tax in action. \"But it's not the only option the government has. They could equalise capital gains tax with income tax. \"They could have a windfall tax on the banks and the financial institutions who have got record profits. \"And they could tax the gambling industry much more fairly.\" He continued: \"The big four banks between them had profits of nearly £46bn last year alone, mainly because we're in a high interest rates environment. \"Under the previous Conservative government, when the energy companies had huge windfall profits, they moved to a windfall tax, extended by Labour. \"We think they should take a similar approach in banking and other sectors where we may see those windfall profits.\" Labour voters 'leaning to Reform' The debate over a wealth tax was triggered by a call by former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, in an interview on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News on 6 July, for a 2% levy on people with assets of more than £10m. Weeks later, it was backed by Labour's former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, on Sky News political editor Beth Rigby's Electoral Dysfunction podcast, but rejected by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Ms Reeves will deliver the budget on 26 November. On the TUC's poll, carried out on 15-19 August, Mr Nowak said 74% of 2024 Labour voters who are now \"leaning to Reform\" backed wealth, gambling, and bank taxes. This was also true for 84% of 2024 Conservative to Labour switchers. Read more:No room for Treasury complacencyDodds says she 'hopes' Reeves considering wealth tax  'A clear dividing line' \"We polled the public on a 2% wealth tax on those with assets of more than £10m,\" Mr Nowak said. \"Most people would recognise, if you've got £10m in assets, you could probably afford to pay a little bit more in tax. \"This is a clear dividing line between the government and Reform, showing you are on the side of working people. \"We know some [union] members voted for Reform at the last general election and clearly Reform was the biggest party at the local elections and union members would have been among those who cast their vote for Reform. \"My job isn't to tell trade union members which way they should vote or not. What we want to do is expose the gap between what Nigel Farage says and what he does. \"He says he stands up for working people and then votes against rights for millions of working people when it's introduced in parliament. \"He says he stands up for British industry and supports Donald Trump and his destructive tariffs. And he talks about tax cuts for the rich when we know that we need those with the broader shoulders to pay their fair share.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  To her most savage critics - from Tories to the far left - she's \"Rotten Rayner\", a tax evader, freeloader and a \"low life… on the make\". To her trade union friends, she's a victim of misogyny who right-wing politicians are attempting to hound out because she's working class. And after her tearful interview on Sky News, even among some of her political opponents there's a degree of sympathy for Angela Rayner too. Politics latest: Why the deputy PM nearly resigned But amid the rancorous debate among MPs about whether she should stay or go, there's one part of her defence that is attracting scepticism from friends and foes. That's her claim that she was initially given duff advice by a solicitor. Really? If she has evidence to substantiate that, she may be in the clear, though there'd no doubt be accusations of an establishment stitch-up. But if not - and the city grandee who's the PM's ethics adviser - the Eton and Oxford-educated baronet Sir Laurie Magnus - rejects her defence, she'll almost certainly have to go. And with her resignation - or sacking - would almost certainly go her hopes of succeeding the increasingly unpopular Sir Keir as Labour leader, despite her popularity with the party's activists. When she arrived for Prime Minister's Questions, just half an hour after her bombshell confession, the Labour high command placed a collective arm around her. Sir Keir Starmer, who told MPs he was proud to sit alongside a deputy PM from a working-class background, put his hand on her left shoulder.  Badenoch misses an open goal... Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, sitting the other side of the beleaguered Ms Rayner, did the same on her right shoulder. Rachel Reeves, who also knows all about being beleaguered and shedding tears in public, looked across at her and smiled sympathetically. If Labour feared a brutal PMQs onslaught from Kemi Badenoch, they needn't have worried. \"Why is she still in office?\" the Tory leader began. So far, so good. \"If he had a backbone he would sack her,\" she said in the second of her six questions. But that was it. \"But let us get back to borrowing,\" she continued. Inexplicably, the Tory leader ploughed on with her pre-prepared questions on government borrowing. Labour MPs couldn't believe their luck. Cue numerous jokes about missed open goals. After another dud Kemi-Kaze performance at PMQs, some MPs were even speculating that Ms Rayner's survival prospects - slim, at best - remain better than those of the Tory leader.  ...but others go in studs up But in the cruel world of social media, Ms Rayner was not spared a vicious onslaught from critics from across the political divide. You'd better keep your phone switched off, Angi. From the spiky shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Ms Rayner was \"the property tax dodging, freeloading deputy prime minister\" who had \"finally admitted breaking the law and evading paying taxes owed\". There was more. \"She says that she's sorry,\" said punchy Priti. \"But she's only sorry that she was caught out. Rotten Rayner should go.\" Nadhim Zahawi, who was sacked as Tory chairman in 2023 after an inquiry found he failed to disclose an investigation into his tax affairs, added: \"Did you think about my children Angela Rayner? \"Breaks my heart seeing anybody distressed about their children, but the hypocrisy really does hurt.\" But it wasn't just Tories - who let's not forget were denounced as \"Scum!\" by Ms Rayner back in 2021, in what she described as \"street language\" - who were brutal. The acerbic George Galloway declared: \"She's a lowlife\". For good measure, he claimed she was \"on the make\" and on \"Supermarket Sweep, piling her trolley full\". Read more:Rayner admits she should have paid more stamp dutyRayner came out fighting in Sky interviewRayner's tax affairs statement in full However, from the trade union movement, which campaigned hard for the DPM's workers' rights legislation, there was unequivocal support. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak told Sky News: \"Angela Rayner comes under sustained coverage because she's a working-class woman in a way that frankly Nigel Farage, leading members of the shadow cabinet, never would. \"I think there's a real heavy dose of misogyny when it comes to Angela. \"I wouldn't want to see a hounded out of an important role by right wing politicians and the right wing media who frankly can't handle the fact that a working class woman is our deputy prime minister.\" There was sympathy from one party leader, Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats, who said that as a parent of a disabled child \"I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son's care after we have gone\". 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Shortly after PMQs, opening a Tory debate on, yes, property taxes, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride opted for ridicule and mockery. \"I'm absolutely certain that the deputy prime minister had a good recess,\" he began. \"We saw many photographs of her down at the seaside, just off the coast in a rubber dinghy, rather like many of the other photographs over the summer given the reckless policies this government has towards illegal migration. \"She was probably celebrating the acquisition of another property for her property empire, but perhaps also slightly tinged with that nagging doubt as to whether she had indeed paid enough stamp duty. \"Well, we'll get to the bottom of that in due course.\" Quite so, Mel. We will.  A fight for survival Let's also reflect that on Monday Sir Keir Starmer proudly announced: \"Phase two of my government starts today.\" On Tuesday, he informed MPs, he was \"speaking at length\" to Ms Rayner. Must have been awkward. And on Wednesday, the PM had to watch her tearful confession, just minutes before facing MPs in the Commons. Not a great start to phase two, prime minister. Nor for his embattled and tearful deputy, who's now fighting for political survival."

Following media reports that she had avoided tax of up to £40,000 she took fresh advice and now acknowledges she should have paid the second-home stamp duty surcharge, taking the tax owed on the £800,000 property from £30,000 to £70,000. She says the confusion lies in the complexity of her domestic affairs, arising from arrangements made to care for her son, who has \"lifelong disabilities\" and special educational needs. Politics latest: Angela Rayner facing calls to quit In 2020 an award was made to Ms Rayner's son following what she called \"a deeply personal and distressing incident\" as a premature baby, and a trust was established to manage the award and his interests. She is not explicit in her statement but it is presumed the \"award\" was financial, potentially made in compensation. Ms Rayner says she and her then husband Mark Rayner committed to transfer their interest in the family home in Ashton-under-Lyne to the trust, of which their son is the sole beneficiary. \n                  Angela Rayner: 'Victim of misogyny' or 'freeloading' deputy prime minister?\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner came out fighting in our interview - but her future is now out of her control\n                 \n                  Angela Rayner's tax affairs statement in full\n                 In 2023, the couple divorced but agreed that their children would remain in the family home while they routinely moved in and out to care for them, an arrangement known as nesting. At that time, Ms Rayner said some of their interest in the family home passed to her son's trust  In January 2025, the deputy prime minister says she sold her remaining interest in the home to her son's trust and used it as a deposit on a flat in Hove, valued at around £800,000. She took out a mortgage to cover the remainder of the purchase. At the time, she says she took tax advice and was told that, given she no longer owned any other property, she was only required to pay standard stamp duty, which would have totalled around £30,000. Money latest: Wetherspoons stops accepting some banknotes in England  Following media reporting last month she says she sought fresh advice from \"senior tax counsel\" and was told she was in fact liable to pay the second-home stamp duty surcharge, an additional 5% flat charge, because of what she calls \"complex deeming provisions\" relating to her son's trust. Deeming provisions are a legal device that create a \"legal fiction\" to simplify complex issues, often in relation to tax. Ms Rayner gives no details of the provisions, but one explanation is that if she has rights under the terms of the trust to live in the family home for life, it should be treated as her main residence for the purposes of stamp duty. HMRC's guidance on the higher rate of stamp duty states parents of under-18s are treated as the owners of residential property \"even if the property is held through trust and they are not the trustees\". She says that the Ashton-under-Lyne property remains her family home, where she is registered for official, financial and medical purposes. Read more:Rayner admits she should have paid more stamp dutyRayner came out fighting in Sky interviewRayner's tax affairs statement in full In December 2024, Ms Rayner was granted the use of a grace-and-favour flat in Admiralty House in Whitehall in her role as deputy prime minister, and gave up a rented property in London to move in. She had classified this as her second home for council tax purposes, which as a consequence is paid for by the government. The advice that counts now is that which Sir Laurie Magnus gives to the prime minister. The government's independent ethics adviser may want to know if Ms Rayner provided the full facts regarding the trust and her main home to her first tax adviser, or whether by omission the fault lies with her."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  Nigel Farage knows how to seize on a moment and how to spin a line. He came to Washington to declare that Britain had \"become North Korea.\" I'm not sure if he has been to North Korea, but I have, and I can report that Britain is not North Korea. But then it makes a good headline and Mr Farage knows that. And to underline his point, he was gifted a moment with the news of the arrest of Graham Linehan two days ago at Heathrow. But perhaps Mr Farage met his match over here on the other side of the Atlantic and on the other side of the political divide. At a committee hearing in Washington - examining the perceived threat and impact that UK and EU online safety laws have on free speech - Mr Farage was given what liberals will likely regard as an evisceration by a number of Democratic Party politicians. American politicians know how to drive a sound bite. One lawmaker called Mr Farage a \"fringe politician\". Another, Representative Jamie Raskin, described Mr Farage's appearance as \"a drive by hit against a Democratic ally to benefit a Donald Trump sycophant and wannabe…\" \n                  Partial release of Epstein files feeds view the whole truth is being covered up\n                 \n                  Trump suffers setback in bid to act as national police chief after chaos on streets of LA\n                 \n                  Trump says 11 dead in strike on Venezuelan drugs boat\n                 Mr Raskin went on to address the British people. \"To the people of the UK who think this Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant will protect freedom in your country, come on over to America and see what Trump and MAGA are doing to destroy our freedom.\"  There is a curiosity around this hearing. The right in Britain (Farage) and the left in America (Raskin et al) are using this moment to warn of what they both see as the erosion of freedom of speech in their own countries. Frankly both are using the moment to score political points for their own side in their own countries - you'd expect nothing less.

Instead he said he was here to warn against the stifling of any free speech; and to warn America of where he thinks it leads: \"'authoritarian Britain\" in his mind. Speaking to the committee, Mr Farage said: \"I've come today as well to be a klaxon, to say to you, don't allow piece by piece, this to happen here in America. \"And you would be doing us and yourselves and all freedom-loving people a favour if your politicians and your businesses said to the British government, 'You've simply got this wrong, at what point did we become North Korea?'\""

Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.\" The health secretary told Sky News Breakfast with Wilfred Frost that he can't comment on the specifics of the case, as operational police decisions are \"rightly independent of politicians\". However, Mr Streeting said more generally that the government would rather see \"police on the streets rather than policing tweets\".

He said that those priorities are neighbourhood policing and keeping borders safe. Writing on Substack, Lineham said that after flying into the UK from Arizona, he was detained by five armed officers at Heathrow Airport and put in a cell before being questioned over posts published on X in April. He added that officials became concerned for his health after taking his blood pressure, and he was taken to hospital. His arrest has drawn criticism from opposition politicians. Senior Conservative MP Sir James Cleverly said the arrest looked like a \"real overreaction\" to what was \"self-evidently a joke\".  Meanwhile, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the incident was \"ridiculous and a complete waste of police time\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who is currently in Washington to give evidence to the House Judiciary Committee on free speech in the UK, told Sky News the arrest was a \"huge overreach\". \"We finished up in a situation where a foreigner, somebody with an Irish passport, coming into Heathrow airport is arrested by five police. And that could be an American executive.\" But Sir Keir Starmer would not commit to reviewing the law or police guidelines when asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n Controversial efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in cattle are likely to fail unless there's greater urgency and funding from the government, scientists have warned. The disease has caused bitter divisions between farmers and wildlife groups because of the use of badger culls to reduce transmission of the disease to cattle. The government has vowed to end the cull in 2029 and vaccinate badgers instead, with a target of eliminating the disease in English cattle herds by 2038. Now a scientific review of the strategy has warned it will only succeed if the government rapidly rolls out badger jabs and steps up infection control within cattle herds. Professor Sir Charles Godfray, who led the government-commission review, said: \"We're obviously fully aware of the great pressures of the public finances at the moment. \"Nevertheless, we believe that investment in bovine TB control now will save money in the future.\" A huge cost to farming \n                  One of the world's biggest icebergs is finally breaking up after 40 years\n                 \n                  Hate speech, harassment and free speech: What you can't say online\n                 \n                  Why the EU has banned some gel nail polishes – and when the UK is expected to do the same\n                 TB continues to devastate British farming and wildlife almost halfway through a 25-year strategy to eliminate the disease. In the last decade alone, 274,000 cattle have been compulsorily slaughtered in England, and over 230,000 badgers have been culled since 2013. Last year, compensation paid out for slaughtered cattle was almost £23m. Jeremy Clarkson revealed in July that his farm \"gone down with TB.\" \"Bad news from Diddly Squat,\" he said in a post on X. \"Everyone here is absolutely devastated.\" Genetic tracing of the TB bug shows most cattle are infected by other animals in the herd. But the original source of the disease is likely to be wildlife or the movement of infected cattle from elsewhere. Vaccination of badgers will become a key part of the elimination strategy once culling stops. But the report says there are currently significant challenges, including difficulties in catching sufficient badgers. 'Greater urgency' needed Prof Godfray said: \"Considerable effort will be required to scale up vaccination, so that it comes viable, both economically and logistically.\" But he added better biosecurity and testing was also needed to stop the disease being spread by cattle movements between farms. Hopes are high for a cattle vaccine which is currently being assessed by government veterinary regulators. Professor James Wood, from the University of Cambridge, and who was also part of the review team, said: \"This is a very exciting advance, but we feel that greater urgency could be applied here. \"Cattle vaccination presents huge opportunities for protecting cattle and reducing transmission in herds.\" Read more from Sky News:Rayner admits stamp duty errorMurdered teen's mum wants smartphone ban The government said it would consider the review's findings. A new strategy to eradicate the disease will be published next year. Farming minister Daniel Zeichner said: \"The government is determined to eradicate bovine TB - a devastating disease that destroys too many farmers' livelihoods and has led to the culling of thousands of badgers. \"Following a record year for badger vaccination in 2024, a new Badger Vaccinator Field Force will be deployed next year. \"We are also developing a cattle vaccine and, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, have invested over £40m into vaccine related research.\""

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  It's the mother of all break-ups. The life of one of the world's largest and longest lasting icebergs is finally coming to an end after it drifted away from Antarctica nearly 40 years ago. In March, we flew over megaberg A23a after it ran aground off South Georgia, one of the UK's most remote overseas territories. Back then it was a trillion-tonne block of ice more than twice the size of Greater London. There were concerns its collapse close to the island might endanger globally significant populations of penguins, seals and seabirds. But a few months later the iceberg floated free and began drifting again, looping around to the north of South Georgia where now, in the Antarctic spring, it is finally falling apart. \"It's been exposed to warmer waters for quite a long time,\" said Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. \"So it's pretty much rotted through.\" Satellite images from the last few days now reveal \"we've got really big chunks breaking off,\" said Meijers. The largest piece to come away in the last few days is 80 sq km - a colossal iceberg in its own right. A23a is still 1,700sq km - larger than London - but will now rapidly disappear. 'It's not going to last for more than a few weeks' \"It's not going to last in that chunk format for more than a few weeks or a month at most,\" predicts Meijers. As the iceberg breaks up, the surface area of pieces exposed to warmer water increases, accelerating its melting. It's also now caught in a current carrying it northwards, into increasingly milder temperatures. The rapid break-up of A23a means it's unlikely to pose a risk to wildlife on South Georgia but will represent a temporary hazard to shipping - especially as pieces become too small to monitor by satellite. Last week, RAF Operation Cold Stare, using the aircraft that flew us over the iceberg in spring, overflew A23a again. One of its roles is to map icebergs that may threaten shipping - largely fishing vessels and Antarctica-bound cruise ships in a remote corner of the Southern Ocean. During our flight over A23a it was hard to imagine a block of ice so large disappearing so fast. But even then we could see cracks several kilometres long running through it. All along its edges were cathedrals-sized caverns and vast \"terraces\" of ice at sea-level resulting from pounding by waves that rapidly crumble into the ocean. Satellite records of large icebergs don't go back long enough for scientists to know whether they are becoming more frequent as the planet warms. But there's strong evidence the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where A23a and many of its predecessors began their lives, is melting increasingly fast. Antarctica is losing around 150 billion tonnes of water each year, half of which is carried away in the form of icebergs. Read more:The impact of the world's biggest icebergYour iceberg A23a questions answered  Antarctic melting is being closely monitored by scientists concerned about the impact it is having on major ocean currents that underpin global climate - a potential \"tipping-point\" in planetary warming. As it has shrunk, A23a has now ceded its world heavyweight title to the 3000sq km iceberg D15a, which is aground on the coast of Antarctica close to where it broke off in 1992."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       The arrest of Father Ted's co-creator over social media posts has reignited arguments over what you should and shouldn't be allowed to say online. Graham Linehan, who also created the Black Books and The IT Crowd comedies, said on Tuesday he was arrested at Heathrow Airport over posts on X sharing his views on trans rights. In one of his posts, Linehan said: \"If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.\" Now, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has told Sky News the government needs to look at whether police are \"getting the balance right\", and that the government would rather see \"police on the streets rather than policing tweets\". X owner Elon Musk also questioned the priorities of the British police after Linehan's arrest and has previously called Britain a \"tyrannical police state\". So what kind of posts could get you in trouble with the law? The type of posts most hotly debated in the last year are around hate speech and extremism. Posts that stir up racial or religious hatred, promote violence or are deemed hate-motivated harassment are all illegal. Hate speech and harassment  Although they were already outlawed by bills like 1986's Public Order Act, the Online Safety Act of 2023 gave the authorities stronger guidelines and powers when dealing with hate speech online. This hit the headlines last year when riots swept the UK in the wake of Axel Rudakubana's murder of three young girls in Southport. Hundreds of people were arrested, with a number of those detained because of their social media posts. Childminder Lucy Connolly was one of them - she was released in August after nine months in prison. She had pleaded guilty to publishing written material to stir up racial hatred after the Southport stabbings, posting on X: \"Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the bastards for all I care... if that makes me racist so be it.\"  Extremism and terrorism There are also separate laws around extremism and terrorism. You cannot share posts that support organisations like Hamas, Palestine Action, the far-right group National Action or other proscribed groups. In June, 30-year-old Zakir Hussain was jailed for five years and eight months after posting on X in support of Hamas and Hezbollah in the wake of the 7 October attacks in Israel. He also wrote numerous antisemitic comments, including praise for the actions of Adolf Hitler. \"This case demonstrates, yet again, that we will act when we receive information about social media content that is unlawful,\" said the head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command at the time. Libel Posts that harm a person's or organisation's reputation by making false statements can also get you into trouble - although libel is a civil offence, rather than a criminal one. Last year, actor-turned-politician Laurence Fox was ordered to pay £180,000 in damages after he called former Stonewall trustee Simon Blake and drag artist Crystal \"paedophiles\" on social media. Repeating libellous claims can get you in even more trouble and is classed as contempt of court, which also covers posts that risk prejudicing court proceedings. This could involve commenting on anyone involved in a case from the point that someone is arrested, if it has the potential to influence a jury in a future or ongoing trial. Those who commit contempt of court can be jailed for up to two years, fined, or both. Far-right political activist Tommy Robinson was jailed last year after admitting breaching a 2021 High Court order banning him from repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him for libel. Mr Robinson was released in May. Encouraging serious self-harm and suicide A number of new rules were added to UK law through the Online Safety Act. Some of them, like encouraging serious self-harm, have only recently started being tested in court. In July, 23-year-old Tyler Webb became the first person to be sentenced for the offence after he groomed a young woman into self-harm online. Repeatedly harassing someone, sending messages with the intent to cause distress to the recipient or intentionally false messages designed to cause \"non-trivial psychological or physical harm\" is also banned under UK law.  Intimate image abuse Rules around intimate image abuse were also strengthened by the act. Cyber-flashing, sending someone unsolicited intimate pictures, and revenge porn, sharing or threatening to share intimate pictures without consent, were outlawed. Other serious sexual offences have been around for longer. Depictions of extreme violence or sexual violence, as well as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), are all banned. Sharing CSAM is illegal even if the material is AI-generated, for example, through a \"nudifying\" app or creating images that aren't photo-realistic. Last November, 27-year-old Hugh Nelson was jailed for 18 years after using an AI picture generator to turn ordinary pictures of children into child abuse images and selling them online."

        "Content": "The European Union has banned a key ingredient in gel nail polish, raising concerns that products used in salons in the UK and elsewhere may not be safe. From 1 September 2025, Norway, Switzerland, and all 27 EU member states have prohibited the use and sale of the chemical trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide, or TPO. This means that any leftover nail products containing TPO can no longer be used in salons in those countries. Under a post-Brexit framework, the UK is considering imposing a similar ban in late-2026 - but until then, TPO products are still allowed. What is TPO and why are scientists concerned about it? Trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide is a substance used in gel nail polishes as a photoinitiator - a molecule that sparks a reaction when exposed to light. This means that when a customer in a nail salon places their gel nails under a lamp, the polish hardens and becomes more resistant to chipping. Following a small number of studies linking TPO exposure to long-term fertility issues in animals, EU officials decided to classify it as a CMR (carcinogen, mutagen, reprotoxic) under its classification, labelling, and packaging regulations. The EU TPO ban is seen as a precautionary measure, as scientists have not yet evidenced any risk to humans. The US is also yet to legislate on it, with TPO products still allowed in salons across all 50 states. Read more from Sky NewsEvery mobile phone to receive emergency alertWhy you're seeing zombie rabbits with black horns onlineNew internet safety rules explained The Gel Bottle, which produces the thickening product BIAB, or Builder In A Bottle, cautioned in a statement: \"The cosmetics industry frequently undergoes regulatory updates to protect consumer safety and wellbeing. \"These updates are proactive measures, ensuring products remain compliant with the latest scientific research and safety standards. This is not a product recall, current products remain safe to use.\" Will it impact nail salons in the UK? Since Brexit, separate legislation governs the use of chemicals in Great Britain, with Northern Ireland subject to slightly modified rules under the Windsor Framework due to its location on the island of Ireland. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulations have been in place since 1 January 2021. REACH consulted with businesses, scientists, and other stakeholders over the use of TPO in 2022, with most respondents supporting a ban by October 2026. This was intended to give businesses time to transition to alternative products. The UK government has said \"subject to consent of the Scottish and Welsh governments... [it] intends to introduce\" the ban on the proposed timescale, although this is yet to be confirmed. How widely is TPO used in salons? TPO has proved a popular choice for gel nail products because it works with both UV and LED light, allowing salon owners more choice in the type of drying equipment they use. However, as soon as the EU began the process of banning it, manufacturers started to swap their products for TPO-free alternatives. Popular brands such as OPI, Apres Nail, and Aimelli now have a wide range of non-TPO products. The Gel Bottle says all of its EU products are now TPO-free. \"We are pleased to confirm that 100% of The Gel Bottle products sold in the EU are now fully TPO-free and compliant with the September 2025 regulation,\" it said in a statement. \"We are actively transitioning all products to new TPO-free formulations, with reformulated versions already rolling out. We expect the entire range to be fully TPO-free ahead of the UK regulatory deadline (Sep 2026).\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n A woman known as the \"Ketamine Queen\" has officially pleaded guilty to selling Friends star Matthew Perry the drug that killed him. Jasveen Sangha initially denied the charges but agreed to change her plea in a signed statement in August, just a few weeks before she had been due to stand trial. The 42-year-old, a dual citizen of the US and the UK, has now appeared in a federal court in Los Angeles to plead guilty to five charges, including supplying the ketamine that led to Perry's death. She faces up to 65 years in prison after admitting one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death. Prosecutors agreed to drop three other counts related to the distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of methamphetamine that was unrelated to the Perry case. In a brief statement when the plea deal was announced, her lawyer Mark Geragos said she was \"taking responsibility for her actions\". The judge is not bound to follow any terms of the plea agreement, but prosecutors have said they will ask for less than the maximum possible sentence. Perry died aged 54 in October 2023. He had struggled with addiction for years, but released a memoir a year before his death during a period of being clean. He had been using ketamine through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, but in the weeks before his death had also started to seek more of the drug illegally. Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 (£4,464) in cash four days before his death, prosecutors said. Read more:The Hollywood drugs network exposed by Perry's deathObituary: The one who made everyone laugh  Sangha, described by prosecutors as the \"Ketamine Queen of North Hollywood\", is now the fifth and final person to plead guilty to charges connected to the supply of drugs to the Friends star. The actor's live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, an acquaintance Erik Fleming, and a physician, Mark Chavez, all agreed to plead guilty when the charges were announced in August 2024. Another doctor, Salvador Plasencia, initially pleaded not guilty and had been due to face trial alongside Sangha, but changed his plea in July. Sangha and Plasencia had been the primary targets of the investigation. The three other defendants: Chavez, Iwamasa and Fleming pleaded guilty in exchange for their co-operation, which included statements implicating Sangha and Plasencia. Perry had bought ketamine from Sangha after he was led to her by Fleming, prosecutors said. On the day of Perry's death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to Sangha's indictment. Sangha is due to be sentenced on 10 December. The other four defendants are also still awaiting sentencing. Perry was one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing in Friends - which ran on NBC between 1994 and 2004. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for all 10 seasons of the show. The Friends stars were among around 20 mourners who attended his funeral in November 2023, according to TMZ."
