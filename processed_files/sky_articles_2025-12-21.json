        "Content": "The US is in \"active pursuit\" of a third oil tanker near Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea, officials have said. It comes amid escalation from the Trump administration against Nicolas Maduro's government, and as the US builds up a naval military presence in the region, including the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and its support group. The status of the attempted interception is unclear, according to Sky's US partner network NBC News, but reports first emerged at around 2.30pm in the UK that the operation was under way. As it happened: US in 'active pursuit' of third vessel  Two officials told NBC News the US Coast Guard was in \"active pursuit\" of the vessel, which is sanctioned by the US. One told the outlet it was \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\". \n                  How Trump has supercharged the new world dis-order\n                 \n                  US seizes another tanker off Venezuela - as Brazil issues warning\n                 \n                  Trump turns angry ahead of Epstein files release\n                 \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said, adding that dark fleet vessels usually do not operate exclusively for one country. It is understood the vessel is sailing under the name Bella 1, according to British maritime risk management group Vanguard, according to NBC News and Bloomberg. Sky News has seen Bella 1 is sanctioned by the US government, according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website, and has been included on the list since June 2024. Read more: The real reason for Donald Trump's Venezuela exploits One US official told NBC the vessel was sanctioned under the counterterrorism authority for its involvement in the network of Houthi financial facilitator Sa'id al Jamal. Another US official separately told the New York Times the ship did not submit to being boarded and continued onward. If successful, it would mark the third such interception near Venezuela in the past two weeks, with a tanker being seized on Saturday and near the start of the month. Explained: The US-Venezuela crisis Trump's 'blockade' of tankers  Earlier this week, the US president declared he had ordered the \"blockade\" of oil tankers into and out of the South American country. He said the US military would remain in place until Venezuela returns \"all of the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us\". In the social media post following months of escalating tensions in the Caribbean, Donald Trump said Venezuela was surrounded by the \"largest armada ever assembled in the history of South America\". Venezuela's government has accused Mr Trump of \"violating international law, free trade, and the principle of free navigation\" with \"a reckless and grave threat\" against the South American country. China's foreign minister Wang Yi later accused the US of \"bullying\" Venezuela, and said on Wednesday: \"China believes the international community understands and supports Venezuela's position in defending its legitimate rights and interests.\" Washington has also announced sanctions on numerous oil tankers, shipping companies and family members of Mr Maduro. President Trump has been ramping up pressure on the Maduro regime, accusing it of involvement in the drugs trade. As part of his efforts, he has also authorised deadly strikes against vessels he claims are trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. President Maduro claims Mr Trump is trying to overthrow him with a view to seizing Venezuela's oil reserves."

        "Headline": "One of 16 documents missing from the release was a chest of drawers with pictures, which includes two photos of Donald Trump. The Department of Justice have since restored the image, saying it was removed \"out of an abundance of caution\".",
        "Content": "Pictures of Donald Trump were included among at least 16 documents that disappeared from the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Democrats from the House Oversight Committee drew attention to the apparent removal of an image showing two printed pictures of Mr Trump in a desk draw. One picture had Mr Trump standing surrounded by women in bathing suits, while the second appears to be an already known picture - partly obscured - of him, his wife Melania, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. After the Democrats flagged the missing image on Saturday, Sky News went back to the files online and confirmed that it did appear to be missing, despite the fact they downloaded it when the files were initially released on Friday. The other photos removed from the trove of documents were almost all nude paintings of women in Epstein's home. In a post on X on Sunday, the DOJ said the image including pictures of Mr Trump has since been reposted on to the Epstein Files page. Sky News has seen that file number 468 is once again listed online. Mr Trump is still visible in the latest version of the image, and there is no immediate difference from the original upload. The DOJ said that \"the Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims\". \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the department added. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\" Mr Trump has not commented on the release of the files and has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's case. Questions over heavy redactions Thousands of documents relating to the dead paedophile financier were made public by the DOJ on Friday - hours before a legal deadline following the passing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Many of the pages were either partially or fully redacted, which the DOJ says is to protect the more than 1,200 victims and their families identified in them. Some of Epstein's victims, legal experts and members of the public have questioned whether this is the sole reason for the redactions, while the Oversight Democrats have claimed: \"This is a White House cover-up.\" Ashley Rubright, who was abused for several years after meeting Epstein in Palm Beach when she was 15, told Sky News: \"Seeing [...] completely redacted pages, there's no way that that's just to protect the victims' identities, and there better be a good reason. I just don't know if we'll ever know what that is.\" Gloria Allred, a lawyer who has represented some of Epstein's victims, says she has been told that despite the heavy redactions, some compromising pictures of survivors and their names were left in the files released on Friday. \"We have had to notify the Department of Justice about names that should have been redacted that weren't redacted,\" she told Sky News. \"So this is further trauma to survivors, and apparently also some of the images of some of the survivors appear not to have been redacted, and they are nude or not completely dressed. \"This is a major concern because the law clearly indicates, and the judges have indicated, that the names and any identifying information of the survivors must be redacted.\" Read more:Epstein victims react to partial release of filesLinks between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files In a letter to the judges overseeing the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, US attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton acknowledged that a review \"of this size and scope is vulnerable to machine error [or] instances of human error\". He also said the DOJ had opted to redact the faces of women in photographs with Epstein \"even where not all the women are known to be victims,\" as it was not viewed as practical for the DOJ to identify every person in all the photos. The methodology has led to some confusion and misled speculation online. Many celebrities and public figures appear with Epstein in the photos published by the DOJ, often included without context. There is no suggestion that these pictures imply anyone has done anything wrong, and many of those featured in them have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Through its release, the Trump administration has claimed to be the most transparent in history, despite the fact Congress forced their hand by voting to make the files public by 19 December. But some have been held back, with Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, saying more would follow in the coming weeks. Many Democrats and some Republicans have criticised the partial release as failing to \"comply with law,\" as have lawyers including Ms Allred. \"So clearly, the law has been violated. And it's the Department of Justice letting down the survivors once again,\" she said. She labelled the incomplete release of the files a \"distraction\", adding: \"This is not over, and it won't be over until we get the truth and transparency for the survivors.\""

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n The family of a Palestine Action prisoner on day 43 of a hunger strike says she could die in prison if the UK government does not intervene. Teuta Hoxha, 29, has been on remand, awaiting trial for 13 months. Her sister told Sky News she suffers from continuous headaches, mobility issues, and can no longer stand for prayer. They fear the worst.   \"I know that she's already instructed the doctors on what to do if she collapses and she's instructed them on what to do if she passes away,\" Teuta's younger sister Rahma said. \"She's only 29 - she's not even 30 yet and nobody should be thinking about that,\" she added. \"She's been on remand for over a year, her trial's not until April next year and bail keeps getting denied.\" Rahma, 17, said despite ill health, Teuta calls her from prison every day to help with homework. \"She's like my mother figure,\" she said. \"Our mother passed away when I was really young. \"Teuta took care of me and my siblings and made sure to read us bedtime stories. She's always there for me and even from prison, she's helping me do my homework and revise for exams.\" \"My sister is a caring and loving person,\" Rahma added. \"It feels like the state has taken a piece of me.\" Teuta is among eight Palestine Action prisoners who have been on hunger strike. They are all on remand, awaiting trial for offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage, with some having been in custody for over 12 months. They all deny the charges. The hunger strikers demand an end to the UK's hosting of weapons factories supplying arms to Israel, the de-proscription of Palestine Action, an end to mistreatment of prisoners in custody, and immediate bail.

UK law sets out custody time limits to safeguard unconvicted defendants by preventing them from being held in pre-trial custody for an excessive period of time. The regulations governing these limits require the prosecution to progress cases to trial diligently and expeditiously. The government has said it will not intervene in ongoing legal cases. Minister of state for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending Lord Timpson said: \"These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. \"Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients. \"Ministers will not meet with them - we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.\" On Monday, Teuta is set to mark her 30th birthday behind bars. There will be no birthday cake, Rahma said. \"The only form of resistance she has is her body and that's what she is using against the state,\" she said. A spokesperson for HMP Peterborough declined to comment on specific individuals, but said all prisoners are managed in line with government policies and procedures. They continued: \"If any prisoner has specific complaints, we encourage them to raise them directly with the prison, as there are numerous channels available for addressing such concerns.\""

        "Content": "The earliest publicly known survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse has told Sky News there was a \"wilful blindness\" about the young women and children around him - as she claimed the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had \"broken the law\" with the Epstein files. Warning: This article contains details of sexual assault. In 1991, Jess Michaels, then a 22-year-old professional dancer, was introduced to Epstein by a roommate who said he had a \"fabulous experience\" with the financier. They met twice, with the first meeting being an interview at his office in Madison Avenue for a role as a masseuse.  During their second meeting at Epstein's penthouse, she said he raped her. Speaking to Sky News presenter Barbara Serra, Ms Michaels said that while she did not meet anyone else in connection with the convicted sex offender, \"the volume of wilful blindness and blatant disregard for the protection of the young women and the children\" that were \"very obviously around Jeffrey Epstein\" was \"horrific\". Three months after her encounter with Epstein, Ms Michaels said she left New York \"because of the anxiety and the insomnia\". Six months after, she said she could \"pull a pair of size zero jeans down off of my hips because I was really struggling to even eat properly\", and noted that a friend remembered she \"just slept all the time\". 'That didn't even get us justice' Speaking almost 35 years after her ordeal and days after the release of thousands of files relating to Epstein, Ms Michaels said her mission now \"is that nothing like this happens again and that we change something\". However, the White House has come under heavy criticism as only a fraction of the files have so far been released, with many heavily redacted and some disappearing after being uploaded. When asked how she felt about the latest release, Ms Michaels noted that the Epstein Transparency Act, signed by Donald Trump in November, required the DoJ to release all files by 19 December. \"The US Department of Justice has broken the law,\" she said. \"Blatantly so. So sometimes I hear from people or journalists, 'so how do you feel? what comes up next?' I actually don't care.\" She added the DoJ had \"proved the point of why we needed to get an Act of Congress to actually listen to us and try to get justice. And that didn't even get us justice.\" Ms Michaels later said \"it's not unexpected\", and said it marked the \"exact same treatment we have received across five administrations\". It is important to note that inclusion in the Epstein files does not infer any wrongdoing. 'What do you expect us to do?' Ms Michaels said she had been looking for her own statement she made to the FBI about Epstein, and said many survivors \"want to hear the FBI tipline recordings because it proves the volume of victims that did come forward that maybe got disregarded\". In the wake of Epstein's arrest in 2019, the FBI set up a telephone number for any information on his crimes. However, Ms Michaels said she \"initially got disregarded\" when she rang. \"When they called back in 2019, the officer said to me, 'Well, we have to call everyone back, but it was 30 years ago. What do you expect us to do about it now?'\" Ms Michaels said she has not been able to find any information on her call to the FBI in the files released, and said it is \"extremely frustrating because we don't know how to easily search this database\". She also noted that despite being told her statement was going to be used in Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial, \"I never heard a word\" and that \"the lack of statement proves the negligence we've been saying all along\". Ms Michaels is the earliest victim of Epstein to have come forward with her experience. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Read more:Victims express shock and outrage over incomplete release of filesThe links between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files He did not face prosecution for crimes relating to the sexual abuse of young girls until the 2000s. He was later arrested in Florida on state felony charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of a prostitute in 2006. An FBI investigation also found dozens of women had accused the financier of sexual assault, and it looked likely that the 53-page federal indictment built against him would see him face a lengthy prison sentence. Epstein instead agreed to a plea deal and was convicted on those state charges, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was registered as a sex offender. Read more: The mysterious life and death of Epstein At the time of his death, Epstein was being held in custody on charges related to running a sex-trafficking scheme that involved dozens of underage girls. He had pleaded not guilty and faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Epstein was specifically accused of using his private jet, nicknamed the Lolita Express, to shuttle girls as young as 14 between his lavish residences in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. In a post on X, US attorney general Pam Bondi said the DoJ would \"bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims\". \"We reaffirm this commitment, and ask any victim to please come forward with any information pertaining to any individuals who engaged in illicit activity at their expense,\" she said. \"We have met with many victims and victims groups, and will continue to do so if more reach out. Please contact myself, DAG Blanche, or the FBI and we will investigate immediately. We believe in the equal standard of justice in this country and will ensure that Justice is served.\" The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said the justice department was continuing to review the remaining Epstein files and was withholding some documents under exemptions meant to protect victims. \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law - full stop. Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim,\" the justice department said, quoting Mr Blanche in a post on X."

        "Content": "Israel has approved 19 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank in a fresh blow to the possibility of a Palestinian state. The move brings the number of new settlements over the past few years to 69, a new record, according to Israel's far-right finance minister Betzalel Smotrich. Widely considered illegal under international law, the settlements have been criticised for fragmenting the territory of a future Palestinian state by confiscating land and displacing residents.   Under Israel's current government, figures show, the number of settlements in the West Bank has surged by nearly 50%, rising from 141 in 2022, to 210 with the new approvals, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog. The government's latest action retroactively authorises some previously-established outposts or neighbourhoods of existing settlements, and the creation of settlements on land where Palestinians were evacuated. It also approves Kadim and Ganim, two of the four settlements dismantled in 2005, and which Israelis were previously banned from re-entering as part of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Since Israel repealed the 2005 act in March 2023, there have been multiple attempts to resettle them. The move comes amid mounting pressure from the US to move ahead with the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October. Mr Smotrich is one of a number of figures now prominent in Israel's government who back the settlements. The West Bank, east Jerusalem, and Gaza are claimed by the Palestinians for their future state, but were captured by Israel in the 1967 war.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n This is a story about a roundabout in Leicester.  It's not a particularly special roundabout. But it does tell us something about British politics. Belgrave Circle, in the north of the city, was opened in March 2015 on the site of an old railway station known locally as \"The Gateway to Skegness\". Later that year, Leicester - along with the rest of the country - went to the polls in the 2015 general election. The vote saw David Cameron win a majority and Ed Miliband resign as Labour leader. But around the Belgrave Circle, something different was going on. Because this is the spot where Leicester's three parliamentary constituencies meet, and in 2015 they were all held by Labour MPs who saw their majorities increase. It's a different story now. Stand in the middle of the roundabout and face towards Abbey Park and you'll see the city's only remaining Labour seat - that of cabinet minister Liz Kendall. Turn around and face the B&M Home Store, and you'll find the only place the Conservatives picked up at the last election. This freak occurrence happened after the Labour vote was split by two independent candidates - both of whom also happened to be former MPs for the city. Labour saw its vote share cut in half here, and then some. The Tory vote dropped as well, but not by enough to stop the party coming through the middle and taking the seat by four thousand votes. But walk to the south of this roundabout and you'll get to where an independent candidate went one step further. Local optician Shockat Adam won this seat last year, defeating frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth in a campaign focused mainly on Gaza and events in the Middle East. What happened on this roundabout last July is no one-off. There's plenty of evidence to suggest these phenomena could be on the rise around the country. Since the election, Labour's vote share has plunged, and its base has fractured as support for insurgent parties on the right and left surges. A lot of the focus from this has been on Reform UK and how Labour can stop Nigel Farage in traditional 'red wall' seats in the midlands and the north. And yes, Labour is leaking support to Reform on the right. But what's often not talked about is the greater number of votes its losing on the left. A rejuvenated Green Party under Zack Polanski is chasing Labour close in some polls, while Your Party is attempting to form a separate fighting force straddling ex-Corbynites, independent pro-Gaza candidates and those from the more hard-left tradition. Come the next election, this could all have far-reaching consequences. Sky News has ranked all 404 Labour seats according to how at risk they are to these new forces on the left. We created this 'vulnerability index' using factors like voting history, population and demographic data. It shows several cabinet ministers in the top 25 most vulnerable, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in fourth place, Sir Keir Starmer in thirteenth place and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy in twenty-third place. All three of these Labour big beasts have seen their majorities cut in the last election by a Green candidate, an independent candidate or a mix of the two. In Birmingham Ladywood, the total number of votes won by independent and green candidates exceed the number won by the Home Secretary. That could trigger trouble, given the Greens and Your Party have indicated they may be open to the idea of local \"progressive pacts\". But in the neighbouring constituency of Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, the result last year shows how an altogether different result could materialise. Here, Labour's vote was again split by a left-wing insurgent candidate - this time from George Galloway's Workers Party. But the conservative vote was also cut in half by Reform. If Nigel Farage can unite the right in places like this, he could come through the middle - in much the same way the Tories did in Leicester. So how can the government fight back? Part of the answer, according to senior figures, is attempting to tell a more appealing story about the more overly left-wing chunks of their policy platform - such as the workers rights reforms and rental overhaul. The hope is these stories may be given more of a hearing in 2026 when (or perhaps more accurately, if) a corner starts to be turned on big domestic priorities like the economy, the NHS and migration. If that doesn't happen, the real saving grace for Labour could be tactical voting. The Greens and Your Party have made it clear that they will plough on with their campaigns against the government, even if it ultimately benefits Reform.

If they are faced with the prospect of Nigel Farage in Downing Street, could they hold their nose and stick with Labour? It all begs the question - who is their great enemy: the government or Reform? Ministers are already trying to emphasise a binary choice when they talk about Labour being the one single \"bulwark\" to Nigel Farage. Expect more attempts to mobilise this anti-Reform vote in the years ahead. But that's made more difficult by what happened around Leicester's Belgrave Circle. The same political fracturing that's dogged the right in years past now being replicated on the left. Labour's ability to pick up the electoral pieces may prove decisive in whether what took place on a shabby East Midlands roundabout in July 2024 is recreated across the country in a few years' time."

        "Content": "Australia's prime minister was met with boos and insults when he arrived at a Bondi Beach vigil for victims of last week's gun attack.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was booed when his name was announced on the stage set up in front of the crowd - amid anger that the premier hasn't done more to tackle rising antisemitism in Australia. In contrast, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns's name was greeted with cheers and a standing ovation. The premier was thanked for his leadership and for not missing \"a funeral, synagogue service, or an opportunity to be with the Jewish community this week\". Before going to the vigil, Albanese had announced a review of the country's police and intelligence agencies a week after the deadly Bondi Beach gun attack. Albanese said the review, ‌led by a former chief of Australia's spy agency, would probe whether federal police and intelligence agencies have the \"right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\". The review comes as Australia marks a day of reflection to honour those killed and injured by two gunmen at Sydney's Bondi Beach. Authorities invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday evening, the start of the eighth and final day of the Jewish festival of lights, \"as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones\" of the victims. An evening memorial event at Bondi Beach will take place under a heavy police presence, including officers carrying long-arm firearms, police said in a statement. A minute's silence was also held at 6.47pm (7.47am UK time). Earlier this week, around 700 people on paddle boards and surfboards took to the sea at Bondi Beach, forming a huge circle in a show of solidarity. News correspondent As the heat of Sydney's summer started to drop away, thousands of people came out to Bondi to support the Jewish community in a day of National Reflection.   They covered the hillside above Bondi.  A sea of people standing in solidarity. \n There was a minute of silence, though it felt much longer as the usual din of Bondi faded away to stillness. \n \n People hugged each other, sat quietly and there were also tears.  It has been a confronting and deeply emotional week for the Jewish community in Bondi, as they struggle to comprehend the scale of the tragedy that has struck them.  The rest of Australia has struggled too.  People are shocked that a mass shooting could happen in this normally peaceful country.  People are angry that the strict gun laws failed to keep firearms out of people with extremist ideology.  Jewish people are angry at the government for failing to curb a rise of antisemitic attacks since the Israel-Gaza war started.   After the memorial I spoke with three of Sydney's Jewish rabbis from the Emmanuel Synagogue.  They said that when it comes to hate speech and antisemitism \"words matter\".  But there are few words of comfort to offer a community still so shaken and raw from the massacre of one week ago.\n \n Gaps in the system The attack ‌exposed gaps in gun-license assessments and information-sharing between agencies that politicians have said they want to plug. Albanese has announced a nationwide gun buyback, while gun safety experts say the nation's gun laws, among the world's toughest, are full of loopholes. Authorities believe the gunmen were inspired by Islamic State. \"The ISIS-inspired atrocity ‍last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation. \"Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond,\" Albanese said in a statement, adding that the review would conclude by the end of April. Albanese has been under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the war in Gaza. Read more at Sky News:US seizes another tanker off VenezuelaEngineer becomes first wheelchair user in space The prime minister has since vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake ‌of the attack. On Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, committed to introducing a bill to ban the display of symbols and flags of \"terrorist organisations\", including those of Islamic State, Hamas and Hezbollah. Authorities say Islamic State flags were found in the car the attackers took to Bondi. One of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday, has been charged with 59 ‍offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. He remains in custody in hospital."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n The Christmas period is upon us, and goods are flying off the shelves, but for some reason, the tills are not ringing as loudly as they should be. Across the country, the five-finger discount is being used with such frequency that retailers are taking action into their own hands. With concerns about the police response to shoplifting, many are now resorting to controversial facial recognition technology to catch culprits before they strike. Sainsbury's, Budgens and Sports Direct are among the high-street businesses that have signed up to Facewatch, a cloud-based facial recognition security system that scans faces as they enter a store. Those images are then compared to a database of known offenders and, if a match is found, an alert is set off to warn the business that a shoplifter has entered the premises. It comes as official figures show shoplifting offences rose by 13% in the year to June, reaching almost 530,000 incidents. Figures reported in August showed more than 80% result in no charge. At the same time, retailers are reporting more than 2,000 cases of violence or abuse against their staff every day. Faced with mounting losses and safety concerns, businesses say they are being forced to take security into their own hands because stretched police forces are only able to respond to a fraction of incidents. At Ruxley Manor Garden Centre in south London, managing director James Evans said theft had become increasingly brazen and organised, with losses from shoplifting now accounting for around 1.5% of turnover. \"That may sound small, but it represents a significant hit to the bottom line,\" he said, pointing out that thousands of pounds' worth of goods can be stolen in a single visit. \n                  Asda to sell 24 stores only to rent them back as it struggles with debt pile\n                 \n                  M&S reveals cost of cyber attack as profit almost wiped out\n                 \n                  KKR makes surprise move to brew up Costa Coffee bid\n                 \"We have had instances where the children get sent in to do it. They know that the parents will be waiting in the car park and they'll know that there's nothing that we can do to stop them.\" Staff members here have also had their fair share of run-ins with shoplifters. In one case, employees trying to stop a suspected shoplifter were nearly struck by an accomplice in a car. \"This is no longer just about stock loss,\" said James, \"It is about the safety of our staff.\" However, the technology is not without its critics. Civil liberties groups have warned that the expansion of this type of technology is eroding our privacy. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, called it \"a very dangerous kind of privatised policing industry\". \"[It] really threatens fairness and justice for us all, because now it's the case that just going to do your supermarket shopping, a company is quietly taking your very sensitive biometric data. That's data that's as sensitive as your passport, and [it's] making a judgement about whether you're a criminal or not.\" Silkie said the organisation was routinely receiving messages from people who said they had been mistakenly targeted. They include Rennea Nelson, who was wrongly flagged as a shoplifter at a B&M store after being mistakenly added to the facial recognition database. Nelson said she was threatened with police action and warned that her immigration status could be at risk. \"He said to me, if you don't get out, I'm going to call the police. So at that point I turned around and I was like, are you speaking to me? Then he was like yes, yes, your face set off the alarm because you're a thief... At that point, I was around six to seven months pregnant and I was having a high-risk pregnancy. I was already going through a lot of anxiety and, so him coming over and shouting at me, it was like really triggering me.\" The retailer later acknowledged the error and apologised, describing it as a rare case of human mistake. Read more:Elon Musk closer to becoming first-ever trillionaireWilliam and George help prepare Christmas lunch for the homeless A spokesperson for B&M said: 'This was a simple case of human error, and we sincerely apologise to Ms Nelson for any upset caused. Reported incidents like this are rare. Facewatch services are designed to operate strictly in compliance with UK GDPR and to help protect store colleagues from incidents of aggressive shoplifting.\" Nick Fisher, chief executive of Facewatch, said the backlash was disproportionate. \"Well, I think it's designed to be quite alarmist, using language like 'dystopian', 'orwellian', 'turning people into barcodes',\" he said. \"The inference of that is that we will identify people using biometric technology, hold and store their own, store their data. And that's just, quite frankly, misleading. We only store and retain data of known repeat offenders, of which it's been deemed to be proportionate and responsible to do so... I think in the world that we are currently operating in, as long as the technology is used and managed in a responsible, proportionate way, I can only see it being a force for good.\" Yet, there is obviously widespread unease, if not anger, at the proliferation of this technology. Businesses are obviously alert to it, but the bottom line is calling."

Teuta Hoxha, 29, has been on remand, awaiting trial for 13 months. Her sister told Sky News she suffers from continuous headaches, mobility issues, and can no longer stand for prayer. They fear the worst.   \"I know that she's already instructed the doctors on what to do if she collapses and she's instructed them on what to do if she passes away,\" Teuta's younger sister Rahma said. \"She's only 29 - she's not even 30 yet and nobody should be thinking about that,\" she added. \"She's been on remand for over a year, her trial's not until April next year and bail keeps getting denied.\" Rahma, 17, said despite ill health, Teuta calls her from prison every day to help with homework. \"She's like my mother figure,\" she said. \"Our mother passed away when I was really young. \"Teuta took care of me and my siblings and made sure to read us bedtime stories. She's always there for me and even from prison, she's helping me do my homework and revise for exams.\" \"My sister is a caring and loving person,\" Rahma added. \"It feels like the state has taken a piece of me.\" Teuta is among eight Palestine Action prisoners who have been on hunger strike. They are all on remand, awaiting trial for offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage, with some having been in custody for over 12 months. They all deny the charges. The hunger strikers demand an end to the UK's hosting of weapons factories supplying arms to Israel, the de-proscription of Palestine Action, an end to mistreatment of prisoners in custody, and immediate bail. Read more:Five Palestine Action hunger strikers taken to hospitalPalestine Action can challenge terror ban after court verdict Their families warn young British citizens will die in UK prisons having never been convicted on an offence. UK law sets out custody time limits to safeguard unconvicted defendants by preventing them from being held in pre-trial custody for an excessive period of time. The regulations governing these limits require the prosecution to progress cases to trial diligently and expeditiously. The government has said it will not intervene in ongoing legal cases. Minister of state for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending Lord Timpson said: \"These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. \"Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients. \"Ministers will not meet with them - we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.\" On Monday, Teuta is set to mark her 30th birthday behind bars. There will be no birthday cake, Rahma said. \"The only form of resistance she has is her body and that's what she is using against the state,\" she said. A spokesperson for HMP Peterborough declined to comment on specific individuals, but said all prisoners are managed in line with government policies and procedures. They continued: \"If any prisoner has specific complaints, we encourage them to raise them directly with the prison, as there are numerous channels available for addressing such concerns.\""

Lindsay and Craig Foreman, from East Sussex, were taken into custody in Kerman in January during a motorcycle tour around the world and later charged with espionage, which they deny. They were both moved to Tehran's notorious Evin prison in October, where they will likely remain over Christmas. Lindsay's son Joe Bennett is continuing his campaign to get them released, urging the UK government to \"come out and defend them\". Speaking to Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Mr Bennett said he was now in contact with his mother almost daily, after she and Craig, his stepfather, went on a hunger strike last month. Before that, he said, he'd only been able to speak with her three times in just under 11 months.\"They've lost a lot of weight because there isn't enough nourishment. They're eating rice and gristle every day. They can't really exercise. It's overcrowded and cramped,\" he told Phillips. He said Lindsay was also suffering with a bad skin condition, because of a lack of ventilation in the jail. \"It is extremely dirty. She's cooking, the kitchen's filled with rats. It is dire, to be honest with you, for them both,\" he said. Asked about how their absence will feel for his family over the festive period, Mr Bennett said the pair were both integral to \"keeping the Christmas spirit alive\" and that \"we've lost that a lot\". He added he feels \"a sense of guilt\" while his mother is \"stuck in a cell\", unable to celebrate. Frustrations with UK government Mr Bennett said he was \"frustrated\" by the government's handling of the incident, adding: \"There is this policy, it seems, to sit and wait and allow this judicial process which is, in my eyes, a complete circus, to play out. \"We were told almost two months ago, when they last were in court, that a sentence would be passed in a couple of weeks. We're now two months down the line and nothing has happened. \"I keep saying that we need to be being more accountable as a government and speaking out. \"They're not being accused of something like shoplifting, or a petty crime, they are being accused of espionage. This is a state level charge of crime, and they need to be backing their UK citizens. \"That's what I believe needs to be done - taking a stand and saying: 'This isn't right, we do not agree with it, and we want our citizens home as soon as possible.'\" Read more:The links between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files£20,000 reward announced over fatal shooting of father The Foreign Office warns all British and British-Iranian nationals against all travel to Iran because of \"significant risk of arrest, questioning, or detention\".

Speaking to Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Anna Turley acknowledged that \"things are still hard\" for Britons, but struck an optimistic tone about the year ahead. She said the government has \"taken a lot of difficult decisions this year\" to \"stabilise the economy\", but we are now \"starting to see that recovery\". \"As we go into the new year, I'm really optimistic about delivering the kind of change that people voted for last year, and to see them starting to see and feel it in their pockets and in their local communities,\" Ms Turley insisted.

Ms Turley continued: \"We live in the real world. We know things are still hard. \"But I'm conscious with every single day that goes by next year, people will really start to see and feel more money in their pockets, better public services when they're looking for an appointment with a doctor, their streets and the neighbourhoods are looking better and better, and that change takes time. \"But we will be delivering that in the new year, and I'm confident people can really start to see that.\" Asked directly if Sir Keir Starmer will be Labour leader and prime minister by next Christmas, Turley replied: \"Of course. Absolutely. \"As I said, people will really start to see and feel the change in their pockets. He has got a very clear vision for making sure that people can really deal with the cost of living, that public services will get back on their [...] feet. \"And he's building a Britain that is one that is tolerant, that is open, that is confident in itself.

One told the outlet it was \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\". \n                  How Trump has supercharged the new world dis-order\n                 \n                  US seizes another tanker off Venezuela - as Brazil issues warning\n                 \n                  Trump turns angry ahead of Epstein files release\n                 \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said, adding that dark fleet vessels usually do not operate exclusively for one country. It is understood the vessel is sailing under the name Bella 1, according to British maritime risk management group Vanguard, according to NBC News and Bloomberg. Sky News has seen Bella 1 is sanctioned by the US government, according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website, and has been included on the list since June 2024. Read more: The real reason for Donald Trump's Venezuela exploits One US official told NBC the vessel was sanctioned under the counterterrorism authority for its involvement in the network of Houthi financial facilitator Sa'id al Jamal. Another US official separately told the New York Times the ship did not submit to being boarded and continued onward. If successful, it would mark the third such interception near Venezuela in the past two weeks, with a tanker being seized on Saturday and near the start of the month. Explained: The US-Venezuela crisis Trump's 'blockade' of tankers  Earlier this week, the US president declared he had ordered the \"blockade\" of oil tankers into and out of the South American country. He said the US military would remain in place until Venezuela returns \"all of the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us\". In the social media post following months of escalating tensions in the Caribbean, Donald Trump said Venezuela was surrounded by the \"largest armada ever assembled in the history of South America\". Venezuela's government has accused Mr Trump of \"violating international law, free trade, and the principle of free navigation\" with \"a reckless and grave threat\" against the South American country. China's foreign minister Wang Yi later accused the US of \"bullying\" Venezuela, and said on Wednesday: \"China believes the international community understands and supports Venezuela's position in defending its legitimate rights and interests.\" Washington has also announced sanctions on numerous oil tankers, shipping companies and family members of Mr Maduro. President Trump has been ramping up pressure on the Maduro regime, accusing it of involvement in the drugs trade. As part of his efforts, he has also authorised deadly strikes against vessels he claims are trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. President Maduro claims Mr Trump is trying to overthrow him with a view to seizing Venezuela's oil reserves."

        "Content": "Israel has approved 19 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank in a fresh blow to the possibility of a Palestinian state. The move brings the number of new settlements over the past few years to 69, a new record, according to Israel's far-right finance minister Betzalel Smotrich. Widely considered illegal under international law, the settlements have been criticised for fragmenting the territory of a future Palestinian state by confiscating land and displacing residents.   Under Israel's current government, figures show, the number of settlements in the West Bank has surged by nearly 50%, rising from 141 in 2022, to 210 with the new approvals, according to Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog. The government's latest action retroactively authorises some previously-established outposts or neighbourhoods of existing settlements, and the creation of settlements on land where Palestinians were evacuated. It also approves Kadim and Ganim, two of the four settlements dismantled in 2005, and which Israelis were previously banned from re-entering as part of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Since Israel repealed the 2005 act in March 2023, there have been multiple attempts to resettle them. The move comes amid mounting pressure from the US to move ahead with the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October. Mr Smotrich is one of a number of figures now prominent in Israel's government who back the settlements. The West Bank, east Jerusalem, and Gaza are claimed by the Palestinians for their future state, but were captured by Israel in the 1967 war.

        "Content": "The earliest publicly known survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse has told Sky News there was a \"wilful blindness\" about the young women and children around him - as she claimed the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had \"broken the law\" with the Epstein files. Warning: This article contains details of sexual assault. In 1991, Jess Michaels, then a 22-year-old professional dancer, was introduced to Epstein by a roommate who said he had a \"fabulous experience\" with the financier. They met twice, with the first meeting being an interview at his office in Madison Avenue for a role as a masseuse.  During their second meeting at Epstein's penthouse, she said he raped her. Speaking to Sky News presenter Barbara Serra, Ms Michaels said that while she did not meet anyone else in connection with the convicted sex offender, \"the volume of wilful blindness and blatant disregard for the protection of the young women and the children\" that were \"very obviously around Jeffrey Epstein\" was \"horrific\". Three months after her encounter with Epstein, Ms Michaels said she left New York \"because of the anxiety and the insomnia\". Six months after, she said she could \"pull a pair of size zero jeans down off of my hips because I was really struggling to even eat properly\", and noted that a friend remembered she \"just slept all the time\". 'That didn't even get us justice' Speaking almost 35 years after her ordeal and days after the release of thousands of files relating to Epstein, Ms Michaels said her mission now \"is that nothing like this happens again and that we change something\". However, the White House has come under heavy criticism as only a fraction of the files have so far been released, with many heavily redacted and some disappearing after being uploaded. When asked how she felt about the latest release, Ms Michaels noted that the Epstein Transparency Act, signed by Donald Trump in November, required the DoJ to release all files by 19 December. \"The US Department of Justice has broken the law,\" she said. \"Blatantly so. So sometimes I hear from people or journalists, 'so how do you feel? what comes up next?' I actually don't care.\" She added the DoJ had \"proved the point of why we needed to get an Act of Congress to actually listen to us and try to get justice. And that didn't even get us justice.\" Ms Michaels later said \"it's not unexpected\", and said it marked the \"exact same treatment we have received across five administrations\". It is important to note that inclusion in the Epstein files does not infer any wrongdoing. 'What do you expect us to do?' Ms Michaels said she had been looking for her own statement she made to the FBI about Epstein, and said many survivors \"want to hear the FBI tipline recordings because it proves the volume of victims that did come forward that maybe got disregarded\". In the wake of Epstein's arrest in 2019, the FBI set up a telephone number for any information on his crimes. However, Ms Michaels said she \"initially got disregarded\" when she rang. \"When they called back in 2019, the officer said to me, 'Well, we have to call everyone back, but it was 30 years ago. What do you expect us to do about it now?'\" Ms Michaels said she has not been able to find any information on her call to the FBI in the files released, and said it is \"extremely frustrating because we don't know how to easily search this database\". She also noted that despite being told her statement was going to be used in Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial, \"I never heard a word\" and that \"the lack of statement proves the negligence we've been saying all along\". Ms Michaels is the earliest victim of Epstein to have come forward with her experience. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Read more:Victims express shock and outrage over incomplete release of filesThe links between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files He did not face prosecution for crimes relating to the sexual abuse of young girls until the 2000s. He was later arrested in Florida on state felony charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of a prostitute in 2006. An FBI investigation also found dozens of women had accused the financier of sexual assault, and it looked likely that the 53-page federal indictment built against him would see him face a lengthy prison sentence. Epstein instead agreed to a plea deal and was convicted on those state charges, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was registered as a sex offender. Read more: The mysterious life and death of Epstein At the time of his death, Epstein was being held in custody on charges related to running a sex-trafficking scheme that involved dozens of underage girls. He had pleaded not guilty and faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Epstein was specifically accused of using his private jet, nicknamed the Lolita Express, to shuttle girls as young as 14 between his lavish residences in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. In a post on X, US attorney general Pam Bondi said the DoJ would \"bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims\". \"We reaffirm this commitment, and ask any victim to please come forward with any information pertaining to any individuals who engaged in illicit activity at their expense,\" she said. \"We have met with many victims and victims groups, and will continue to do so if more reach out. Please contact myself, DAG Blanche, or the FBI and we will investigate immediately. We believe in the equal standard of justice in this country and will ensure that Justice is served.\" The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said the justice department was continuing to review the remaining Epstein files and was withholding some documents under exemptions meant to protect victims. \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law - full stop. Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim,\" the justice department said, quoting Mr Blanche in a post on X."

        "Content": "Pictures of Donald Trump were included among at least 16 documents that disappeared from the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Democrats from the House Oversight Committee drew attention to the apparent removal of an image showing two printed pictures of Mr Trump in a desk draw. One picture had Mr Trump standing surrounded by women in bathing suits, while the second appears to be an already known picture - partly obscured - of him, his wife Melania, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. After the Democrats flagged the missing image on Saturday, Sky News went back to the files online and confirmed that it did appear to be missing, despite the fact they downloaded it when the files were initially released on Friday. The other photos removed from the trove of documents were almost all nude paintings of women in Epstein's home. In a post on X on Sunday, the DOJ said the image including pictures of Mr Trump has since been reposted on to the Epstein Files page. Sky News has seen that file number 468 is once again listed online. Mr Trump is still visible in the latest version of the image, and there is no immediate difference from the original upload. The DOJ said that \"the Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims\". \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the department added. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\" Mr Trump has not commented on the release of the files and has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's case. Questions over heavy redactions Thousands of documents relating to the dead paedophile financier were made public by the DOJ on Friday - hours before a legal deadline following the passing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Many of the pages were either partially or fully redacted, which the DOJ says is to protect the more than 1,200 victims and their families identified in them. Some of Epstein's victims, legal experts and members of the public have questioned whether this is the sole reason for the redactions, while the Oversight Democrats have claimed: \"This is a White House cover-up.\" Ashley Rubright, who was abused for several years after meeting Epstein in Palm Beach when she was 15, told Sky News: \"Seeing [...] completely redacted pages, there's no way that that's just to protect the victims' identities, and there better be a good reason. I just don't know if we'll ever know what that is.\" Gloria Allred, a lawyer who has represented some of Epstein's victims, says she has been told that despite the heavy redactions, some compromising pictures of survivors and their names were left in the files released on Friday. \"We have had to notify the Department of Justice about names that should have been redacted that weren't redacted,\" she told Sky News. \"So this is further trauma to survivors, and apparently also some of the images of some of the survivors appear not to have been redacted, and they are nude or not completely dressed. \"This is a major concern because the law clearly indicates, and the judges have indicated, that the names and any identifying information of the survivors must be redacted.\" Read more:Epstein victims react to partial release of filesLinks between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files In a letter to the judges overseeing the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, US attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton acknowledged that a review \"of this size and scope is vulnerable to machine error [or] instances of human error\". He also said the DOJ had opted to redact the faces of women in photographs with Epstein \"even where not all the women are known to be victims,\" as it was not viewed as practical for the DOJ to identify every person in all the photos. The methodology has led to some confusion and misled speculation online. Many celebrities and public figures appear with Epstein in the photos published by the DOJ, often included without context. There is no suggestion that these pictures imply anyone has done anything wrong, and many of those featured in them have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Through its release, the Trump administration has claimed to be the most transparent in history, despite the fact Congress forced their hand by voting to make the files public by 19 December. But some have been held back, with Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, saying more would follow in the coming weeks. Many Democrats and some Republicans have criticised the partial release as failing to \"comply with law,\" as have lawyers including Ms Allred. \"So clearly, the law has been violated. And it's the Department of Justice letting down the survivors once again,\" she said. She labelled the incomplete release of the files a \"distraction\", adding: \"This is not over, and it won't be over until we get the truth and transparency for the survivors.\""

        "Content": "Australia's prime minister was met with boos and insults when he arrived at a Bondi Beach vigil for victims of last week's gun attack.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was booed when his name was announced on the stage set up in front of the crowd - amid anger that the premier hasn't done more to tackle rising antisemitism in Australia. In contrast, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns's name was greeted with cheers and a standing ovation. The premier was thanked for his leadership and for not missing \"a funeral, synagogue service, or an opportunity to be with the Jewish community this week\". Before going to the vigil, Albanese had announced a review of the country's police and intelligence agencies a week after the deadly Bondi Beach gun attack. Albanese said the review, ‌led by a former chief of Australia's spy agency, would probe whether federal police and intelligence agencies have the \"right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\". The review comes as Australia marks a day of reflection to honour those killed and injured by two gunmen at Sydney's Bondi Beach. Authorities invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday evening, the start of the eighth and final day of the Jewish festival of lights, \"as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones\" of the victims. An evening memorial event at Bondi Beach will take place under a heavy police presence, including officers carrying long-arm firearms, police said in a statement. A minute's silence was also held at 6.47pm (7.47am UK time). Earlier this week, around 700 people on paddle boards and surfboards took to the sea at Bondi Beach, forming a huge circle in a show of solidarity. News correspondent As the heat of Sydney's summer started to drop away, thousands of people came out to Bondi to support the Jewish community in a day of National Reflection.   They covered the hillside above Bondi.  A sea of people standing in solidarity. \n There was a minute of silence, though it felt much longer as the usual din of Bondi faded away to stillness. \n \n People hugged each other, sat quietly and there were also tears.  It has been a confronting and deeply emotional week for the Jewish community in Bondi, as they struggle to comprehend the scale of the tragedy that has struck them.  The rest of Australia has struggled too.  People are shocked that a mass shooting could happen in this normally peaceful country.  People are angry that the strict gun laws failed to keep firearms out of people with extremist ideology.  Jewish people are angry at the government for failing to curb a rise of antisemitic attacks since the Israel-Gaza war started.   After the memorial I spoke with three of Sydney's Jewish rabbis from the Emmanuel Synagogue.  They said that when it comes to hate speech and antisemitism \"words matter\".  But there are few words of comfort to offer a community still so shaken and raw from the massacre of one week ago.\n \n Gaps in the system The attack ‌exposed gaps in gun-license assessments and information-sharing between agencies that politicians have said they want to plug. Albanese has announced a nationwide gun buyback, while gun safety experts say the nation's gun laws, among the world's toughest, are full of loopholes. Authorities believe the gunmen were inspired by Islamic State. \"The ISIS-inspired atrocity ‍last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation. \"Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond,\" Albanese said in a statement, adding that the review would conclude by the end of April. Albanese has been under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the war in Gaza. Read more at Sky News:US seizes another tanker off VenezuelaEngineer becomes first wheelchair user in space The prime minister has since vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake ‌of the attack. On Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, committed to introducing a bill to ban the display of symbols and flags of \"terrorist organisations\", including those of Islamic State, Hamas and Hezbollah. Authorities say Islamic State flags were found in the car the attackers took to Bondi. One of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday, has been charged with 59 ‍offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. He remains in custody in hospital."

        "Content": "By David Rivers, news reporter  The parents of a woman who went missing nearly 20 years ago are hoping an AI enhanced picture of a suspect's ear could crack the case.  Drew and Joyce Kesse last saw their daughter, Jennifer, 20 years ago this Christmas. Weeks later, they were told she had failed to show up for work after the festive break. Among the few clues was her car found abandoned a mile from her home in Orlando, Florida. A suspect was spotted on CCTV walking away from the black 2004 Chevrolet Malibu after parking it at an apartment block, according to the FBI. The footage was too grainy to identify them, and they also have their face obscured by a gate. But Mr Kesse, 68, believes AI may finally help uncover the individual by enhancing their ear. \n                  Actors vote for industrial action over AI concerns\n                 \n                  OpenAI bags Disney characters for Sora short video app\n                 \n                  Apple's AI chief steps down as company falls behind in tech race\n                 He said: \"We have film of a person who dropped Jennifer's car off and walked away. On that film... it was a 35-year-old camera... very grainy. \"NASA enhanced the film... the best it's going to get we're told. However, AI has come along and we have the side of this person's head. \"(I hope) We can clarify the ear in a picture through AI. An ear is just as good as eyes or fingerprints or DNA, so we have great hopes. We do have an AI company that we are working with. FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] have everything. \"They're working their magic and we hope that magic comes... and if we can enhance that picture, this is going to go so fast because we will find that person.\" Read more:Woman missing for more than 60 years found 'alive and well'Body found in Tesla registered to singer d4vd named 'I knew something was wrong right then' Mr Kesse told Sky News he first got a call from one of Jennifer's work colleagues on 24 January 2006. \"He asked: 'Is everything okay with Jen? She didn't show up for a meeting and that's very unlike her, and she didn't call',\" Mr Kesse said. \"I said... I'll give her a call and see what's up because she always answers. That was the only rule in our house that if mum or dad call, you pick the phone up. \"So for the first time since she got her car licence, I gave her a call and it went directly to voicemail, not four rings then voicemail, directly to voicemail. \"I knew something was wrong right then.\" The DNA evidence The Kesses hold out hope for another key piece of evidence - one they spent decades chasing. The missing person case was first handled by the Orlando Police Department, but the family became frustrated at the lack of progress, accusing police of failing to investigate properly. So in 2019 Mr Kesse sued them and chased them through the courts to access thousands of pages of case files. These were then passed over to the FDLE, which took on the case in 2022. It found DNA that was taken from the car that had never been tested in the almost two decades the police held it. Mr Kesse said: \"When the FDLE took it on they started going through everything and basically they came across a couple of pieces of evidence that had not been tested. \"Nineteen years later, we are looking for additional DNA that could probably help us.\" The FDLE has also narrowed down their persons of interest shortlist. 'We have hope' Mrs Kesse, 68, who was working as a nurse at the time, says they will never give up the search. While her husband believes she is dead, she maintains small hope she could still be alive. Asked what it would mean to finally know what happened, she told Sky News: \"It would end almost 20 years of ambiguous loss. You have good days, you have bad days, and we're not the only people in the world who have suffered having a loved one stolen from them by a person who thinks it's okay to steal people. It's not. \"Finding Jennifer would be filling part of our hearts.\" Pointing towards cases of people being found years after disappearing, she said: \"I personally keep that hope because of the fact that someone was found alive years later. \"I hope and pray that we will find Jennifer alive but I'm a realist and statistically, that's not going to be the outcome.\" Mr Kesse added: \"I don't think she's alive, I think she fought. So we just need to find her. We don't believe anyone should go missing and not be found in this world.\" Mrs Kesse said: \"We still continue to pass out business cards that are a version of her missing persons flyer at gas stations. Wherever we go, we leave them on the counters, because we want everyone in the world to know that she is still missing. \"For 20 years, we want people to know that every single day we have done something to try and find Jennifer, for 20 years, and we're not going to stop. \"We do celebrate her life, she is talked about daily.\" Sky News has approached the Orlando Police Department and FDLE for a response.

        "Headline": "The return of Ran \"Rani\" Gvili's body is the final hurdle before phase two of the peace plan between Hamas and Israel can get under way. But Hamas says it does not know where his remains are.",
        "Content": "\n          International correspondent\n              @DiMagnaySky\n Now the other hostages are home, the living and the dead, there is just one face whose image you will see across Israel, alongside the national flag and the ubiquitous yellow ribbon, symbol of solidarity with the hostages. It is of a robust young police officer, sometimes in uniform, sometimes on his motorbike - Master Sergeant Ran \"Rani\" Gvili, 24 years old on 7 October, his body still somewhere in Gaza. \"Everyone knows Rani now, because he's the last person, the last hostage,\" his parents, Talik and Itzik Gvili, tell me in their home in Meitar. \"He came to save Israel, so Israel must save him.\" Progression into phase two of the ceasefire hinges on the return of his body. Hamas says it does not know where it is, that the scale of killing as a result of Israel's bombardment makes tracing his original captors and those who might know the location of his body extremely difficult. The hunt is ongoing, complicated by recent storms. Footage from early December of a search convoy accompanied by the International Red Cross, picking its way through a wasteland of rubble and destruction, testifies to the potential problems. \"Hamas is a monster. He knows exactly where my son is. And we will finish Hamas if they don't give us Rani,\" says his mother, Talik. \"The only cards they have, it's Rani. And now they think they can play with these cards because it's very valuable.\" There is a bleak precedent. The body of 23-year-old IDF soldier Hadar Goldin, killed in Gaza in 2014, was only returned to Israel last month after an 11-year wait. But if Gvili's body is indeed Hamas's final trump card, then the pressure this time, with US President Donald Trump heavily invested in the success of the peace plan, is that bit more intense. \"We'll get him out,\" Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference with the German chancellor earlier this month. He is due to meet Mr Trump at the White House on 29 December to discuss the ceasefire's next phase. The return of Gvili's body is the first hurdle. Phase two is then meant to see Hamas disarmed, an International Stabilisation Force in place in the Gaza Strip and the beginnings at least of Palestinian-led governance. With Hamas refusing to do much more than potentially store or freeze its weapons and international partners reluctant to commit troops, which might be forced to take on Hamas, the complications are legion. Mr Trump is expected to have stern words for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too, after Israel assassinated top Hamas commander Raed Saad in an airstrike last Saturday. The US president has said he is looking into whether it constitutes a breach of the ceasefire. Hamas accuses Israel of numerous violations, with around 400 killed since it went into effect on 10 October, the Rafah crossing still shut and insufficient aid coming into the Strip. Israel says it killed Saad in retaliation for an attack on IDF forces a day earlier. Gvili was on sick leave with a broken shoulder the morning of 7 October, recovering from an accident on his motorbike. \"How do you think you can go with a broken shoulder?\" his father, Itzik, had asked him, but he says he had refused to be put off. \"You cannot stop him - he's a very, very, strong person, physically and emotionally.\" Gvili was shot in the leg in a firefight with Hamas outside Kibbutz Alumim and taken from there into Gaza. Residents of the kibbutz call him the \"shield of Alumim\" and credit him and his team with protecting them from the kind of casualties suffered at the neighbouring kibbutzim, though Alumim was by no means left unscathed. Read more:Analysis: Gaza longs for normalitySettlements fill Palestinians with dreadAnti-Hamas leader killed Twenty-two agricultural workers from Nepal and Thailand were murdered by Hamas militants who broke into the kibbutz from the west, with two more foreign workers taken hostage into Gaza. In total, 55 people were killed around the kibbutz, many of whom, like Gvili, had come to see how they could help. \"It's an extremely difficult situation, the feeling that once again Hamas has hold of a body which people might say doesn't matter, but a body is so critical and vital to the family. It's closure. If you don't get your loved one's body back, you have no closure,\" says Alumim resident Sarah-Jane Landsman. The IDF told Gvili's parents they doubted he would have survived his injuries without medical help, and they did not believe he had received any treatment. \"They think he did not survive, but no one knows,\" his mother says. \"We want a little bit of hope.\" \"A miracle,\" his father adds. \"This Hanukkah miracle.\""

Authorities said around 12 suspects in a white mini-bus and a silver sedan opened fire at KwaNoxolo tavern in Bekkersdal, 28 miles (45km) west of Johannesburg just before 1am on Sunday. \"Some victims were randomly shot in the streets by unknown gunmen,\" police said. According to authorities, they continued to shoot randomly as they fled the scene. Provincial police commissioner Fred Kekana said one of the deceased was a driver from an online car-hailing service who had been outside the pub. A manhunt for the suspects is now underway. There have been several mass shootings at bars - sometimes called shebeens or taverns in South Africa - in recent years. The attack is the second mass shooting to happen in South Africa in three weeks. On 6 December, multiple suspects took part in a mass shooting in an unlicensed bar that left at least 12 dead and 13 injured.

        "Content": "The US is in \"active pursuit\" of a third oil tanker near Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea, officials have said. It comes amid escalation from the Trump administration against Nicolas Maduro's government, and as the US builds up a naval military presence in the region, including the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and its support group. The status of the attempted interception is unclear, according to Sky's US partner network NBC News, but reports first emerged at around 2.30pm in the UK that the operation was under way. As it happened: US in 'active pursuit' of third vessel  Two officials told NBC News the US Coast Guard was in \"active pursuit\" of the vessel, which is sanctioned by the US.

It is understood the vessel is sailing under the name Bella 1, according to British maritime risk management group Vanguard, according to NBC News and Bloomberg. Sky News has seen Bella 1 is sanctioned by the US government, according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website, and has been included on the list since June 2024. Read more: The real reason for Donald Trump's Venezuela exploits One US official told NBC the vessel was sanctioned under the counterterrorism authority for its involvement in the network of Houthi financial facilitator Sa'id al Jamal. Another US official separately told the New York Times the ship did not submit to being boarded and continued onward. If successful, it would mark the third such interception near Venezuela in the past two weeks, with a tanker being seized on Saturday and near the start of the month. Explained: The US-Venezuela crisis Trump's 'blockade' of tankers  Earlier this week, the US president declared he had ordered the \"blockade\" of oil tankers into and out of the South American country. He said the US military would remain in place until Venezuela returns \"all of the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us\". In the social media post following months of escalating tensions in the Caribbean, Donald Trump said Venezuela was surrounded by the \"largest armada ever assembled in the history of South America\". Venezuela's government has accused Mr Trump of \"violating international law, free trade, and the principle of free navigation\" with \"a reckless and grave threat\" against the South American country. China's foreign minister Wang Yi later accused the US of \"bullying\" Venezuela, and said on Wednesday: \"China believes the international community understands and supports Venezuela's position in defending its legitimate rights and interests.\" Washington has also announced sanctions on numerous oil tankers, shipping companies and family members of Mr Maduro. President Trump has been ramping up pressure on the Maduro regime, accusing it of involvement in the drugs trade. As part of his efforts, he has also authorised deadly strikes against vessels he claims are trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. President Maduro claims Mr Trump is trying to overthrow him with a view to seizing Venezuela's oil reserves."

        "Headline": "One of 16 documents missing from the release was a chest of drawers with pictures, which includes two photos of Donald Trump. The Department of Justice have since restored the image, saying it was removed \"out of an abundance of caution\".",
        "Content": "Pictures of Donald Trump were included among at least 16 documents that disappeared from the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Democrats from the House Oversight Committee drew attention to the apparent removal of an image showing two printed pictures of Mr Trump in a desk draw. One picture had Mr Trump standing surrounded by women in bathing suits, while the second appears to be an already known picture - partly obscured - of him, his wife Melania, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. After the Democrats flagged the missing image on Saturday, Sky News went back to the files online and confirmed that it did appear to be missing, despite the fact they downloaded it when the files were initially released on Friday. The other photos removed from the trove of documents were almost all nude paintings of women in Epstein's home. In a post on X on Sunday, the DOJ said the image including pictures of Mr Trump has since been reposted on to the Epstein Files page. Sky News has seen that file number 468 is once again listed online. Mr Trump is still visible in the latest version of the image, and there is no immediate difference from the original upload. The DOJ said that \"the Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims\". \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the department added. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\" Mr Trump has not commented on the release of the files and has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's case. Questions over heavy redactions Thousands of documents relating to the dead paedophile financier were made public by the DOJ on Friday - hours before a legal deadline following the passing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Many of the pages were either partially or fully redacted, which the DOJ says is to protect the more than 1,200 victims and their families identified in them. Some of Epstein's victims, legal experts and members of the public have questioned whether this is the sole reason for the redactions, while the Oversight Democrats have claimed: \"This is a White House cover-up.\" Ashley Rubright, who was abused for several years after meeting Epstein in Palm Beach when she was 15, told Sky News: \"Seeing [...] completely redacted pages, there's no way that that's just to protect the victims' identities, and there better be a good reason. I just don't know if we'll ever know what that is.\" Gloria Allred, a lawyer who has represented some of Epstein's victims, says she has been told that despite the heavy redactions, some compromising pictures of survivors and their names were left in the files released on Friday. \"We have had to notify the Department of Justice about names that should have been redacted that weren't redacted,\" she told Sky News. \"So this is further trauma to survivors, and apparently also some of the images of some of the survivors appear not to have been redacted, and they are nude or not completely dressed. \"This is a major concern because the law clearly indicates, and the judges have indicated, that the names and any identifying information of the survivors must be redacted.\" Read more:Epstein victims react to partial release of filesLinks between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files In a letter to the judges overseeing the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, US attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton acknowledged that a review \"of this size and scope is vulnerable to machine error [or] instances of human error\". He also said the DOJ had opted to redact the faces of women in photographs with Epstein \"even where not all the women are known to be victims,\" as it was not viewed as practical for the DOJ to identify every person in all the photos. The methodology has led to some confusion and misled speculation online. Many celebrities and public figures appear with Epstein in the photos published by the DOJ, often included without context. There is no suggestion that these pictures imply anyone has done anything wrong, and many of those featured in them have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Through its release, the Trump administration has claimed to be the most transparent in history, despite the fact Congress forced their hand by voting to make the files public by 19 December. But some have been held back, with Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, saying more would follow in the coming weeks. Many Democrats and some Republicans have criticised the partial release as failing to \"comply with law,\" as have lawyers including Ms Allred. \"So clearly, the law has been violated. And it's the Department of Justice letting down the survivors once again,\" she said. She labelled the incomplete release of the files a \"distraction\", adding: \"This is not over, and it won't be over until we get the truth and transparency for the survivors.\""

        "Content": "The earliest publicly known survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse has told Sky News there was a \"wilful blindness\" about the young women and children around him - as she claimed the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had \"broken the law\" with the Epstein files. Warning: This article contains details of sexual assault. In 1991, Jess Michaels, then a 22-year-old professional dancer, was introduced to Epstein by a roommate who said he had a \"fabulous experience\" with the financier. They met twice, with the first meeting being an interview at his office in Madison Avenue for a role as a masseuse.  During their second meeting at Epstein's penthouse, she said he raped her. Speaking to Sky News presenter Barbara Serra, Ms Michaels said that while she did not meet anyone else in connection with the convicted sex offender, \"the volume of wilful blindness and blatant disregard for the protection of the young women and the children\" that were \"very obviously around Jeffrey Epstein\" was \"horrific\". Three months after her encounter with Epstein, Ms Michaels said she left New York \"because of the anxiety and the insomnia\". Six months after, she said she could \"pull a pair of size zero jeans down off of my hips because I was really struggling to even eat properly\", and noted that a friend remembered she \"just slept all the time\". 'That didn't even get us justice' Speaking almost 35 years after her ordeal and days after the release of thousands of files relating to Epstein, Ms Michaels said her mission now \"is that nothing like this happens again and that we change something\". However, the White House has come under heavy criticism as only a fraction of the files have so far been released, with many heavily redacted and some disappearing after being uploaded. When asked how she felt about the latest release, Ms Michaels noted that the Epstein Transparency Act, signed by Donald Trump in November, required the DoJ to release all files by 19 December. \"The US Department of Justice has broken the law,\" she said. \"Blatantly so. So sometimes I hear from people or journalists, 'so how do you feel? what comes up next?' I actually don't care.\" She added the DoJ had \"proved the point of why we needed to get an Act of Congress to actually listen to us and try to get justice. And that didn't even get us justice.\" Ms Michaels later said \"it's not unexpected\", and said it marked the \"exact same treatment we have received across five administrations\". It is important to note that inclusion in the Epstein files does not infer any wrongdoing. 'What do you expect us to do?' Ms Michaels said she had been looking for her own statement she made to the FBI about Epstein, and said many survivors \"want to hear the FBI tipline recordings because it proves the volume of victims that did come forward that maybe got disregarded\". In the wake of Epstein's arrest in 2019, the FBI set up a telephone number for any information on his crimes. However, Ms Michaels said she \"initially got disregarded\" when she rang. \"When they called back in 2019, the officer said to me, 'Well, we have to call everyone back, but it was 30 years ago. What do you expect us to do about it now?'\" Ms Michaels said she has not been able to find any information on her call to the FBI in the files released, and said it is \"extremely frustrating because we don't know how to easily search this database\". She also noted that despite being told her statement was going to be used in Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial, \"I never heard a word\" and that \"the lack of statement proves the negligence we've been saying all along\". Ms Michaels is the earliest victim of Epstein to have come forward with her experience. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Read more:Victims express shock and outrage over incomplete release of filesThe links between Epstein and the UK revealed in new files He did not face prosecution for crimes relating to the sexual abuse of young girls until the 2000s. He was later arrested in Florida on state felony charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of a prostitute in 2006. An FBI investigation also found dozens of women had accused the financier of sexual assault, and it looked likely that the 53-page federal indictment built against him would see him face a lengthy prison sentence. Epstein instead agreed to a plea deal and was convicted on those state charges, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was registered as a sex offender. Read more: The mysterious life and death of Epstein At the time of his death, Epstein was being held in custody on charges related to running a sex-trafficking scheme that involved dozens of underage girls. He had pleaded not guilty and faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Epstein was specifically accused of using his private jet, nicknamed the Lolita Express, to shuttle girls as young as 14 between his lavish residences in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. In a post on X, US attorney general Pam Bondi said the DoJ would \"bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims\". \"We reaffirm this commitment, and ask any victim to please come forward with any information pertaining to any individuals who engaged in illicit activity at their expense,\" she said. \"We have met with many victims and victims groups, and will continue to do so if more reach out. Please contact myself, DAG Blanche, or the FBI and we will investigate immediately. We believe in the equal standard of justice in this country and will ensure that Justice is served.\" The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said the justice department was continuing to review the remaining Epstein files and was withholding some documents under exemptions meant to protect victims. \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law - full stop. Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim,\" the justice department said, quoting Mr Blanche in a post on X."

        "Content": "By David Rivers, news reporter  The parents of a woman who went missing nearly 20 years ago are hoping an AI enhanced picture of a suspect's ear could crack the case.  Drew and Joyce Kesse last saw their daughter, Jennifer, 20 years ago this Christmas. Weeks later, they were told she had failed to show up for work after the festive break. Among the few clues was her car found abandoned a mile from her home in Orlando, Florida. A suspect was spotted on CCTV walking away from the black 2004 Chevrolet Malibu after parking it at an apartment block, according to the FBI. The footage was too grainy to identify them, and they also have their face obscured by a gate. But Mr Kesse, 68, believes AI may finally help uncover the individual by enhancing their ear. \n                  Actors vote for industrial action over AI concerns\n                 \n                  OpenAI bags Disney characters for Sora short video app\n                 \n                  Apple's AI chief steps down as company falls behind in tech race\n                 He said: \"We have film of a person who dropped Jennifer's car off and walked away. On that film... it was a 35-year-old camera... very grainy. \"NASA enhanced the film... the best it's going to get we're told. However, AI has come along and we have the side of this person's head. \"(I hope) We can clarify the ear in a picture through AI. An ear is just as good as eyes or fingerprints or DNA, so we have great hopes. We do have an AI company that we are working with. FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] have everything. \"They're working their magic and we hope that magic comes... and if we can enhance that picture, this is going to go so fast because we will find that person.\" Read more:Woman missing for more than 60 years found 'alive and well'Body found in Tesla registered to singer d4vd named 'I knew something was wrong right then' Mr Kesse told Sky News he first got a call from one of Jennifer's work colleagues on 24 January 2006. \"He asked: 'Is everything okay with Jen? She didn't show up for a meeting and that's very unlike her, and she didn't call',\" Mr Kesse said. \"I said... I'll give her a call and see what's up because she always answers. That was the only rule in our house that if mum or dad call, you pick the phone up. \"So for the first time since she got her car licence, I gave her a call and it went directly to voicemail, not four rings then voicemail, directly to voicemail. \"I knew something was wrong right then.\" The DNA evidence The Kesses hold out hope for another key piece of evidence - one they spent decades chasing. The missing person case was first handled by the Orlando Police Department, but the family became frustrated at the lack of progress, accusing police of failing to investigate properly. So in 2019 Mr Kesse sued them and chased them through the courts to access thousands of pages of case files. These were then passed over to the FDLE, which took on the case in 2022. It found DNA that was taken from the car that had never been tested in the almost two decades the police held it. Mr Kesse said: \"When the FDLE took it on they started going through everything and basically they came across a couple of pieces of evidence that had not been tested. \"Nineteen years later, we are looking for additional DNA that could probably help us.\" The FDLE has also narrowed down their persons of interest shortlist. 'We have hope' Mrs Kesse, 68, who was working as a nurse at the time, says they will never give up the search. While her husband believes she is dead, she maintains small hope she could still be alive. Asked what it would mean to finally know what happened, she told Sky News: \"It would end almost 20 years of ambiguous loss. You have good days, you have bad days, and we're not the only people in the world who have suffered having a loved one stolen from them by a person who thinks it's okay to steal people. It's not. \"Finding Jennifer would be filling part of our hearts.\" Pointing towards cases of people being found years after disappearing, she said: \"I personally keep that hope because of the fact that someone was found alive years later. \"I hope and pray that we will find Jennifer alive but I'm a realist and statistically, that's not going to be the outcome.\" Mr Kesse added: \"I don't think she's alive, I think she fought. So we just need to find her. We don't believe anyone should go missing and not be found in this world.\" Mrs Kesse said: \"We still continue to pass out business cards that are a version of her missing persons flyer at gas stations. Wherever we go, we leave them on the counters, because we want everyone in the world to know that she is still missing. \"For 20 years, we want people to know that every single day we have done something to try and find Jennifer, for 20 years, and we're not going to stop. \"We do celebrate her life, she is talked about daily.\" Sky News has approached the Orlando Police Department and FDLE for a response.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A renewable energy group founded by the former chief executive of Petrofac, the oilfield services group which collapsed during the autumn, will this week announce a £40m fundraising despite signs of growing tension over its leadership. Sky News has learnt that Venterra, which was set up four years ago by Ayman Asfari, will unveil the capital injection as early as Monday. Its backers will include existing shareholders Beyond Net Zero, a fund affiliated with the private equity firm General Atlantic, and First Reserve, another private equity investor. The fundraising will come amid a challenging climate sweeping through swathes of the renewable energy sector. While offshore wind remains an important element of the global energy transition, the shifting investment priorities, in part precipitated by Donald Trump's second term as US president, have resulted in slower growth than anticipated for companies such as Venterra. One source said there had been growing tensions in recent months over Mr Asfari's role at the company and its prospects for 2026.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @gurpreetnarwan\n The Christmas period is upon us, and goods are flying off the shelves, but for some reason, the tills are not ringing as loudly as they should be. Across the country, the five-finger discount is being used with such frequency that retailers are taking action into their own hands. With concerns about the police response to shoplifting, many are now resorting to controversial facial recognition technology to catch culprits before they strike. Sainsbury's, Budgens and Sports Direct are among the high-street businesses that have signed up to Facewatch, a cloud-based facial recognition security system that scans faces as they enter a store. Those images are then compared to a database of known offenders and, if a match is found, an alert is set off to warn the business that a shoplifter has entered the premises. It comes as official figures show shoplifting offences rose by 13% in the year to June, reaching almost 530,000 incidents. Figures reported in August showed more than 80% result in no charge. At the same time, retailers are reporting more than 2,000 cases of violence or abuse against their staff every day. Faced with mounting losses and safety concerns, businesses say they are being forced to take security into their own hands because stretched police forces are only able to respond to a fraction of incidents. At Ruxley Manor Garden Centre in south London, managing director James Evans said theft had become increasingly brazen and organised, with losses from shoplifting now accounting for around 1.5% of turnover. \"That may sound small, but it represents a significant hit to the bottom line,\" he said, pointing out that thousands of pounds' worth of goods can be stolen in a single visit. \n                  Asda to sell 24 stores only to rent them back as it struggles with debt pile\n                 \n                  M&S reveals cost of cyber attack as profit almost wiped out\n                 \n                  KKR makes surprise move to brew up Costa Coffee bid\n                 \"We have had instances where the children get sent in to do it. They know that the parents will be waiting in the car park and they'll know that there's nothing that we can do to stop them.\" Staff members here have also had their fair share of run-ins with shoplifters. In one case, employees trying to stop a suspected shoplifter were nearly struck by an accomplice in a car. \"This is no longer just about stock loss,\" said James, \"It is about the safety of our staff.\" However, the technology is not without its critics. Civil liberties groups have warned that the expansion of this type of technology is eroding our privacy. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, called it \"a very dangerous kind of privatised policing industry\". \"[It] really threatens fairness and justice for us all, because now it's the case that just going to do your supermarket shopping, a company is quietly taking your very sensitive biometric data. That's data that's as sensitive as your passport, and [it's] making a judgement about whether you're a criminal or not.\" Silkie said the organisation was routinely receiving messages from people who said they had been mistakenly targeted. They include Rennea Nelson, who was wrongly flagged as a shoplifter at a B&M store after being mistakenly added to the facial recognition database. Nelson said she was threatened with police action and warned that her immigration status could be at risk. \"He said to me, if you don't get out, I'm going to call the police. So at that point I turned around and I was like, are you speaking to me? Then he was like yes, yes, your face set off the alarm because you're a thief... At that point, I was around six to seven months pregnant and I was having a high-risk pregnancy. I was already going through a lot of anxiety and, so him coming over and shouting at me, it was like really triggering me.\" The retailer later acknowledged the error and apologised, describing it as a rare case of human mistake. Read more:Elon Musk closer to becoming first-ever trillionaireWilliam and George help prepare Christmas lunch for the homeless A spokesperson for B&M said: 'This was a simple case of human error, and we sincerely apologise to Ms Nelson for any upset caused. Reported incidents like this are rare. Facewatch services are designed to operate strictly in compliance with UK GDPR and to help protect store colleagues from incidents of aggressive shoplifting.\" Nick Fisher, chief executive of Facewatch, said the backlash was disproportionate. \"Well, I think it's designed to be quite alarmist, using language like 'dystopian', 'orwellian', 'turning people into barcodes',\" he said. \"The inference of that is that we will identify people using biometric technology, hold and store their own, store their data. And that's just, quite frankly, misleading. We only store and retain data of known repeat offenders, of which it's been deemed to be proportionate and responsible to do so... I think in the world that we are currently operating in, as long as the technology is used and managed in a responsible, proportionate way, I can only see it being a force for good.\" Yet, there is obviously widespread unease, if not anger, at the proliferation of this technology. Businesses are obviously alert to it, but the bottom line is calling."

        "Content": "The chair of the Labour Party has insisted that Sir Keir Starmer will \"absolutely\" still be prime minister next Christmas, despite the party's dire position in the polls. Speaking to Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Anna Turley acknowledged that \"things are still hard\" for Britons, but struck an optimistic tone about the year ahead. She said the government has \"taken a lot of difficult decisions this year\" to \"stabilise the economy\", but we are now \"starting to see that recovery\". \"As we go into the new year, I'm really optimistic about delivering the kind of change that people voted for last year, and to see them starting to see and feel it in their pockets and in their local communities,\" Ms Turley insisted. On average over the last 10 polls, the Labour Party is down in third place on 18.2%, while Reform UK is on 29.4%, and the Conservative Party is on 18.9%. Trevor then asked if the public simply hasn't noticed \"how lucky they've been\", and the senior minister said: \"Well, I think rightly, people are impatient for change. We all are. And people voted for change - that was on the front of our manifesto last year. \"But it takes time to deliver that.

Ms Turley continued: \"We live in the real world. We know things are still hard. \"But I'm conscious with every single day that goes by next year, people will really start to see and feel more money in their pockets, better public services when they're looking for an appointment with a doctor, their streets and the neighbourhoods are looking better and better, and that change takes time. \"But we will be delivering that in the new year, and I'm confident people can really start to see that.\" Asked directly if Sir Keir Starmer will be Labour leader and prime minister by next Christmas, Turley replied: \"Of course. Absolutely. \"As I said, people will really start to see and feel the change in their pockets. He has got a very clear vision for making sure that people can really deal with the cost of living, that public services will get back on their [...] feet. \"And he's building a Britain that is one that is tolerant, that is open, that is confident in itself. And that is really about renewal and investment in young people as opposed to the division and the decline of the opposition.\" Read more:Over half of Labour members want to ditch StarmerAlmost two in three Labour members back BurnhamOver a third of Britons think Reeves exaggerated bad news Her backing of the prime minister comes amid continued unease on the Labour benches about the party's position in the polls, and the manoeuvrings of some big figures who are rumoured to be plotting a move against the prime minister if May's local elections go badly. One such person thought to be preparing for a potential leadership bid is the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who has told The Observer today that he is not ruling himself out as a candidate for the top job in future. \"I'm diplomatically ducking the question to avoid any more of the silly soap opera we've had in the last few months,\" Streeting said, despite also noting the \"pressure\" and the \"demands of that job\". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is repeatedly refusing to rule out a return to Westminster to challenge Sir Keir for the Labour leadership, and former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner is thought to be preparing to potentially launch a leadership bid of her own. 'We're going to smash the local elections' Also on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, the Conservative Party deputy chair, Matt Vickers, was bullish about his party's prospects at May's local elections. \"We're going to go out there and smash these next elections,\" he said. \"The reality is we had a tough general election. If anybody thought that we were going to dust ourselves off and be back in the game within months, then they're a bit mad.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @robpowellnews\n This is a story about a roundabout in Leicester.  It's not a particularly special roundabout. But it does tell us something about British politics. Belgrave Circle, in the north of the city, was opened in March 2015 on the site of an old railway station known locally as \"The Gateway to Skegness\". Later that year, Leicester - along with the rest of the country - went to the polls in the 2015 general election. The vote saw David Cameron win a majority and Ed Miliband resign as Labour leader. But around the Belgrave Circle, something different was going on. Because this is the spot where Leicester's three parliamentary constituencies meet, and in 2015 they were all held by Labour MPs who saw their majorities increase. It's a different story now. Stand in the middle of the roundabout and face towards Abbey Park and you'll see the city's only remaining Labour seat - that of cabinet minister Liz Kendall. Turn around and face the B&M Home Store, and you'll find the only place the Conservatives picked up at the last election. This freak occurrence happened after the Labour vote was split by two independent candidates - both of whom also happened to be former MPs for the city. Labour saw its vote share cut in half here, and then some. The Tory vote dropped as well, but not by enough to stop the party coming through the middle and taking the seat by four thousand votes. But walk to the south of this roundabout and you'll get to where an independent candidate went one step further. Local optician Shockat Adam won this seat last year, defeating frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth in a campaign focused mainly on Gaza and events in the Middle East. What happened on this roundabout last July is no one-off. There's plenty of evidence to suggest these phenomena could be on the rise around the country. Since the election, Labour's vote share has plunged, and its base has fractured as support for insurgent parties on the right and left surges. A lot of the focus from this has been on Reform UK and how Labour can stop Nigel Farage in traditional 'red wall' seats in the midlands and the north. And yes, Labour is leaking support to Reform on the right. But what's often not talked about is the greater number of votes its losing on the left. A rejuvenated Green Party under Zack Polanski is chasing Labour close in some polls, while Your Party is attempting to form a separate fighting force straddling ex-Corbynites, independent pro-Gaza candidates and those from the more hard-left tradition. Come the next election, this could all have far-reaching consequences. Sky News has ranked all 404 Labour seats according to how at risk they are to these new forces on the left. We created this 'vulnerability index' using factors like voting history, population and demographic data. It shows several cabinet ministers in the top 25 most vulnerable, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in fourth place, Sir Keir Starmer in thirteenth place and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy in twenty-third place. All three of these Labour big beasts have seen their majorities cut in the last election by a Green candidate, an independent candidate or a mix of the two. In Birmingham Ladywood, the total number of votes won by independent and green candidates exceed the number won by the Home Secretary. That could trigger trouble, given the Greens and Your Party have indicated they may be open to the idea of local \"progressive pacts\". But in the neighbouring constituency of Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, the result last year shows how an altogether different result could materialise. Here, Labour's vote was again split by a left-wing insurgent candidate - this time from George Galloway's Workers Party. But the conservative vote was also cut in half by Reform. If Nigel Farage can unite the right in places like this, he could come through the middle - in much the same way the Tories did in Leicester. So how can the government fight back? Part of the answer, according to senior figures, is attempting to tell a more appealing story about the more overly left-wing chunks of their policy platform - such as the workers rights reforms and rental overhaul. The hope is these stories may be given more of a hearing in 2026 when (or perhaps more accurately, if) a corner starts to be turned on big domestic priorities like the economy, the NHS and migration. If that doesn't happen, the real saving grace for Labour could be tactical voting. The Greens and Your Party have made it clear that they will plough on with their campaigns against the government, even if it ultimately benefits Reform. Read more from Sky News:Australia launches intelligence reviewEngineer becomes first wheelchair user in space What's less clear is whether left-wingers across the country will. If they are faced with the prospect of Nigel Farage in Downing Street, could they hold their nose and stick with Labour? It all begs the question - who is their great enemy: the government or Reform? Ministers are already trying to emphasise a binary choice when they talk about Labour being the one single \"bulwark\" to Nigel Farage. Expect more attempts to mobilise this anti-Reform vote in the years ahead. But that's made more difficult by what happened around Leicester's Belgrave Circle. The same political fracturing that's dogged the right in years past now being replicated on the left. Labour's ability to pick up the electoral pieces may prove decisive in whether what took place on a shabby East Midlands roundabout in July 2024 is recreated across the country in a few years' time."
