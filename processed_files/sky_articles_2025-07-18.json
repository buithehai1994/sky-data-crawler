        "Content": "\n          Special correspondent\n              @AlexCrawfordSky\n  The Syrian presidency has announced it's assembling a special taskforce to try to stop nearly a week of sectarian clashes in the southern Druze city of Sweida. The presidency called for restraint on all sides and said it is making strenuous efforts to \"stop the fighting and curb the violations that threaten the security of the citizens and the safety of society\". By early Saturday morning, a ceasefire had been confirmed by the US special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, who posted on X that Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to a ceasefire supported by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The post went on to state that this agreement had the support of \"Turkey, Jordan and its neighbours\" and called upon the Druze, Bedouins, and Sunni factions to put down their arms.  Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford reports from the road leading to Sweida, the city that has become the epicentre of Syria's sectarian violence. For the past 24 hours, we've watched as Syria's multiple Arab tribes began mobilising in the Sweida province to help defend their Bedouin brethren. Thousands travelled from multiple different Syrian areas and had reached the edge of Sweida city by Friday nightfall after a day of almost non-stop violent clashes and killings. \n                  Israel and Syria agree to ceasefire, says US ambassador to Turkey, after 'hundreds' killed in clashes\n                 \n                  Syria's president vows to protect Druze population after Israel airstrikes - as new ceasefire begins\n                 \n                  Why has Trump just called his own supporters 'stupid'?\n                 \"We have come to protect the [Arab] Bedouin women and children who are being terrorised by the Druze,\" they told us. Every shop and every home in the streets leading up to Sweida city has been burned or ransacked, the contents destroyed or looted. We saw tribal fighters loading the back of pickup trucks and driving away from the city with vehicles packed with looted goods from Druze homes. Several videos posted online showed violence against the Druze, including one where tribal fighters force three men to throw themselves off a high-rise balcony and are seen being shot as they do so. Doctors at the nearby community hospital in Buser al Harir said there had been a constant stream of casualties being brought in. As we watched, another dead fighter was carried out of an ambulance. The medics estimated there had been more than 600 dead in their area alone. \"The youngest child who was killed was a one-and-a-half-year-old baby,\" one doctor told us. The violence is the most dangerous outbreak of sectarian clashes since the fall of the Bashar al Assad regime last December - and the most serious challenge for the new leader to navigate. The newly brokered deal is aimed at ending the sectarian killings and restoring some sort of stability in a country which is emerging from more than a decade of civil war."

        "Headline": "The US president has denied claims he wrote a letter to the disgraced financier as part of a collection for his 50th birthday in 2003.",
        "Content": " Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, two Wall Street Journal reporters and the publication's owner, News Corp. The US president has accused the named individuals of defamation, claiming they acted with malicious intent and caused him overwhelming financial and reputational harm. The lawsuit, which was filed in Miami, seeks at least $10bn (Â£7.5bn) in damages. In a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump called the lawsuit \"historic legal action\" which he said was filed on behalf of himself and all Americans who will \"no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media\". \"I hope Rupert and his 'friends' are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case,\" he wrote. It comes after Mr Trump claimed that a letter he allegedly wrote to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was \"fake\" and said he would sue the \"ass off\" Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which first published the story. The publication had said Mr Trump wrote the letter as part of a collection Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, planned to give him as a 50th birthday present in 2003. It claimed the message, allegedly from Mr Trump, featured several lines of typewritten text, concluding with: \"May every day be another wonderful secret.\" The text was framed by what appeared to be a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, the WSJ claimed. The letter is also said to have featured the signature \"Donald\". Mr Trump immediately denied writing the letter when the WSJ report was published on Thursday night.  \"The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.\" Mr Trump ignored questions about Epstein as he signed a cryptocurrency bill at the White House earlier on Friday. The president's lawsuit comes as the US government filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein, who took his own life while awaiting trial in 2019. In a Manhattan federal court filing, the Department of Justice said the criminal cases against Epstein and Maxwell are a matter of public interest, justifying the release of associated grand jury transcripts. Earlier on Friday, Mr Trump said attorney general Pam Bondi had been asked to release the transcripts because of \"the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein\". ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The justice department previously said it had around 200 documents relating to Epstein and that the FBI had thousands more. It is unknown how much of this is grand jury testimony, which is typically kept secret under US law.

Mr Trump pledged to release files on Epstein during his presidential campaign, as his MAGA movement accused the Biden administration of suppressing the extent of Epstein's paedophilia, predatory behaviour and his so-called \"client list\" - thought to contain names of the rich and famous who conspired with him in his child sex trafficking operation. But after a review of the evidence the US government has, the Justice Department recently determined that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted\". Venezuela releases jailed Americans in prisoner swap  The Trump administration said on Friday that it had negotiated an exchange with Venezuela, resulting in the release of 10 jailed Americans. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the prisoners, who had been held in the South American country, were \"on their way to freedom\". In return, 252 Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador have been freed, the Venezuelan government said. They had been held in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison after being deported by the US."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n What started as a missing person case led to the capture of an \"evil\" serial killer who \"got sadistic sexual pleasure\" from murdering women. Peter Tobin died in October 2022 at the age of 76 while serving three life sentences for the murders of Angelika Kluk, Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol. Former detective superintendent David Swindle helped to unmask the murderer and has always believed there are more victims out there. Mr Swindle told Sky News: \"Peter Tobin was evil. And, you know, there's a lot of speculation - nature, nurture or born evil. He's evil. This is someone that got sadistic sexual pleasure from killing people. \"And when we look back at his life, we see that he cut the head off a dog. He tortured animals - a trait that featured with Ian Brady killing a cat. \"This kind of stuff - he was progressing, he had all the traits early on. And then we traced various partners that he had, and they describe horrific, violent domestic abuse. \"This is someone progressing towards it. And Tobin is evil. He's killed other people, but we don't know how many else he's killed. \n                  Michael Harvey: Man who attempted to murder woman while on date in Glasgow jailed for nine years\n                 \n                  Scottish parliament seeking views for new law that would create register for domestic abusers\n                 \n                  Man stabbed to death near five-star hotel in central London\n                 \"And the reason we don't know it, is because he targeted vulnerable people and he was forensically aware. So, there could be others, there will be other cases.\" Tobin's secret reign of terror was unveiled following the disappearance of Polish student Angelika Kluk in September 2006. The 23-year-old had been enjoying her second summer at St Patrick's Church in Glasgow, where she was living and working as a cleaner to help finance her Scandinavian studies course at the University of Gdansk. She was reported missing after failing to turn up to work and was last seen alive in the company of the church's handyman, \"Patrick McLaughlin\". The caretaker initially spoke to police before sparking suspicion by disappearing himself. Following a public appeal, the force discovered \"McLaughlin\" was instead registered sex offender Tobin. In 1993, Tobin attacked two 14-year-old girls while living in Havant, Hampshire. He attempted to evade justice for the horrific sex assaults but was jailed the following year and spent a decade behind bars before returning to his home county of Renfrewshire in 2004. In 2005, he fled Paisley after being accused of attacking a woman and managed to avoid detection until Angelika's case. Mr Swindle said he can still remember the day he was brought onto the case after Tobin's true identity was discovered. Angelika instantly became a high-risk missing person as she was last seen in the company of a registered sex offender. Officers were sent back to search the church, where Angelika's body was thereafter discovered under the floorboards. Forensic scientist Carol Rogers ordered for the body not to be moved and crawled under the floorboards to collect vital DNA evidence from the bloody crime scene. Angelika suffered a violent death in the sexually motivated murder. A post-mortem examination revealed she had been bound and gagged, raped, beaten with a piece of wood, and stabbed 16 times in the chest. Mr Swindle said the \"ferocity\" of what had happened to Angelika was \"absolutely horrendous\". He said: \"I've worked on hundreds of murder investigations in my long time in the police, mostly in the CID. This was horrendous, absolutely horrendous, and it was organised. \"The way he had put poor Angelika under the floor and concealed her remains and stayed at the scene - this is someone that's cool, calculating, someone that knew what he was about.\" A manhunt was launched for Tobin, who had absconded to London. He was eventually captured after admitting himself to a hospital under the name \"James Kelly\". His deception was foiled after a staff member recognised Tobin from the media coverage. Tobin was initially brought back to Scotland for failing to comply with his sex offender requirements. Mr Swindle said: \"So, you've got the person, you've got the individual, but you need to work round it all. \"Meanwhile, it's very fast moving. There was huge media interest, rightly so, and you're always thinking, 'okay, it's him, we've got to prove this'. \"And you have to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, and that was the issue. And then later on that week, we got the DNA. It was Tobin's DNA. That is a significant development.\" Tobin denied any wrongdoing and went to trial despite the DNA evidence stacked against him. Dorothy Bain KC, Scotland's now lord advocate, was the prosecutor in the case. Jurors heard how semen recovered from Angelika's body linked back to Tobin, as did fingerprints on tarpaulin left at the scene of the crime. The victim's blood was also found on a wooden table leg and on Tobin's watch. The defence, led by Donald Findlay KC, claimed any sex was consensual. Suspicions were instead cast on to the parish priest at the time, who claimed he'd had a sexual relationship with Angelika, as well as a married man the victim was having an affair with. Mr Swindle said: \"What happened very early on with the murder of Angelika Kluk was what you see so many times in cases - victim blaming and victim shaming.\" Jurors saw through Tobin's lies and found him guilty. Judge Lord Menzies described the rapist and murderer as an \"evil man\" as he handed down a life sentence with at least 21 years behind bars in May 2007. The killer kicked a press photographer to the ground as he was led from the High Court in Edinburgh. Following Tobin's conviction, what was then Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram to investigate his life. Mr Swindle said: \"As soon as I saw what Peter Tobin had done to poor Angelika - how organised he was, how methodical he was, the fact that he was using a false name, the fact that he gave a statement to the police in a false name before the heat was on him. \"He was 60 years of age. He's done this before.\" Mr Swindle said \"fortunately\" there aren't many serial killers in the UK. He added: \"Serial killers - they're cunning, they're controlling, they're conniving, they can be charming, and that's what we actually found out about Tobin, and they can be clever.\" Mr Swindle likened Tobin's traits to that of Moors murderer Ian Brady and fellow Scot Dennis Nilsen, who admitted murdering at least 15 young men between 1978 and 1983. Mr Swindle said: \"And that's when I thought we have to look at his whole life.\" As officers mapped the thrice-married Tobin's movements over the years, it was discovered he was living in Bathgate at the time of Vicky Hamilton's disappearance in February 1991. Vicky was just 15 when she went missing from a bus stop in the West Lothian town. The teenager had been staying with her older sister in Livingston and vanished during a cold weather snap while making her way home to Redding, near Falkirk. She was last seen alive eating from a bag of chips while waiting for her connecting bus. The case was one of Scotland's most high-profile missing person enquiries. Sadly, Vicky's heartbroken mother, Janette, died in 1993 without knowing what happened to her daughter. In June 2007, police searched Tobin's old Bathgate home and recovered a dagger hidden in the loft space. A piece of Vicky's skin was recovered from the weapon. Vicky's purse, which had been discarded in Edinburgh following her disappearance in an attempt to fool police she had run away, was submitted for testing and found to contain traces of saliva linking back to Tobin's then young son. It is believed the toddler may have put the purse in his mouth while playing with it. There was no sign of Vicky, but the mystery would soon unravel nearly 500 miles away. In October 2007, a search was conducted at Tobin's old home in Margate, Kent, where he had moved to a few months after Vicky went missing. Officers believed he may have been involved in the disappearance of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol. The Essex teenager vanished in August 1991 after accepting a ride while hitchhiking home from a music festival in Hampshire. Her male friend was dropped off by the man, but she was never seen again. Following Dinah's disappearance, large sums of money were withdrawn from her bank account along the south coast. The location of the ATMs linked back to places Tobin had lived. After 16 years, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of both Vicky and Dinah came to a close with the discovery of their bodies in the back garden of Tobin's old Margate home. Vicky had been dismembered. Prosecutors argued Tobin drugged the teenagers with amitriptyline, which he was prescribed at the time, before raping and murdering them. Tobin once again denied any wrongdoing - despite his fingerprints being found on the refuse bags used to wrap the bodies - but was found guilty of both murders. In December 2008, he was sentenced to at least 30 years in jail for killing Vicky. The following year he received a whole life order for the death of Dinah. Tobin died on 8 October 2022. The HMP Edinburgh inmate had been receiving palliative care at the city's royal infirmary following a fall in his cell the previous month. A fatal accident inquiry was held last year, which revealed Tobin was suffering from bronchial pneumonia, vascular disease and prostate cancer at the time of his death. The serial killer's ashes were later scattered at sea as no one came forward to claim them. Tobin has long been suspected by police of murdering other women due to the sheer amount of aliases, cars, and homes he held over his lifetime. Mr Swindle said: \"Tobin's killed other people - there's no doubt about it.\" However, Tobin took his secrets to the grave. Mr Swindle said: \"Police Scotland were at his bedside when he was dying and asked him to do the right thing. He didn't. \"It's the ultimate control. It's like Ian Brady - a narcissist. They lack empathy, it's all about them.\" Tobin's name was linked to the disappearance of Louise Kay, 18, from Beachy Head in Eastbourne in 1988. The murder of Jessie Earl, 22, in 1980 was also reinvestigated as part of Operation Anagram. Her remains were recovered in 1989 in thick undergrowth on Beachy Head, a place she would often take walks and the same area Louise disappeared. Mystery continues to surround dozens of pieces of jewellery recovered from Tobin's possessions in Glasgow after he fled the church following Angelika's murder. Mr Swindle believes Tobin's plan was to move Angelika's body away from the crime scene - as what he did with Vicky - but police arrived before he could dispose of the evidence. Mr Swindle said: \"That phrase that's used quite a lot - trophies. I don't like that phrase. I think the word trophy sounds like a victory. I call it souvenirs from a horrible act. \"And Tobin, I thought, 'he's kept them, they're souvenirs from a terrible act'. \"And to take it further, the jewellery is examined and there's DNA profiles on that jewellery. Profiles of women, which we've never identified. Trophies is a horrible word.\" Tobin has also been mentioned in connection with the Bible John killings, a series of murders that brought terror to Glasgow in the late 1960s. The deaths of the three young women - who met their killer at the city's renowned Barrowland Ballroom - remain unsolved. Mr Swindle said: \"I'm not convinced the same person was involved in these three murders. \"And there's no evidence, I don't think professionally and evidentially, that Peter Tobin killed these women either.\" Police Scotland has since scaled back Operation Anagram. Mr Swindle retired from the force in 2011 but went on to set up David Swindle Crime Solutions. As well as offering expert crime advice and spearheading independent case reviews, he can also be found on tour with his latest stage show, Murder: A Search For The Truth. Mr Swindle additionally established Victims Abroad to help support families who lose a loved one in a foreign country due to homicide or suspicious death and are faced with confusing updates and legal processes in different languages. Speaking of Operation Anagram, Mr Swindle said: \"Throughout my long police career, I've worked in some big, big investigations. \"This, for me, is a career defining moment and also a personal and professional defining moment in my life. \"I've never worked on anything like it, and I hope never ever to experience it again. And I hope no other serving officers have to experience such horrendous things.\""

        "Content": " A 65-year-old woman dubbed \"gangster granny\" by police has been jailed for running a UK-wide drug-dealing operation.  Deborah Mason - known as 'Queen Bee' - and seven other members of the family-run gang were sentenced to a total of 106.5 years at Woolwich Crown Court in London on Friday. The group imported almost a tonne of cocaine - with an estimated street value of Â£80m - over seven months. Mason spent her profits on designer goods, including a Gucci lead and collar for her cat, and planned to travel to Turkey for cosmetic procedures. The ringleader was in \"close contact\" with an upstream supplier called Bugsy using an encrypted app and directed other members of the gang as they drove packages of imported cocaine to locations across England. Mason was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Judge Philip Shorrock told her: \"You were effectively the site foreman working under the direction of a site manager. \n                  Child who died in Minehead school coach crash was 10-year-old boy, police say\n                 \n                  Unmasked: The 18 Russian spies who mounted series of attacks on UK\n                 \n                  Detective who helped catch 'sadistic' serial killer Peter Tobin believes there are more victims out there\n                 \"You recruited members of your own family - as a mother you should have been setting an example for your children and not corrupting them.\" Prosecutor Charlotte Hole said earlier that Mason \"recruited both her family members - her sister and her children - as well as partners and friends of her children, to a network of at least 10 individuals.\" Mason and the other eight defendants made multiple trips to collect and drop off imported cocaine from Harwich Port and other locations. Some of the gang members took their young children with them as they couriered the packages. They took them to addresses in Bradford, Cardiff, south London, Rotherham, Southend, Leicester, Walsall and various other places. Ms Hole said Mason did not use pressure or coercion to woo her family into the gang, as they were \"motivated by financial benefit\". It is estimated each person earned more than Â£1,000 a day, the Metropolitan Police said.

She was jailed on Friday alongside seven other people. Roseanne Mason, 29, of Canon, north London, Chloe Hodgkin, 23, of Wye, Kent, Lillie Bright, 26, of Ashford, Demi Bright, 30, of Staplehurst, Kent, and Anita Slaughter, 44, of Ashford, Kent, stood trial alongside the 65-year-old and were all found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Prior to her trial, Lillie Bright pleaded guilty to a separate offence of offering to supply Class A drugs. Her partner, Chloe Hodgkin, is awaiting the birth of her baby and will be sentenced at a later date. Tina Golding, 66, of Ashford, Kent, Reggie Bright, 24, of Staplehurst, Kent, and Demi Kendall, 31, of Staplehurst, Kent, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Reggie Bright and Demi Kendall also pleaded guilty to a separate offence of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, and possession of criminal property after seizures of cocaine and more than Â£15,000 cash during a search of their home. Roseanne Mason and Demi Bright were each sentenced to 11 years in prison. Lillie Bright was sentenced to 13 years, and Demi Kendall was sentenced to 13 years and six months imprisonment. Reggie Bright was sentenced to 15 years, and Tina Golding was jailed for 10 years. Anita Slaughter was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment."

        "Content": "\n          Social Affairs correspondent\n              @BeckyJohnsonSky\n The parents of a young man who was stabbed to death by a 14-year-old girl say their son was failed by the state. Nimroy Hendricks, 24, was fatally stabbed in the chest in Crawley in October 2020. He knew his killer as he had met her mother months before his death. An inquest has found opportunities were missed by both police and social workers when the girl was reported as missing in the hours before Nimroy was killed. The girl was known to the authorities from birth. For legal reasons she can only be named as Child A. She had a long criminal record, a history of violence and was known to carry knives. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in 2021. Nimroy's parents blame a \"catalogue of errors\" by the authorities throughout the girl's troubled life and warn if the system does not change more people will be killed by violent children. \"I just wonder how much more will they wait on to see happen before they do something\", Nimroy's father, who has the same first name, told Sky News. \"This girl who had mental problems, who was known to the system for so many years, and they just laid back and knew that she is just on the brink to kill someone because she attempted it so many times. \"They have all the warning signs. So for me the system needs to changeâ€¦ and if it doesn't change sooner or later you'll hear another parent like us.\" Nimroy's mother, Lisa Hendricks, agrees. \"When somebody sticks a knife into your son's heart and kills him... I've had to read everything,\" she says. \"Because you wonder how he spent his time in that last moment - after he knew he'd been stabbed and after he was bleeding out and he was dying.\" Since their son's death, they've watched in horror as other children known to the authorities have gone on to kill, including the knife attack in Southport carried out by Axel Rudakubana who was 17 when he murdered seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, six-year-old Bebe King, and nine-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar. \"Since Nim's been killed, there has been a raft of children who are running around killing people,\" Mrs Hendricks told Sky News. \"Far more serious interventions need to be put in place when they begin to flex those very, very dangerous muscles. \"Does anybody think that this is going to get better unless those who are really, really in need of it receive and are able to access the support that they need for their troubled children. How? This cannot get better unless that is actually done,\" she says. 'Downplayed, downgraded, dismissed' Child A was born in Birmingham. Social services had been involved with her mother, even before she gave birth. The warning signs began to emerge from a young age. By the age of six, she was increasingly violent and aggressive at school. She was permanently excluded from her third primary school aged eight. By 2019 she had been arrested several times, including for being in possession of a bladed article. At one point she was taken into police protection. She also spent time in emergency foster care. In 2020 she stabbed her mother in the leg then set fire to her bedroom. That led to her being remanded in secure juvenile custody. A psychological assessment warned she needed therapy before living with her mother again. That did not happen. When she was released from custody, she was returned to the care of her mother who had moved to West Sussex. The psychological assessment was not shared with authorities there. In the days before she killed Nimroy, she had made threats to stab her mother and been reported as missing. \"When you really look back at this entire scenario, it's like every single thing with her has been downplayed, downgraded, dismissed, put aside,\" Mrs Hendricks says. 'Someone has to be accountable' Nimroy's parents now want individual accountability for their son's death. \"Someone has to be accountable, knowing how dangerous she was and having all the paperwork, evidence about her,\" Mr Hendricks says. \"She was known to them for so many years.\" Nimroy's mother fears their son's death is one of so many that the authorities just want to move on. \"We've been treated as 'well go away, deal with it',\" she says \"I just feel as if nobody cares. Nobody cares. That's how I feel. Nobody cares.\" A spokesperson for Sussex Police told Sky News The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigated the case after it was referred by Sussex Police in respect of this contact with Child A. They found no evidence of wrongdoing or misconduct by the force. Vince Clark, West Sussex County Council's interim executive director of children, young people and learning, said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the inquest and the coroner's conclusions, which we will reflect upon as we move forward.\" James Thomas, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, said: \"We have already acted on the lessons learnt... As a result, our processes have been strengthened, including how information is shared with other statutory agencies when children move out of our area.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n What started as a missing person case led to the capture of an \"evil\" serial killer who \"got sadistic sexual pleasure\" from murdering women. Peter Tobin died in October 2022 at the age of 76 while serving three life sentences for the murders of Angelika Kluk, Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol. Former detective superintendent David Swindle helped to unmask the murderer and has always believed there are more victims out there. Mr Swindle told Sky News: \"Peter Tobin was evil. And, you know, there's a lot of speculation - nature, nurture or born evil. He's evil. This is someone that got sadistic sexual pleasure from killing people. \"And when we look back at his life, we see that he cut the head off a dog. He tortured animals - a trait that featured with Ian Brady killing a cat. \"This kind of stuff - he was progressing, he had all the traits early on. And then we traced various partners that he had, and they describe horrific, violent domestic abuse. \"This is someone progressing towards it. And Tobin is evil. He's killed other people, but we don't know how many else he's killed. \n                  Michael Harvey: Man who attempted to murder woman while on date in Glasgow jailed for nine years\n                 \n                  Scottish parliament seeking views for new law that would create register for domestic abusers\n                 \n                  Man stabbed to death near five-star hotel in central London\n                 \"And the reason we don't know it, is because he targeted vulnerable people and he was forensically aware. So, there could be others, there will be other cases.\" Tobin's secret reign of terror was unveiled following the disappearance of Polish student Angelika Kluk in September 2006. The 23-year-old had been enjoying her second summer at St Patrick's Church in Glasgow, where she was living and working as a cleaner to help finance her Scandinavian studies course at the University of Gdansk. She was reported missing after failing to turn up to work and was last seen alive in the company of the church's handyman, \"Patrick McLaughlin\". The caretaker initially spoke to police before sparking suspicion by disappearing himself. Following a public appeal, the force discovered \"McLaughlin\" was instead registered sex offender Tobin. In 1993, Tobin attacked two 14-year-old girls while living in Havant, Hampshire. He attempted to evade justice for the horrific sex assaults but was jailed the following year and spent a decade behind bars before returning to his home county of Renfrewshire in 2004. In 2005, he fled Paisley after being accused of attacking a woman and managed to avoid detection until Angelika's case. Mr Swindle said he can still remember the day he was brought onto the case after Tobin's true identity was discovered. Angelika instantly became a high-risk missing person as she was last seen in the company of a registered sex offender. Officers were sent back to search the church, where Angelika's body was thereafter discovered under the floorboards. Forensic scientist Carol Rogers ordered for the body not to be moved and crawled under the floorboards to collect vital DNA evidence from the bloody crime scene. Angelika suffered a violent death in the sexually motivated murder. A post-mortem examination revealed she had been bound and gagged, raped, beaten with a piece of wood, and stabbed 16 times in the chest. Mr Swindle said the \"ferocity\" of what had happened to Angelika was \"absolutely horrendous\". He said: \"I've worked on hundreds of murder investigations in my long time in the police, mostly in the CID. This was horrendous, absolutely horrendous, and it was organised. \"The way he had put poor Angelika under the floor and concealed her remains and stayed at the scene - this is someone that's cool, calculating, someone that knew what he was about.\" A manhunt was launched for Tobin, who had absconded to London. He was eventually captured after admitting himself to a hospital under the name \"James Kelly\". His deception was foiled after a staff member recognised Tobin from the media coverage. Tobin was initially brought back to Scotland for failing to comply with his sex offender requirements. Mr Swindle said: \"So, you've got the person, you've got the individual, but you need to work round it all. \"Meanwhile, it's very fast moving. There was huge media interest, rightly so, and you're always thinking, 'okay, it's him, we've got to prove this'. \"And you have to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, and that was the issue. And then later on that week, we got the DNA. It was Tobin's DNA. That is a significant development.\" Tobin denied any wrongdoing and went to trial despite the DNA evidence stacked against him. Dorothy Bain KC, Scotland's now lord advocate, was the prosecutor in the case. Jurors heard how semen recovered from Angelika's body linked back to Tobin, as did fingerprints on tarpaulin left at the scene of the crime. The victim's blood was also found on a wooden table leg and on Tobin's watch. The defence, led by Donald Findlay KC, claimed any sex was consensual. Suspicions were instead cast on to the parish priest at the time, who claimed he'd had a sexual relationship with Angelika, as well as a married man the victim was having an affair with. Mr Swindle said: \"What happened very early on with the murder of Angelika Kluk was what you see so many times in cases - victim blaming and victim shaming.\" Jurors saw through Tobin's lies and found him guilty. Judge Lord Menzies described the rapist and murderer as an \"evil man\" as he handed down a life sentence with at least 21 years behind bars in May 2007. The killer kicked a press photographer to the ground as he was led from the High Court in Edinburgh. Following Tobin's conviction, what was then Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram to investigate his life. Mr Swindle said: \"As soon as I saw what Peter Tobin had done to poor Angelika - how organised he was, how methodical he was, the fact that he was using a false name, the fact that he gave a statement to the police in a false name before the heat was on him. \"He was 60 years of age. He's done this before.\" Mr Swindle said \"fortunately\" there aren't many serial killers in the UK. He added: \"Serial killers - they're cunning, they're controlling, they're conniving, they can be charming, and that's what we actually found out about Tobin, and they can be clever.\" Mr Swindle likened Tobin's traits to that of Moors murderer Ian Brady and fellow Scot Dennis Nilsen, who admitted murdering at least 15 young men between 1978 and 1983. Mr Swindle said: \"And that's when I thought we have to look at his whole life.\" As officers mapped the thrice-married Tobin's movements over the years, it was discovered he was living in Bathgate at the time of Vicky Hamilton's disappearance in February 1991. Vicky was just 15 when she went missing from a bus stop in the West Lothian town. The teenager had been staying with her older sister in Livingston and vanished during a cold weather snap while making her way home to Redding, near Falkirk. She was last seen alive eating from a bag of chips while waiting for her connecting bus. The case was one of Scotland's most high-profile missing person enquiries. Sadly, Vicky's heartbroken mother, Janette, died in 1993 without knowing what happened to her daughter. In June 2007, police searched Tobin's old Bathgate home and recovered a dagger hidden in the loft space. A piece of Vicky's skin was recovered from the weapon. Vicky's purse, which had been discarded in Edinburgh following her disappearance in an attempt to fool police she had run away, was submitted for testing and found to contain traces of saliva linking back to Tobin's then young son. It is believed the toddler may have put the purse in his mouth while playing with it. There was no sign of Vicky, but the mystery would soon unravel nearly 500 miles away. In October 2007, a search was conducted at Tobin's old home in Margate, Kent, where he had moved to a few months after Vicky went missing. Officers believed he may have been involved in the disappearance of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol. The Essex teenager vanished in August 1991 after accepting a ride while hitchhiking home from a music festival in Hampshire. Her male friend was dropped off by the man, but she was never seen again. Following Dinah's disappearance, large sums of money were withdrawn from her bank account along the south coast. The location of the ATMs linked back to places Tobin had lived. After 16 years, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of both Vicky and Dinah came to a close with the discovery of their bodies in the back garden of Tobin's old Margate home. Vicky had been dismembered. Prosecutors argued Tobin drugged the teenagers with amitriptyline, which he was prescribed at the time, before raping and murdering them. Tobin once again denied any wrongdoing - despite his fingerprints being found on the refuse bags used to wrap the bodies - but was found guilty of both murders. In December 2008, he was sentenced to at least 30 years in jail for killing Vicky. The following year he received a whole life order for the death of Dinah. Tobin died on 8 October 2022. The HMP Edinburgh inmate had been receiving palliative care at the city's royal infirmary following a fall in his cell the previous month. A fatal accident inquiry was held last year, which revealed Tobin was suffering from bronchial pneumonia, vascular disease and prostate cancer at the time of his death. The serial killer's ashes were later scattered at sea as no one came forward to claim them. Tobin has long been suspected by police of murdering other women due to the sheer amount of aliases, cars, and homes he held over his lifetime. Mr Swindle said: \"Tobin's killed other people - there's no doubt about it.\" However, Tobin took his secrets to the grave. Mr Swindle said: \"Police Scotland were at his bedside when he was dying and asked him to do the right thing. He didn't. \"It's the ultimate control. It's like Ian Brady - a narcissist. They lack empathy, it's all about them.\" Tobin's name was linked to the disappearance of Louise Kay, 18, from Beachy Head in Eastbourne in 1988. The murder of Jessie Earl, 22, in 1980 was also reinvestigated as part of Operation Anagram. Her remains were recovered in 1989 in thick undergrowth on Beachy Head, a place she would often take walks and the same area Louise disappeared. Mystery continues to surround dozens of pieces of jewellery recovered from Tobin's possessions in Glasgow after he fled the church following Angelika's murder. Mr Swindle believes Tobin's plan was to move Angelika's body away from the crime scene - as what he did with Vicky - but police arrived before he could dispose of the evidence. Mr Swindle said: \"That phrase that's used quite a lot - trophies. I don't like that phrase. I think the word trophy sounds like a victory. I call it souvenirs from a horrible act. \"And Tobin, I thought, 'he's kept them, they're souvenirs from a terrible act'. \"And to take it further, the jewellery is examined and there's DNA profiles on that jewellery. Profiles of women, which we've never identified. Trophies is a horrible word.\" Tobin has also been mentioned in connection with the Bible John killings, a series of murders that brought terror to Glasgow in the late 1960s. The deaths of the three young women - who met their killer at the city's renowned Barrowland Ballroom - remain unsolved. Mr Swindle said: \"I'm not convinced the same person was involved in these three murders. \"And there's no evidence, I don't think professionally and evidentially, that Peter Tobin killed these women either.\" Police Scotland has since scaled back Operation Anagram. Mr Swindle retired from the force in 2011 but went on to set up David Swindle Crime Solutions. As well as offering expert crime advice and spearheading independent case reviews, he can also be found on tour with his latest stage show, Murder: A Search For The Truth. Mr Swindle additionally established Victims Abroad to help support families who lose a loved one in a foreign country due to homicide or suspicious death and are faced with confusing updates and legal processes in different languages. Speaking of Operation Anagram, Mr Swindle said: \"Throughout my long police career, I've worked in some big, big investigations. \"This, for me, is a career defining moment and also a personal and professional defining moment in my life. \"I've never worked on anything like it, and I hope never ever to experience it again. And I hope no other serving officers have to experience such horrendous things.\""

        "Content": "\n          Social Affairs correspondent\n              @BeckyJohnsonSky\n The parents of a young man who was stabbed to death by a 14-year-old girl say their son was failed by the state. Nimroy Hendricks, 24, was fatally stabbed in the chest in Crawley in October 2020. He knew his killer as he had met her mother months before his death. An inquest has found opportunities were missed by both police and social workers when the girl was reported as missing in the hours before Nimroy was killed. The girl was known to the authorities from birth. For legal reasons she can only be named as Child A. She had a long criminal record, a history of violence and was known to carry knives. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in 2021. Nimroy's parents blame a \"catalogue of errors\" by the authorities throughout the girl's troubled life and warn if the system does not change more people will be killed by violent children. \"I just wonder how much more will they wait on to see happen before they do something\", Nimroy's father, who has the same first name, told Sky News. \"This girl who had mental problems, who was known to the system for so many years, and they just laid back and knew that she is just on the brink to kill someone because she attempted it so many times. \"They have all the warning signs. So for me the system needs to changeâ€¦ and if it doesn't change sooner or later you'll hear another parent like us.\" Nimroy's mother, Lisa Hendricks, agrees. \"When somebody sticks a knife into your son's heart and kills him... I've had to read everything,\" she says. \"Because you wonder how he spent his time in that last moment - after he knew he'd been stabbed and after he was bleeding out and he was dying.\" Since their son's death, they've watched in horror as other children known to the authorities have gone on to kill, including the knife attack in Southport carried out by Axel Rudakubana who was 17 when he murdered seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, six-year-old Bebe King, and nine-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar. \"Since Nim's been killed, there has been a raft of children who are running around killing people,\" Mrs Hendricks told Sky News. \"Far more serious interventions need to be put in place when they begin to flex those very, very dangerous muscles. \"Does anybody think that this is going to get better unless those who are really, really in need of it receive and are able to access the support that they need for their troubled children. How? This cannot get better unless that is actually done,\" she says. 'Downplayed, downgraded, dismissed' Child A was born in Birmingham. Social services had been involved with her mother, even before she gave birth. The warning signs began to emerge from a young age. By the age of six, she was increasingly violent and aggressive at school. She was permanently excluded from her third primary school aged eight. By 2019 she had been arrested several times, including for being in possession of a bladed article. At one point she was taken into police protection. She also spent time in emergency foster care. In 2020 she stabbed her mother in the leg then set fire to her bedroom. That led to her being remanded in secure juvenile custody. A psychological assessment warned she needed therapy before living with her mother again. That did not happen. When she was released from custody, she was returned to the care of her mother who had moved to West Sussex. The psychological assessment was not shared with authorities there. In the days before she killed Nimroy, she had made threats to stab her mother and been reported as missing. \"When you really look back at this entire scenario, it's like every single thing with her has been downplayed, downgraded, dismissed, put aside,\" Mrs Hendricks says. 'Someone has to be accountable' Nimroy's parents now want individual accountability for their son's death. \"Someone has to be accountable, knowing how dangerous she was and having all the paperwork, evidence about her,\" Mr Hendricks says. \"She was known to them for so many years.\" Nimroy's mother fears their son's death is one of so many that the authorities just want to move on. \"We've been treated as 'well go away, deal with it',\" she says \"I just feel as if nobody cares. Nobody cares. That's how I feel. Nobody cares.\" A spokesperson for Sussex Police told Sky News The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigated the case after it was referred by Sussex Police in respect of this contact with Child A. They found no evidence of wrongdoing or misconduct by the force. Vince Clark, West Sussex County Council's interim executive director of children, young people and learning, said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the inquest and the coroner's conclusions, which we will reflect upon as we move forward.\" James Thomas, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, said: \"We have already acted on the lessons learnt... As a result, our processes have been strengthened, including how information is shared with other statutory agencies when children move out of our area.\""

        "Content": " A 65-year-old woman dubbed \"gangster granny\" by police has been jailed for running a UK-wide drug-dealing operation.  Deborah Mason - known as 'Queen Bee' - and seven other members of the family-run gang were sentenced to a total of 106.5 years at Woolwich Crown Court in London on Friday. The group imported almost a tonne of cocaine - with an estimated street value of Â£80m - over seven months. Mason spent her profits on designer goods, including a Gucci lead and collar for her cat, and planned to travel to Turkey for cosmetic procedures. The ringleader was in \"close contact\" with an upstream supplier called Bugsy using an encrypted app and directed other members of the gang as they drove packages of imported cocaine to locations across England. Mason was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Judge Philip Shorrock told her: \"You were effectively the site foreman working under the direction of a site manager. \n                  Child who died in Minehead school coach crash was 10-year-old boy, police say\n                 \n                  Unmasked: The 18 Russian spies who mounted series of attacks on UK\n                 \n                  Detective who helped catch 'sadistic' serial killer Peter Tobin believes there are more victims out there\n                 \"You recruited members of your own family - as a mother you should have been setting an example for your children and not corrupting them.\" Prosecutor Charlotte Hole said earlier that Mason \"recruited both her family members - her sister and her children - as well as partners and friends of her children, to a network of at least 10 individuals.\" Mason and the other eight defendants made multiple trips to collect and drop off imported cocaine from Harwich Port and other locations. Some of the gang members took their young children with them as they couriered the packages. They took them to addresses in Bradford, Cardiff, south London, Rotherham, Southend, Leicester, Walsall and various other places. Ms Hole said Mason did not use pressure or coercion to woo her family into the gang, as they were \"motivated by financial benefit\". It is estimated each person earned more than Â£1,000 a day, the Metropolitan Police said.

She was jailed on Friday alongside seven other people. Roseanne Mason, 29, of Canon, north London, Chloe Hodgkin, 23, of Wye, Kent, Lillie Bright, 26, of Ashford, Demi Bright, 30, of Staplehurst, Kent, and Anita Slaughter, 44, of Ashford, Kent, stood trial alongside the 65-year-old and were all found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Prior to her trial, Lillie Bright pleaded guilty to a separate offence of offering to supply Class A drugs. Her partner, Chloe Hodgkin, is awaiting the birth of her baby and will be sentenced at a later date. Tina Golding, 66, of Ashford, Kent, Reggie Bright, 24, of Staplehurst, Kent, and Demi Kendall, 31, of Staplehurst, Kent, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Reggie Bright and Demi Kendall also pleaded guilty to a separate offence of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, and possession of criminal property after seizures of cocaine and more than Â£15,000 cash during a search of their home. Roseanne Mason and Demi Bright were each sentenced to 11 years in prison. Lillie Bright was sentenced to 13 years, and Demi Kendall was sentenced to 13 years and six months imprisonment.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  An independent review of the water industry is to recommend sweeping changes to the way the sector is managed, including the potential replacement of Ofwat with a strengthened body combining economic and environmental regulation. Former Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe will publish the findings of the Independent Water Commission on Monday, with stakeholders across the industry expecting significant changes to regulation to be at its heart. The existing regulator Ofwat has been under fire from all sides in recent years amid rising public anger at levels of pollution and the financial management of water companies. Read more:Serious water pollution incidents in England up 60% last yearWhy has there been a surge in water pollution? Campaigners and politicians have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain that its focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate investment in infrastructure. In an interim report, published in June, Sir Jon identified the presence of multiple regulators with overlapping responsibilities as a key issue facing the industry. While Ofwat is the economic regulator, the Environment Agency has responsibility for setting pollution standards, alongside the Drinking Water Inspectorate. \n                  Why has there been a surge in water pollution? \n                 \n                  Prince William has had a lot to say this week - but is anyone listening?\n                 \n                  Water cremation and human composting could be offered instead of traditional funerals\n                 Sir Jon's final report is expected to include a recommendation that the government consider a new regulator that combines Ofwat's economic regulatory powers with the water-facing responsibilities currently managed by the EA. In his interim report, Sir Jon said options for reform ranged from \"rationalising\" existing regulation to \"fundamental, structural options for integrating regulatory remits and functions\". He is understood to have discussed the implications of fundamental reform with senior figures in industry and government in the last week as he finalised his report. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals following publication of the commission report. The commission is also expected to recommend a \"major shift\" in the model of economic regulation, which currently relies on econometric modelling, to a supervisory approach that takes more account of individual company circumstances. Read more from Sky News: Police taking no further action over Kneecap's Glastonbury showNew fee for Britons travelling to EU will cost more than expected Political correspondent On Monday, the government's long-awaited review into the UK's water industry will finally report.  The expectation is that it will recommend sweeping changes - including the abolition of the regulator, Ofwat.  But frustrated customers of the water companies could rightly complain that the process of taking on this failing sector and its regulator has been slow and ineffective.  They may be forgiven for going further and suggesting that how Labour has dealt with water is symbolic of their inability to make an impact across many areas of public life, leaving many of their voters disappointed.  This is an industry that has been visibly and rapidly declining for decades, with the illegal sewage dumping and rotting pipes in stark contrast with the vast salaries and bonuses paid out to their executives.   It doesn't take a review to see what's gone wrong. Most informed members of the public could explain what has happened in a matter of minutes. And yet, despite 14 years in opposition with plenty of time to put together a radical plan, a review is exactly what the government decided on before taking on Ofwat.  Month after month, they were asked if they believed the water industry regulator was fit for purpose despite the obvious disintegration on their watch. Every time the answer was 'yes'.  As in so many areas of government, Labour, instead of acting, needed someone else to make the decision for them, meaning that it has taken over a year to come to the simple conclusion that the regulator is in fact, not fit for purpose. As they enter their second year in office, maybe this can provide a lesson they desperately need to learn if they want to turn around their fortunes. That bold decisions do not require months of review, endless consultations, or outside experts to endlessly analyse the problem.  They just need to get on with it. Voters will thank them. Sir Jon has said the water industry requires long-term strategic planning and stability in order to make it attractive to \"low-risk, low-return investors\". The water industry has long complained that the current model, in which companies are benchmarked against a notional model operator, and penalised for failing to hit financial and environmental standards, risks a \"doom loop\". Thames Water, currently battling to complete an equity process to avoid falling into special administration, has said the imposition of huge fines for failing to meet pollution standards is one of the reasons it is in financial distress. Publication of the Independent Commission report comes after the Environment Agency published figures showing that serious pollution incidents increased by 60% in 2024, and as Thames Water imposes a hosepipe ban on 15m customers. Ofwat, Water UK and the Department for the Environment all declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          Home editor\n              @JasonFarrellSky\n  Maria's treatment by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was so shocking the chief constable described it as \"undefendable\".  Warning: This story includes graphic descriptions of strip searches and references to domestic violence. Yet a year after a high-profile inquiry found she had been \"unlawfully\" arrested and strip-searched, Maria now has a criminal conviction for the crime the inquiry said she should never have been arrested for. The Baird Inquiry - named after its lead Dame Vera Baird - into GMP, published a year ago, found that the force made numerous unlawful arrests and unlawful strip searches on vulnerable women. A year on, the review has led to major changes in police processes. Strip searches for welfare purposes, where the person is deemed at risk of harming themselves, are banned, and the mayor's office told Sky News only one woman was intimately strip-searched to look for a concealed item by GMP last year. Women had previously told Sky News the practice was being used by police \"as a power trip\" or \"for the police to get their kicks\". However, several women who gave evidence to the Baird Inquiry have told Sky News they feel let down and are still fighting for accountability and to get their complaints through the bureaucracy of a painfully slow system. The case of Maria (not her real name) perhaps best illustrates how despite an inquiry pointing out her \"terrible treatment\", she continues to face the consequences of what the police did. 'Treated like a piece of meat' The story begins with an act of poor service. A victim of domestic violence, Maria went to the police to get keys off her arrested partner but was made to wait outside for five-and-a-half hours. The Baird Inquiry said: \"This domestic abuse victim, alone in a strange city, made 14 calls for police to help her. \"She was repeatedly told that someone would contact her, but nobody did. The pattern didn't change, hour after hour, until eventually she rang, sobbing and angry.\" The police then arrested her for malicious communications, saying she'd sworn at staff on the phone. Inside the police station, officers strip-searched her because they thought she was concealing a vape. Maria told Sky News she was \"treated like a piece of meat\". The Baird Inquiry says of the demeaning humiliation: \"Maria describes being told to take all her clothes off and, when completely naked, to open the lips of her vagina so the police could see inside and to bend over and open her anal area similarly.\" After the inquiry found all this not only \"terrible\" but \"unlawful\", Chief Constable Stephen Watson described the actions of his officers towards Maria as \"an inexplicable and undefendable exercise of police power\". He added: \"We've done the wrong thing, in the wrong way and we've created harm where harm already existed.\" Despite all of this, the charges of malicious communication were not dropped. They hung over Maria since her arrest in May 2023. Then in March this year, magistrates convicted her of the offence, and she was fined. Dame Vera's report describes the arrest for malicious communications as \"pointless\", \"unlawful\", \"not in the public interest\" and questions whether the officer had taken \"a dislike to Maria\". Yet, while Maria gained a criminal record, no officer has been disciplined over her treatment. A GMP spokesperson said: \"The court has tested the evidence for the matter that Maria was arrested for, and we note the outcome by the magistrate. We have a separate investigation into complaints made about the defendant's arrest and her treatment whilst in police custody.\" The complaint was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in August 2023 and Maria was told several months ago the report was completed, but she has not heard anything since. 'There's been no accountability' Dame Vera's report also catalogues the \"unlawful\" arrest and strip search of Dannika Stewart in October 2023 at the same police station. Dannika is still grinding through the police complaints service to get a formal acknowledgement of their failings. She told Sky News: \"Everyone involved in it is still in the same position. There's been no accountability from the police. We're still fighting the complaint system, we're still trying to prove something which has already been proved by an independent inquiry.\" Asked if anyone had been disciplined, Chief Constable Watson told Sky News: \"There are ongoing investigations into individual failings, but for the most part the Baird review talked about systemic failings of leadership, it talked of failings in policy and failings of systems. \"In some cases, those people who may have misconducted themselves at the level of professional standards have retired. There are no criminal proceedings in respect of any individual.\" He added: \"Every single element of the Baird inquiry has been taken on board - every single one of those recommendations has been implemented - we believe ourselves to be at the forefront of practice.\" 'It's been three years' Mark Dove who was also found by the inquiry to have been unlawfully arrested three times and twice unlawfully stripped-searched says he's been in the complaints system for three years now. He told Sky News: \"There have been improvements in that I'm being informed more, but ultimately there's no timeline. It's been three years, and I have to keep pushing them. And I've not heard of anyone being suspended.\" Sophie (not her real name), a domestic violence victim who was also found by the review team to have been unlawfully arrested by GMP, told Sky News that although most of her complaints were eventually upheld they had originally been dismissed and no officer has faced any consequences. She said: \"They put on record that I'd accepted a caution when I hadn't - and then tried to prosecute me. Why has no one been disciplined? These are people's lives. I could have lost my job. Where is the accountability?\" Since the Baird Inquiry, every strip search by GMP is now reviewed by a compliance team. GMP also provides all female suspects in custody with dignity packs including sanitary products, and they work with the College of Policing to ensure all officers are trained to recognise and respond to the effects of domestic and sexual trauma on survivors. The deputy mayor for Greater Manchester for policing and crime, Kate Green, says the lessons of the Baird Inquiry should reach all police forces. She said: \"I would strongly recommend that other forces, if they don't already follow GMP's practise in not conducting so-called welfare strip searches, similarly cease to carry out those searches. It's very difficult to see how a traumatising search can be good for anybody's welfare, either the officers or the detainees. We've managed to do that now for well over a year.\" Ms Green also suggests a national review of the police complaints system. Read more:Inquiry prompted by Sky news' investigationWhat Baird Inquiry revealed Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of GMP, said: \"Our reformed Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) has increased the quality of complaints handling and improved timeliness. \"Where officers have been found to breach our standards then we have not hesitated to remove them from GMP, with more than 100 officers being dismissed on the chief constable's watch. \"Out of 14 complaints relating to Dame Vera's report, four have been completed. Our PSD continues to review and investigate the other complaints. \"We're committed to being held to account for our use of arrests and our performance in custody. \"By its nature, custody has - and always will be - a challenging environment. \"However, basic provisions and processes must always be met and, while we're confident our progress is being recognised across policing, we stand ready to act on feedback.\""

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said \"a number of individuals\" have presented with symptoms such as breathing difficulties after having cosmetic procedures involving botulinum toxin, which is best known by the brand name Botox. Investigations so far suggest the use of an unlicensed Botox-like product, the agency added. It is understood the practitioners involved are cooperating with the investigation and no longer offering the injections. The latest cases relate to procedures carried out in the East of England and the East Midlands, and do not relate to recent diagnoses in the North East. A total of 38 cases of iatrogenic botulism have been reported in the UK between 4 June and 14 July.

Dr Gauri Godbole, consultant medical microbiologist at UKHSA, said: \"Botulism related to aesthetic procedures is rare, but it can be serious. \"It is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. These toxins (but not the bacteria) are the active ingredient in Botox and similar products.\" \"Symptoms of botulism can take up to four weeks to develop,\" she added. They include drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, facial muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech and breathing difficulties. Anyone who has had a recent botulinum toxin treatment and is experiencing symptoms should contact NHS 111 for further advice. Treatments, including the use of an anti-toxin, should be administered in hospital, the NHS website states.

        "Content": "\n          Special correspondent\n              @AlexCrawfordSky\n  The Syrian presidency has announced it's assembling a special taskforce to try to stop nearly a week of sectarian clashes in the southern Druze city of Sweida. The presidency called for restraint on all sides and said it is making strenuous efforts to \"stop the fighting and curb the violations that threaten the security of the citizens and the safety of society\". By early Saturday morning, a ceasefire had been confirmed by the US special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, who posted on X that Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to a ceasefire supported by US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The post went on to state that this agreement had the support of \"Turkey, Jordan and its neighbours\" and called upon the Druze, Bedouins, and Sunni factions to put down their arms.  Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford reports from the road leading to Sweida, the city that has become the epicentre of Syria's sectarian violence. For the past 24 hours, we've watched as Syria's multiple Arab tribes began mobilising in the Sweida province to help defend their Bedouin brethren. Thousands travelled from multiple different Syrian areas and had reached the edge of Sweida city by Friday nightfall after a day of almost non-stop violent clashes and killings. \n                  Israel and Syria agree to ceasefire, says US ambassador to Turkey, after 'hundreds' killed in clashes\n                 \n                  Syria's president vows to protect Druze population after Israel airstrikes - as new ceasefire begins\n                 \n                  Why has Trump just called his own supporters 'stupid'?\n                 \"We have come to protect the [Arab] Bedouin women and children who are being terrorised by the Druze,\" they told us. Every shop and every home in the streets leading up to Sweida city has been burned or ransacked, the contents destroyed or looted. We saw tribal fighters loading the back of pickup trucks and driving away from the city with vehicles packed with looted goods from Druze homes. Several videos posted online showed violence against the Druze, including one where tribal fighters force three men to throw themselves off a high-rise balcony and are seen being shot as they do so. Doctors at the nearby community hospital in Buser al Harir said there had been a constant stream of casualties being brought in. As we watched, another dead fighter was carried out of an ambulance. The medics estimated there had been more than 600 dead in their area alone. \"The youngest child who was killed was a one-and-a-half-year-old baby,\" one doctor told us. The violence is the most dangerous outbreak of sectarian clashes since the fall of the Bashar al Assad regime last December - and the most serious challenge for the new leader to navigate. The newly brokered deal is aimed at ending the sectarian killings and restoring some sort of stability in a country which is emerging from more than a decade of civil war."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, two Wall Street Journal reporters and the publication's owner, News Corp. The US president has accused the named individuals of defamation, claiming they acted with malicious intent and caused him overwhelming financial and reputational harm. The lawsuit, which was filed in Miami, seeks at least $10bn (Â£7.5bn) in damages. In a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump called the lawsuit \"historic legal action\" which he said was filed on behalf of himself and all Americans who will \"no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media\". \"I hope Rupert and his 'friends' are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case,\" he wrote. It comes after Mr Trump claimed that a letter he allegedly wrote to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was \"fake\" and said he would sue the \"ass off\" Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which first published the story. The publication had said Mr Trump wrote the letter as part of a collection Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, planned to give him as a 50th birthday present in 2003. It claimed the message, allegedly from Mr Trump, featured several lines of typewritten text, concluding with: \"May every day be another wonderful secret.\" The text was framed by what appeared to be a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, the WSJ claimed. The letter is also said to have featured the signature \"Donald\". Mr Trump immediately denied writing the letter when the WSJ report was published on Thursday night.  \"The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.\" Mr Trump ignored questions about Epstein as he signed a cryptocurrency bill at the White House earlier on Friday. The president's lawsuit comes as the US government filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein, who took his own life while awaiting trial in 2019. In a Manhattan federal court filing, the Department of Justice said the criminal cases against Epstein and Maxwell are a matter of public interest, justifying the release of associated grand jury transcripts. Earlier on Friday, Mr Trump said attorney general Pam Bondi had been asked to release the transcripts because of \"the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein\". ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ The justice department previously said it had around 200 documents relating to Epstein and that the FBI had thousands more. It is unknown how much of this is grand jury testimony, which is typically kept secret under US law.

Mr Trump pledged to release files on Epstein during his presidential campaign, as his MAGA movement accused the Biden administration of suppressing the extent of Epstein's paedophilia, predatory behaviour and his so-called \"client list\" - thought to contain names of the rich and famous who conspired with him in his child sex trafficking operation. But after a review of the evidence the US government has, the Justice Department recently determined that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted\". Venezuela releases jailed Americans in prisoner swap  The Trump administration said on Friday that it had negotiated an exchange with Venezuela, resulting in the release of 10 jailed Americans. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the prisoners, who had been held in the South American country, were \"on their way to freedom\". In return, 252 Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador have been freed, the Venezuelan government said. They had been held in the notorious maximum security CECOT prison after being deported by the US."

        "Content": " At least three people have been killed after a \"horrific incident\" at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility, officials have said.  A spokesperson for the department said there was an explosion at the Biscailuz Center Academy Training in east LA. The incident was reported at around 7.30am local time (3.30pm UK time). Aerial footage from local channel KABC-TV suggests the blast happened in a parking lot filled with sheriff patrol cars and box trucks. A law enforcement official briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press an investigation is looking into whether the incident was a training accident. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that the arson and explosives team undergoes in-depth training, and the deputies had served 19, 22 and 33 years in the department. He added: \"They have years of training. They are fantastic experts and, unfortunately, I lost three of them today.\" \n                  'It's a war': Meet the volunteers leading the fight against Trump's immigration raids\n                 \n                  Farmer becomes first person to die during Trump's ICE raids\n                 \n                  California: Seven missing after explosion at fireworks warehouse in California \n                 The county sheriff then said the incident marked the department's worst loss of life in a single incident since 1857, when four officers were killed by gunfire. He also noted that he could not release the deputies' names because he had yet to speak to one of the families. Attorney general Pam Bondi wrote on X: \"I just spoke to @USAttyEssayli about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles. \"Our federal agents are at the scene and we are working to learn more.\" California congressman Jimmy Sanchez also sent his \"condolences to the families and everyone impacted by this loss\". Several law enforcement sources told Sky's US partner network NBC News two devices were moved to the training centre overnight. They said one of the devices then exploded on Friday morning, killing three and injuring a sergeant. According to the law enforcement sources, investigators are trying to determine why they were moved and whether they could have been made safe at the scene or handled more securely in a bomb-proof container. Later, the attorney general said in a follow-up post that agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are \"on the ground to support\". Arson investigators from the Los Angeles Fire Department and members of the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad were also assisting the investigation at the training facility, the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said in a post on X. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said he has been briefed on the incident. \"The Governor's Office of Emergency Services is in contact with the Sheriff's Department and closely monitoring the situation, and has offered full state assistance,\" it added."

Police said they had intelligence that phones smuggled into prisons allowed those involved in the plot to plan to target senior police officers, members of the judiciary and employees at the state prosecution office. At a press conference on Friday, police commissioner Allister Guevarro said: \"They were planning, actively so, to carry out assassinations, robberies, and kidnappings.\" He said the intelligence report prompted him to recommend that newly elected Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar declare the emergency. He noted there were no particular threats to any politicians. It's the second state of emergency declared in Trinidad and Tobago in a year - authorities cited concerns about gang violence in that declaration, which lasted from December to April. Under a state of emergency, police can conduct searches and make arrests without a warrant. A curfew has not been put into effect.

Mr Trump pledged to release files on Epstein during his presidential campaign, as his MAGA movement accused the Biden administration of suppressing the extent of Epstein's paedophilia, predatory behaviour and his so-called \"client list\" - thought to contain names of the rich and famous who conspired with him in his child sex trafficking operation. But after a review of the evidence the US government has, the Justice Department recently determined that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted\". Venezuela releases jailed Americans in prisoner swap  The Trump administration said on Friday that it had negotiated an exchange with Venezuela, resulting in the release of 10 jailed Americans. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the prisoners, who had been held in the South American country, were \"on their way to freedom\". In return, 252 Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador have been freed, the Venezuelan government said.

        "Content": "Donald Trump has called an alleged letter he wrote to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein \"fake\" and said he will sue the \"ass off\" Rupert Murdoch, who owns the paper that first published the claim. In multiple posts on Truth Social, the US president accused The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of fabricating the letter that it claimed was written by Mr Trump as part of a collection of letters addressed to Epstein that his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell planned to give him as a birthday present in 2003. Follow latest: Trump and Epstein updates According to documents seen by the WSJ, Mr Trump's letter featured several lines of typewritten text framed by what appeared to be a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman. The paper said the letter concludes \"Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret\", and featured the signature \"Donald\", allegedly drawn across the woman's waist, meant to mimic the appearance of pubic hair. Responding to the WSJ's claims, Mr Trump wrote: \"The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures. \"I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DJT.\" He said earlier he would also sue the WSJ and News Corp, which Mr Murdoch owns. The WSJ is published by News Corp subsidiary company, Dow Jones & Co.  The Justice Department has not responded to the WSJ and the FBI declined to comment. In a separate post, Mr Trump said he has asked the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to release \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony\" in the case of the paedophile financier who was found dead in his Manhattan cell in August 2019, shortly after he was arrested on sex trafficking charges. US correspondent Classy, it's not. Â  The alleged letter sent to Jeffrey Epstein by Donald Trump has a typewritten note inside the hand-drawn outline of a woman. There's a squiggly signature - \"Donald\" - below the waist.Â  It shows friendship, certainly - the dialogue from \"Donald\" to \"Jeffrey\" reads: \"Happy birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret.\" However, it doesn't quite produce definitive proof of impropriety. Â  The Wall Street Journal hasn't produced the document and, until it does, the story's credibility rests on its word. Â  Whether it rests easy will be tested by Team Trump - it was clear last night that prominent MAGA figures were rallying to the president's cause and turning their anger towards the Wall Street Journal - circling the wagons and shooting the messenger. Â  Trump has threatened to sue the Wall Street Journal and has targeted its owner, old friend Rupert Murdoch. \"I'll sue his ass off,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.Â  It's a billionaires' struggle symptomatic of the wider acrimony. Â Trump can pursue Rupert Murdoch through the courts, but the MAGA millions will be more difficult to pin down.Â \n\n Trump supporters who stood behind him as he screamed \"cover-up\" by the so-called \"deep state\".  They stand before him now, let down. \n\n  Donald Trump has authorised his attorney-general Pam Bondi to release grand jury testimony in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation - it's something, but it's far short of everything. He is the man who did more than most to bake conspiracy theory into US political culture, so he can hardly complain it turns on him.Â  It has, and how.   The release of any documents, Mr Trump said, would be subject to approval by a court. The justice department has previously said it had around 200 documents relating to Epstein and that the FBI had thousands more. It is unknown how much of this is grand jury testimony - which is typically kept secret under US law. Ms Bondi responded to the president on X, writing: \"President Trump-we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Elon Musk, who claimed last month that Mr Trump appears in the Epstein files, was surprisingly among the first to come to the president's defence over the WSJ claims. \"It really doesn't sound like something Trump would say tbh,\" the tech billionaire wrote on X, before going on to ask where the evidence against Epstein allegedly held by the FBI had gone. The Trump administration has come under criticism after the president appeared to U-turn on his own promise to release more information about the Epstein case publicly. In the run-up to the US election last year, Mr Trump drew on rumours and conspiracy theories that appeared to accuse the Biden administration of suppressing the extent of Epstein's paedophilia, predatory behaviour and his so-called \"client list\" - thought to contain names of the rich and famous who conspired with him in a child sex trafficking operation. Ms Bondi fuelled these rumours in February by telling Fox News that the alleged Epstein client list was \"sitting on my desk right now to review\". Read more:Ghislaine Maxwell could challenge imprisonmentWhy is Trump fighting with MAGA over Epstein?The huge impact of Musk's row with Trump In the same month, the justice department released some government documents regarding the case, but there were no new revelations. After a months-long review of additional evidence, the department earlier this month released a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself, but said no other files related to the case would be made public. The decision was criticised by many in Mr Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, who Mr Trump later called \"weaklings\". Sky News has contacted the White House for further comment."

        "Content": " At least three people have been killed after a \"horrific incident\" at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility, officials have said.  A spokesperson for the department said there was an explosion at the Biscailuz Center Academy Training in east LA. The incident was reported at around 7.30am local time (3.30pm UK time). Aerial footage from local channel KABC-TV suggests the blast happened in a parking lot filled with sheriff patrol cars and box trucks. A law enforcement official briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press an investigation is looking into whether the incident was a training accident. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that the arson and explosives team undergoes in-depth training, and the deputies had served 19, 22 and 33 years in the department. He added: \"They have years of training. They are fantastic experts and, unfortunately, I lost three of them today.\" \n                  'It's a war': Meet the volunteers leading the fight against Trump's immigration raids\n                 \n                  Farmer becomes first person to die during Trump's ICE raids\n                 \n                  California: Seven missing after explosion at fireworks warehouse in California \n                 The county sheriff then said the incident marked the department's worst loss of life in a single incident since 1857, when four officers were killed by gunfire. He also noted that he could not release the deputies' names because he had yet to speak to one of the families. Attorney general Pam Bondi wrote on X: \"I just spoke to @USAttyEssayli about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles. \"Our federal agents are at the scene and we are working to learn more.\" California congressman Jimmy Sanchez also sent his \"condolences to the families and everyone impacted by this loss\". Several law enforcement sources told Sky's US partner network NBC News two devices were moved to the training centre overnight. They said one of the devices then exploded on Friday morning, killing three and injuring a sergeant. According to the law enforcement sources, investigators are trying to determine why they were moved and whether they could have been made safe at the scene or handled more securely in a bomb-proof container. Later, the attorney general said in a follow-up post that agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are \"on the ground to support\". Arson investigators from the Los Angeles Fire Department and members of the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad were also assisting the investigation at the training facility, the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said in a post on X. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said he has been briefed on the incident. \"The Governor's Office of Emergency Services is in contact with the Sheriff's Department and closely monitoring the situation, and has offered full state assistance,\" it added."

There is now-infamous NBC News archive footage of the pair socialising in November 1992 at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, with the now-president appearing to point out women on the dance floor.  In a 2002 interview with New York magazine, Mr Trump was quoted saying: \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. \"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\" Allegations that Epstein had been sexually abusing girls became public in 2006 and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal. He was then arrested for a second time in 2019 and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy.  Trump was asked about his relationship with Epstein after he was found dead in his cell, and he played down the extent of their relationship. He said he \"knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\", but added: \"I had a falling out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.\" Asked why the pair fell out, Mr Trump said: \"The reason doesn't make any difference, frankly,\" and added that he had \"no idea\" about Epstein's crimes. Trump flew on Epstein's plane numerous times  Epstein owned an island in the Caribbean, a location where he is known to have taken underage girls to abuse them. He had a private plane which he flew acquaintances in, and some of the flight logs have been released to the public.  ðŸ‘‰ Follow Trump100 on your podcast app ðŸ‘ˆ Amid speculation in January last year, Mr Trump said on social media: \"I was never on Epstein's Plane, or at his 'stupid' Island.\" But the flight logs indicated he flew on Epstein's plane at least seven times. There is no suggestion that Mr Trump was flown to the island. The logs indicate that on one of the trips between New York and Florida he was accompanied by his then-wife Marla Maples and their daughter, Tiffany, and another listed his son Eric as a passenger. Court documents name Trump Court documents relating to Ghislaine Maxwell, her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and alleged victims of sexual abuse were unsealed in January last year. The documents, which were part of a 2015 defamation case by Virginia Giuffre against Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, named Mr Trump, along with the likes of Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton.  A woman named Johanna Sjoberg gave testimony and said that while flying to Manhattan with Epstein, Maxwell, Ms Giuffre and Prince Andrew, the financier's jet was diverted to Atlantic City, New Jersey - where Epstein suggested going to one of Mr Trump's casinos. \"The pilots told me to go back and tell [Epstein] that we can't land in New York and that we were going to have to land in Atlantic City,\" she said. \"Jeffrey said, 'Great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to' - I don't recall the name of the casino, but - 'we'll go to the casino'.\" She said she spent several hours with Epstein at a Trump casino but did not say if she met him. Mr Trump was not accused of any wrongdoing. Birthday letter from Trump to Epstein  The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claims it has seen a letter written by Mr Trump as part of a collection of letters addressed to Epstein that his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell planned to give him as a birthday present in 2003. According to documents seen by the WSJ, Mr Trump's letter featured several lines of typewritten text framed by what appeared to be a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman.

Mr Trump denied he wrote it in an interview with the WSJ prior to publication. \"This is not me. This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story,\" he said. \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,\" he said. \"It's not my language. It's not my words.\" Later, Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures.\" In 2017, Mr Trump drew a picture of the Empire State Building which sold at auction for $16,000 (Â£11,892). His Truth Social post continued: \"I told Rupert Murdoch [WSJ's owner] it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DJT.\" Falling out Any friendship that existed between Mr Trump and Epstein in the 1990s is said to have turned sour in the early 2000s. The New York Times reports that the pair fell out in 2004 over a foreclosed oceanfront Palm Beach mansion that Mr Trump outbid Epstein for. In 2006 Epstein was indicted as part of an FBI and Florida police investigation. Two years later he pleaded guilty in state court to two felony charges, including soliciting a minor, as part of a plea deal that avoided federal charges that would have meant far more serious prison time. There is little public record of Mr Trump and Epstein crossing paths from 2004 onwards. In 2019 Mr Trump said that he and Epstein had had a \"falling out\" and hadn't spoken for 15 years."

While Ofwat is the economic regulator, the Environment Agency has responsibility for setting pollution standards, alongside the Drinking Water Inspectorate. \n                  Why has there been a surge in water pollution? \n                 \n                  Prince William has had a lot to say this week - but is anyone listening?\n                 \n                  Water cremation and human composting could be offered instead of traditional funerals\n                 Sir Jon's final report is expected to include a recommendation that the government consider a new regulator that combines Ofwat's economic regulatory powers with the water-facing responsibilities currently managed by the EA. In his interim report, Sir Jon said options for reform ranged from \"rationalising\" existing regulation to \"fundamental, structural options for integrating regulatory remits and functions\". He is understood to have discussed the implications of fundamental reform with senior figures in industry and government in the last week as he finalised his report. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals following publication of the commission report. The commission is also expected to recommend a \"major shift\" in the model of economic regulation, which currently relies on econometric modelling, to a supervisory approach that takes more account of individual company circumstances. Read more from Sky News: Police taking no further action over Kneecap's Glastonbury showNew fee for Britons travelling to EU will cost more than expected Political correspondent On Monday, the government's long-awaited review into the UK's water industry will finally report.  The expectation is that it will recommend sweeping changes - including the abolition of the regulator, Ofwat.  But frustrated customers of the water companies could rightly complain that the process of taking on this failing sector and its regulator has been slow and ineffective.  They may be forgiven for going further and suggesting that how Labour has dealt with water is symbolic of their inability to make an impact across many areas of public life, leaving many of their voters disappointed.  This is an industry that has been visibly and rapidly declining for decades, with the illegal sewage dumping and rotting pipes in stark contrast with the vast salaries and bonuses paid out to their executives.   It doesn't take a review to see what's gone wrong. Most informed members of the public could explain what has happened in a matter of minutes. And yet, despite 14 years in opposition with plenty of time to put together a radical plan, a review is exactly what the government decided on before taking on Ofwat.  Month after month, they were asked if they believed the water industry regulator was fit for purpose despite the obvious disintegration on their watch. Every time the answer was 'yes'.  As in so many areas of government, Labour, instead of acting, needed someone else to make the decision for them, meaning that it has taken over a year to come to the simple conclusion that the regulator is in fact, not fit for purpose. As they enter their second year in office, maybe this can provide a lesson they desperately need to learn if they want to turn around their fortunes. That bold decisions do not require months of review, endless consultations, or outside experts to endlessly analyse the problem.  They just need to get on with it. Voters will thank them. Sir Jon has said the water industry requires long-term strategic planning and stability in order to make it attractive to \"low-risk, low-return investors\". The water industry has long complained that the current model, in which companies are benchmarked against a notional model operator, and penalised for failing to hit financial and environmental standards, risks a \"doom loop\". Thames Water, currently battling to complete an equity process to avoid falling into special administration, has said the imposition of huge fines for failing to meet pollution standards is one of the reasons it is in financial distress. Publication of the Independent Commission report comes after the Environment Agency published figures showing that serious pollution incidents increased by 60% in 2024, and as Thames Water imposes a hosepipe ban on 15m customers. Ofwat, Water UK and the Department for the Environment all declined to comment."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @SkyNewsAdele\n  The first Post Office Capture conviction is to be sent to the Court of Appeal, Sky News understands, in a \"breakthrough\" moment in the IT scandal. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has decided to refer the case of sub-postmistress Patricia Owen, who was convicted in 1998 of theft. Mrs Owen was found guilty by a jury based on evidence from the faulty IT software Capture, which was used in 2,500 branches between 1992 and 1999, before the Horizon Post Office scandal. It comes after Sky News revealed that a damning report into Capture, which could help overturn criminal convictions, had been unearthed after nearly 30 years. The decision to refer the first-ever Capture case to the Court of Appeal has been made on the grounds that Mrs Owen's prosecution was an \"abuse of process\". The development has been described by victims' lawyer Neil Hudgell as \"hugely pivotal\". \"The Court of Appeal don't receive that many referrals that start at the CCRC, and most get turned away, so it's a very high bar to even get cases from the CCRC to the Court of Appealâ€¦\" \"I think it will be a real shot in the arm to all the other Capture victims who are waiting for their cases to be determined by the CCRC.\" Mr Hudgell described the report found earlier this year - written by computer experts in 1998 and highly critical of Capture - as \"significantly tipping the balance\". Sky News found that the Post Office knew about the report at the time and continued to prosecute sub-postmasters based on Capture evidence. Mrs Owen always maintained her innocence but died in 2003 with a criminal record before the wider Post Office scandal came to light. Her daughter Juliet Shardlow said she cried when she heard the news that her mother's case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. \"I feel angry that she is not here because she died before her timeâ€¦ we will be there - we will be sitting there in that front row. \"I can't put it into words because it's still all a shock that we are where we are and that later this year, or next year, we might have what we set out to getâ€¦ justice for her.\" Read more from Sky News:Child dies after coach crashes on way back from school tripWoman handed criminal conviction despite 'unlawful' strip search by police The CCRC is currently investigating 30 cases potentially related to the Capture software system. Twenty-seven of those cases are now assigned to case review managers and under \"active review\", with a further three cases in the preparatory stages. The CCRC has described a \"challenge\" over determining \"whether cases involved the use of Capture at the time of the alleged offences\". Dame Vera Baird, chair of the CCRC, told Sky News that Mrs Owen's \"could be a touchstone case\" and if her conviction is quashed, it would \"obviously speed up others that are in the pipeline\". In a letter written to Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, and seen by Sky News, it said that information the Post Office has provided \"does not, in most cases, show whether it was installed and in operation at the time of the alleged offending\". It also mentioned that the Post Office is reviewing \"a significant amount of data which may contain further information\". A Post Office spokesperson said: \"While it is not appropriate for us to comment on specific cases, we have been very concerned about the reported problems relating to the use of the Capture software, and we are sincerely sorry for past failings that have caused suffering to postmasters. \"We are determined that past wrongs are put right and continue to support the government's work in this area as well as fully co-operate with the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The number of most serious water pollution incidents rose by 60% last year, according to data covering England, with three companies responsible for the bulk of them. The Environment Agency (EA) - under fire for its own oversight of water firms' pollution performance - said that more than 80% of the 75 instances of pollution in its two most serious categories were the responsibility of Thames Water (33), Southern Water (15) and Yorkshire Water (13). But the body added it had found \"consistently poor performance\" across all nine water and wastewater firms in the country - a similar summary to that of 2023. Money latest: Who big mortgage changes could help most According to the report, reasons behind the 2024 results included persistent underinvestment in new infrastructure, poor asset maintenance, and reduced resilience due to the impacts of climate change. The period was dominated by spells of intense rainfall, which overwhelmed storm overflows and resulted in sewage discharges. The EA reported 2,801 pollution incidents in total during 2024 - a hike of almost a third. Thames Water, which has almost 16 million households on its books and is struggling to shore up its very future, was fined a record Â£105m by the regulator Ofwat in May for breaching wastewater rules. Fast-forward to 2025 and England is experiencing its driest start to the year since 1976.  Hosepipe bans are expanding as drought conditions are declared. The data was released as a committee of MPs called for regulation of water companies to face a \"complete overhaul\" amid a lack of public trust and anger over surging bills to pay for long overdue infrastructure improvements. The Public Accounts Committee said that Ofwat and the EA had failed to secure industry compliance and warned that even the high bill settlements to 2030 would only result in 44% of sewage overflows being overhauled.  The Independent Water Commission, established by the government last year and led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, is due to make final recommendations on the regulatory framework next week. He warned when the interim report was published last month: \"There is no simple, single change, no matter how radical, that will deliver the fundamental reset that is needed for the water sector.\" Water companies believe it is not just their behaviour which requires attention. The sector argued its efforts to stem pollution spills would be greatly enhanced by households and businesses disposing of waste correctly. Firms complain that wet wipes and grease, being disposed of through toilets and sinks respectively, are the main cause of blockages in the waste system. Science and technology editor After years of protest, promised action, and bill increases, it would be reasonable to expect the sewage scandal to have improved.  In fact, it's done the complete opposite: A 60% increase in pollution incidents between 2023 and 2024.\n Water firms admit they're not doing well enough, but point out, correctly, that 2024 was a wet year. Wet weather means a greater likelihood of sewage spills from pipes that carry both rainfall and sewage. Environment Agency data reveals that the excuse doesn't wash.\n\n Serious pollution incidents are up 30% since 2016. And this is the third consecutive year in which they've increased. Their latest report reaffirms what we already know: Persistent underinvestment and poor asset maintenance are why the sewage system can't cope.\n\n Read Tom's full analysis here Alan Lovell, the EA's chair, said of its findings: \"This report demonstrates continued systemic failure by some companies to meet their environmental targets. \"The water industry must act urgently to prevent pollution from occurring and to respond rapidly when it does. \"We have made significant changes to tighten our regulation of the water industry and ensure companies are held to account. \"With a dedicated larger workforce and increased funding, our officers are uncovering and acting on failures to comply with environmental law.\" A spokesperson for industry group Water UK responded: \"While there have been some improvements it is clear that the performance of some companies is not good enough. The Environment Agency is right to highlight underinvestment in infrastructure and maintenance as the major causes of these results. \"Investment in the sector has been suppressed with Ofwat prioritising short -term cuts to people's water bills over the long-term resilience of the network. This is finally being put right, with a record Â£104bn investment over the next 5-years to secure our water supplies, support economic growth and end sewage entering our rivers and seas. \"However, fundamental change to regulation is also needed. We hope that the recommendations of the Independent Water Commission next week will ensure the sector continues to get the investment it needs to drive down pollution incidents.\""

A spokesperson for the Speaker said he was \"himself under a super-injunction\" and so \"would have been under severe legal restrictions\". A massive data breach by the British military that was only made public this week exposed the personal information of close to 20,000 Afghan individuals, endangering them and their families. Successive governments tried to keep the leak secret with a super-injunction, meaning the UK only informed everyone affected on Tuesday - three-and-a-half years after their data was compromised. The breach occurred in February 2022, when Boris Johnson was prime minister, but was only discovered by the British military in August 2023.

Some 6,900 Afghans - comprising 1,500 people named on the list as well as their dependents - are being relocated to the UK as part of this programme. Dame Harriet said: \"The Speaker was warned, 'If somebody's going to say something which breaches this injunction, will you please shut them up straight away if an MP does this', and he agreed to do that. \"But what he should have done at the time is he should have said, but parliamentary accountability is important. I'm the Speaker. I'm going to stand up for parliamentary accountability.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n  An independent review of the water industry is to recommend sweeping changes to the way the sector is managed, including the potential replacement of Ofwat with a strengthened body combining economic and environmental regulation. Former Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe will publish the findings of the Independent Water Commission on Monday, with stakeholders across the industry expecting significant changes to regulation to be at its heart. The existing regulator Ofwat has been under fire from all sides in recent years amid rising public anger at levels of pollution and the financial management of water companies. Read more:Serious water pollution incidents in England up 60% last yearWhy has there been a surge in water pollution? Campaigners and politicians have accused Ofwat of failing to hold water operators to account, while the companies complain that its focus on keeping bills down has prevented appropriate investment in infrastructure. In an interim report, published in June, Sir Jon identified the presence of multiple regulators with overlapping responsibilities as a key issue facing the industry. While Ofwat is the economic regulator, the Environment Agency has responsibility for setting pollution standards, alongside the Drinking Water Inspectorate. \n                  Why has there been a surge in water pollution? \n                 \n                  Prince William has had a lot to say this week - but is anyone listening?\n                 \n                  Water cremation and human composting could be offered instead of traditional funerals\n                 Sir Jon's final report is expected to include a recommendation that the government consider a new regulator that combines Ofwat's economic regulatory powers with the water-facing responsibilities currently managed by the EA. In his interim report, Sir Jon said options for reform ranged from \"rationalising\" existing regulation to \"fundamental, structural options for integrating regulatory remits and functions\". He is understood to have discussed the implications of fundamental reform with senior figures in industry and government in the last week as he finalised his report. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals following publication of the commission report. The commission is also expected to recommend a \"major shift\" in the model of economic regulation, which currently relies on econometric modelling, to a supervisory approach that takes more account of individual company circumstances. Read more from Sky News: Police taking no further action over Kneecap's Glastonbury showNew fee for Britons travelling to EU will cost more than expected Political correspondent On Monday, the government's long-awaited review into the UK's water industry will finally report.  The expectation is that it will recommend sweeping changes - including the abolition of the regulator, Ofwat.  But frustrated customers of the water companies could rightly complain that the process of taking on this failing sector and its regulator has been slow and ineffective.  They may be forgiven for going further and suggesting that how Labour has dealt with water is symbolic of their inability to make an impact across many areas of public life, leaving many of their voters disappointed.  This is an industry that has been visibly and rapidly declining for decades, with the illegal sewage dumping and rotting pipes in stark contrast with the vast salaries and bonuses paid out to their executives.   It doesn't take a review to see what's gone wrong. Most informed members of the public could explain what has happened in a matter of minutes. And yet, despite 14 years in opposition with plenty of time to put together a radical plan, a review is exactly what the government decided on before taking on Ofwat.  Month after month, they were asked if they believed the water industry regulator was fit for purpose despite the obvious disintegration on their watch. Every time the answer was 'yes'.  As in so many areas of government, Labour, instead of acting, needed someone else to make the decision for them, meaning that it has taken over a year to come to the simple conclusion that the regulator is in fact, not fit for purpose. As they enter their second year in office, maybe this can provide a lesson they desperately need to learn if they want to turn around their fortunes. That bold decisions do not require months of review, endless consultations, or outside experts to endlessly analyse the problem.  They just need to get on with it. Voters will thank them. Sir Jon has said the water industry requires long-term strategic planning and stability in order to make it attractive to \"low-risk, low-return investors\". The water industry has long complained that the current model, in which companies are benchmarked against a notional model operator, and penalised for failing to hit financial and environmental standards, risks a \"doom loop\". Thames Water, currently battling to complete an equity process to avoid falling into special administration, has said the imposition of huge fines for failing to meet pollution standards is one of the reasons it is in financial distress. Publication of the Independent Commission report comes after the Environment Agency published figures showing that serious pollution incidents increased by 60% in 2024, and as Thames Water imposes a hosepipe ban on 15m customers. Ofwat, Water UK and the Department for the Environment all declined to comment."

The ice was retrieved from depths of up to 2,800 metres at Little Dome C in East Antarctica as part of an international effort to \"unlock the deepest secrets of Antarctica's ice\". The ice cores - cylindrical tubes of ancient ice - will be analysed at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in Cambridge, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing up to 1.5 million years of Earth's climate history, significantly extending the current ice core record of 800,000 years.

Water firms admit they're not doing well enough, but point out, correctly, that 2024 was a wet year. Wet weather means a greater likelihood of sewage spills from pipes that carry both rainfall and sewage. Environment Agency data reveals that the excuse doesn't wash.  Serious pollution incidents are up 30% since 2016. And this is the third consecutive year in which they've increased. Their latest report reaffirms what we already know: Persistent underinvestment and poor asset maintenance are why the sewage system can't cope. \n                  Ofwat could be scrapped in water reforms\n                 \n                  Prince William has had a lot to say this week - but is anyone listening?\n                 \n                  Water cremation and human composting could be offered instead of traditional funerals\n                 The share of the problem varies widely from company to company, with United Utilities and Northumbrian Water having the fewest pollution incidents. Then it's Southern, Anglian, and Thames Water, England's largest water firm, topping the pollution pop charts. There was some good-ish news. Transparency seems to be improving almost across the board, with more companies \"self-reporting\" pollution incidents than ever before. It's notable, however, that for the 11 most serious - Category 1 - pollution incidents in 2024, only four were reported by water companies themselves, the other seven by third parties. It's easy, of course, to blame the water companies. But the Independent Water Commission, due to report next week, is expected to call for a radical shake-up of the sector, including the possible dismantling of water regulator Ofwat. The buck, ultimately, rises higher than that before stopping.

Officers said they had investigated \"comments about a forthcoming court case made during Kneecap's performance\" at the festival on 28 June. However, after Crown Prosecution Service advice, they decided there is not enough evidence \"to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence\". The Avon & Somerset force started investigating the Irish group's show last month, as well as comments by punk-rap duo Bob Vylan. It said they were looking at a possible public order incident. Police said on Friday that the investigation into Bob Vylan's performance was ongoing. The London duo were widely criticised - and caused a BBC crisis - after leading on-stage chants of \"death to the IDF\" (Israel Defence Forces). Kneecap posted a photograph on Instagram, which the group said was an email from police announcing the case was being dropped. They said their packed Glastonbury gig was a \"celebration of love and solidarity\" and reporting used \"wildly misleading headlines\". Fears over what Kneecap might do or say during the performance had prompted the BBC not to show it live. The group said: \"Every single person who saw our set knew no law was broken, not even close... yet the police saw fit to publicly announce they were opening an investigation.\" \"There is no public apology, they don't send this to media or post it on police accounts,\" they added.
