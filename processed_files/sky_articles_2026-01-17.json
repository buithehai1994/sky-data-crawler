        "Content": "Donald Trump has sparked a strong backlash after saying he will impose tariffs on eight European countries - including the UK - until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland. The US president said 10% tariffs would come into effect on 1 February for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate would then climb to 25% on 1 June if no deal was in place for \"the complete and total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States, Mr Trump wrote in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday. Trump threatens tariffs over Greenland - as it happened  The US president seems to have acted on his previous warning that he would impose tariffs on countries that do not go along with his plan to acquire the Danish territory. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" for applying tariffs on allies who are \"pursuing the collective security of NATO allies\", adding that he will be \"pursuing\" this with the US administration. \n                  Keir Starmer begins pushback against Trump as president threatens tariffs over Greenland\n                 \n                  Denmark says 'fundamental disagreement' remains with Trump - but agrees to high-level talks over Greenland\n                 \n                  Trump restates desire to take over Greenland, as poll finds most Americans are against it\n                 French President Emmanuel Macron called the threat of tariffs \"unacceptable\" and said if implemented Europe would respond in a coordinated manner. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa said in separate but identical posts on X that the European Union stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. \"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward ​spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,\" they said. Officials from Norway, Sweden, France and Germany reiterated support for Denmark and said tariffs should not be part of Greenland discussions. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" to impose tariffs, adding they would be a \"burden for businesses across our country\". Reform leader Nigel Farage said the tariffs would \"hurt\" the UK, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Trump was \"punishing\" the UK. The European Union has called an emergency meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member countries for Sunday following Mr Trump's announcement. The US president indicated the tariffs were a retaliation after European countries sent military personnel to Greenland in a show of support for the territory. He wrote: \"These countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" So far France has sent as many as 15 personnel to the Danish territory, Germany has sent 13 and the UK has sent one military officer. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hands off' Greenland protests The tariffs were announced the same day thousands of people marched through Copenhagen in support of Greenland in the face of threats from Mr Trump. Demonstrators brandished Danish and Greenlandic flags and signs with slogans including \"Make America Smart Again\" and \"Hands off\" as they marched on Saturday afternoon. Other rallies were planned in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, and elsewhere in the Danish kingdom. \"This is important for the whole world,\" Danish protester Elise Riechie said, as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. \"There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.\" The protests come as a bipartisan US congressional delegation sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support. Delegation leader senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said he wanted to de-escalate the situation and the US had respect for Denmark and NATO \"for all we've done together\". \"I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" Mr Coons said in Copenhagen. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued the US needs to take over Greenland because Russia and China had their own designs on the self-governing territory. The president's comments stood in stark contrast to Mr Coons's remarks on Saturday. Read more:Why does Trump want to take over Greenland?Trump is likely gambling he could get away with Greenland grab \"There are no current security threats to Greenland,\" Mr Coons said. The White House has not ruled out taking Greenland - which has vast untapped reserves of critical minerals - by force. \"There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,\" Mr Coons said. \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\" Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met with US vice president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington. That meeting resulted in an agreement to set up a working group, despite Denmark and the White House offering diverging views on its purpose. Denmark said this week it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in co-operation with allies."

        "Content": "An Iranian rapper who took part in the country's protests has described \"a massacre on the streets\", suggesting foreign forces have been brought in to stamp out the protests. Meraj Tehrani, who lives in the UK, told Sky News' international correspondent Alex Rossi he returned to Iran on business in early January, as demonstrations were erupting across the country. Initially motivated by the country's ailing economy, the demonstrations have grown to challenge the ruling regime itself, leading to violence in the streets.   Iran latest: Khamenei admits thousands died in protests On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khameni acknowledged \"several thousand people\" had been killed in the protests. \n                  How the Iran uprising unfolded and what happened to the victims of the crackdown\n                 \n                  'Violent disorder' at Iran's London embassy leaves four police officers in hospital - with at least 14 arrested\n                 \n                  The Iranians who want Trump to intervene\n                 In their latest figures, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency group said it had verified 3,090 deaths, including 2,885 protesters, from the demonstrations and subsequent crackdown. Tehrani told Sky News: \"At first I think the government didn't believe that so many people would come out, they were surprised.\" He said the internet shut down quickly after \"millions\" of people turned out. The musician said people from all walks of life are calling for change, describing the country as undergoing a complete transformation. \"I've never seen an Iranian mood like that,\" he said. \"Everyone was united, everyone was hoping, 'This is the time'. Everyone was chanting together for the first time.\" He said he saw non-lethal bullets and tear gas being used by authorities, but said the violence then escalated. \"On Friday evening [9 January], that's when the majority of the killing started,\" said Tehrani. He said it was when the revolutionary guard came out, \"that's when everything got serious\", and it became \"a massacre on the streets\". Describing a video he had seen of \"bullets shooting and killing people\", he said bodies were \"left on the street for the others to look at, so they get panicked and scared and it is a lesson for them, 'You are next if you're coming out on the street'… If you come out and demonstrate again, you will be like this guy, this lady, this woman, this kid.\" He also said \"machine guns\" were used to shoot protesters at random. Tehrani said he believed foreign forces - including Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq - have been brought in by the regime to stop the protests. He said: \"That is why they know how to fight, [shooting at] heads and chest, heads and chest.\" He described the guards doing the killing as \"different\" to the normal guards. He said: \"One person's life matters in any nation, and thousands of people have been killed in a very aggressive way.\" Describing the regime's days as numbered, maybe \"less than two months\", he said Iran felt let down by the international community, asking: \"Where is the European Union? Where is Keir Starmer? I've never seen him put down any statement.\" As for those who came out to protest after US President Donald Trump's statement of support on Tuesday, he said Iranians felt \"a bit let down, but we have hope\". Tehrani said he received threatening messages on social media and said he would not be going back to Iran, adding: \"If I go back, they will catch me and hang me.\" 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 Despite that, he said he would be a voice for his people, saying: \"The whole world needs to understand and hear us. How can we be terrorists? We just want a better life. We just want freedom.\" In comments carried by Iranian state media, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused \"those linked to Israel and US\" for causing \"massive damages\" and killing \"several thousands\" during unrest. Earlier on X, Khamenei said he held President Trump responsible for the \"casualties, damages and slander he has levelled against the Iranian nation\" during protests. He said the recent unrest was caused by \"American sedition\", the goal of which \"is to swallow Iran\". \"The Iranian nation broke the back of sedition; it must also break the back of the seditionists,\" he said. \"We are not leading the country to war, but we will not abandon the domestic and international criminals of American sedition either.\""

It comes as the Met Office said this weekend, temperatures will be mostly average, with showers on Saturday and temperatures ranging from 6C to 10C (42.8F to 50F). Met Office meteorologist Honor Criswick said that Sunday would be a \"very cloudy and grey day\" with dense fog, and rain moving in as the day progressed. \"Spells of rain eventually pushing into southern England and Wales, pushing northwards through the day, this could turn a little bit heavy at times,\" she said.

Initially, milder Atlantic air is expected to dominate, with cloudy, changeable conditions with showers and average temperatures, the weather agency said. Then towards the end of the month, there is an increased chance that it will turn colder, with the potential for snow. The Met Office said: \"This aspect of the forecast is still somewhat uncertain but the potential transition to colder weather also increases the chance of snow across parts of the country.\" People can also expect an increased chance of cold conditions in February and the \"associated risk of wintry hazards at times\".

        "Content": "\n          Africa correspondent\n              @YousraElbagir\n President Yoweri Museveni has extended his 40-year reign over Uganda by another five years. A military helicopter roared above the National Tally Centre marquee as the chairman of the electoral commission announced a landslide victory for the 81-year-old incumbent with 71.65% of the vote. Members of the ruling National Resistance Movement party cheered and praised God as their long-time leader remained in power.   \"Was this a free and fair election?\" I asked Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja. \"It was, it was,\" she replied quickly. So why have the military and police been deployed to the streets for weeks? \"You are aware that our opponents were promising havoc, to burn the city, and I believe it is the work of security agents to keep law and order,\" she said. There is no doubt she is referring to the supporters of the main opposition leader, Bobi Wine, who have been taking to the streets in the face of a violent state crackdown. Police say that at least seven people have been killed in central Uganda as votes were tallied and disputed on Friday. \"The votes that have been stolen are votes of the people of Uganda,\" Wine's lawyer Benjamin Katana told me outside the National Tally Centre marquee. Katana is the only associate of Wine that has been permitted to witness the official results alongside dignitaries, diplomats and religious leaders. He refused to certify the results and walked out shortly after Wine's 24.72% was declared - a drop from 34.8% of the vote count he was officially attributed in 2021. \"This electoral process has been reduced to a fraudulent affair, that is aimed at short-changing the people of Uganda and subverting their will,\" said Katana. \"Our position has been that the constitution of Uganda, particularly article 29, gives the people of Uganda the right to demonstrate and protest against any unfairness,\" he added, echoing Wine's call for his supporters to take to the streets and reject the election.

The crowds gathering in front of neighbourhood television screens were not watching the election results but the Premier League. They are gripped by the Manchester derby game as the internet is still shut down by the state - a score of 2-0 that is more suspenseful than the election results. \"This [is] a foregone conclusion,\" Dr Livingstone Sewanya, the executive director of the Human Rights Initiative, told us in the National Tally Centre before the electoral commission declared the winner of the presidential race. \"Freedom of expression, association and assembly are at their lowest. You cannot organise now. If you do, you are subversive. You cannot associate freely; if you do, you are anti-establishment. \"So, this is a real threat and a serious issue.\""

Speaking on Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the Scottish leader said he believed the Scottish National Party (SNP) had to do \"really well\" in May's vote for there to be another independence referendum. Asked by Phillips whether he thought May's polls were an \"independence election\", Mr Swinney replied: \"I'm being straightforward with people in Scotland that if people in Scotland want Scotland to become independent, the SNP has got to do really well in this forthcoming election.\" He continued: \"It's got to achieve a majority in the Scottish parliament because when that happened before in 2011, it led to a referendum in 2014 and the Scots were able to determine their own constitution.\"  Asked what he would say to Scots if UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer turns down another referendum request, Mr Swinney said: \"I think there's two things about that. \"First of all, the United Kingdom is allegedly a partnership of equals, so Scotland has got a democratic right to decide our own future. \n                  Trump's Maduro raid broke international law, Scottish leader suggests - as PM says US must 'set out justifications'\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  First Minister John Swinney backs Justice Secretary Angela Constance amid threat of no confidence vote in grooming gangs row\n                 \"And secondly, if I win a majority in the Scottish parliament elections in May of this year, I don't think Keir Starmer will be the prime minister.\" The SNP is currently the largest party in the Scottish parliament with 60 MSPs out of 129. The last time Scottish people took to the polls to decide on whether Scotland should gain independence from the UK was in 2014, when more than two million people (55.3%) voted No and 1.6 million (44.7%) voted Yes. Following the defeat, then first minister Alex Salmond stepped down and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon.

The rule is named after 27-year-old Jessica Brady, who contacted her surgery 20 times in six months before she died from cancer in 2020. Jess's Rule encourages GPs to seek a second opinion, order more tests and see patients face-to-face for an examination when they have had three appointments with no diagnosis, or if their symptoms have worsened. The \"three strikes and rethink\" approach was rolled out in September last year to help doctors avoid missing serious illnesses such as cancer and prevent avoidable deaths.

Speaking on Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the Scottish leader said he believed the Scottish National Party (SNP) had to do \"really well\" in May's vote for there to be another independence referendum. Asked by Phillips whether he thought May's polls were an \"independence election\", Mr Swinney replied: \"I'm being straightforward with people in Scotland that if people in Scotland want Scotland to become independent, the SNP has got to do really well in this forthcoming election.\" He continued: \"It's got to achieve a majority in the Scottish parliament because when that happened before in 2011, it led to a referendum in 2014 and the Scots were able to determine their own constitution.\"  Asked what he would say to Scots if UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer turns down another referendum request, Mr Swinney said: \"I think there's two things about that. \"First of all, the United Kingdom is allegedly a partnership of equals, so Scotland has got a democratic right to decide our own future. \n                  Trump's Maduro raid broke international law, Scottish leader suggests - as PM says US must 'set out justifications'\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  First Minister John Swinney backs Justice Secretary Angela Constance amid threat of no confidence vote in grooming gangs row\n                 \"And secondly, if I win a majority in the Scottish parliament elections in May of this year, I don't think Keir Starmer will be the prime minister.\" The SNP is currently the largest party in the Scottish parliament with 60 MSPs out of 129. The last time Scottish people took to the polls to decide on whether Scotland should gain independence from the UK was in 2014, when more than two million people (55.3%) voted No and 1.6 million (44.7%) voted Yes. Following the defeat, then first minister Alex Salmond stepped down and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon. Read more: John Swinney sets out latest plan for independence referendum Although indyref was touted as a \"once in a generation opportunity to follow a different path\", dissatisfaction with the result has led to campaigners continually calling for a second vote. The previous Conservative government steadfastly refused to consent to a second referendum. The argument went all the way to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled in 2022 that the Scottish government cannot legislate for indyref2 without Westminster approval. It threw a spanner in the works for Ms Sturgeon, who had previously proposed plans to hold a second referendum - known as indyref2 - on 19 October 2023.

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n Kemi Badenoch led hundreds of protesters in opposition to China's proposed new mega-embassy in central London. Crowds were warned plain clothes Chinese police officers were among those gathered at the site of the former Royal Mint. It was the last chance for demonstrators to voice their concerns ahead of the government's decision on the controversial planning application on Tuesday. Chants of \"mega embassy, mega mistake\", \"don't bow to China\" and \"no mega embassy\" rang out, while protesters raised their middle fingers towards the huge site. The location between the financial districts of the City of London and Canary Wharf has raised security concerns the embassy will be used as a spy hub, while dissidents fear it will be used as a base for repression. The Tory leader took to a makeshift stage next to the site to assure protesters: \"I stand with you\". \"I tell you, I will always fight for freedom.

Sir Iain urged the government to \"wake up\" to the threat from China and said he was not reassured by the apparent lack of intervention from the UK security services. \"The reality is that many in the security services know what the threat is, but they're also kiboshed by the Foreign Office and the government,\" he told Sky News. Some in the crowd carried placards featuring Sir Keir Starmer in compromising positions with Winnie the Pooh - often used to satirise Chinese president Xi Jinping. The government is expected to approve the controversial plans on Tuesday - ahead of the prime minister's expected visit to China later this month. Many in the crowd were members of Chinese, Uighur and Tibetan diasporas in the UK or Hong Kongers exiled because of their pro-democracy activities. Chloe Cheung, 20, who has a HK$1m (around £100,000) bounty on her head and is subject to an arrest warrant, said she already faces repression in the UK from China. \"It's devastating that I have been fighting for democracy, which is one of the British values,\" the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong activist told Sky News. \"I don't have any intention to harm Britain but I have been harassed and threatened every day because of speaking out for democracy.\" She said she was \"horrified\" at the prospect of the new mega embassy, adding: \"The worst-case scenario is someone will kidnap me to the embassy.\" Read more from Sky News:'Violent disorder' at Iran's London embassy leads to 14 arrestsJess's Rule to be advertised in all GP clinics in England China maintains the new embassy is being built to \"promote understanding and friendship\" with the UK and \"develop mutually beneficial co-operation\".

Speaking to Sky News on condition of anonymity, the mum's son, who is just three months old, was first taken to hospital with symptoms that included vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain that got progressively worse. She had given her son SMA infant formula, produced by food and drink giant Nestle, in four-hourly feeds since birth because she said she \"trusted the brand\". She had bought the formula at a local supermarket and continued to feed it to her son after he fell ill. The mum said her \"heart sank\" when, after her son had already been admitted to hospital, she saw that batches of the formula that she had fed him were among those linked to possible contamination with the toxin cereulide. Earlier this month, Nestle issued a global recall of specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula due to the potential presence of cereulide. Once consumed, the heat-resistant toxin can lead to a rapid onset of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. \n                  Screen time linked to poor speech development in under-fives, say ministers as parents offered new guidance\n                 \n                  'My daughter was diagnosed with childhood dementia before she turned four - what we were told is criminal'\n                 \n                  Nestle recalls baby formula batches over toxin fears\n                 In a statement, Nestle told Sky News the batches had been recalled as a \"precautionary\" measure, following the detection of a quality issue with an ingredient provided by a leading supplier\". \"No illnesses have been confirmed in connection with the products involved to date,\" the company added. However, the parent we spoke to wants a \"full investigation\" into what has caused her son's illness. \"We don't have the full picture of what has happened,\" she says, describing how her baby developed mottled skin, \"blue feet\" and \"grunting, jerking movements\" before being taken to hospital. After tests, including two lumbar punctures, medical teams diagnosed meningitis. \"When people ingest or are exposed to bacteria, it crosses the lining of the mouth or somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract,\" explains Professor Michael Benedict, Director of the University of Liverpool's Brain Infection and Inflammation Group. Those bacteria can then \"enter the bloodstream and stay there, that causes sepsis or bloodstream infection,\" he says, \"or if it spreads from the bloodstream to an organ, in this case the meninges, this sac around the brain, and it results in meningitis.\" In this case, the baby has been treated with antibiotics.

        "Content": "A mother who is among a group of British parents suing TikTok after the deaths of five children has described a hearing in America as \"deeply painful\". Ellen Roome, 49, from Gloucestershire, has been campaigning since her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died at home in Cheltenham in 2022. She travelled to Delaware to attend the hearing in the case filed by the Social Media Victims Law Centre against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The case alleges Jools, Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Noah Gibson, 11, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while trying an online challenge. The bereaved parents believe their children saw the challenge on TikTok - although they don't have proof. TikTok says the data around what their children were watching has likely been deleted under data privacy rules. The parents are suing TikTok in the US for wrongful death, a process that may see them find out what happened to their children, if that data can be recovered. Ms Roome wrote on Facebook: \"Today we had our TikTok hearing. \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 \n                  'I have PTSD after seeing an online suicide at 12': The growing call to ban smartphones in schools\n                 \n                  Cyber flashing just became a priority offence - here's what changes from today\n                 \"We now have to wait for the judge to decide whether the case is dismissed or whether we are allowed to proceed to the discovery stage. \"Sitting through the hearing was incredibly hard. The language was cold, technical and legal. For the court, this is about motions and procedures. For us, it is about our children. Our dead children.\" She went on: \"Listening to lawyers argue abstract points while the reality of our loss sat silently behind every word was deeply painful. This is our lived experience, our grief, and our determination to find the truth and protect other children. \"Whatever the outcome, we showed up. We spoke for our children. And we will keep going. Thank you to everyone who continues to support us.\" Ms Roome sold the financial business she had run for 18 years to campaign for Jools' Law, a right for parents to access their deceased child's data without a court order. She is also pushing for wider changes to social media to improve the safety of children online. Speaking previously about internet safety, she said: \"This is not about banning the internet. It is about stopping platforms being addictive by design, exposing children to harm, and avoiding responsibility when the worst happens. \"Children deserve protection. Parents deserve answers. And tech companies must be held to account. \"We are here to make sure other children are safer.\" Since her son's death, Ms Roome has been trying to obtain data from TikTok and ByteDance which she believes could provide an explanation as to what happened. All five parents believe their children died attempting a dangerous stunt known as the blackout challenge. Around for decades, it's banned on mainstream social media apps, including TikTok. TikTok has applied to dismiss the case, stating UK residents are suing US entities which do not operate or provide the social media firm's services in the UK. It says established US law, such as the First Amendment, bars liability for third-party content on TikTok. A spokesperson for TikTok said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families. We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us. \"As a company, we comply with the UK's strict data protection laws.\""

The Green Party said the universal bus pass for young people would be self-financing because it would boost the economy. \"Young people are increasingly shut out of employment and training by the cost of living crisis, which often hits the youngest the hardest,\" Mr Polanski said. \"This Labour government has made a dire situation for young people even worse with the poorest getting even poorer and rich getting even richer. \"Free bus travel for the young is one part of improving the lives of younger people and showing what a richer and greener country looks like if we invest in people and not hand over our assets to the super-rich and corporations.\" \n                  Can Zack Polanski's anti-establishment message beat Nigel Farage on migration?\n                 \n                  Open border immigration 'not pragmatic right now', says Green Party leader\n                 \n                  Scottish Greens 'riding same wave' as Green Party as membership surge continues\n                 Under-18s can already travel for free on buses in London and there are other discounts available for some up to age 25. Other bus companies across England also offer travel discounts for young people. Mr Polanski said Green Party councillors would push for the universal bus scheme in their areas if elected in May's local elections.

        "Content": "A murderer accused of rapping about the death of the London schoolboy he killed will not be transferred to an open prison, after the Deputy Prime Minister intervened. Jake Fahri murdered 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen in a south London bakery in 2008, throwing a glass dish at him which shattered and severed blood vessels in his neck. Given a life sentence in 2009 with a minimum term of 14 years, Fahri was released on licence in June 2023, and embarked upon a new musical venture. Dubbing himself Ten, the masked drill artist was reportedly showcased on BBC 1Xtra, and had a track on Spotify and YouTube that seemed to reference Jimmy's death. But after The Sun newspaper revealed his identity, the Ministry of Justice recalled him to prison in January 2025. Putting him back behind bars, a Probation Service spokesperson said that Jimmy's parents \"deserve better than to see their son's murderer shamelessly boasting about his violent crime\". According to a Parole Board decision summary, Fahri initially denied he was the rapper and disputed that the music was about his own life, but later admitted he was Ten after his recall to prison. \n                  Man jailed for murdering wife after child revealed plot in rare retrial\n                 \n                  Former nuns and retired support worker punished for cruelty in children's homes\n                 \n                  Gunman who disguised himself as Deliveroo rider jailed for 38 years after shooting eight-year-old girl \n                 The board decided Fahri, now 36, should not be released from custody, but could be moved to an open prison, where there is minimal security and eligible prisoners can spend most of their day out of the facility on licence. \"The panel determined that Mr Fahri needed to reflect on his attitude, thinking and behaviour, so that he could better understand himself, including why he failed to be open and honest with the professionals managing his case,\" the written decision said. \"It considered that this could be achieved in an open prison and recommended that Mr Fahri should be progressed in this way.\" Now Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy has rejected the move. Jimmy's mother Margaret, 73, told The Sun she was \"shocked\" by the panel's recommendation, that Fahri had \"not changed his attitude\", and that she was glad that Mr Lammy had blocked his transfer. \"I would much prefer this decision didn't have to be made because he would have turned his life around. I'm really sad that he hasn't,\" she said. \"It goes to show that the things which have been said about him over the years are probably true. \"He got into the witness box at his trial and lied through his teeth. Clearly, he hasn't changed, and I'm glad the Justice Secretary has seen through it.\" A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: \"Jimmy Mizen's murder was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with his friends and family. \"Public protection is our top priority, which is why the Deputy Prime Minister has blocked Jake Fahri's transfer to open conditions.\" The Mizen Foundation was set up by Jimmy's family after his death, to promote \"forgiveness, peace and hope, and empowerment among young people and communities\". Jimmy's parents, Barry and Margaret, were both appointed MBEs (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 2013 for their charitable endeavours."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has sparked a strong backlash after saying he will impose tariffs on eight European countries - including the UK - until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland. The US president said 10% tariffs would come into effect on 1 February for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate would then climb to 25% on 1 June if no deal was in place for \"the complete and total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States, Mr Trump wrote in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday. Trump threatens tariffs over Greenland - as it happened  The US president seems to have acted on his previous warning that he would impose tariffs on countries that do not go along with his plan to acquire the Danish territory. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" for applying tariffs on allies who are \"pursuing the collective security of NATO allies\", adding that he will be \"pursuing\" this with the US administration. \n                  Keir Starmer begins pushback against Trump as president threatens tariffs over Greenland\n                 \n                  Denmark says 'fundamental disagreement' remains with Trump - but agrees to high-level talks over Greenland\n                 \n                  Trump restates desire to take over Greenland, as poll finds most Americans are against it\n                 French President Emmanuel Macron called the threat of tariffs \"unacceptable\" and said if implemented Europe would respond in a coordinated manner. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa said in separate but identical posts on X that the European Union stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. \"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward ​spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,\" they said. Officials from Norway, Sweden, France and Germany reiterated support for Denmark and said tariffs should not be part of Greenland discussions. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" to impose tariffs, adding they would be a \"burden for businesses across our country\". Reform leader Nigel Farage said the tariffs would \"hurt\" the UK, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Trump was \"punishing\" the UK. The European Union has called an emergency meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member countries for Sunday following Mr Trump's announcement. The US president indicated the tariffs were a retaliation after European countries sent military personnel to Greenland in a show of support for the territory. He wrote: \"These countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" So far France has sent as many as 15 personnel to the Danish territory, Germany has sent 13 and the UK has sent one military officer. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hands off' Greenland protests The tariffs were announced the same day thousands of people marched through Copenhagen in support of Greenland in the face of threats from Mr Trump. Demonstrators brandished Danish and Greenlandic flags and signs with slogans including \"Make America Smart Again\" and \"Hands off\" as they marched on Saturday afternoon. Other rallies were planned in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, and elsewhere in the Danish kingdom. \"This is important for the whole world,\" Danish protester Elise Riechie said, as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. \"There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.\" The protests come as a bipartisan US congressional delegation sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support. Delegation leader senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said he wanted to de-escalate the situation and the US had respect for Denmark and NATO \"for all we've done together\". \"I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" Mr Coons said in Copenhagen. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued the US needs to take over Greenland because Russia and China had their own designs on the self-governing territory. The president's comments stood in stark contrast to Mr Coons's remarks on Saturday. Read more:Why does Trump want to take over Greenland?Trump is likely gambling he could get away with Greenland grab \"There are no current security threats to Greenland,\" Mr Coons said. The White House has not ruled out taking Greenland - which has vast untapped reserves of critical minerals - by force. \"There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,\" Mr Coons said. \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\" Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met with US vice president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington. That meeting resulted in an agreement to set up a working group, despite Denmark and the White House offering diverging views on its purpose. Denmark said this week it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in co-operation with allies."

Meraj Tehrani, who lives in the UK, told Sky News' international correspondent Alex Rossi he returned to Iran on business in early January, as demonstrations were erupting across the country. Initially motivated by the country's ailing economy, the demonstrations have grown to challenge the ruling regime itself, leading to violence in the streets.   Iran latest: Khamenei admits thousands died in protests On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khameni acknowledged \"several thousand people\" had been killed in the protests. \n                  How the Iran uprising unfolded and what happened to the victims of the crackdown\n                 \n                  'Violent disorder' at Iran's London embassy leaves four police officers in hospital - with at least 14 arrested\n                 \n                  The Iranians who want Trump to intervene\n                 In their latest figures, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency group said it had verified 3,090 deaths, including 2,885 protesters, from the demonstrations and subsequent crackdown. Tehrani told Sky News: \"At first I think the government didn't believe that so many people would come out, they were surprised.\" He said the internet shut down quickly after \"millions\" of people turned out. The musician said people from all walks of life are calling for change, describing the country as undergoing a complete transformation. \"I've never seen an Iranian mood like that,\" he said. \"Everyone was united, everyone was hoping, 'This is the time'. Everyone was chanting together for the first time.\" He said he saw non-lethal bullets and tear gas being used by authorities, but said the violence then escalated. \"On Friday evening [9 January], that's when the majority of the killing started,\" said Tehrani. He said it was when the revolutionary guard came out, \"that's when everything got serious\", and it became \"a massacre on the streets\". Describing a video he had seen of \"bullets shooting and killing people\", he said bodies were \"left on the street for the others to look at, so they get panicked and scared and it is a lesson for them, 'You are next if you're coming out on the street'… If you come out and demonstrate again, you will be like this guy, this lady, this woman, this kid.\" He also said \"machine guns\" were used to shoot protesters at random. Tehrani said he believed foreign forces - including Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Forces in Iraq - have been brought in by the regime to stop the protests. He said: \"That is why they know how to fight, [shooting at] heads and chest, heads and chest.\" He described the guards doing the killing as \"different\" to the normal guards. He said: \"One person's life matters in any nation, and thousands of people have been killed in a very aggressive way.\" Describing the regime's days as numbered, maybe \"less than two months\", he said Iran felt let down by the international community, asking: \"Where is the European Union? Where is Keir Starmer? I've never seen him put down any statement.\" As for those who came out to protest after US President Donald Trump's statement of support on Tuesday, he said Iranians felt \"a bit let down, but we have hope\". Tehrani said he received threatening messages on social media and said he would not be going back to Iran, adding: \"If I go back, they will catch me and hang me.\" 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 Despite that, he said he would be a voice for his people, saying: \"The whole world needs to understand and hear us. How can we be terrorists? We just want a better life. We just want freedom.\" In comments carried by Iranian state media, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused \"those linked to Israel and US\" for causing \"massive damages\" and killing \"several thousands\" during unrest. Earlier on X, Khamenei said he held President Trump responsible for the \"casualties, damages and slander he has levelled against the Iranian nation\" during protests. He said the recent unrest was caused by \"American sedition\", the goal of which \"is to swallow Iran\". \"The Iranian nation broke the back of sedition; it must also break the back of the seditionists,\" he said. \"We are not leading the country to war, but we will not abandon the domestic and international criminals of American sedition either.\""

Most shop owners were either closing up or had already left the centre when the fire broke out, according to local media. No official cause of the fire has been determined, but authorities said flames spread rapidly after starting in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which helped fuel the flames. Thick black smoke was shown billowing from numerous floors of the shopping centre. The smoke was visible from several streets away, according to a reporter from the Associated Press.

A military helicopter roared above the National Tally Centre marquee as the chairman of the electoral commission announced a landslide victory for the 81-year-old incumbent with 71.65% of the vote. Members of the ruling National Resistance Movement party cheered and praised God as their long-time leader remained in power.   \"Was this a free and fair election?\" I asked Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja. \"It was, it was,\" she replied quickly. So why have the military and police been deployed to the streets for weeks? \"You are aware that our opponents were promising havoc, to burn the city, and I believe it is the work of security agents to keep law and order,\" she said. There is no doubt she is referring to the supporters of the main opposition leader, Bobi Wine, who have been taking to the streets in the face of a violent state crackdown. Police say that at least seven people have been killed in central Uganda as votes were tallied and disputed on Friday. \"The votes that have been stolen are votes of the people of Uganda,\" Wine's lawyer Benjamin Katana told me outside the National Tally Centre marquee. Katana is the only associate of Wine that has been permitted to witness the official results alongside dignitaries, diplomats and religious leaders. He refused to certify the results and walked out shortly after Wine's 24.72% was declared - a drop from 34.8% of the vote count he was officially attributed in 2021. \"This electoral process has been reduced to a fraudulent affair, that is aimed at short-changing the people of Uganda and subverting their will,\" said Katana. \"Our position has been that the constitution of Uganda, particularly article 29, gives the people of Uganda the right to demonstrate and protest against any unfairness,\" he added, echoing Wine's call for his supporters to take to the streets and reject the election.

        "Content": "Sir Tony Blair has said he is \"honoured\" to be appointed as part of a team that will be key to Donald Trump's plan to rebuild Gaza. The former Labour prime minister has been listed by the White House on a \"founding executive board\" to lead long-term Middle East peace efforts, along with high-profile Trump administration officials. This will be the operational arm of the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump who called it the \"greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled\" ahead of the announcement. Under the US president's peace plan, the territory will be governed by an apolitical, transitional Palestinian government, monitored by a Board of Peace. Mr Trump said the US was launching \"phase two\" of its 20-point plan to end the Gaza conflict, which his special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said would see the focus shift beyond a ceasefire and towards demilitarisation, technocratic governance and reconstruction. Sir Tony called the 20-point plan \"an extraordinary achievement\" and \"something many thought could not happen\". \"For Gaza and its people, we want a Gaza which does not reconstruct Gaza as it was but as it could and should be. And for the Israelis we want to ensure that the horrific events of October 7 2023 are never repeated. \n                  Board of Peace is best option for Gazans in desperate need of stability\n                 \n                  Phase two of Gaza peace plan will be complicated, protracted and unpredictable\n                 \n                  US launches phase two of plan to end Gaza conflict, including creation of transitional authority\n                 \"Both myself personally and my Institute will continue to work and commit for this outcome and again I thank President Trump for his leadership which made this possible.\" Among the other figures on the \"founding executive board\" will be Mr Witkoff, Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who both helped negotiate the peace plan, and US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The other members named are billionaire Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga, and US deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel. In a statement, the White House said each would oversee a \"defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success\". Mr Trump was effusive about the membership of the Board of Peace in a post on Truth Social. He wrote: \"I can say with certainty that it is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place.\" Sir Tony, Mr Rubio, and Mr Kushner were also named among the 11 members of a \"Gaza executive board\", the purpose of which appears to be advising a newly set up interim government for Gaza. That interim authority, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), will be headed up by Dr Ali Sha'ath, described by the Trump administration as \"a widely respected technocratic leader\". In this role, the White House said, he will \"oversee the restoration of core public services, the rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilisation of daily life in Gaza, while laying the foundation for long-term, self-sustaining governance\". Also named was Nickolay Mladenov, an executive board member and former UN Middle East envoy, who has been appointed High Representative for Gaza, acting as the \"on-the-ground link between the Board of Peace and the NCAG\", according to the announcement. While Major General Jasper Jeffers will command an \"International Stabilisation Force\", responsible for security operations, demilitarisation, and safe delivery of humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials, the White House said. US correspondent When Blair's name was first floated by Trump's team, the reaction within the Arab world was particularly negative.  Despite having a relationship, at leader level, with gulf Arab nations which was seen as important, Blair's legacy from Iraq still runs deep, particularly on the Arab street. \"Palestinians in general don't see Mr Blair as anything else than a war criminal and a mercenary, and do not expect anything positive coming out from his involvement in a region he has already damaged,\" one source close to the Palestinian Authority leadership told me late last year. The choice of Nickolay Mladenov for High Representative has received a more positive reaction. Mladenov is a former Bulgarian foreign minister and defence minister. He served as the UN special envoy to the Middle East between 2015 and 2020. Trump has asked him to oversee the running of the Strip on the ground. Critically, he is respected by both the Palestinians and the Israelis - who are usually particularly sceptical of anyone associated with the UN. During his time in Jerusalem, he was seen as a strong diplomat who left a good impression with key figures on both sides.  In 2021, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas awarded Mladenov the Grand Star of the Order of Jerusalem in recognition of his work to further peace in the region.  His appointment will be seen as a victory for the Palestinian side who were so critical of Blair and worried that the Trump appointments would all lean only to the Israeli side. \n Mladenov also had a key regional contribution in helping to mold Trump's Abraham Accords - the diplomatic normalisation process between Israel and Arab countries. He has close ties with the Emiratis which will prove useful and important for the redevelopment of Gaza.  One Arab source expressed concern that Mladenov has rarely openly criticised the Israelis, but added: \"He understands international law and the limits for what he could do.\" 'Blair can be divisive figure in this region' Speaking from Jerusalem, Sky News Middle East correspondent Adam Parsons explained the details around the proposal, admitting there was some \"confusion\" around the \"very complicated bureaucratic structure\". Mr Blair is the only member of the executive board who is not an American citizen. Describing the mood on the ground, Adam Parsons said: \"There's been a lot of heat around Tony Blair, around this question of his reputation.

A lot of people remember his decision to take the UK into the Iraq War. \"Others find the agreement is an extraordinary effort, bringing communities together.

The attack, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 people with 251 others taken hostage, was soon followed by an Israeli offensive on Gaza, which lasted two years and killed a further 70,000 people, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. A fragile ceasefire came into effect in October, but Gaza continues to see outbursts of deadly violence, with Israel and Hamas both accusing each other of violating the peace."

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @adamparsons\n Like so much of the politics in the Middle East, the new governance structure for Gaza is complicated and contentious. And it's clear that the most prominent positions so far will belong to people who are either American citizens or else are called Sir Tony Blair. There are four layers to this new plan. At the top is a Board of Peace, which will be chaired by Donald Trump and will consist of serving national leaders, so Sir Tony won't be involved in that. Instead, expect invitations to be received by Sir Keir Starmer, Italy's Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, among others. Turkey has already confirmed that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been asked to join the Board. Yes, there is star quality here, but the day-to-day work is likely to be done by the three committees that sit below. \n                  Sir Tony Blair 'honoured' to be part of Donald Trump's efforts to rebuild Gaza\n                 \n                  Phase two of Gaza peace plan will be complicated, protracted and unpredictable\n                 \n                  US launches phase two of plan to end Gaza conflict, including creation of transitional authority\n                 Firstly, we now know about the executive board - what we might call layer number two. Sir Tony is the only person named so far who isn't an American citizen, and it's little surprise to see Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's roaming negotiator, named on it, along with Jared Kushner, a financier who is married to Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka. Secretary of state Marco Rubio is there, too, along with Ajay Banga, head of the World Bank, Robert Gabriel, a national security advisor and Marc Rowan, the billionaire boss of a private equity firm. The idea here is that the executive board, to quote the White House, will \"operationalize the Board of Peace's vision\". One assumes that, looking at the background of Witkoff, Kushner, Banga and Rowan, a lot of faith is being placed in their ability to raise money, do deals and spot development opportunities. Not listed on the membership, but clearly deeply involved, is the diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, previously Bulgaria's defence minister and the UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. He has now been named as the High Representative for Gaza, acting as the link between the Board of Peace and the day-to-day work on the ground. I assume he will be added to the executive board. Mladenov, who earned widespread respect during his five-year spell in this region with the UN, will effectively be the liaison with the group of Palestinian technocratic leaders who form another layer of governance, and who have already held their first meeting, in Cairo, last week. Let's call them layer number four. Read more: US moves to transitional government in GazaIsrael suspends 37 aid organisations from operating in Gaza But in that oversight, Mladenov will not be alone. Another committee, also including Sir Tony, Kushner, Witkoff and Rubio, will scrutinise what's happening on the ground. That's layer number three. Importantly, this time, there are people involved who aren't American, Bulgarian or Sir Tony. In fact, this is the committee with the widest range - Turkey's foreign minister, the influential Qatari diplomat Ali Al Thawadi, Reem Al Hashimy, a minister from Dubai who is the only woman involved so far, and the head of the Egyptian Intelligence Service among them. On paper, this group is the one to watch - the link between the American influence at the top and the Palestinian leaders on the ground, with adept politicians who, importantly, are not afraid of upsetting the Israeli government. If there are rows and political tremors, I imagine they will come from this committee. Sir Tony will have a significant role to play in balancing those interests. There are some in the Middle East who still see him as a warmonger for the role he played during the invasion of Iraq, but there are others who think he \"gets\" the politics of this region better than almost any other diplomat, and who greatly admire his achievements in pushing through the Good Friday Agreement. This version of Sir Tony - the patient, politically astute dealmaker - is the one the Americans hope they've got. The big question emerging from all this is whether it makes a big difference. How will this advance the demands of phase two, for instance, by leading to the disarmament of Hamas, the withdrawal of the Israeli military, the rebuilding of Gaza and the restoration of safe government. All of these are towering, intimidating demands. But they have to be addressed. The other crucial announcement is that Major General Jasper Jeffers is now in charge of the international stabilisation force for Gaza. It is a job with huge responsibility - perhaps more than any other - charged with creating a secure environment, demilitarising Gaza and allowing for the safe delivery of supplies. For that, he will need troops on the ground in Gaza. And at the moment, it's not clear where he will get them from, or what their actual remit would be, or how Major General Jeffers will command them. All that is clear is that Gaza, and the people who live there, desperately need stability. And this structure, unwieldy and elaborate though it may be, is the best option they have."

        "Content": "Uganda's long-time leader Yoweri Museveni has won the country's presidential election, officials say, amid claims by the main opposition leader of \"massive ballot stuffing\". Mr Museveni, 81, has been in power for 40 years and is set to serve a seventh term in office after securing 71% of support this time, according to the electoral commission. His main challenger, musician-turned-politician Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, better known as Bobi Wine, gained 24% of the vote.   Wine, of the National Unity Platform party, said the military and police had raided his home but he was able to \"escape\". He has dismissed the announced results as \"fake\" and has asked his supporters to ignore them. Police said Wine was free to leave his house, although there was \"controlled access\" for others trying to enter the property. Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke said the measure was implemented to prevent people from using the premises to incite violence. Wine has alleged fraud, claiming there was \"massive ballot stuffing\" and that his party's polling agents were abducted to give an unfair advantage to the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement. Meanwhile in a statement shared on social media on Saturday morning, Wine said that \"last night was very difficult at our home\" as \"the military and police raided us\" but he managed to \"escape\". \"They switched off power and cut off some of our CCTV cameras. There were helicopters hovering over,\" he said. \"I want to confirm that I managed to escape from them,\" he added, saying that his wife and other family members remain at their home in a residential area on the outskirts of the capital Kampala. Wine reiterated his \"complete rejection\" of the results and said the results have \"zero backing\". Uganda was plunged into a state-enforced internet blackout, and the media were forcefully restricted from reporting on the unfolding scenes of unrest, as the votes were tallied and disputed. Read more:Uganda election descends into deadly violencePresident on shutting down the internetHow Ugandan government is trying to stop pop star politician The voting process has been marred by delays caused by the late arrival of materials at polling stations after they had opened, as well as malfunctions of some biometric machines. Electoral officials faced questions about the failure of biometric voter identification machines on Thursday, which delayed the start of voting in urban areas - often opposition strongholds - including the capital. After the machines failed, polling officials reverted to using manual voter registers, a setback for pro-democracy activists who had long advocated their use to prevent election fraud. Security forces were visibly deployed throughout the campaign, and Wine said authorities monitored his movements and harassed his supporters, including firing tear gas at them. Citing safety concerns, he conducted his campaign wearing a flak jacket and helmet. Mr Museveni has maintained his grip on power by repeatedly changing the rules. Constitutional term and age limits - the final legal barriers to his rule - have been abolished, while several potential presidential challengers have been imprisoned or pushed aside. He has given no indication of when he plans to step down. Uganda has not seen a peaceful transition of presidential power since gaining independence from British colonial rule more than six decades ago. Veteran opposition leader Kizza Besigye, a four-time presidential contender, has remained jailed since being charged with treason in February 2025."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has sparked a strong backlash after saying he will impose tariffs on eight European countries - including the UK - until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland. The US president said 10% tariffs would come into effect on 1 February for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate would then climb to 25% on 1 June if no deal was in place for \"the complete and total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States, Mr Trump wrote in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday. Trump threatens tariffs over Greenland - as it happened  The US president seems to have acted on his previous warning that he would impose tariffs on countries that do not go along with his plan to acquire the Danish territory. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" for applying tariffs on allies who are \"pursuing the collective security of NATO allies\", adding that he will be \"pursuing\" this with the US administration. \n                  Keir Starmer begins pushback against Trump as president threatens tariffs over Greenland\n                 \n                  Denmark says 'fundamental disagreement' remains with Trump - but agrees to high-level talks over Greenland\n                 \n                  Trump restates desire to take over Greenland, as poll finds most Americans are against it\n                 French President Emmanuel Macron called the threat of tariffs \"unacceptable\" and said if implemented Europe would respond in a coordinated manner. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa said in separate but identical posts on X that the European Union stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. \"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward ​spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,\" they said. Officials from Norway, Sweden, France and Germany reiterated support for Denmark and said tariffs should not be part of Greenland discussions. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said Mr Trump was \"completely wrong\" to impose tariffs, adding they would be a \"burden for businesses across our country\". Reform leader Nigel Farage said the tariffs would \"hurt\" the UK, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Trump was \"punishing\" the UK. The European Union has called an emergency meeting of ambassadors from the 27-member countries for Sunday following Mr Trump's announcement. The US president indicated the tariffs were a retaliation after European countries sent military personnel to Greenland in a show of support for the territory. He wrote: \"These countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" So far France has sent as many as 15 personnel to the Danish territory, Germany has sent 13 and the UK has sent one military officer. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 'Hands off' Greenland protests The tariffs were announced the same day thousands of people marched through Copenhagen in support of Greenland in the face of threats from Mr Trump. Demonstrators brandished Danish and Greenlandic flags and signs with slogans including \"Make America Smart Again\" and \"Hands off\" as they marched on Saturday afternoon. Other rallies were planned in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital, and elsewhere in the Danish kingdom. \"This is important for the whole world,\" Danish protester Elise Riechie said, as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. \"There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.\" The protests come as a bipartisan US congressional delegation sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support. Delegation leader senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said he wanted to de-escalate the situation and the US had respect for Denmark and NATO \"for all we've done together\". \"I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" Mr Coons said in Copenhagen. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued the US needs to take over Greenland because Russia and China had their own designs on the self-governing territory. The president's comments stood in stark contrast to Mr Coons's remarks on Saturday. Read more:Why does Trump want to take over Greenland?Trump is likely gambling he could get away with Greenland grab \"There are no current security threats to Greenland,\" Mr Coons said. The White House has not ruled out taking Greenland - which has vast untapped reserves of critical minerals - by force. \"There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,\" Mr Coons said. \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\" Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met with US vice president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington. That meeting resulted in an agreement to set up a working group, despite Denmark and the White House offering diverging views on its purpose. Denmark said this week it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in co-operation with allies."

        "Content": "A mother who is among a group of British parents suing TikTok after the deaths of five children has described a hearing in America as \"deeply painful\". Ellen Roome, 49, from Gloucestershire, has been campaigning since her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died at home in Cheltenham in 2022. She travelled to Delaware to attend the hearing in the case filed by the Social Media Victims Law Centre against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The case alleges Jools, Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Noah Gibson, 11, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while trying an online challenge. The bereaved parents believe their children saw the challenge on TikTok - although they don't have proof. TikTok says the data around what their children were watching has likely been deleted under data privacy rules. The parents are suing TikTok in the US for wrongful death, a process that may see them find out what happened to their children, if that data can be recovered. Ms Roome wrote on Facebook: \"Today we had our TikTok hearing. \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 \n                  'I have PTSD after seeing an online suicide at 12': The growing call to ban smartphones in schools\n                 \n                  Cyber flashing just became a priority offence - here's what changes from today\n                 \"We now have to wait for the judge to decide whether the case is dismissed or whether we are allowed to proceed to the discovery stage. \"Sitting through the hearing was incredibly hard. The language was cold, technical and legal. For the court, this is about motions and procedures. For us, it is about our children. Our dead children.\" She went on: \"Listening to lawyers argue abstract points while the reality of our loss sat silently behind every word was deeply painful. This is our lived experience, our grief, and our determination to find the truth and protect other children. \"Whatever the outcome, we showed up. We spoke for our children. And we will keep going. Thank you to everyone who continues to support us.\" Ms Roome sold the financial business she had run for 18 years to campaign for Jools' Law, a right for parents to access their deceased child's data without a court order. She is also pushing for wider changes to social media to improve the safety of children online. Speaking previously about internet safety, she said: \"This is not about banning the internet. It is about stopping platforms being addictive by design, exposing children to harm, and avoiding responsibility when the worst happens. \"Children deserve protection. Parents deserve answers. And tech companies must be held to account. \"We are here to make sure other children are safer.\" Since her son's death, Ms Roome has been trying to obtain data from TikTok and ByteDance which she believes could provide an explanation as to what happened. All five parents believe their children died attempting a dangerous stunt known as the blackout challenge. Around for decades, it's banned on mainstream social media apps, including TikTok. TikTok has applied to dismiss the case, stating UK residents are suing US entities which do not operate or provide the social media firm's services in the UK. It says established US law, such as the First Amendment, bars liability for third-party content on TikTok. A spokesperson for TikTok said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families. We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us. \"As a company, we comply with the UK's strict data protection laws.\""

        "Content": "Scientists have dismissed warnings from Donald Trump linking paracetamol use during pregnancy to autism. The US president made the allegation in September as he claimed there had been a \"meteoric rise\" in cases of autism. Identifying the medication - known as Tylenol in the States - as a potential cause, Mr Trump suggested pregnant women should \"tough it out\". Now, after reviewing dozens of studies on the topic, experts have concluded there is \"no clinically important\" link between paracetamol use and autism. For the review, scientists identified 43 studies concerning autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disabilities. Then they examined the outcome of pregnancies with and without paracetamol exposure, and found \"paracetamol exposure during pregnancy was not associated with the risk of autism\" or ADHD, or intellectual disabilities. Lead author Asma Khalil of St George's Hospital in London said: \"We found no clinically important increase in the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability among children where the mothers took paracetamol during pregnancy. \n                  The Iranians who want Trump to intervene\n                 \n                  Is Trump about to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis?\n                 \n                  Venezuela's Machado gave Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal in pursuit of a greater prize\n                 \"And this is the important message to the millions of pregnant individuals - paracetamol is safe to use in pregnancy. \"It remains the first-line treatment that we would recommend if pregnant women have pain or fever, and it's also consistent with recommendations or guidelines by various national or international bodies.\" Grainne McAlonan, professor of translational neuroscience at King's College London, highlighted that the review had also examined a number of sibling comparison studies. These studies compared children born to the same mother, where she took paracetamol in one pregnancy, but did not in another.

She continued: \"Expectant mothers do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far-reaching effects on their child's health. \"While the impact of last year's announcement has been extensive, I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"This major review can, yet again, reassure mothers-to-be everywhere that there is no evidence whatsoever to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism, ADHD or disabilities in their children. \"Our country's leading scientists, doctors and the NHS are clear that paracetamol is safe to take when pregnant and in pain or suffering a fever.\" The review was published in the journal, The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women's Health."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Rolls-Royce Holdings is to hand its chief executive a multimillion-pound annual pay boost, even as he nears one of Britain's most lucrative ever public company payouts after overseeing a spectacular revival of the industrial manufacturing group. Sky News has learnt that Rolls-Royce's board has concluded a consultation with leading shareholders on a radical overhaul of its remuneration policy. The proposals, which have been endorsed by top investors, will see Tufan Erginbilgic's annual bonus entitlement increase from two times to three times his base salary of about £1.2m. The revamped scheme will also see his long-term incentive award will double from a maximum of 375% of salary to 750% - making it one of the richest such rewards programmes offered by a FTSE-100 company. Under the plans, Mr Erginbilgic's overall package of salary, annual bonus and LTIP award will rise to a maximum of more than £13m. Mr Erginbilgic, who joined Rolls-Royce at the beginning of 2023, has engineered a stellar recovery for the company, which had been left fighting for its survival after the COVID pandemic brought global aviation to a near-standstill. He described the company, which supplies engines for the world's leading airlines and is playing a key role in the development of small modular reactors as a source of new nuclear power, as \"a burning platform\" and said it had been poorly managed. \n                  The parking loopholes and tricks every driver should know to beat unfair fines | Money blog\n                 \n                  Gas prices soar 40% amid 'perfect storm' of pressures\n                 \n                  Green Party calls for free bus travel in England for under-22s\n                 City sources said this weekend that the recent announcement of a change of leadership at BP, where Mr Erginbilgic used to work, had highlighted to the Rolls-Royce board the risks of losing him to another blue-chip corporate job. Paradoxically, however, Mr Erginbilgic is likely to earn far less under the new pay policy than he will have done under its existing one. That is a function of the scale of the stock awards handed to him when he joined Rolls-Royce, with its share price in the doldrums. He was given 8.3 million shares - which at the time were worth £7.5m, and are now valued at about £107m. Last year, Mr Erginbilgic earned £4.1m, with the prior year's figure of £13.6m inflated by a £7.5m one-off award to compensate him for money he forfeited by leaving his previous employer, the investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson said: \"The step-change in Rolls-Royce's performance, coupled with competitive pressures in the external environment for world-class talent, necessitates a review of our remuneration policy. \"This is a proactive measure initiated by the remuneration committee with the full support of the Rolls-Royce Board. \"A revised remuneration policy is planned to be presented for shareholder approval at our 2026 AGM.\" Rolls-Royce's valuation has multiplied more than 12-fold since Mr Erginbilgic took the reins, with the shares languishing at just 93.2p on the day prior to him joining the company. On Friday, the stock closed at 1285.5p, giving Britain's proudest industrial name a market capitalisation of £108bn. The scale of its transformation will be underlined in its annual results next month, when it has guided analysts to expect between £3.1bn and £3.2bn of operating profit and free cashflow of more than £3bn. Full details of the new remuneration policy will be outlined in Rolls-Royce's annual report in March. However, the company is understood to have seen the proposals drawn up by Lord Gadhia, the Conservative peer who chairs Rolls-Royce's remuneration committee, given the comprehensive backing of its leading shareholders. \"As a top ten shareholder of Rolls Royce we are supportive of the changes to the remuneration policy,\" Stephen Anness, head of global equities at Invesco, said. \"We struggle to think of a more successful corporate turnaround and resulting value creation. \"Shareholders, our end investors, have benefitted enormously from that value creation and we believe management should be rewarded for that. \"We have seen many examples of egregious pay for poor performance; this is the opposite.\" This weekend, Rolls-Royce declined to comment on the details of its new remuneration policy."

Speaking on Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, the Scottish leader said he believed the Scottish National Party (SNP) had to do \"really well\" in May's vote for there to be another independence referendum. Asked by Phillips whether he thought May's polls were an \"independence election\", Mr Swinney replied: \"I'm being straightforward with people in Scotland that if people in Scotland want Scotland to become independent, the SNP has got to do really well in this forthcoming election.\" He continued: \"It's got to achieve a majority in the Scottish parliament because when that happened before in 2011, it led to a referendum in 2014 and the Scots were able to determine their own constitution.\"  Asked what he would say to Scots if UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer turns down another referendum request, Mr Swinney said: \"I think there's two things about that. \"First of all, the United Kingdom is allegedly a partnership of equals, so Scotland has got a democratic right to decide our own future. \n                  Trump's Maduro raid broke international law, Scottish leader suggests - as PM says US must 'set out justifications'\n                 \n                  Scotland's first minister John Swinney announces bank holiday to celebrate World Cup\n                 \n                  First Minister John Swinney backs Justice Secretary Angela Constance amid threat of no confidence vote in grooming gangs row\n                 \"And secondly, if I win a majority in the Scottish parliament elections in May of this year, I don't think Keir Starmer will be the prime minister.\" The SNP is currently the largest party in the Scottish parliament with 60 MSPs out of 129. The last time Scottish people took to the polls to decide on whether Scotland should gain independence from the UK was in 2014, when more than two million people (55.3%) voted No and 1.6 million (44.7%) voted Yes. Following the defeat, then first minister Alex Salmond stepped down and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon.

The previous Conservative government steadfastly refused to consent to a second referendum.

        "Content": "\n          Home affairs reporter and feature writer\n              @Henry_Vaughan\n Kemi Badenoch led hundreds of protesters in opposition to China's proposed new mega-embassy in central London. Crowds were warned plain clothes Chinese police officers were among those gathered at the site of the former Royal Mint. It was the last chance for demonstrators to voice their concerns ahead of the government's decision on the controversial planning application on Tuesday. Chants of \"mega embassy, mega mistake\", \"don't bow to China\" and \"no mega embassy\" rang out, while protesters raised their middle fingers towards the huge site. The location between the financial districts of the City of London and Canary Wharf has raised security concerns the embassy will be used as a spy hub, while dissidents fear it will be used as a base for repression. The Tory leader took to a makeshift stage next to the site to assure protesters: \"I stand with you\". \"I tell you, I will always fight for freedom. I am calling on the government to stop this decision,\" Ms Badenoch said. \n                  Trump risks end of China trade war truce through Iran tariffs\n                 \n                  Frightening ordeal as Sky News team forced into cars and camera seized - with dissent in China rising dramatically\n                 \n                  Bosses courted to join PM's China trip as embassy verdict looms\n                 \"We do not want a country that spies on our MPs having a super embassy right here, and I will do everything in my power to continue speaking on your behalf.\" Reform UK MP Danny Kruger, Liberal Democrat MP Bobby Dean and Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith were also among the speakers. Sir Iain urged the government to \"wake up\" to the threat from China and said he was not reassured by the apparent lack of intervention from the UK security services. \"The reality is that many in the security services know what the threat is, but they're also kiboshed by the Foreign Office and the government,\" he told Sky News. Some in the crowd carried placards featuring Sir Keir Starmer in compromising positions with Winnie the Pooh - often used to satirise Chinese president Xi Jinping. The government is expected to approve the controversial plans on Tuesday - ahead of the prime minister's expected visit to China later this month. Many in the crowd were members of Chinese, Uighur and Tibetan diasporas in the UK or Hong Kongers exiled because of their pro-democracy activities. Chloe Cheung, 20, who has a HK$1m (around £100,000) bounty on her head and is subject to an arrest warrant, said she already faces repression in the UK from China. \"It's devastating that I have been fighting for democracy, which is one of the British values,\" the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong activist told Sky News. \"I don't have any intention to harm Britain but I have been harassed and threatened every day because of speaking out for democracy.\" She said she was \"horrified\" at the prospect of the new mega embassy, adding: \"The worst-case scenario is someone will kidnap me to the embassy.\" Read more from Sky News:'Violent disorder' at Iran's London embassy leads to 14 arrestsJess's Rule to be advertised in all GP clinics in England China maintains the new embassy is being built to \"promote understanding and friendship\" with the UK and \"develop mutually beneficial co-operation\".

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"It is a normal feature of diplomatic relations for countries to maintain embassies -we have embassies worldwide, including in Beijing. \"It goes without saying that national security has been a priority through this process. In terms of process, the decision will be made independently and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has set out that a decision will be made on or by 20 January.\" Residents' groups have already indicated they plan to challenge any decision to approve planning permission in the courts, so these demonstrations are likely to become a common sight."

        "Content": "Scientists have dismissed warnings from Donald Trump linking paracetamol use during pregnancy to autism. The US president made the allegation in September as he claimed there had been a \"meteoric rise\" in cases of autism. Identifying the medication - known as Tylenol in the States - as a potential cause, Mr Trump suggested pregnant women should \"tough it out\". Now, after reviewing dozens of studies on the topic, experts have concluded there is \"no clinically important\" link between paracetamol use and autism. For the review, scientists identified 43 studies concerning autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disabilities. Then they examined the outcome of pregnancies with and without paracetamol exposure, and found \"paracetamol exposure during pregnancy was not associated with the risk of autism\" or ADHD, or intellectual disabilities. Lead author Asma Khalil of St George's Hospital in London said: \"We found no clinically important increase in the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability among children where the mothers took paracetamol during pregnancy. \n                  The Iranians who want Trump to intervene\n                 \n                  Is Trump about to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis?\n                 \n                  Venezuela's Machado gave Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal in pursuit of a greater prize\n                 \"And this is the important message to the millions of pregnant individuals - paracetamol is safe to use in pregnancy. \"It remains the first-line treatment that we would recommend if pregnant women have pain or fever, and it's also consistent with recommendations or guidelines by various national or international bodies.\" Grainne McAlonan, professor of translational neuroscience at King's College London, highlighted that the review had also examined a number of sibling comparison studies. These studies compared children born to the same mother, where she took paracetamol in one pregnancy, but did not in another. Read more:Health claims made by Trump - and what experts sayUK health officials push back on Trump's autism claims This \"crucial\" factor meant the review also accounted for family history, Professor McAlonan said. She continued: \"Expectant mothers do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far-reaching effects on their child's health. \"While the impact of last year's announcement has been extensive, I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"This major review can, yet again, reassure mothers-to-be everywhere that there is no evidence whatsoever to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism, ADHD or disabilities in their children. \"Our country's leading scientists, doctors and the NHS are clear that paracetamol is safe to take when pregnant and in pain or suffering a fever.\" The review was published in the journal, The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women's Health."

        "Content": "A mother who is among a group of British parents suing TikTok after the deaths of five children has described a hearing in America as \"deeply painful\". Ellen Roome, 49, from Gloucestershire, has been campaigning since her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died at home in Cheltenham in 2022. She travelled to Delaware to attend the hearing in the case filed by the Social Media Victims Law Centre against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The case alleges Jools, Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Noah Gibson, 11, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while trying an online challenge. The bereaved parents believe their children saw the challenge on TikTok - although they don't have proof. TikTok says the data around what their children were watching has likely been deleted under data privacy rules. The parents are suing TikTok in the US for wrongful death, a process that may see them find out what happened to their children, if that data can be recovered. Ms Roome wrote on Facebook: \"Today we had our TikTok hearing. \n                  Parents say their children died taking part in viral trend - now they're set to face TikTok in court\n                 \n                  'I have PTSD after seeing an online suicide at 12': The growing call to ban smartphones in schools\n                 \n                  Cyber flashing just became a priority offence - here's what changes from today\n                 \"We now have to wait for the judge to decide whether the case is dismissed or whether we are allowed to proceed to the discovery stage. \"Sitting through the hearing was incredibly hard. The language was cold, technical and legal. For the court, this is about motions and procedures. For us, it is about our children. Our dead children.\" She went on: \"Listening to lawyers argue abstract points while the reality of our loss sat silently behind every word was deeply painful. This is our lived experience, our grief, and our determination to find the truth and protect other children. \"Whatever the outcome, we showed up. We spoke for our children. And we will keep going. Thank you to everyone who continues to support us.\" Ms Roome sold the financial business she had run for 18 years to campaign for Jools' Law, a right for parents to access their deceased child's data without a court order. She is also pushing for wider changes to social media to improve the safety of children online. Speaking previously about internet safety, she said: \"This is not about banning the internet. It is about stopping platforms being addictive by design, exposing children to harm, and avoiding responsibility when the worst happens. \"Children deserve protection. Parents deserve answers. And tech companies must be held to account. \"We are here to make sure other children are safer.\" Since her son's death, Ms Roome has been trying to obtain data from TikTok and ByteDance which she believes could provide an explanation as to what happened. All five parents believe their children died attempting a dangerous stunt known as the blackout challenge. Around for decades, it's banned on mainstream social media apps, including TikTok. TikTok has applied to dismiss the case, stating UK residents are suing US entities which do not operate or provide the social media firm's services in the UK. It says established US law, such as the First Amendment, bars liability for third-party content on TikTok. A spokesperson for TikTok said: \"Our deepest sympathies remain with these families. We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour. \"Using robust detection systems and dedicated enforcement teams to proactively identify and remove this content, we remove 99% that's found to break these rules before it is reported to us. \"As a company, we comply with the UK's strict data protection laws.\""
