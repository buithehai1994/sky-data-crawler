        "Headline": "Sir Keir Starmer is hoping the evidence will show the trial of two men, charged with spying for China, did not collapse because of government input. Meanwhile, one of those men insists he is \"completely innocent\" and attacked his \"trial by media\".",
        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer remains under pressure over the collapse of a trial into alleged Chinese spies after witness statements revealed the government's deputy national security adviser had warned of significant espionage in the UK. Three witness statements from the government were released late on Wednesday amid confusion about why the prosecutions of two men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates Ex-parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and teacher Christopher Berry, 33, were charged last year with passing politically sensitive information to a Chinese agent between December 2021 and February 2023. They have both denied the allegations, and the case collapsed last month. The director of public prosecutions blamed the government's refusal to brand China a threat, sparking accusations of a \"cover-up\". Sir Keir, who wants a \"strategic and long-term\" relationship with Beijing, used PMQs to announce witness statements from the case, made by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, would be published. The PM has sought to blame the previous Tory government's stance on China for the spying trial collapsing. Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig said Sir Keir \"will hope he's got off the hook\" by publishing the statements, but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say \"they beg more questions than they answer\". So what do the witness statements say? In the first, from December 2023, Mr Collins said \"large scale espionage\" was being carried out against Britain. A second, from February 2025, said Chinese spying threatened the economy. In the documents, it was also revealed information about internal Tory politics - when the party was in government - was being fed to a Chinese intelligence handler known as \"Alex\", according to counterterrorism command SO15. This includes Mr Cash working as a researcher and \"contributing to policy advice being provided to Rishi Sunak\". The evidence adds: \"It is axiomatic that this is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK for the Chinese state to have indirect access to one of the individuals providing policy advice to the now prime minister on China, with the potential to influence that advice.\" In the most recent third document from Mr Collins, dated 4 August, he said the Chinese intelligence services remain \"highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK\". But he also quotes the Labour manifesto from last year's election, saying: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however, that the UK government is committed to pursuing a positive relationship with China to strengthen understanding, cooperation and stability. \"The government's position is that we will co-operate where we can; compete where we need to; and challenge where we must, including on issues of national security.\" Sir Keir had suggested the \"substantive\" evidence in the case was submitted under the Tories, while supplementary statements given also reflected the previous government's position.  Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said the evidence required from the government in the alleged spying case related to whether China could be considered an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act. None of the statements use that word. 'Completely devoid of context' Mr Cash and Mr Berry were both charged under the secrets act. In a statement after the government published the statements, Mr Cash reiterated he was \"completely innocent\" and attacked his \"trial by media\". The collapse of the trial, meaning he can't prove his innocence, has put him in an \"impossible position\", he said. \"At no point did I intentionally assist Chinese intelligence,\" he added. Mr Cash described the statements as \"completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial\".  'Yet more unanswered questions' Sir Keir had previously said the government would not publish the evidence as it would not have been allowed by the CPS - before the CPS then denied this was the case. Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said in a statement the prosecution was dropped after attempts to get more evidence from the government \"over many months\" proved unfruitful. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a statutory inquiry, with the party's foreign affairs spokesperson saying the published statements \"raise yet more unanswered questions\". Calum Miller MP said: \"Did emphasising the government's desire for a positive relationship with China effectively cause this trial to collapse? What evidence was the CPS requesting which the government failed to provide? \"And who was aware of these statements and the evidence being asked for both among ministers and in No 10?\" Sky's Jon Craig said a number of Commons committees are likely to open their own inquiries into the case."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has warned the war in Gaza could resume if Hamas doesn't uphold its end of the ceasefire deal, amid uncertainty over whether the group can return the remaining bodies of Israeli hostages. Under the agreement announced by the US president last week, all remaining 48 captives, dead and alive, were supposed to be returned by this Monday. While all 20 living hostages were returned on Monday, only seven of the dead have been returned and verified. The bodies of two more hostages were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas on Wednesday evening, which - if confirmed - would take the total to nine. Just hours after the latest handover, the Israeli military said a 10th body previously turned over was not that of a hostage - and the confusion added to tensions over the fragile truce that has paused the two-year war. What have Hamas and Trump said? Hamas has previously said recovering the remaining bodies could take time, as not all burial sites are known. In a statement on Wednesday, its armed wing said it has returned all the bodies it could reasonably recover, but specialist equipment would be needed to find the others. Mr Trump, who claimed earlier this week the ceasefire deal had brought \"peace in the Middle East\", told CNN the conflict could restart if he feels Hamas is not upholding its end of the agreement. \"Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,\" he said.  From our experts:Will Trump stay the course over Gaza?Analysis: There is a catch to Trump's Gaza peace deal The return of all the hostages is a key pillar of the deal signed in Egypt on Monday. Israel - which has freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees - had already threatened to keep the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed on Wednesday, and limit aid entering Gaza, due to Hamas not returning all the dead. Meanwhile, the Gaza health ministry said it received 45 more bodies of Palestinians from Israel, another step in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. That brings to 90 the total number of bodies returned to Gaza for burial. The forensics team examining the remains claimed they showed signs of mistreatment. Until the truce began, the two-year war had seen nearly 68,000 Palestinians killed - though the figures from Gaza's health ministry do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken were hostage in Hamas's initial October 7 attacks in 2003.  But in another sign of the tension, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Kassem accused Israel of violating the deal with shootings on Tuesday in Gaza City and the southern city of Rafah. Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said the military is operating along the deployment lines troops withdrew to under the deal, and he warned that anyone approaching the lines will be targeted, as happened on Tuesday with several militants. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Aid trickling in The World Food Programme said its trucks began arriving in Gaza after the entrance of humanitarian aid was paused for two days due to the exchange on Monday and a Jewish holiday on Tuesday. The timing of the scaled-up deliveries - which are also part of the ceasefire deal - had been called into question after Israel said on Tuesday that it would cut the number of trucks allowed into Gaza, saying Hamas was too slow to return the hostages' bodies. Abeer Etefa, spokesperson for the World Food Programme, lauded the trucks' passage but said the situation remained unpredictable. \"We're hopeful that access will improve in the coming days,\" she said. The Egyptian Red Crescent said 400 trucks carrying food, fuel and medical supplies were bound for Gaza on Wednesday."

        "Headline": "After Rachel Reeves told Sky News tax rises were being considered ahead of the November budget, the latest analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests any hikes should be substantial enough to avoid yet more increases in the years ahead.",
        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Rachel Reeves faces the prospect of another \"groundhog day\" unless next month's budget goes further than plugging an estimated Â£22bn black hole in the public finances, according to a respected thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was a \"strong case\" for the chancellor to substantially increase the Â£10bn headroom she has previously given herself against her own debt rules, or risk further repeats of needing to restore the buffer in the years ahead. It said Ms Reeves could bring the cost of servicing government debt down through ending constant chatter over the limited breathing space she has previously given herself, in uncertain times for the global economy. The chancellor herself used an interview with Sky News this week to admit tax rises were being considered, and appeared to concede she was trapped in a \"doom loom\" of annual increases.  What is the chancellor facing? Speculation over the likely contents of the budget has been rife for months and intensified after U-turns by the government on planned welfare reforms and on winter fuel payments. The Office for Budget Responsibility's determination on the size of the black hole facing Ms Reeves could come in well above or below the IFS estimate of Â£22bn, which includes the restoration of the Â£10bn headroom but not the cost of any possible policy announcements such as the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap. Economists broadly agree tax rises are inevitable, as borrowing more would be prohibitive given the bond market's concerns about the UK's fiscal position. Long-term borrowing costs have recently stood at levels not seen since the last century. What are her tax options? While there has been talk of new levies on bank profits and the wealthy, to name but a few rumours, the IFS analysis suggests the best way to raise the bulk of sufficient funds is by hiking income tax, rather than making the tax system even more complicated. Earlier this week, it suggested reforms, such as to property taxes, could raise tens of billions of pounds. But any move on income tax would mean breaking Labour's manifesto pledge not to target the three main sources of revenue from income, employee national insurance contributions and VAT.  She is particularly unlikely to raise VAT, as it would risk fanning the flames of inflation, already expected by the International Monetary Fund to run at the highest rate across the G7 this year and next. Business argues it should be spared. The chancellor's first budget, which raised taxes by Â£40bn, has been blamed by the sector for raising costs in the economy since April via higher minimum pay and employer national insurance contributions. They say the measures have dragged on employment, investment, and growth. Read more:Reeves plots budget boost to entrepreneur tax incentivesFour big themes as IMF takes aim at UK growth and inflation  'A situation of her own making' Analysis by Barclays, revealed within the IFS's Green Budget, suggested inflation was on course to return to target by the middle of next year but that the UK's jobless rate could top 5% from its current 4.8% level. Ms Reeves, who has blamed the challenges she faces on past austerity, Brexit and a continuing drag from the mini-budget of the Liz Truss government in 2022, was urged by the IFS to not harm growth through budget measures. IFS director Helen Miller said: \"Last autumn, the chancellor confidently pronounced she wouldn't be coming back with more tax rises; she almost certainly will. \"For Rachel Reeves, the budget will feel like groundhog day. This is, to a large extent, a situation of her own making. \"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course.\" Ms Miller said there was a \"strong case for the chancellor to build more headroom against her fiscal rules\", adding: \"Persistent uncertainty is damaging to the economic outlook.\"  'No return to austerity' A Treasury spokesperson responded: \"We won't comment on speculation. The chancellor's non-negotiable fiscal rules provide the stability needed to help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth. \"We were the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. They are working day in, day out without getting ahead. \"That needs to change, and that is why the chancellor will continue to relentlessly cut red tape, reform outdated planning rules, and invest in public infrastructure to boost growth - not return to austerity or decline.\" The budget is scheduled for 26 November."

Louise Shackleton had been under investigation for assisted suicide since handing herself in to police after her husband Anthony's death in December. The 59-year-old had been battling motor neurone disease for years and Mrs Shackleton said they had discussed at length his decision to end his life. In April, she told Sky News she accepted she had committed a crime but had no regrets over supporting her husband. But North Yorkshire Police has now confirmed she will face no action. In a statement the force said: \"This has clearly been a complex and sensitive investigation which has required detailed examination by the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Whilst they concluded the evidential test had been met regarding assisted suicide, it was decided not to be in the public interest to prosecute. \"Our thoughts remain with Mr Shackleton's family.\" 'We're treated like criminals' Mrs Shackleton told Sky News she was not surprised by the decision but was critical of the time it had taken. \"In reality, I didn't commit a crime,\" she said. \"The reality is I enabled my husband to get to a place he wanted to be, and to do what he wanted to do. \"I knew nothing would come of it because there was no coercion. \"I could have stopped him, but why would I do that? Why would I stop his will? He died like he lived, with dignity. \"The regret I have is other people are going to have to make this journey and be left in limbo like I've been left in. \"People shouldn't have to go through this. \"In the darkest days of our lives, we're treated like criminals and that is just unfair.\" Mrs Shackleton said she was sad her husband could not choose to die surrounded by his family in his own home. She added: \"It makes me dreadfully sad, and my heart aches that at least one person a week, just from England, is having to make that journey and their loved ones, in the deepest darkest part of their lives, are going to have to go through a police investigation.\" It has been legal to help someone die in Switzerland since 1942 - provided the motive is not \"selfish\". The country's Dignitas group has become well-known as it allows non-Swiss people to use its clinics. Will UK legalise assisted dying? Mrs Shackleton has become a vocal supporter of legislation going through parliament to legalise assisted dying. It would permit a person who is terminally ill and with less than six months to live to legally end their life. The law in the UK currently prohibits people from assisting in the suicide of others, but prosecutions are rare. Opponents to the assisted dying bill have raised concerns about the safety of vulnerable people and the risk of coercion and a change in attitudes toward the elderly, seriously ill and disabled. Read more:What does assisted dying look like?Assisted dying poses 'substantial task' for NHS  Mrs Shackleton chose to speak out publicly to honour a promise made to her husband to push for people to have choice, and believes he would be proud of her campaigning. \"People should have the right to a choice,\" she said. \"I know people will say they don't agree with that, that's absolutely fine, I respect that, but because you don't want something doesn't mean you should stop someone else doing it.\" A final farewell During the police investigation, she avoided opening her husband's laptop in case it would have been needed as evidence. Since the investigation has been closed, she has opened that laptop and found the last letter her husband wrote to her. \"For nearly 10 months I'd been denied that letter, a letter that could have helped a lot,\" she said. \"And I was denied it, and that's wrong.\""

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Britain's hopes of becoming a critical minerals superpower have been dealt a severe blow after one of its leading companies abandoned its plans to build a rare earths refinery near Hull. Pensana had pledged to build a Â£250m refinery on the banks of the Humber, to process rare earths that would have then been used to make magnets for electric cars and wind turbines. The plant promised to create 126 jobs and was due to receive millions of pounds of government funding. However, Sky News has learnt that Pensana has decided to scrap the Hull plant and will instead move its refining operations to the US. Pensana's chairman, Paul Atherley, said the company had taken the decision after the Trump administration committed to buying rare earths from an American mine, Mountain Pass, at a guaranteed price - something no government in Europe had done. \"That's repriced the market - and Washington is looking to do more of these deals, moving at an absolute rate of knots,\" he said. \"Europe and the UK have been talking about critical minerals for ages. But when the Americans do it, they go big and hard, and make it happen. We don't; we mostly just talk about it.\"  The decision comes at a crucial juncture in critical minerals and geopolitics. China produces roughly 90% of all finished rare earth metals - exotic elements essential for the manufacture of many technology, energy and military products. Last week, Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of rare earths, prompting Donald Trump to threaten further 100% tariffs on China. Pensana had been seen as Britain's answer to the periodic panics about the availability of rare earths. The site at Saltend Chemicals Park was chosen by the government to launch its critical minerals strategy in 2022. Visiting for the official groundbreaking, the then business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"This incredible facility will be the only one of its kind in Europe and will help secure the resilience of Britain's supplies into the future.\" He pledged a government grant to support the scheme. That grant was never received because Pensana never built its plant. Read more from Sky News:Analysis: China's rare-earth controlsAirPods link to global trade warTrump threatens extra China tariffs Mr Atherley said he is optimistic about another project he's involved with, to bring lithium refining to Teesside through another company, Tees Valley Lithium. But, he said, rare earth processing is far more complex, energy-intensive and expensive, making it unviable in the UK, for the time being. The decision is a further blow for Britain's chemicals industry, which has faced a series of closures in recent months, including that of Vivergo, a biofuels refiner based in the same chemicals park where Pensana planned to locate its refinery. Producers warn that Britain's record energy costs - higher than most other leading economies - are stifling its economy and triggering an outflow of businesses."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has refused to say if the CIA has the authority to assassinate Venezuela's president, after approving covert operations in the country to tackle alleged drug trafficking. The classified decision, first revealed by The New York Times, marks a significant escalation in efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro's regime. Mr Trump said large amounts of drugs were entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea. \"We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said. When asked why the coastguard wasn't asked to intercept suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been a longstanding US practice, Mr Trump said the approach had been ineffective. \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat,\" he said. He declined to answer whether the CIA has the authority to execute Mr Maduro. The US has offered a $50m (Â£37m) reward for information leading to his arrest, accusing him of connections to drug trafficking and criminal organisations - claims he denies. US targets 'drug boats' Mr Trump also alleged Venezuela had sent a significant number of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the US, though he did not specify the border through which they reportedly entered. On Tuesday, he announced America had targeted a small boat suspected of drug trafficking in waters off the Venezuelan coast, resulting in the deaths of six people. According to the president's post on social media, all those killed were aboard the vessel. Read more from Sky News:Pakistan agrees to ceasefire with Afghanistan afterVenezuela opposition leader wins Nobel Peace Prize The incident marked the fifth such fatal strike in the Caribbean, as the Trump administration continues to classify suspected drug traffickers as unlawful combatants to be confronted with military force. War secretary Pete Hegseth authorised the strike, according to Mr Trump, who released a video of the operation. The black-and-white footage showed a small boat seemingly stationary on the water. It is struck by a projectile from above and explodes, then drifts while burning for several seconds. Mr Trump said the \"lethal kinetic strike\" was in international waters and targeted a boat travelling along a well-known smuggling route. There has also been a significant increase in US military presence in the southern Caribbean, with at least eight warships, a submarine, and F-35 jets stationed in Puerto Rico. US correspondent It's a dramatic - and risky - escalation of US strategy for countering narcotics. Having carried out strikes on Venezuelan \"drug boats\" at sea, Trump says he's \"looking a\"  targeting cartels on land. He claims the attacks, which have claimed 27 lives, have saved up to 50,000 Americans. By framing bombings as a blow against \"narcoterrorists\", he's attempting to justify them as self-defence - but the administration has veered into murky territory. Under international law, such strikes require proof of imminent threat - something the White House has yet to substantiate. Strategically, Trump'ss militarised approach could backfire, forcing traffickers to adapt, and inflaming tensions with Venezuela and allies wary of US intervention. Without transparent evidence or congressional oversight, some will view the move less like counterterrorism and more like vigilantism on the seas. The president's \"bomb the boats\" rhetoric signals a shift back to shock and awe tactics in foreign policy, under the banner of fighting drugs. Supporters will hail it as a bold, decisive move, but to critics it's reckless posturing that undermines international law. The strikes send a message of strength, but the legal, moral and geopolitical costs are still being calculated."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       Children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) from poorer families are being left behind, a report into England's education system warns. The Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, said they are battling both their additional needs and a system stacked against those without money or influence. More than 1.7 million children in England have been identified with SEND, an increase of 5.6% in the past year. And children from low-income households are over-represented in the system. Among those with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan, a legally binding document outlining tailored support, 43.8% are eligible for free school meals, compared with 25.7% nationally. Yet wealthier parents are far more likely to secure an EHC for their child. The Sutton Trust report stated 41% of middle class parents of a child with SEND secured a special school place, compared with only 25% of working class parents of a SEND child. 'Arduous process' One mother, Tiya Currie, described the emotional and financial toll of trying to secure support for her young son. \"We faced constant dismissal and neglect from professionals in both healthcare and education,\" she told Sky News. \"I ultimately had to seek private help to get a diagnosis. After spending almost Â£20,000, in addition to the loss of income and two years of my life, we won our tribunal case. \"My son, Arun, was then placed in a mainstream school with a DLD (developmental language disorder) specialist resource unit. \"I left my career, deferred his school entry, and funded private speech and language therapy while navigating the arduous EHC process.\" Her story is echoed by hundreds of parents surveyed for the Sutton Trust, who described a complex and unequal system that favours those with time, money, and confidence. The report found 65% of working class parents spent nothing on their EHC applications, while 11% of middle class parents spent more than Â£5,000 on private assessments, consultants and legal advice. Those with resources are also more likely to win appeals and secure special school placements. 'Huge emotional and financial cost' Ms Ali, a parent of a child with SEND, told Sky News: \"We were left with no choice, after what felt like a battle of egos, but to go to tribunal. \"The process came at a huge emotional and financial cost with legal fees and specialist reports exceeding Â£10,000 just to secure the support my son was legally entitled to.\" The research also shows children with SEND who are eligible for free school meals consistently achieve lower exam results. Only 7.5% of those with EHC plans secured a grade 4 or higher in English and maths last year, compared with 17.3% of their more affluent peers with the same support. Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said the findings expose a system \"that was meant to level the playing field but is now widening it\". \"Families with fewer resources are being left to fight an impossible battle,\" he said. \"SEND support should not depend on a parent's income.\" Read more from Sky News:Jobs market continues to slowBanks step up lobbying over threat of tax hikes  The Trust is calling for urgent reform, including simpler EHC applications, shorter wait times for diagnosis, and more consistent identification of SEND across schools and local authorities. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said \"chronic underfunding\" had \"exacerbated existing inequalities\". He added: \"It is especially unfair that children with SEND from low-income families face this double whammy of disadvantage.\" What's the government doing about it? The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould MP, said the report highlights \"the stark inequalities and poor outcomes facing SEND families, under the system this government inherited\". \"We're committed to cementing a system that delivers for all families and not just the lucky few, which is why we're engaging with children and parents from a range of backgrounds as we develop plans to ensure all children get the outcomes and life chances they deserve,\" she added. She cited improved teacher training, Â£740m for additional specialist school places, and earlier intervention for speech and language needs. The charity's report surveyed 4,008 parents, 1,273 of whom had a child with SEND."

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions. In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: \"Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. \"Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. \"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.\" FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey. The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico. Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts. President Trump said: \"If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that. \"He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.\" Read more:FIFA president defends 'critical' alliance with TrumpFIFA boss criticised over decision to join Trump tour President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament. They have popped up together at summits and meetings across the world since. The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal. Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the \"radical left\" was taking over Boston. He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei. The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis in what he said was a bid to clean up crime."

After the initial stage of a much-sought ceasefire deal aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza was agreed on by Israel and Hamas, aid has begun to trickle into the devastated region again. According to the DEC, its charities and local partners have been scaling up their work in the Gaza Strip since the agreement took effect last week. It said lorries carrying food and other aid began to enter Gaza on Sunday, with the British Red Cross and Plan International UK among those confirming supplies had made it in.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The government has vowed to pursue a company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone for millions of pounds paid for defective PPE at the height of the COVID pandemic after a High Court deadline passed without repayment. Earlier this month, the High Court ruled that PPE Medpro, a company founded by Baroness Mone's husband Doug Barrowman and promoted in government by the Tory peer, was in breach of contract and gave it two weeks to repay the Â£122m plus interest of Â£23m. In a statement after Wednesday's deadline passed, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash. \"PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over Â£145m, with interest now accruing daily.\" It is understood that is being charged at a rate of 8%. \"We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back where they belong - in our NHS,\" Mr Streeting concluded.  Money latest: How to add 24% to your home's value   Earlier, a spokesman for Mr Barrowman and the consortium behind the company said the government had not responded to an offer from PPE Medpro to discuss a settlement. \"Very disappointingly, the government has made no effort to respond or seek to enter into discussions,\" he said. During the trial PPE Medpro offered to pay Â£23m to settle the case but was rejected by the Department of Health and Social Care. While Mr Barrowman has described himself as the \"ultimate beneficial owner\" of PPE Medpro, and says Â£29m of profit from the deal was paid into a trust benefitting his family including Baroness Mone and her children, he was never a director and the couple are not personally liable for the money.  PPE Medpro filed for insolvency the day before Mrs Justice Cockerill's finding of breach of contract was published, and the company's most recent accounts show assets of just Â£666,000. Court-appointed administrators will now be responsible for recovering as much money as possible on behalf of creditors, principally the DHSC. With PPE Medpro in administration and potentially limited avenues to recover funds, there is a risk that the government may recover nothing while incurring further legal expenses. In June 2020, PPE Medpro won contracts worth a total of Â£203m to provide 210m masks and 25m surgical gowns after Baroness Mone contacted ministers including Michael Gove on the company's behalf. While the Â£81m mask contract was fulfilled the gowns were rejected for failing sterility standards, and in 2022 the DHSC sued. Earlier this month Mrs Justice Cockerill ruled that PPE Medpro was in breach of contract and liable to repay the full amount.  Mr Barrowman has previously named several other companies as part of the gown supply including two registered in the UK, and last week his spokesman said there was a \"strong case\" for the administrator to pursue them for the money. One of the companies named has denied any connection to PPE Medpro and two others have not responded to requests for comment. Insolvency experts say that administrators and creditors, in this case the government, may have some recourse to pursue individuals and entities beyond the liable company, but any process is likely to be lengthy and expensive. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, told Sky News: \"The administrators will want to look at what's happened to what look like significant profits made on these contracts. \"If I was looking at this I would want to establish the exact timeline, at what point were the profits taken out. \"They may also want to consider whether there is a claim for wrongful trading, because that effectively pierces the corporate veil of protection of a limited company, and can allow proceedings against company officers personally. \"The net of a director can also be expanded to shadow directors, people sitting in the background quite clearly with a degree of control of the management of the company, in which case some claims may rest against them.\" A spokesman for Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators of PPE Medpro, did not comment other than to confirm the firm's appointment."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer remains under pressure over the collapse of a trial into alleged Chinese spies after witness statements revealed the government's deputy national security adviser had warned of significant espionage in the UK. Three witness statements from the government were released late on Wednesday amid confusion about why the prosecutions of two men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates Ex-parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and teacher Christopher Berry, 33, were charged last year with passing politically sensitive information to a Chinese agent between December 2021 and February 2023. They have both denied the allegations, and the case collapsed last month. The director of public prosecutions blamed the government's refusal to brand China a threat, sparking accusations of a \"cover-up\". Sir Keir, who wants a \"strategic and long-term\" relationship with Beijing, used PMQs to announce witness statements from the case, made by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, would be published. The PM has sought to blame the previous Tory government's stance on China for the spying trial collapsing. Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig said Sir Keir \"will hope he's got off the hook\" by publishing the statements, but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say \"they beg more questions than they answer\". So what do the witness statements say? In the first, from December 2023, Mr Collins said \"large scale espionage\" was being carried out against Britain. A second, from February 2025, said Chinese spying threatened the economy. In the documents, it was also revealed information about internal Tory politics - when the party was in government - was being fed to a Chinese intelligence handler known as \"Alex\", according to counterterrorism command SO15. This includes Mr Cash working as a researcher and \"contributing to policy advice being provided to Rishi Sunak\". The evidence adds: \"It is axiomatic that this is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK for the Chinese state to have indirect access to one of the individuals providing policy advice to the now prime minister on China, with the potential to influence that advice.\" In the most recent third document from Mr Collins, dated 4 August, he said the Chinese intelligence services remain \"highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK\". But he also quotes the Labour manifesto from last year's election, saying: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however, that the UK government is committed to pursuing a positive relationship with China to strengthen understanding, cooperation and stability. \"The government's position is that we will co-operate where we can; compete where we need to; and challenge where we must, including on issues of national security.\" Sir Keir had suggested the \"substantive\" evidence in the case was submitted under the Tories, while supplementary statements given also reflected the previous government's position.  Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said the evidence required from the government in the alleged spying case related to whether China could be considered an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act. None of the statements use that word. 'Completely devoid of context' Mr Cash and Mr Berry were both charged under the secrets act. In a statement after the government published the statements, Mr Cash reiterated he was \"completely innocent\" and attacked his \"trial by media\". The collapse of the trial, meaning he can't prove his innocence, has put him in an \"impossible position\", he said. \"At no point did I intentionally assist Chinese intelligence,\" he added. Mr Cash described the statements as \"completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial\".  'Yet more unanswered questions' Sir Keir had previously said the government would not publish the evidence as it would not have been allowed by the CPS - before the CPS then denied this was the case. Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said in a statement the prosecution was dropped after attempts to get more evidence from the government \"over many months\" proved unfruitful. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a statutory inquiry, with the party's foreign affairs spokesperson saying the published statements \"raise yet more unanswered questions\". Calum Miller MP said: \"Did emphasising the government's desire for a positive relationship with China effectively cause this trial to collapse? What evidence was the CPS requesting which the government failed to provide? \"And who was aware of these statements and the evidence being asked for both among ministers and in No 10?\" Sky's Jon Craig said a number of Commons committees are likely to open their own inquiries into the case."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Rachel Reeves faces the prospect of another \"groundhog day\" unless next month's budget goes further than plugging an estimated Â£22bn black hole in the public finances, according to a respected thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was a \"strong case\" for the chancellor to substantially increase the Â£10bn headroom she has previously given herself against her own debt rules, or risk further repeats of needing to restore the buffer in the years ahead. It said Ms Reeves could bring the cost of servicing government debt down through ending constant chatter over the limited breathing space she has previously given herself, in uncertain times for the global economy. The chancellor herself used an interview with Sky News this week to admit tax rises were being considered, and appeared to concede she was trapped in a \"doom loom\" of annual increases.  What is the chancellor facing? Speculation over the likely contents of the budget has been rife for months and intensified after U-turns by the government on planned welfare reforms and on winter fuel payments. The Office for Budget Responsibility's determination on the size of the black hole facing Ms Reeves could come in well above or below the IFS estimate of Â£22bn, which includes the restoration of the Â£10bn headroom but not the cost of any possible policy announcements such as the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap. Economists broadly agree tax rises are inevitable, as borrowing more would be prohibitive given the bond market's concerns about the UK's fiscal position. Long-term borrowing costs have recently stood at levels not seen since the last century. What are her tax options? While there has been talk of new levies on bank profits and the wealthy, to name but a few rumours, the IFS analysis suggests the best way to raise the bulk of sufficient funds is by hiking income tax, rather than making the tax system even more complicated. Earlier this week, it suggested reforms, such as to property taxes, could raise tens of billions of pounds. But any move on income tax would mean breaking Labour's manifesto pledge not to target the three main sources of revenue from income, employee national insurance contributions and VAT.  She is particularly unlikely to raise VAT, as it would risk fanning the flames of inflation, already expected by the International Monetary Fund to run at the highest rate across the G7 this year and next. Business argues it should be spared. The chancellor's first budget, which raised taxes by Â£40bn, has been blamed by the sector for raising costs in the economy since April via higher minimum pay and employer national insurance contributions. They say the measures have dragged on employment, investment, and growth. Read more:Reeves plots budget boost to entrepreneur tax incentivesFour big themes as IMF takes aim at UK growth and inflation  'A situation of her own making' Analysis by Barclays, revealed within the IFS's Green Budget, suggested inflation was on course to return to target by the middle of next year but that the UK's jobless rate could top 5% from its current 4.8% level. Ms Reeves, who has blamed the challenges she faces on past austerity, Brexit and a continuing drag from the mini-budget of the Liz Truss government in 2022, was urged by the IFS to not harm growth through budget measures. IFS director Helen Miller said: \"Last autumn, the chancellor confidently pronounced she wouldn't be coming back with more tax rises; she almost certainly will. \"For Rachel Reeves, the budget will feel like groundhog day. This is, to a large extent, a situation of her own making. \"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course.\" Ms Miller said there was a \"strong case for the chancellor to build more headroom against her fiscal rules\", adding: \"Persistent uncertainty is damaging to the economic outlook.\"  'No return to austerity' A Treasury spokesperson responded: \"We won't comment on speculation. The chancellor's non-negotiable fiscal rules provide the stability needed to help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth. \"We were the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. They are working day in, day out without getting ahead. \"That needs to change, and that is why the chancellor will continue to relentlessly cut red tape, reform outdated planning rules, and invest in public infrastructure to boost growth - not return to austerity or decline.\" The budget is scheduled for 26 November."

Louise Shackleton had been under investigation for assisted suicide since handing herself in to police after her husband Anthony's death in December. The 59-year-old had been battling motor neurone disease for years and Mrs Shackleton said they had discussed at length his decision to end his life. In April, she told Sky News she accepted she had committed a crime but had no regrets over supporting her husband. But North Yorkshire Police has now confirmed she will face no action. In a statement the force said: \"This has clearly been a complex and sensitive investigation which has required detailed examination by the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Whilst they concluded the evidential test had been met regarding assisted suicide, it was decided not to be in the public interest to prosecute. \"Our thoughts remain with Mr Shackleton's family.\" 'We're treated like criminals' Mrs Shackleton told Sky News she was not surprised by the decision but was critical of the time it had taken. \"In reality, I didn't commit a crime,\" she said. \"The reality is I enabled my husband to get to a place he wanted to be, and to do what he wanted to do. \"I knew nothing would come of it because there was no coercion. \"I could have stopped him, but why would I do that? Why would I stop his will? He died like he lived, with dignity. \"The regret I have is other people are going to have to make this journey and be left in limbo like I've been left in. \"People shouldn't have to go through this. \"In the darkest days of our lives, we're treated like criminals and that is just unfair.\" Mrs Shackleton said she was sad her husband could not choose to die surrounded by his family in his own home. She added: \"It makes me dreadfully sad, and my heart aches that at least one person a week, just from England, is having to make that journey and their loved ones, in the deepest darkest part of their lives, are going to have to go through a police investigation.\" It has been legal to help someone die in Switzerland since 1942 - provided the motive is not \"selfish\". The country's Dignitas group has become well-known as it allows non-Swiss people to use its clinics. Will UK legalise assisted dying? Mrs Shackleton has become a vocal supporter of legislation going through parliament to legalise assisted dying. It would permit a person who is terminally ill and with less than six months to live to legally end their life. The law in the UK currently prohibits people from assisting in the suicide of others, but prosecutions are rare. Opponents to the assisted dying bill have raised concerns about the safety of vulnerable people and the risk of coercion and a change in attitudes toward the elderly, seriously ill and disabled. Read more:What does assisted dying look like?Assisted dying poses 'substantial task' for NHS  Mrs Shackleton chose to speak out publicly to honour a promise made to her husband to push for people to have choice, and believes he would be proud of her campaigning. \"People should have the right to a choice,\" she said. \"I know people will say they don't agree with that, that's absolutely fine, I respect that, but because you don't want something doesn't mean you should stop someone else doing it.\" A final farewell During the police investigation, she avoided opening her husband's laptop in case it would have been needed as evidence. Since the investigation has been closed, she has opened that laptop and found the last letter her husband wrote to her. \"For nearly 10 months I'd been denied that letter, a letter that could have helped a lot,\" she said. \"And I was denied it, and that's wrong.\""

The Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, said they are battling both their additional needs and a system stacked against those without money or influence. More than 1.7 million children in England have been identified with SEND, an increase of 5.6% in the past year. And children from low-income households are over-represented in the system. Among those with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan, a legally binding document outlining tailored support, 43.8% are eligible for free school meals, compared with 25.7% nationally. Yet wealthier parents are far more likely to secure an EHC for their child. The Sutton Trust report stated 41% of middle class parents of a child with SEND secured a special school place, compared with only 25% of working class parents of a SEND child. 'Arduous process' One mother, Tiya Currie, described the emotional and financial toll of trying to secure support for her young son. \"We faced constant dismissal and neglect from professionals in both healthcare and education,\" she told Sky News. \"I ultimately had to seek private help to get a diagnosis. After spending almost Â£20,000, in addition to the loss of income and two years of my life, we won our tribunal case. \"My son, Arun, was then placed in a mainstream school with a DLD (developmental language disorder) specialist resource unit. \"I left my career, deferred his school entry, and funded private speech and language therapy while navigating the arduous EHC process.\" Her story is echoed by hundreds of parents surveyed for the Sutton Trust, who described a complex and unequal system that favours those with time, money, and confidence. The report found 65% of working class parents spent nothing on their EHC applications, while 11% of middle class parents spent more than Â£5,000 on private assessments, consultants and legal advice. Those with resources are also more likely to win appeals and secure special school placements. 'Huge emotional and financial cost' Ms Ali, a parent of a child with SEND, told Sky News: \"We were left with no choice, after what felt like a battle of egos, but to go to tribunal. \"The process came at a huge emotional and financial cost with legal fees and specialist reports exceeding Â£10,000 just to secure the support my son was legally entitled to.\" The research also shows children with SEND who are eligible for free school meals consistently achieve lower exam results. Only 7.5% of those with EHC plans secured a grade 4 or higher in English and maths last year, compared with 17.3% of their more affluent peers with the same support. Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said the findings expose a system \"that was meant to level the playing field but is now widening it\". \"Families with fewer resources are being left to fight an impossible battle,\" he said. \"SEND support should not depend on a parent's income.\" Read more from Sky News:Jobs market continues to slowBanks step up lobbying over threat of tax hikes  The Trust is calling for urgent reform, including simpler EHC applications, shorter wait times for diagnosis, and more consistent identification of SEND across schools and local authorities. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said \"chronic underfunding\" had \"exacerbated existing inequalities\". He added: \"It is especially unfair that children with SEND from low-income families face this double whammy of disadvantage.\" What's the government doing about it? The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould MP, said the report highlights \"the stark inequalities and poor outcomes facing SEND families, under the system this government inherited\". \"We're committed to cementing a system that delivers for all families and not just the lucky few, which is why we're engaging with children and parents from a range of backgrounds as we develop plans to ensure all children get the outcomes and life chances they deserve,\" she added. She cited improved teacher training, Â£740m for additional specialist school places, and earlier intervention for speech and language needs. The charity's report surveyed 4,008 parents, 1,273 of whom had a child with SEND."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Britain's hopes of becoming a critical minerals superpower have been dealt a severe blow after one of its leading companies abandoned its plans to build a rare earths refinery near Hull. Pensana had pledged to build a Â£250m refinery on the banks of the Humber, to process rare earths that would have then been used to make magnets for electric cars and wind turbines. The plant promised to create 126 jobs and was due to receive millions of pounds of government funding. However, Sky News has learnt that Pensana has decided to scrap the Hull plant and will instead move its refining operations to the US. Pensana's chairman, Paul Atherley, said the company had taken the decision after the Trump administration committed to buying rare earths from an American mine, Mountain Pass, at a guaranteed price - something no government in Europe had done. \"That's repriced the market - and Washington is looking to do more of these deals, moving at an absolute rate of knots,\" he said. \"Europe and the UK have been talking about critical minerals for ages. But when the Americans do it, they go big and hard, and make it happen. We don't; we mostly just talk about it.\"  The decision comes at a crucial juncture in critical minerals and geopolitics. China produces roughly 90% of all finished rare earth metals - exotic elements essential for the manufacture of many technology, energy and military products. Last week, Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of rare earths, prompting Donald Trump to threaten further 100% tariffs on China. Pensana had been seen as Britain's answer to the periodic panics about the availability of rare earths. The site at Saltend Chemicals Park was chosen by the government to launch its critical minerals strategy in 2022. Visiting for the official groundbreaking, the then business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"This incredible facility will be the only one of its kind in Europe and will help secure the resilience of Britain's supplies into the future.\" He pledged a government grant to support the scheme. That grant was never received because Pensana never built its plant. Read more from Sky News:Analysis: China's rare-earth controlsAirPods link to global trade warTrump threatens extra China tariffs Mr Atherley said he is optimistic about another project he's involved with, to bring lithium refining to Teesside through another company, Tees Valley Lithium. But, he said, rare earth processing is far more complex, energy-intensive and expensive, making it unviable in the UK, for the time being. The decision is a further blow for Britain's chemicals industry, which has faced a series of closures in recent months, including that of Vivergo, a biofuels refiner based in the same chemicals park where Pensana planned to locate its refinery. Producers warn that Britain's record energy costs - higher than most other leading economies - are stifling its economy and triggering an outflow of businesses."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The government has vowed to pursue a company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone for millions of pounds paid for defective PPE at the height of the COVID pandemic after a High Court deadline passed without repayment. Earlier this month, the High Court ruled that PPE Medpro, a company founded by Baroness Mone's husband Doug Barrowman and promoted in government by the Tory peer, was in breach of contract and gave it two weeks to repay the Â£122m plus interest of Â£23m. In a statement after Wednesday's deadline passed, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash. \"PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over Â£145m, with interest now accruing daily.\" It is understood that is being charged at a rate of 8%. \"We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back where they belong - in our NHS,\" Mr Streeting concluded.  Money latest: How to add 24% to your home's value   Earlier, a spokesman for Mr Barrowman and the consortium behind the company said the government had not responded to an offer from PPE Medpro to discuss a settlement. \"Very disappointingly, the government has made no effort to respond or seek to enter into discussions,\" he said. During the trial PPE Medpro offered to pay Â£23m to settle the case but was rejected by the Department of Health and Social Care. While Mr Barrowman has described himself as the \"ultimate beneficial owner\" of PPE Medpro, and says Â£29m of profit from the deal was paid into a trust benefitting his family including Baroness Mone and her children, he was never a director and the couple are not personally liable for the money.  PPE Medpro filed for insolvency the day before Mrs Justice Cockerill's finding of breach of contract was published, and the company's most recent accounts show assets of just Â£666,000. Court-appointed administrators will now be responsible for recovering as much money as possible on behalf of creditors, principally the DHSC. With PPE Medpro in administration and potentially limited avenues to recover funds, there is a risk that the government may recover nothing while incurring further legal expenses. In June 2020, PPE Medpro won contracts worth a total of Â£203m to provide 210m masks and 25m surgical gowns after Baroness Mone contacted ministers including Michael Gove on the company's behalf. While the Â£81m mask contract was fulfilled the gowns were rejected for failing sterility standards, and in 2022 the DHSC sued. Earlier this month Mrs Justice Cockerill ruled that PPE Medpro was in breach of contract and liable to repay the full amount.  Mr Barrowman has previously named several other companies as part of the gown supply including two registered in the UK, and last week his spokesman said there was a \"strong case\" for the administrator to pursue them for the money. One of the companies named has denied any connection to PPE Medpro and two others have not responded to requests for comment. Insolvency experts say that administrators and creditors, in this case the government, may have some recourse to pursue individuals and entities beyond the liable company, but any process is likely to be lengthy and expensive. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, told Sky News: \"The administrators will want to look at what's happened to what look like significant profits made on these contracts. \"If I was looking at this I would want to establish the exact timeline, at what point were the profits taken out. \"They may also want to consider whether there is a claim for wrongful trading, because that effectively pierces the corporate veil of protection of a limited company, and can allow proceedings against company officers personally. \"The net of a director can also be expanded to shadow directors, people sitting in the background quite clearly with a degree of control of the management of the company, in which case some claims may rest against them.\" A spokesman for Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators of PPE Medpro, did not comment other than to confirm the firm's appointment."

        "Content": "Donald Trump has warned the war in Gaza could resume if Hamas doesn't uphold its end of the ceasefire deal, amid uncertainty over whether the group can return the remaining bodies of Israeli hostages. Under the agreement announced by the US president last week, all remaining 48 captives, dead and alive, were supposed to be returned by this Monday. While all 20 living hostages were returned on Monday, only seven of the dead have been returned and verified. The bodies of two more hostages were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas on Wednesday evening, which - if confirmed - would take the total to nine. Just hours after the latest handover, the Israeli military said a 10th body previously turned over was not that of a hostage - and the confusion added to tensions over the fragile truce that has paused the two-year war. What have Hamas and Trump said? Hamas has previously said recovering the remaining bodies could take time, as not all burial sites are known. In a statement on Wednesday, its armed wing said it has returned all the bodies it could reasonably recover, but specialist equipment would be needed to find the others. Mr Trump, who claimed earlier this week the ceasefire deal had brought \"peace in the Middle East\", told CNN the conflict could restart if he feels Hamas is not upholding its end of the agreement. \"Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,\" he said.  From our experts:Will Trump stay the course over Gaza?Analysis: There is a catch to Trump's Gaza peace deal The return of all the hostages is a key pillar of the deal signed in Egypt on Monday. Israel - which has freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees - had already threatened to keep the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed on Wednesday, and limit aid entering Gaza, due to Hamas not returning all the dead. Meanwhile, the Gaza health ministry said it received 45 more bodies of Palestinians from Israel, another step in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. That brings to 90 the total number of bodies returned to Gaza for burial. The forensics team examining the remains claimed they showed signs of mistreatment. Until the truce began, the two-year war had seen nearly 68,000 Palestinians killed - though the figures from Gaza's health ministry do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken were hostage in Hamas's initial October 7 attacks in 2003.  But in another sign of the tension, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Kassem accused Israel of violating the deal with shootings on Tuesday in Gaza City and the southern city of Rafah. Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said the military is operating along the deployment lines troops withdrew to under the deal, and he warned that anyone approaching the lines will be targeted, as happened on Tuesday with several militants. ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ Aid trickling in The World Food Programme said its trucks began arriving in Gaza after the entrance of humanitarian aid was paused for two days due to the exchange on Monday and a Jewish holiday on Tuesday. The timing of the scaled-up deliveries - which are also part of the ceasefire deal - had been called into question after Israel said on Tuesday that it would cut the number of trucks allowed into Gaza, saying Hamas was too slow to return the hostages' bodies. Abeer Etefa, spokesperson for the World Food Programme, lauded the trucks' passage but said the situation remained unpredictable. \"We're hopeful that access will improve in the coming days,\" she said. The Egyptian Red Crescent said 400 trucks carrying food, fuel and medical supplies were bound for Gaza on Wednesday."

After raising more than Â£50m since the Middle East Humanitarian Appeal was launched last October, the DEC is renewing calls for donations, saying Â£10 could provide blankets for two people, while Â£50 could provide emergency food for five families for one week.

They're also distributing clean water, medicine, food, and nutrition support. On its website, the DEC pointed to how famine was declared in Gaza City in August as it appealed for funds saying: \"Your support can save lives.\" You can donate to the Middle East Humanitarian Appeal at dec.org.uk.

        "Content": " Donald Trump has refused to say if the CIA has the authority to assassinate Venezuela's president, after approving covert operations in the country to tackle alleged drug trafficking. The classified decision, first revealed by The New York Times, marks a significant escalation in efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro's regime. Mr Trump said large amounts of drugs were entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea. \"We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said. When asked why the coastguard wasn't asked to intercept suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been a longstanding US practice, Mr Trump said the approach had been ineffective. \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat,\" he said. He declined to answer whether the CIA has the authority to execute Mr Maduro. The US has offered a $50m (Â£37m) reward for information leading to his arrest, accusing him of connections to drug trafficking and criminal organisations - claims he denies. US targets 'drug boats' Mr Trump also alleged Venezuela had sent a significant number of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the US, though he did not specify the border through which they reportedly entered. On Tuesday, he announced America had targeted a small boat suspected of drug trafficking in waters off the Venezuelan coast, resulting in the deaths of six people. According to the president's post on social media, all those killed were aboard the vessel. Read more from Sky News:Pakistan agrees to ceasefire with Afghanistan afterVenezuela opposition leader wins Nobel Peace Prize The incident marked the fifth such fatal strike in the Caribbean, as the Trump administration continues to classify suspected drug traffickers as unlawful combatants to be confronted with military force. War secretary Pete Hegseth authorised the strike, according to Mr Trump, who released a video of the operation. The black-and-white footage showed a small boat seemingly stationary on the water. It is struck by a projectile from above and explodes, then drifts while burning for several seconds. Mr Trump said the \"lethal kinetic strike\" was in international waters and targeted a boat travelling along a well-known smuggling route. There has also been a significant increase in US military presence in the southern Caribbean, with at least eight warships, a submarine, and F-35 jets stationed in Puerto Rico. US correspondent It's a dramatic - and risky - escalation of US strategy for countering narcotics. Having carried out strikes on Venezuelan \"drug boats\" at sea, Trump says he's \"looking a\"  targeting cartels on land. He claims the attacks, which have claimed 27 lives, have saved up to 50,000 Americans. By framing bombings as a blow against \"narcoterrorists\", he's attempting to justify them as self-defence - but the administration has veered into murky territory. Under international law, such strikes require proof of imminent threat - something the White House has yet to substantiate. Strategically, Trump'ss militarised approach could backfire, forcing traffickers to adapt, and inflaming tensions with Venezuela and allies wary of US intervention. Without transparent evidence or congressional oversight, some will view the move less like counterterrorism and more like vigilantism on the seas. The president's \"bomb the boats\" rhetoric signals a shift back to shock and awe tactics in foreign policy, under the banner of fighting drugs. Supporters will hail it as a bold, decisive move, but to critics it's reckless posturing that undermines international law. The strikes send a message of strength, but the legal, moral and geopolitical costs are still being calculated."

        "Content": " An inter-Arab security force should be set up in Gaza within weeks to prevent Hamas from retaking control, Israel's former prime minister Ehud Barak has said. Asked by Sky News chief presenter Mark Austin if intervention was necessary to prevent Hamas from filling the current power vacuum inside the Strip, Mr Barak said he believed a force was needed, but it should not be international. \"An inter-Arab force should be there in a few weeks, not several months,\" he said, warning that the group's readiness to give up its arms will decrease over time. Mr Barak also said the \"only condition for success\" in the ceasefire plan for Gaza was the \"determination\" of Donald Trump. He said there were concerns that the US president \"might lose his attention to the issue\" and that his plan to bring the war to a conclusion \"will take time\". \"It cannot happen overnight. But the zeitgeist, the atmosphere in the world and the pressure on both sides to find a solution is created in front of our eyes. So it's very promising.\" Follow the latest updates from Gaza However, he said the war with Hamas over the last few months has harmed Israel's international reputation, and it would take time to fix that damage. \"It's killed our positioning in the world,\" he said. \"It's huge damage. It will take probably a generation to correct it. \"It created a feeling in the world that Israel probably executed war crimes.\" From our experts:Will Trump stay the course over Gaza?Analysis: There is a catch to Trump's Gaza peace deal According to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, nearly 68,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began in 2023 - when more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. The Hamas-run ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says half of that number were women and children. The war has also flattened huge swathes of Gaza and left nearly 170,000 people wounded, according to the ministry.  Palestinian state 'only sustainable' solution Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"turned Hamas' military defeat a year ago into an unprecedented diplomatic and political success and brought back the Palestinian issue,\" Mr Barak said. His comments refer to the creation of a Palestinian state, which he said was \"the only sustainable\" solution. \"Any other solution will break,\" Mr Barak said. \"And it's not because we have special sentiments to the lives of the Palestinians, it's because of our own interests.\" \"Israel has a compelling imperative to separate from the Palestinians. If there is only one entity reigning over this whole area, namely Israel, it will become inevitably either non-Jewish or non-democratic.\" Calls for Hamas to disarm It comes after aid trucks rolled into Gaza following a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that threatened Israel's nascent ceasefire deal with Hamas. Israel has threatened to reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly. The militant group returned four bodies confirmed as dead hostages on Monday, as well as another four late on Tuesday, but Israeli authorities have said one of those bodies was not that of a hostage. Several other issues are yet to be resolved, with later phases of the truce plan calling for Hamas to disarm and give up power, which it has so far refused to do. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump appeared to threaten Hamas over the issue, telling a press conference: \"If Hamas doesn't disarm, we will disarm them - perhaps violently.\" Meanwhile, Hamas has launched a security crackdown in Gaza, carrying out public executions and clashing with local clans."

The US president stepped up his criticism of crime in Democrat-run cities at the White House after previously claiming California could be stripped of matches at the FIFA event next year, and at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. FIFA President Gianni Infantino is a close ally of President Trump's - attending his Gaza peace summit in Egypt this week - and is not pushing back on his World Cup interventions. In a statement to Sky News, FIFA said: \"Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. \"Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety. \"We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfill all necessary requirements.\" FIFA did not directly comment on changing any of the 11 venues in the US for the expanded 48-team men's football World Cup which will see the Americans host 78 of the 104 fixtures, including the final in New Jersey. The remaining games are in Canada and Mexico. Boston does not have matches itself, but the home of the NFL's New England Patriots is being used by FIFA for seven matches, 30 miles away in Foxborough, Massachusetts. President Trump said: \"If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni - the head of FIFA who's phenomenal - and I would say, 'Let's move into another location,' and they would do that. \"He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.\" Read more:FIFA president defends 'critical' alliance with TrumpFIFA boss criticised over decision to join Trump tour President Trump and Mr Infantino first encountered each other during Mr Trump's first term in office, when the US was awarded the right to host next year's tournament.

The FIFA president was even among those in attendance as Mr Trump and world leaders signed the recent Israel-Gaza peace deal. Earlier this week, President Trump slammed Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and said the \"radical left\" was taking over Boston. He made the comments while hosting Argentine president Javier Milei. The Trump administration has already deployed National Guard troops to Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis in what he said was a bid to clean up crime."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer remains under pressure over the collapse of a trial into alleged Chinese spies after witness statements revealed the government's deputy national security adviser had warned of significant espionage in the UK. Three witness statements from the government were released late on Wednesday amid confusion about why the prosecutions of two men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates Ex-parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and teacher Christopher Berry, 33, were charged last year with passing politically sensitive information to a Chinese agent between December 2021 and February 2023. They have both denied the allegations, and the case collapsed last month. The director of public prosecutions blamed the government's refusal to brand China a threat, sparking accusations of a \"cover-up\". Sir Keir, who wants a \"strategic and long-term\" relationship with Beijing, used PMQs to announce witness statements from the case, made by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, would be published. The PM has sought to blame the previous Tory government's stance on China for the spying trial collapsing. Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig said Sir Keir \"will hope he's got off the hook\" by publishing the statements, but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say \"they beg more questions than they answer\". So what do the witness statements say? In the first, from December 2023, Mr Collins said \"large scale espionage\" was being carried out against Britain. A second, from February 2025, said Chinese spying threatened the economy. In the documents, it was also revealed information about internal Tory politics - when the party was in government - was being fed to a Chinese intelligence handler known as \"Alex\", according to counterterrorism command SO15. This includes Mr Cash working as a researcher and \"contributing to policy advice being provided to Rishi Sunak\". The evidence adds: \"It is axiomatic that this is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK for the Chinese state to have indirect access to one of the individuals providing policy advice to the now prime minister on China, with the potential to influence that advice.\" In the most recent third document from Mr Collins, dated 4 August, he said the Chinese intelligence services remain \"highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK\". But he also quotes the Labour manifesto from last year's election, saying: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however, that the UK government is committed to pursuing a positive relationship with China to strengthen understanding, cooperation and stability. \"The government's position is that we will co-operate where we can; compete where we need to; and challenge where we must, including on issues of national security.\" Sir Keir had suggested the \"substantive\" evidence in the case was submitted under the Tories, while supplementary statements given also reflected the previous government's position.  Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said the evidence required from the government in the alleged spying case related to whether China could be considered an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act. None of the statements use that word. 'Completely devoid of context' Mr Cash and Mr Berry were both charged under the secrets act. In a statement after the government published the statements, Mr Cash reiterated he was \"completely innocent\" and attacked his \"trial by media\". The collapse of the trial, meaning he can't prove his innocence, has put him in an \"impossible position\", he said. \"At no point did I intentionally assist Chinese intelligence,\" he added. Mr Cash described the statements as \"completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial\".  'Yet more unanswered questions' Sir Keir had previously said the government would not publish the evidence as it would not have been allowed by the CPS - before the CPS then denied this was the case. Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said in a statement the prosecution was dropped after attempts to get more evidence from the government \"over many months\" proved unfruitful. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a statutory inquiry, with the party's foreign affairs spokesperson saying the published statements \"raise yet more unanswered questions\". Calum Miller MP said: \"Did emphasising the government's desire for a positive relationship with China effectively cause this trial to collapse? What evidence was the CPS requesting which the government failed to provide? \"And who was aware of these statements and the evidence being asked for both among ministers and in No 10?\" Sky's Jon Craig said a number of Commons committees are likely to open their own inquiries into the case."

        "Content": "Pakistan says it has agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire with Afghanistan following days of bloody cross-border violence. The announcement came after Afghanistan's capital city was rocked by an explosion on Wednesday afternoon. In one video circulating on social media, and verified by Sky News, huge plumes of black smoke can be seen rising from a road in western Kabul. However, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed in a post on X that an oil tanker had exploded in the city and that \"no one should worry\". Then, Pakistani security sources told Sky News it had carried out \"precision strikes\" in Kabul and Kandahar provinces on Afghan Taliban and Pakistan Taliban targets, that the targets were isolated from civilians and had been \"successfully destroyed\". Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said the ceasefire was at Afghanistan's request and that it would be for 48 hours.

All Afghan forces have been instructed to observe the ceasefire \"as long as no one violates it,\" Mujahid added. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring armed groups, a charge rejected by the country's Taliban rulers. Pakistan is grappling with militant attacks that have increased since 2021, when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan. The escalation of tensions is likely to destabilise a region where groups, including the Islamic State and al-Qaida, are trying to establish a foothold and resurface. Read more from Sky News:Borders closed between Pakistan and Afghanistan amid clashesTaliban won't 'hand back' Bagram airbase to US  Before the ceasefire announcement, Pakistan said its troops killed dozens of Afghan security forces and militants in overnight fighting. The clashes had stopped briefly on Sunday following appeals from major regional powers, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 'Fierce response' Security sources told Sky News other clashes had broken out in Kurram - a border region - where Afghan, Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij fighters had opened fire \"without provocation\". This had provoked a \"strong and fierce response\" from the Pakistan Army, which forced them to flee, abandoning their weapons and vehicles. Taliban posts suffered heavy damage - including the destruction of a tank. Pakistani forces said they had repelled \"unprovoked\" assaults, but denied targeting civilians after the Taliban government said more than a dozen were killed and over 100 others wounded when Pakistan targeted another site in a border area of Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province. Pakistan's army also targeted militant hideouts in the Afghan capital, two Pakistani security officials said."

        "Headline": "There's speculation Donald Trump is about to rubber stamp long-range Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine. It would be a major boost to Kyiv - but Russia has warned of a \"serious escalation\".",
        "Content": " Donald Trump is considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - but what makes them different to current weapons, and could they make a difference? Here's what you need to know about the US-made missiles, why Ukraine wants them, and what Russia has said in response. What exactly is a Tomahawk? It's a type of long-range cruise missile, propelled by a jet engine and guided by on-board GPS. Made by American firm Raytheon, they're used by militaries including the US, UK, Australia and the Netherlands - and cost an average of $1.3m (Â£973,000) each. The 6m-long (20ft) missile has a 1,000lb warhead (approximately 450kg) and an onboard camera. The latest variants can \"loiter\" near a target and be reprogrammed during flight to switch targets. \"You can leave it quite late until you decide on the target,\" defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke told Sky's weekly Ukraine Q&A. \"So you can go for something that might be moving around... you can choose your target dynamically as things might alter on the ground.\" Tomahawks fly at high subsonic speeds and at low altitudes, making them difficult to detect by ground radar even in heavily guarded airspace - and they are extremely accurate. Crucially for Ukraine, they have a range of about 1,500 miles, which would massively expand its range of possible targets within Russia. Ukraine currently uses weapons such as the British Storm Shadow missile and the US Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). These have a range of only about 150-200 miles, limiting targets to those relatively close to Ukraine's border. What are Storm Shadow missiles? Tomahawks are typically launched from a ship or submarine - but Ukraine would likely need to fire them from land. America's Typhon missile system has this capability; whether these would also be provided under a potential deal or if Ukraine would use another solution is unclear. First used in the Gulf War in 1991, Tomahawks were most recently used by the UK and US navies to hit Houthi rebel targets in Yemen. Could they change the war - and could Moscow be targeted? It's too early to say for certain the impact they might have, or if they could push Vladimir Putin towards meaningful negotiations. Sky News foreign correspondent Alistair Bunkall says they would be a \"very valuable weapon\", though perhaps not the \"game-changer\" some are hoping for.  He says the key advantage would be \"massive firepower to target key Russian infrastructure deep inside Russia\". Professor Clarke says the Tomahawks would probably be used to attack transport choke points and Russian assets just behind the frontline, so they can't be brought forward. Oil depots, marshalling yards, convoys of stationary vehicles - and the factories churning out the drones blighting Ukraine's skies - would also be likely targets. Hitting Moscow would be \"pointless\" and \"foolish\", adds Professor Clarke, \"unless they want to make a political point that might go wrong on them\". The fact that Russia has been making regular statements about the Tomahawk speculation shows they are concerned, he says. \"Certainly, the Russians are worried about Tomahawks. They carry a reasonably heavy warhead, they're hard to defend against, and they're accurate. \"The Ukrainians could use them to good effect to really put a spanner in the works of this creeping offensive that the Russians have been conducting all year.\" What has Russia said? Mr Putin's spokesperson said Tomahawks won't change the frontlines in Ukraine, but admitted the issue was \"of extreme concern\" and would be a \"serious escalation\". \"Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,\" he told Russian state TV on Sunday. He warned that certain Tomahawk variants can also carry nuclear warheads - something Moscow would have to consider if they are fired into its territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \"Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying, and we know that it could be nuclear. \"What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react? Military experts overseas should understand this.\" Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev also warned of potentially dangerous consequences, saying he hoped it was \"another empty threat\" from the US leader.  There is speculation Mr Trump could approve the missiles as early as Friday, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington. But the president has also given himself room to keep the threat on the shelf if he chooses. There are concerns that it could escalate the war and significantly increase tensions between the two nuclear powers. Speaking on Air Force One while travelling to Israel, he told reporters he was thinking about issuing an ultimatum after growing tired of Russia's reticence to end the war. \"I might say, 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks,'\" the president said. He called the Tomahawk an \"incredible weapon\" that Russia \"does not need\". \"I might tell them that if the war is not settled - that we may very well [provide the Tomahawks].\" He added: \"We may not, but we may do it. I think it's appropriate to bring up.\" Read more:Ukraine strikes Crimea oil depot and explosives factoryThe frontrunners to replace Putin - and who 'smart money' is on Alistair Bunkall says Mr Trump signing off on the missiles would be \"diplomatically huge\" and follow his about-turn at the UN General Assembly, where the president suggested Ukraine could still win the war and regain all its lost territory. Mr Zelenskyy has said getting the missiles would be \"significant\" and suggested he had already given the president an idea of how many of the missiles he would like. \"Frankly, I've already shared our vision with Trump... but some of these things are not for a phone conversation, so we'llmeet,\" he told reporters in Kyiv on Monday. And, in what could be a sign of what's to come, senior Ukrainian officials were in America on Wednesday and met executives from US weapons firms, including Tomahawk-maker Raytheon."

        "Content": " Six suspected drug smugglers have been killed in a US attack on a boat near Venezuela's coast, Donald Trump has said. The US president said intelligence had confirmed it was carrying drugs and associated with \"illicit narcoterrorist networks\". Mr Trump said Tuesday's \"lethal kinetic strike\" was in international waters as the boat travelled an established smuggling route. He posted a video on Truth Social showing it left in flames after what appears to be a single aerial strike. It's the fifth attack since the start of September after the Pentagon said the president had ruled the US was in an \"armed conflict\" with cartels. Mr Trump previously said the cartels were a threat to US \"national security, foreign policy, and vital US interests\". However, some experts argue the explanation for destroying the boats does not meet the requirements under the laws of war. Limited detail has been given about those killed in the attacks, the exact cargo being carried and where the boats were heading. After the first attack, the president said the boat belonged to Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua - designated a terror group by the US in February. However, the Venezuelan government claims the group was dismantled in 2023. There has been a large build up of US forces in the southern Caribbean, including at least eight warships, a submarine, and F-35 jets in Puerto Rico. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro believes the US is trying to force him out. America is offering a $50m (Â£37m) reward for information leading to his arrest and claims he has links to drug trafficking and criminal groups - allegations he denies. Mr Maduro, widely considered a dictator, recently signed a decree giving himself increased security powers should the US enter the country.

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n Britain's hopes of becoming a critical minerals superpower have been dealt a severe blow after one of its leading companies abandoned its plans to build a rare earths refinery near Hull. Pensana had pledged to build a Â£250m refinery on the banks of the Humber, to process rare earths that would have then been used to make magnets for electric cars and wind turbines. The plant promised to create 126 jobs and was due to receive millions of pounds of government funding. However, Sky News has learnt that Pensana has decided to scrap the Hull plant and will instead move its refining operations to the US. Pensana's chairman, Paul Atherley, said the company had taken the decision after the Trump administration committed to buying rare earths from an American mine, Mountain Pass, at a guaranteed price - something no government in Europe had done. \"That's repriced the market - and Washington is looking to do more of these deals, moving at an absolute rate of knots,\" he said. \"Europe and the UK have been talking about critical minerals for ages. But when the Americans do it, they go big and hard, and make it happen. We don't; we mostly just talk about it.\"  The decision comes at a crucial juncture in critical minerals and geopolitics. China produces roughly 90% of all finished rare earth metals - exotic elements essential for the manufacture of many technology, energy and military products. Last week, Beijing imposed restrictions on the exports of rare earths, prompting Donald Trump to threaten further 100% tariffs on China. Pensana had been seen as Britain's answer to the periodic panics about the availability of rare earths. The site at Saltend Chemicals Park was chosen by the government to launch its critical minerals strategy in 2022. Visiting for the official groundbreaking, the then business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"This incredible facility will be the only one of its kind in Europe and will help secure the resilience of Britain's supplies into the future.\" He pledged a government grant to support the scheme. That grant was never received because Pensana never built its plant. Read more from Sky News:Analysis: China's rare-earth controlsAirPods link to global trade warTrump threatens extra China tariffs Mr Atherley said he is optimistic about another project he's involved with, to bring lithium refining to Teesside through another company, Tees Valley Lithium. But, he said, rare earth processing is far more complex, energy-intensive and expensive, making it unviable in the UK, for the time being. The decision is a further blow for Britain's chemicals industry, which has faced a series of closures in recent months, including that of Vivergo, a biofuels refiner based in the same chemicals park where Pensana planned to locate its refinery. Producers warn that Britain's record energy costs - higher than most other leading economies - are stifling its economy and triggering an outflow of businesses."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The government has vowed to pursue a company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone for millions of pounds paid for defective PPE at the height of the COVID pandemic after a High Court deadline passed without repayment. Earlier this month, the High Court ruled that PPE Medpro, a company founded by Baroness Mone's husband Doug Barrowman and promoted in government by the Tory peer, was in breach of contract and gave it two weeks to repay the Â£122m plus interest of Â£23m. In a statement after Wednesday's deadline passed, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash. \"PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over Â£145m, with interest now accruing daily.\" It is understood that is being charged at a rate of 8%. \"We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back where they belong - in our NHS,\" Mr Streeting concluded.  Money latest: How to add 24% to your home's value   Earlier, a spokesman for Mr Barrowman and the consortium behind the company said the government had not responded to an offer from PPE Medpro to discuss a settlement. \"Very disappointingly, the government has made no effort to respond or seek to enter into discussions,\" he said. During the trial PPE Medpro offered to pay Â£23m to settle the case but was rejected by the Department of Health and Social Care. While Mr Barrowman has described himself as the \"ultimate beneficial owner\" of PPE Medpro, and says Â£29m of profit from the deal was paid into a trust benefitting his family including Baroness Mone and her children, he was never a director and the couple are not personally liable for the money.  PPE Medpro filed for insolvency the day before Mrs Justice Cockerill's finding of breach of contract was published, and the company's most recent accounts show assets of just Â£666,000. Court-appointed administrators will now be responsible for recovering as much money as possible on behalf of creditors, principally the DHSC. With PPE Medpro in administration and potentially limited avenues to recover funds, there is a risk that the government may recover nothing while incurring further legal expenses. In June 2020, PPE Medpro won contracts worth a total of Â£203m to provide 210m masks and 25m surgical gowns after Baroness Mone contacted ministers including Michael Gove on the company's behalf. While the Â£81m mask contract was fulfilled the gowns were rejected for failing sterility standards, and in 2022 the DHSC sued. Earlier this month Mrs Justice Cockerill ruled that PPE Medpro was in breach of contract and liable to repay the full amount.  Mr Barrowman has previously named several other companies as part of the gown supply including two registered in the UK, and last week his spokesman said there was a \"strong case\" for the administrator to pursue them for the money. One of the companies named has denied any connection to PPE Medpro and two others have not responded to requests for comment. Insolvency experts say that administrators and creditors, in this case the government, may have some recourse to pursue individuals and entities beyond the liable company, but any process is likely to be lengthy and expensive. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, told Sky News: \"The administrators will want to look at what's happened to what look like significant profits made on these contracts. \"If I was looking at this I would want to establish the exact timeline, at what point were the profits taken out. \"They may also want to consider whether there is a claim for wrongful trading, because that effectively pierces the corporate veil of protection of a limited company, and can allow proceedings against company officers personally. \"The net of a director can also be expanded to shadow directors, people sitting in the background quite clearly with a degree of control of the management of the company, in which case some claims may rest against them.\" A spokesman for Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators of PPE Medpro, did not comment other than to confirm the firm's appointment."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Rachel Reeves faces the prospect of another \"groundhog day\" unless next month's budget goes further than plugging an estimated Â£22bn black hole in the public finances, according to a respected thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was a \"strong case\" for the chancellor to substantially increase the Â£10bn headroom she has previously given herself against her own debt rules, or risk further repeats of needing to restore the buffer in the years ahead. It said Ms Reeves could bring the cost of servicing government debt down through ending constant chatter over the limited breathing space she has previously given herself, in uncertain times for the global economy. The chancellor herself used an interview with Sky News this week to admit tax rises were being considered, and appeared to concede she was trapped in a \"doom loom\" of annual increases.  What is the chancellor facing? Speculation over the likely contents of the budget has been rife for months and intensified after U-turns by the government on planned welfare reforms and on winter fuel payments. The Office for Budget Responsibility's determination on the size of the black hole facing Ms Reeves could come in well above or below the IFS estimate of Â£22bn, which includes the restoration of the Â£10bn headroom but not the cost of any possible policy announcements such as the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap. Economists broadly agree tax rises are inevitable, as borrowing more would be prohibitive given the bond market's concerns about the UK's fiscal position. Long-term borrowing costs have recently stood at levels not seen since the last century. What are her tax options? While there has been talk of new levies on bank profits and the wealthy, to name but a few rumours, the IFS analysis suggests the best way to raise the bulk of sufficient funds is by hiking income tax, rather than making the tax system even more complicated. Earlier this week, it suggested reforms, such as to property taxes, could raise tens of billions of pounds. But any move on income tax would mean breaking Labour's manifesto pledge not to target the three main sources of revenue from income, employee national insurance contributions and VAT.  She is particularly unlikely to raise VAT, as it would risk fanning the flames of inflation, already expected by the International Monetary Fund to run at the highest rate across the G7 this year and next. Business argues it should be spared. The chancellor's first budget, which raised taxes by Â£40bn, has been blamed by the sector for raising costs in the economy since April via higher minimum pay and employer national insurance contributions. They say the measures have dragged on employment, investment, and growth. Read more:Reeves plots budget boost to entrepreneur tax incentivesFour big themes as IMF takes aim at UK growth and inflation  'A situation of her own making' Analysis by Barclays, revealed within the IFS's Green Budget, suggested inflation was on course to return to target by the middle of next year but that the UK's jobless rate could top 5% from its current 4.8% level. Ms Reeves, who has blamed the challenges she faces on past austerity, Brexit and a continuing drag from the mini-budget of the Liz Truss government in 2022, was urged by the IFS to not harm growth through budget measures. IFS director Helen Miller said: \"Last autumn, the chancellor confidently pronounced she wouldn't be coming back with more tax rises; she almost certainly will. \"For Rachel Reeves, the budget will feel like groundhog day. This is, to a large extent, a situation of her own making. \"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course.\" Ms Miller said there was a \"strong case for the chancellor to build more headroom against her fiscal rules\", adding: \"Persistent uncertainty is damaging to the economic outlook.\"  'No return to austerity' A Treasury spokesperson responded: \"We won't comment on speculation. The chancellor's non-negotiable fiscal rules provide the stability needed to help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth. \"We were the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. They are working day in, day out without getting ahead. \"That needs to change, and that is why the chancellor will continue to relentlessly cut red tape, reform outdated planning rules, and invest in public infrastructure to boost growth - not return to austerity or decline.\" The budget is scheduled for 26 November."

Prosecutors are setting up a compensation scheme after Yadi Zhang, 47, conned around 128,000 Chinese investors into fraudulent wealth schemes between 2014 and 2017. Zhang, who is also known as Zhimin Qian, admitted money laundering charges after police discovered more than 61,000 Bitcoin, now worth more than Â£5bn, in digital wallets, in the UK's biggest ever cryptocurrency seizure. She arrived in the UK on a false St Kitts and Nevis passport in September 2017 before coming to the attention of police after trying to buy some of London's most expensive properties. Zhang vanished after police raided her Â£5m six-bedroom rented house near Hampstead Heath in north London in 2018, but was finally arrested in York last year. In written legal arguments, Martin Evans KC representing the Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, said a ledger and passwords were found in a purpose-made concealed pocket in the jogging bottoms she was wearing. She revealed the access code for two wallets during interviews in prison, leading investigators to cryptocurrency worth around Â£67m. The stash has been added to the Â£5bn Bitcoin hoard, which has reportedly been earmarked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to help plug the hole in the public finances. The fortune is at the centre of a High Court battle between the UK government and thousands of Chinese victims, who want to recover their investment and say it should reflect the huge rise in the value of Bitcoin. Law firm Fieldfisher, which is representing around 1,000 victims, said some have lost their life savings and many are old and vulnerable. The court heard the DPP is also setting up a compensation scheme for the victims not represented in court, although no further details have been given. The judge, Mr Justice Turner, will make orders on the case at a later date.

Jian Wen, 43, was jailed for six years and eight months last year after being found guilty of one count of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022 relating to 150 Bitcoin, now worth around Â£12.5m. Her trial heard that Wen, who previously worked in a Chinese takeaway, was not involved in the alleged fraud but acted as a \"front person\" to help disguise the source of the money. The court heard how the two women travelled the world, spending tens of thousands of pounds on designer clothes, jewellery and shoes. Seng Hok Ling, 47, is said to have replaced Wen as Zhang's \"butler\", organising helpers and booking Airbnbs, including in Scotland, for the fugitive while she was on the run. Police found Zhang after carrying out surveillance of Ling and seized assets including encrypted devices, cash, gold and cryptocurrency. Ling, a Malaysian national from Matlock in Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to entering into a money laundering arrangement with Zhang on or before 23 April 2024 and will be sentenced alongside her. Prosecutors said Zhang masterminded a scam in China, before converting the money into cryptocurrency to get it out of the country."

As well as failing to meet current delivery times for both first and second class mail, Royal Mail did not meet revised down targets agreed with Ofcom. The delivery network delivered 77% of first class mail and 92.5% of second-class mail on time from April 2024 to March this year, \"well short\" of its 93% and 98.5% targets, the communications regulator said. Money blog: Major changes to vet prices proposed after investigation  It's also below the reduced goals which were set out for the delivery company at the start of the year - bringing down the percentage of first class post delivered the next day from 93% to 90%, and second class mail delivered within three days from 98.5% to 95%. The latest fine is double that levied last year, Â£10.5m, and nearly quadruple the Â£5.6m fine in 2023 because of the repeat offending. It's the third-largest fine ever levied by Ofcom and would have been higher, Â£30m, but for Royal Mail's admission of wrongdoing and agreement to settle. Millions not getting what they pay for Royal Mail has, without justification, failed to provide an acceptable level of service and breached its obligations, Ofcom said. \"It took insufficient and ineffective steps to try and prevent this failure, which is likely to have impacted millions of customers who did not get the service they paid for,\" it said. People have also been experiencing times when letters have taken weeks to arrive.   Ian Strawhorne, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: \"Millions of important letters are arriving late, and people aren't getting what they pay for when they buy a stamp. \"These persistent failures are unacceptable, and customers expect and deserve better. \"Royal Mail must rebuild consumers' confidence as a matter of urgency. And that means making actual significant improvements, not more empty promises.\"  Real world harms In highlighting the real-life consequences of the delivery delays, Citizens Advice told Sky News it had encountered someone who got a pile of mail with their council tax bill, a court summons for a court hearing date which had passed and a liability order for the debt - all at the same time.

Royal Mail has been ordered by Ofcom to urgently and publicly set out and implement a \"credible plan\" on how it is going to change. The regulator said it expects to see \"meaningful progress soon\", rather than \"more empty promises\". Improvements Ofcom had pressed for have not materialised, it said, and Royal Mail has been called on to make \"actual significant improvements\". \"If this doesn't happen, fines are likely to continue,\" the regulator warned. Ofcom said the \"persistent failures\" are unacceptable, and customers expect and deserve better. \"Royal Mail must rebuild consumers' confidence as a matter of urgency,\" it added.  The company has also been set a new enforceable target for 99% of mail to be delivered no more than two days late. How has Royal Mail responded? A Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the decision made by Ofcom today and we will continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service.\" The company has implemented \"important changes across our network including recruiting, retaining and training our people, and providing additional support to delivery offices\", they said. \"Where we have piloted universal service changes, we can see that our model is working, with improvements in deliveries,\" the spokesperson added."

Sky News has learnt that officials have drawn up proposals to lift the cap on a scheme called Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs), which allows smaller companies to offer share options to employees with no income tax or national insurance liabilities.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n A company has been fined Â£14m for failing to keep data safe during a cyber attack, which resulted in more than six million people having their data stolen. Sensitive information, such as pension records, details of criminal convictions and other financial data, were taken by cyber attackers from outsourcing specialist and government contractor Capita in March 2023. The company was left \"at significant risk\", the UK privacy watchdog said, as it failed to ensure secure processing of personal data. Money blog: Major changes to vet prices proposed after investigation  Capita also lacked appropriate technical and organisational measures to effectively respond to the attack, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said. The scale and impact of the attack could have been prevented if sufficient security measures were in place, the ICO added.  \n                  China poses 'highly sophisticated' cyber threat to UK, NCSC warns\n                 \n                  Discord hack shows risks of online age checks as internet policing hopes put to the test\n                 \n                  Two teenagers arrested over reports of cyber attack on children's nurseries\n                  Rather than responding to a high-priority security alert in an hour, as is the target response time, Capita took 58 hours and its security operations centre was understaffed, the regulator said. The delay meant a malicious file, accidentally downloaded by an employee to their device, was not quarantined and the attacker was able to exploit systems.  As well as those impacted by the breach suffering anxiety and stress, the ICO said there are problems of wider trust among the public from a large company like Capita falling short. It employs roughly 35,000 people globally.  The company avoided a fine of Â£45m as it admitted liability, implemented improvements after the attack, offered support to affected individuals and engaged with other regulators and the UK's cyber agency, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Adolfo Hernandez, Capita's chief executive, said: \"When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. \"As a result, we have hugely strengthened our cyber security posture, built in advanced protections and embedded a culture of continuous vigilance.\"  A spate of major attacks   It comes as the NCSC on Tuesday revealed a 50% jump in significant attacks in Britain by criminals and hostile states. In recent months, high-profile companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, Marks and Spencer and the Co-Op have had their operations hit by attacks. The economic impact of good cyber security was highlighted by the ICO on Wednesday. A warning to other companies \"With so many cyber attacks in the headlines, our message is clear: every organisation, no matter how large, must take proactive steps to keep people's data secure,\" said the UK Information Commissioner John Edwards. Businesses are advised to prioritise investment in key security controls, regularly monitor for suspicious activity and respond to initial warnings and alerts in a timely manner. "

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The owner of stakes in Six Nations and Premiership Rugby and the top flights of French and Spanish football is in talks with a pack of financial giants about a refinancing of its Â£9bn sports assets portfolio. Sky News has learnt that CVC Capital Partners' Global Sport Group (GSG) is in talks with firms including Ares Management about a multibillion-dollar debt deal. Details of the potential structure of an agreement, as well as the identities of other parties in discussions with CVC, were unclear on Wednesday. Money blog: Major changes to vet prices proposed after investigation Sources close to the situation said, however, that a financing package was expected to be secured on favourable terms because of the underlying credit quality of the assets in the portfolio. US-based Ares, which would be expected to lead the GSG syndicate if it proceeded with a deal, has become a major player in the burgeoning provision of private credit for sports assets. It was among the big winners from the recent sale of McLaren Racing, owner of the eponymous Formula One team, has received substantial proceeds from the sale of a stake in Crystal Palace Football Club, and recently invested in SailGP. \n                  UK suffers blow in bid to become minerals superpower - as it's snubbed by its own leading firm\n                 \n                  PPE Medpro will be pursued 'with everything we've got' Wes Streeting says\n                 \n                  Go big with tax hikes or risk 'groundhog day', chancellor told\n                 Ares is also raising its second institutional sports fund, which had a first close to lock in investors' capital commitments at $1bn earlier this year. Sky News revealed during the summer that CVC had engaged a trio of banks to explore plans for a refinancing of what was at the time referred to internally as SportsCo and which has since been renamed Global Sport Group. The portfolio also incorporates stakes in international volleyball, the women's professional tennis tour and an Indian Premier League cricket franchise. Goldman Sachs, PJT Partners and Raine Group are advising on the refinancing of GSG, which has been set up to optimise CVC's investments in the sector. Read more from Sky News:Banks step up lobbying over threat of Reeves tax hikesOcado hires Atos executive to deliver partnerships boost The deal is expected to allow CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in SportsCo or a future initial public offering. Marc Allera, the former boss of mobile phone network EE, has been recruited as GSG's chairman, with a number of other senior executives also appointed to management roles. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced significant challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. In rugby union, its acquisition of a stake in Premiership Rugby's commercial rights was hit by the pandemic and the subsequent financial pressures on clubs, which saw a number of the league's teams forced into insolvency. CVC, which bought into Premiership Rugby in 2019, owns a 27% stake in the league. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the SportsCo approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC being linked to a bid for one of the new European NBA basketball franchises which is expected to be sold in the coming months. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. Apollo Global Management was last month reported to be seeking to raise $5bn to invest in sports assets. Ares and CVC declined to comment."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer remains under pressure over the collapse of a trial into alleged Chinese spies after witness statements revealed the government's deputy national security adviser had warned of significant espionage in the UK. Three witness statements from the government were released late on Wednesday amid confusion about why the prosecutions of two men accused of spying for Beijing fell apart. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates Ex-parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and teacher Christopher Berry, 33, were charged last year with passing politically sensitive information to a Chinese agent between December 2021 and February 2023. They have both denied the allegations, and the case collapsed last month. The director of public prosecutions blamed the government's refusal to brand China a threat, sparking accusations of a \"cover-up\". Sir Keir, who wants a \"strategic and long-term\" relationship with Beijing, used PMQs to announce witness statements from the case, made by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, would be published. The PM has sought to blame the previous Tory government's stance on China for the spying trial collapsing. Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig said Sir Keir \"will hope he's got off the hook\" by publishing the statements, but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say \"they beg more questions than they answer\". So what do the witness statements say? In the first, from December 2023, Mr Collins said \"large scale espionage\" was being carried out against Britain. A second, from February 2025, said Chinese spying threatened the economy. In the documents, it was also revealed information about internal Tory politics - when the party was in government - was being fed to a Chinese intelligence handler known as \"Alex\", according to counterterrorism command SO15. This includes Mr Cash working as a researcher and \"contributing to policy advice being provided to Rishi Sunak\". The evidence adds: \"It is axiomatic that this is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK for the Chinese state to have indirect access to one of the individuals providing policy advice to the now prime minister on China, with the potential to influence that advice.\" In the most recent third document from Mr Collins, dated 4 August, he said the Chinese intelligence services remain \"highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK\". But he also quotes the Labour manifesto from last year's election, saying: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however, that the UK government is committed to pursuing a positive relationship with China to strengthen understanding, cooperation and stability. \"The government's position is that we will co-operate where we can; compete where we need to; and challenge where we must, including on issues of national security.\" Sir Keir had suggested the \"substantive\" evidence in the case was submitted under the Tories, while supplementary statements given also reflected the previous government's position.  Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said the evidence required from the government in the alleged spying case related to whether China could be considered an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act. None of the statements use that word. 'Completely devoid of context' Mr Cash and Mr Berry were both charged under the secrets act. In a statement after the government published the statements, Mr Cash reiterated he was \"completely innocent\" and attacked his \"trial by media\". The collapse of the trial, meaning he can't prove his innocence, has put him in an \"impossible position\", he said. \"At no point did I intentionally assist Chinese intelligence,\" he added. Mr Cash described the statements as \"completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial\".  'Yet more unanswered questions' Sir Keir had previously said the government would not publish the evidence as it would not have been allowed by the CPS - before the CPS then denied this was the case. Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said in a statement the prosecution was dropped after attempts to get more evidence from the government \"over many months\" proved unfruitful. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a statutory inquiry, with the party's foreign affairs spokesperson saying the published statements \"raise yet more unanswered questions\". Calum Miller MP said: \"Did emphasising the government's desire for a positive relationship with China effectively cause this trial to collapse? What evidence was the CPS requesting which the government failed to provide? \"And who was aware of these statements and the evidence being asked for both among ministers and in No 10?\" Sky's Jon Craig said a number of Commons committees are likely to open their own inquiries into the case."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Rachel Reeves faces the prospect of another \"groundhog day\" unless next month's budget goes further than plugging an estimated Â£22bn black hole in the public finances, according to a respected thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was a \"strong case\" for the chancellor to substantially increase the Â£10bn headroom she has previously given herself against her own debt rules, or risk further repeats of needing to restore the buffer in the years ahead. It said Ms Reeves could bring the cost of servicing government debt down through ending constant chatter over the limited breathing space she has previously given herself, in uncertain times for the global economy. The chancellor herself used an interview with Sky News this week to admit tax rises were being considered, and appeared to concede she was trapped in a \"doom loom\" of annual increases.  What is the chancellor facing? Speculation over the likely contents of the budget has been rife for months and intensified after U-turns by the government on planned welfare reforms and on winter fuel payments. The Office for Budget Responsibility's determination on the size of the black hole facing Ms Reeves could come in well above or below the IFS estimate of Â£22bn, which includes the restoration of the Â£10bn headroom but not the cost of any possible policy announcements such as the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap. Economists broadly agree tax rises are inevitable, as borrowing more would be prohibitive given the bond market's concerns about the UK's fiscal position. Long-term borrowing costs have recently stood at levels not seen since the last century. What are her tax options? While there has been talk of new levies on bank profits and the wealthy, to name but a few rumours, the IFS analysis suggests the best way to raise the bulk of sufficient funds is by hiking income tax, rather than making the tax system even more complicated. Earlier this week, it suggested reforms, such as to property taxes, could raise tens of billions of pounds. But any move on income tax would mean breaking Labour's manifesto pledge not to target the three main sources of revenue from income, employee national insurance contributions and VAT.  She is particularly unlikely to raise VAT, as it would risk fanning the flames of inflation, already expected by the International Monetary Fund to run at the highest rate across the G7 this year and next. Business argues it should be spared. The chancellor's first budget, which raised taxes by Â£40bn, has been blamed by the sector for raising costs in the economy since April via higher minimum pay and employer national insurance contributions. They say the measures have dragged on employment, investment, and growth. Read more:Reeves plots budget boost to entrepreneur tax incentivesFour big themes as IMF takes aim at UK growth and inflation  'A situation of her own making' Analysis by Barclays, revealed within the IFS's Green Budget, suggested inflation was on course to return to target by the middle of next year but that the UK's jobless rate could top 5% from its current 4.8% level. Ms Reeves, who has blamed the challenges she faces on past austerity, Brexit and a continuing drag from the mini-budget of the Liz Truss government in 2022, was urged by the IFS to not harm growth through budget measures. IFS director Helen Miller said: \"Last autumn, the chancellor confidently pronounced she wouldn't be coming back with more tax rises; she almost certainly will. \"For Rachel Reeves, the budget will feel like groundhog day. This is, to a large extent, a situation of her own making. \"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course.\" Ms Miller said there was a \"strong case for the chancellor to build more headroom against her fiscal rules\", adding: \"Persistent uncertainty is damaging to the economic outlook.\"  'No return to austerity' A Treasury spokesperson responded: \"We won't comment on speculation. The chancellor's non-negotiable fiscal rules provide the stability needed to help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth. \"We were the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first half of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. They are working day in, day out without getting ahead. \"That needs to change, and that is why the chancellor will continue to relentlessly cut red tape, reform outdated planning rules, and invest in public infrastructure to boost growth - not return to austerity or decline.\" The budget is scheduled for 26 November."

In addition to trying to tackle people smuggling, ministers have also announced policies to bring down legal immigration, with a requirement to learn English to A-level standard outlined in parliament on Tuesday. \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part,\" Ms Mahmood said. It's expected to come into force after 4 November."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       Self-driving taxis could be on the streets of London from next year, according to autonomous taxi firm Waymo.Â  The taxis have become a regular feature on San Francisco's roads and recently launched in Tokyo. London, often associated with the famous black cab, will be the first European city to get the driverless taxis. However, Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association which represents cab drivers in London, is not worried. \"Will I be concerned in 25 years' time? Maybe. I'm certainly not concerned at the moment,\" he told Sky News. \"It's a novelty, it is a gimmick. It is the solution that we don't need. Who needs a driverless cab?\" asked Mr McNamara. He added he didn't think Londoners would trust the taxis, let alone \"put their kids in one to go to school\". In response, Waymo told Sky News it \"provides hundreds of thousands of rides every week in the US, and shared in May of this year that we've provided over 10,000,000 fully autonomous rides to the public\". \"That growth reflects real appreciation, love, and trust in the service among our growing number of riders where we operate,\" said a Waymo spokesperson. \"We're excited to introduce the reliability, safety, and magic of Waymo to Londoners soon.\" Waymo said its autonomous cars are on their way to London and will be on the capital's roads \"in the coming weeks\", albeit with \"safety drivers\" behind the wheel. The company is working with both the Department for Transport and Transport for London to \"secure the necessary permissions to offer fully autonomous rides in 2026\". Those permissions are contingent on the government finalising driverless car regulations and giving Waymo the go-ahead to operate. Uber and UK company Wayve are also planning to trial driverless taxis in the capital next year.

At the time, the government said driverless cars could create nearly 40,000 jobs, make roads safer and add billions to the economy. Since Waymo launched in the US, there have been a series of high-profile incidents involving the cars. In September, a Waymo taxi was spotted making an illegal U-turn \"right in front\" of officers at a light. \"Since there was no human driver, a ticket couldn't be issued,\" San Bruno Police Department said, adding officers cannot book a \"robot\". Earlier this year a \"dizzy\" Waymo passenger nearly missed his flight after his cab started driving round in circles. In a video posted by the passenger, the taxi's steering wheel could be seen spinning as the car manoeuvres around a small area of the car park over and over again.  Last year, Waymo was forced to fix a fleet of cars after residents complained about their constant honking. As the taxis returned to a car park being used as a base, they beeped at each other through the night as they parked or set off on a journey. A livestream set up by one resident monitored the taxi car park and gathered tens of thousands of views from people from all over the world."

As part of the company's policy to \"treat adult users like adults\", the chatbot will be able to create sexual content once age verification is fully rolled out across the tool. \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" said Sam Altman in a post on X. The announcement wasn't popular with everyone. One X user asked Mr Altman: \"Why do age-gates always have to lead to erotica? Like, I just want to be able to be treated like an adult and not a toddler, that doesn't mean I want perv-mode activated.\" \"You won't get it unless you ask for it,\" he responded.  According to the announcement, ChatGPT had become more restrictive and \"less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems\" while the company tackled problems concerning the chatbot and vulnerable users. \"We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,\" Mr Altman said. \"Given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.\" In August, the family of teenager Adam Raine began suing OpenAI over his death. It was the first time the company had faced a wrongful death lawsuit.  Adam's parents accused Sam Altman of putting profit over safety after ChatGPT instructed their son on how to end his life, and even offered to write a suicide note for him. At the time, OpenAI told Sky News it learned its safeguards \"can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade\" and said it would continually improve those safeguards. \"Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,\" said Mr Altman on Tuesday evening. \"In a few weeks, we plan to put out a new version of ChatGPT that allows people to have a personality that behaves more like what people liked about 4o (we hope it will be better!).\"  The latest ChatGPT model, 5o, has faced criticism by users for being less playful and creative than the previous model.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n A company has been fined Â£14m for failing to keep data safe during a cyber attack, which resulted in more than six million people having their data stolen. Sensitive information, such as pension records, details of criminal convictions and other financial data, were taken by cyber attackers from outsourcing specialist and government contractor Capita in March 2023. The company was left \"at significant risk\", the UK privacy watchdog said, as it failed to ensure secure processing of personal data. Money blog: Major changes to vet prices proposed after investigation  Capita also lacked appropriate technical and organisational measures to effectively respond to the attack, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said. The scale and impact of the attack could have been prevented if sufficient security measures were in place, the ICO added.  \n                  China poses 'highly sophisticated' cyber threat to UK, NCSC warns\n                 \n                  Discord hack shows risks of online age checks as internet policing hopes put to the test\n                 \n                  Two teenagers arrested over reports of cyber attack on children's nurseries\n                  Rather than responding to a high-priority security alert in an hour, as is the target response time, Capita took 58 hours and its security operations centre was understaffed, the regulator said. The delay meant a malicious file, accidentally downloaded by an employee to their device, was not quarantined and the attacker was able to exploit systems.  As well as those impacted by the breach suffering anxiety and stress, the ICO said there are problems of wider trust among the public from a large company like Capita falling short. It employs roughly 35,000 people globally.  The company avoided a fine of Â£45m as it admitted liability, implemented improvements after the attack, offered support to affected individuals and engaged with other regulators and the UK's cyber agency, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Adolfo Hernandez, Capita's chief executive, said: \"When I joined as CEO the year after the attack I accelerated our cyber security transformation, with new digital and technology leadership and significant investment. \"As a result, we have hugely strengthened our cyber security posture, built in advanced protections and embedded a culture of continuous vigilance.\"  A spate of major attacks   It comes as the NCSC on Tuesday revealed a 50% jump in significant attacks in Britain by criminals and hostile states. In recent months, high-profile companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, Marks and Spencer and the Co-Op have had their operations hit by attacks. The economic impact of good cyber security was highlighted by the ICO on Wednesday. A warning to other companies \"With so many cyber attacks in the headlines, our message is clear: every organisation, no matter how large, must take proactive steps to keep people's data secure,\" said the UK Information Commissioner John Edwards. Businesses are advised to prioritise investment in key security controls, regularly monitor for suspicious activity and respond to initial warnings and alerts in a timely manner. "

        "Content": "Brain cancer patients will not be able to use a new drug that slows or stops tumour growth after it was rejected for NHS use. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has turned down vorasidenib because of uncertainty in the economic data and a lack of clarity over whether the drug improves overall survival chances, according to draft guidance it has published. Vorasidenib is for people aged 12 or over who have had surgery for types of low-grade glioma with either the IDH1 or IDH2 genetic mutations. Current treatment includes surgery, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and patients who took vorasidenib in clinical trials reported positive results, including their tumours shrinking. The drug, a daily pill, also delayed the time before they needed another intervention. Taylor Pepper, 35, from Peterborough, was diagnosed with an oligodendroglioma brain tumour in 2024 following a routine eye test, which detected swelling behind her right eye. Mrs Pepper, who is married and has a six-year-old daughter, had to stop running her business and give up her driving licence. \n                  Scientists develop first-ever blood test to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome\n                 \n                  Who can get COVID jab - as pharmacies turn people away over eligibility confusion\n                 \n                  Almost 15 million teens around the world using vapes, WHO report says\n                 Surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge removed most of her tumour, but could not take it all because of its location. Mrs Pepper joined a clinical trial of vorasidenib. The drug shrank her tumour, and she will stay on it. \"As much as I keep positive, it is very scary,\" she said. \"But with the treatment, I know I'm in a good place. \"Being able to take this drug has given me a lot more benefits. I'm able to live a normal life and make memories with my little girl. \"It's devastating that this is a no (from NICE), because brain tumour patients have had to wait a long time for decisions on treatment anyway, so having to wait longer for a decision on this will cause a lot of stress and worry. \"They've managed to find a drug that's not as harsh a treatment as chemo and radiotherapy, meaning we're able to do so much more. \"Having a brain tumour is hard enough, especially when you're told it's incurable and that chemo and radiotherapy would only make it worse. You feel desperate. \"My last MRI scan showed a small decrease in size, which is incredible, so I want to stay on this drug as it's allowed me to carry on as normally as I can. \"Anyone facing this diagnosis should be eligible for this drug.\" How common are IDH-mutant low-grade gliomas? IDH-mutant low-grade gliomas are one of the most common primary brain tumours diagnosed in people aged under 50, and about 300 people in England would have been eligible for vorasidenib had the drug been approved. A clinical trial on 331 patients from 10 countries found that vorasidenib slowed or even stopped tumour growth in patients with grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma. Dawn Emerton, a trustee of Astro Brain Tumour Fund, whose son Shay received the drug, said: \"I am dismayed that NICE has not made it available on the NHS. \"If NICE reverses this decision, eligible patients could experience improved quality of life, fewer seizures and delayed treatment with harsher therapies. \"It would also demonstrate the UK's commitment to innovation and provide all patients with hope for progress in brain tumour treatment.\" Read more from Sky News:Pair found dead in camper van after cider festivalSocial media star to be deported from Australia Dr Simon Newman, chief scientific officer at The Brain Tumour Charity, said: \"This draft decision is very disappointing as it means more patients will have chemotherapy and radiotherapy earlier than necessary, which can be effective, but which can have significant long-term side effects. \"We are urgently asking our community to help turn this draft 'no' from NICE into a 'yes'. \"Outcomes for brain tumour patients remain among the poorest of any cancer, so we need to work with all stakeholders to ensure great science is translated into medicines that are available on the NHS as quickly as possible.\""

        "Content": "By Steve Rogers, Sky Sports journalist   They're getting through 70kg of rice a day and the wholesaler has run out of noodles. Yes, sumo returns to London on Wednesday. It's just the second time a Grand Tournament has been held outside of Japan - and this is a sport that has records going back more than 1,500 years. It's 34 years since the Royal Albert Hall hosted the only previous such event on foreign soil - and the appetite for tickets meant all five days sold out immediately. Much of the focus is on the two grand champions or yokozuna, the 74th and 75th men to attain the rank. They're the Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu, plus Japan's Onosato Daiki - who this year became the quickest wrestler to achieve the rank in the modern era. \"I'm happy that sumo is back after so many years,\" Onosato said. \"I hope I can show the UK fans how fantastic sumo is.\" \"Being a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\" Hoshoryu told Sky Sports. \"We have to show everyone an example of what a yokozuna is - and that's very difficult. \"My uncle was a yokozuna - and I'm happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn't, so I'm even happier.\" The two are already great rivals. At the recent Aki Basho - the most prestigious tournament on the sumo calendar - the pair finished with identical records after 15 days of bouts. It all came down to a final play-off between the two yokozuna - the first time that had happened in 16 years. It was Onosato who came out on top on that occasion. Hoshoryu says he is a big fan of basketball and football. He follows Chelsea, although his favourite players are going back a bit: \"Didier Drogba and Petr Cech. He's the 'keeper. I like this guy!\" Early starts and a hearty stew: The life of a rikishi The wrestlers - or rikishi - have a rigorous training regime. They live in communal blocks called stables and practice starts early. Perhaps surprisingly, everyone skips breakfast. After training and practice - and for the younger rikishi, chores - the wrestlers all eat together. The staple of their diet is chankonabe, a hearty stew packed with meat and vegetables. The feeding of the 40 rikishi who have come over for the five-day tournament is a challenge in itself. Donagh Collins, the CEO of co-organisers Askonas Holt, said: \"We are going through 70 kilos of rice a day. Somebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles. We're really pushing the system here.\" The ring - or dohyo - is just 4.55m in diameter and quite small when two giant wrestlers leap at each other. The aim of the fights is to either get your opponent onto the floor - or, more spectacularly, shove or hurl them out of the dohyo, so spectators in the ringside seats may be getting extremely up-close to the wrestlers. The last time the tournament was in Britain, the massive Konishiki, known as the Dump Truck, took centre stage. The giant Hawaiian was the heaviest-ever rikishi coming in at 287kg - or 45 stone. That's a lot of wrestler to dodge if he comes falling out of the ring towards you.

And for the next five days, the cream of the world of sumo will be thrilling the crowds - provided a new noodle supplier is found. Yokozuna is the highest rank in sumo, with its name meaning \"horizontal rope\" and refers to the rope worn around a competitor's waist as they enter the ring."
