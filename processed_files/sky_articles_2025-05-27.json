        "Content": " A man who was among the dozens injured when a car struck a crowd during Liverpool's Premier League trophy parade has told Sky News how he pleaded with the driver to stop before he was hit and sent \"spinning\". Jack Trotter and his girlfriend Abbie Gallagher, both 22, had just met some other Liverpool fans and were taking videos when the Ford Galaxy quickly approached. Ms Gallagher told Sky News' communities correspondent Lisa Holland how she screamed \"Jack, Jack\" as the driver \"rammed through everybody\". Follow latest: Liverpool parade crash live updates Mr Trotter, a father of one, said: \"He rammed through the first set of people, but when it got to me, I put my hands up, telling him to stop, but also to protect myself. \"He just tried to run through me. I twisted, and he just caught my legs. I'm completely bedbound at the moment. I'm traumatised.\" Ms Gallagher was hit on the right side of the car, while Mr Trotter was struck on the left, but she managed to save herself by pushing herself off the bonnet. She said: \"Everything was mental. Everyone was crying. I was in hysterics. I couldn't find him for at least five minutes.\" 'My back's gone' \"I look around and there's people in the air. I just freaked out. I was just trying to find Jack. \"Luckily enough, he heard me screaming. He came up and said, 'I'm here'. We didn't know what to say, we were just crying.\" Mr Trotter said his adrenaline \"kicked in\" and he got himself back up to reach his girlfriend. He added that once he knew she was okay and the adrenaline wore off, he slumped against a wall, telling her that \"my back's gone\".  As Ms Gallagher tried to help him up, a nearby man and woman came to help, and they carried him into a bar. Those who helped - firefighters, paramedics, police and bar staff - were \"amazing\", she said. \"They gave us a hug when we needed it because everyone was crying,\" she added. \"They had to call for an ambulance to come. They gave Jack gas and air to try and ease the pain and other meds for painkillers. They got him onto a bed. He was crying and screaming.\" 'We are in shock still' Ms Gallagher added: \"The hospital was amazing. The doctors made us laugh, tried to ease what happened. We rang my family and his family. We are just in shock still. \"We will be scared by the experience. It's not something you ever expect. It's just heartbreaking,\" she said. Mr Trotter, who is one of more than 50 people who were injured in the incident, said his \"legs are ok\", but his back had \"completely gone\". He said: \"At the moment, I'm just in absolute agony. It was just a traumatic experience.\" Read more from Sky News:What we know after dozens injured in LiverpoolHow the Liverpool FC parade crash unfoldedWhy police released 'unprecedented' details Eleven people remain in hospital in a stable condition.

        "Content": "\n          Data and forensics correspondent\n              @chesh\n  A car that began slowly nosing its way around pedestrians ended up ploughing into them - and a parade turned into panic. This was a terrifying and chaotic incident. Here's what Sky's Data and Forensics team has been able to reconstruct: exactly what happened, and when. This is what everyone was filling the streets to see - the Liverpool team bus on its victory parade. It began at 2.30pm on Bank Holiday Monday - here is the route the procession took. And that meant closures. Here are all of the roads that were shut to traffic, or should have been. Ahead of the parade, Liverpool City Council had strongly advised people not to drive - particularly in the city centre - and asked fans to walk instead. This is the first time we see the car involved. It's slowly moving west along Dale Street. The timestamp on this footage appears not to have been corrected - reading 4.58pm - likely showing it was filmed at 5.58pm, adjusting for summertime hours. We can see the car here again on that same street, before the worst happens. Footage shows somebody closing a door on the right-hand side, but it is unclear if he was a passenger. The driver reverses, hitting a nearby fan. The crowd reacts angrily - kicking and punching the vehicle. Blocked to the front by a stopped car, the people carrier then reverses at speed towards a man attacking the back window. The crowd then throws objects at the car as it speeds west along Dale Street. Meanwhile, the man reversed into earlier chases the car - smashing the back window with a folding chair. Read more:Victim says he's been left 'traumatised'Why police released 'unprecedented' details about suspect Dale Street turns into Water Street - and less than 100 yards later, on the junction with Rumford Street, police say a road block was in place. But this was lifted for an ambulance, and the car was able to follow in behind - despite its already erratic driving and multiple altercations with the surrounding crowd. After this is when the most damage was done. This video shows the car at a stop on Water Street, with an ambulance close behind. The crowd attacks the car while nearby police attempt to intervene.  It accelerates, hitting pedestrians. The car then swerves right into a crowd of people, before swerving left again and coming to a stop. If we cross reference the various videos to maps of the street, we can see the car covers 40m (131ft) in nine seconds - that means an average speed of 10mph - fast enough to inflict critical injuries. It finished here - with people seen trapped under the wheels. Officers quickly surrounded the car as witnesses attempted to stop the driver, who was eventually detained by police. Afterwards, bystanders were seen walking down the road in shock.  It's only a short stretch of road. But this was a bank holiday, and a big occasion. About one million people came to watch the parade - there were dense crowds everywhere. Police said emergency services responded within \"a matter of seconds\". But questions will now focus on how the suspect was able to drive along at least two streets crowded with people - coming into contact with them and causing casualties - without being stopped."

        "Content": " The daughter of Gisele Pelicot has suggested chemical castration could be \"one part of the solution\" when there is \"nothing else you can do\" for sex offenders - like her father. Caroline Darian's father Dominique Pelicot admitted repeatedly drugging and raping his wife Gisele between 2011 and 2020, and inviting dozens of other men to their home in southern France to do the same. Gisele decided to waive her right to anonymity to hold the trial of her husband and 50 other men in public, saying: \"It is not for us to be ashamed, but for those men.\" Politics latest: Farage says 'yes' he can be PM Speaking to Ali Fortescue on The Politics Hub, Ms Darian said the UK government's plans to consider mandatory chemical castration could be \"one part of the solution\" for men like her father. She said: \"It's probably one part of the solution because you know when you're at that level of crime, that level of criminal, there is nothing else you can do.\" Asked if she believed \"men like your father\" could be rehabilitated, Ms Darian said \"no\" and \"never\". For ten years, Pelicot repeatedly sedated his wife and invited strangers to abuse her after advertising sex with her on a French swinging website. Some denied the rape charges, claiming they believed Gisele had agreed to be drugged and was a willing participant in a sex game between the couple. But all the men charged were found guilty of at least one offence, with nearly all convicted of rape, after a trial that shocked France and made headlines around the world. The defendants were sentenced to a total of more than 400 years, with Pelicot being sentenced to 20 years in prison. Pelicot also took photos of his daughter Caroline semi-naked while she was asleep. Ms Darian is pressing charges against her father, having accused him of drugging and raping her. Pelicot has denied this. Speaking to French media, Beatrice Zavarro, Pelicot's lawyer, said Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising\". She added that prosecutors had said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on Ms Darian. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said last week that she will pursue \"a nationwide rollout\" of a scheme being piloted in southwest England to use medication to suppress the sexual drive of sex offenders.

Ms Mahmood said she is \"exploring whether mandating the approach is possible\". The trial is currently voluntary."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n  Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to the United States, has told Sky News he \"regrets\" his association with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson's links to the late billionaire were exposed in a 2019 report by JP Morgan bank, filed in a New York court. Epstein killed himself in August of that year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. He had previously served an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. Whilst serving that sentence, the JP Morgan report suggests that Mr Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan flat. Epstein wrote to his private banker on 17 June 2009: \"Peter will be staying at 71st over weekend…\" At the time, Lord Mandelson was the Business Secretary in the UK government under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was appointed UK ambassador to the United States in December 2024. Sky News asked him if he did, indeed, stay at Epstein's flat while the disgraced financier was in jail. He replied: \"I'm not answering any questions about him. My knowledge of him is something I regret, I wish I'd never met him in the first place.\" Asked why he had an association with Epstein whilst he was in jail, Lord Mandelson replied: \"Why did many people meet him?

This comes after Lord Mandelson described the US president as a \"danger to the world\", for which he apologised earlier this year. He told the Alain Elkann Interviews podcast in 2019: \"What Donald Trump represents and believes is an anathema to mainstream British opinion.\" Lord Mandelson added: \"Even those who have a sneaking admiration for Donald Trump because of his personality, nonetheless regard him as reckless, and a danger to the world.\" But in January this year, Lord Mandelson said he now considered his remarks \"as ill-judged and wrong\"."

        "Content": " King Charles says Canada will remain \"strong and free\" - in a speech viewed by many Canadians as a show of support for the country's sovereignty following annexation threats by Donald Trump. It comes after Mr Trump repeatedly suggested that Canada should become America's 51st state. Prime Minister Mark Carney later invited Charles, who is the head of state in Canada, to the state opening of parliament. On Tuesday, Charles said in a speech, written by Mr Carney's government to open Canada's parliament, that the country would remain \"strong and free\", quoting the national anthem, but did not directly refer to Mr Trump's annexation threats. \"We must face reality: since the Second World War, our world has never been more dangerous and unstable. Canada is facing challenges that, in our lifetimes, are unprecedented,\" the King told politicians in the Senate Building in Ottawa in French. \"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them,\" he added. In the speech, he highlighted his admiration for \"Canada's unique identity, which is recognised across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values\". He set out the government's legislative agenda on the second day of his Canada visit, an honour usually reserved for the governor general. King Charles is only the second monarch, after his mother Queen Elizabeth II, to do so. The late queen delivered the speech at the state opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957, her first visit to the country as head of state, and again in 1977. He said that it has been nearly 70 years since his mother first opened the Canadian parliament, and at the time, World War II remained a painful memory while the Cold War was intensifying simultaneously. \"Freedom and democracy were under threat,\" the King said. \"Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\" Royal correspondent This trip was so much more than a royal visit, it was all about cementing Canada's sovereignty.  And what we've seen is two short days, poignantly packed with spectacle and symbolism. From an open-top carriage procession to a theatrical political ceremony - Canada wanted to put on a visual show of sovereignty, and this was a masterclass. All the stops were pulled out. The King must sit above politics, but this was a very political visit. He is King of Canada and head of state here. But he arrives at a time of fractious relations between Canada and the US. Putting him at the centre of Canada's parliament sends a strong signal to President Trump. During the speech, the King added his own warm words, speaking with deep affection about the country. He also spoke of how the crown brings Canada \"unity\" and represents \"stability and continuity\". And then, reading the words of his government, a punchy message to President Trump. Delivered by the King, the words hit home harder.  When he quoted the national anthem with the words Canada must stay \"strong and free\", the applause rose up. At a time when Canada feels threatened by the US, having the King on side matters. The King has been walking a delicate diplomatic tightrope in Ottawa. Here to celebrate Canada, without causing offence to politicians south of the border. President Trump can be unpredictable, but he affectionately holds the King and Royal Family in high regard, and that goes a long way. The King heads home after just twenty-three hours. Canada has been visibly boosted – the bond with its King has been renewed and strategically strengthened. He added that since Queen Elizabeth II's first Canadian parliament opening, the country \"has dramatically changed: repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth\". Addressing the protection of Canada's sovereignty, Charles read out a promise by the Canadian government that it would rebuild, rearm and reinvest in its armed forces. \"It will invest to strengthen its presence in the north, as this region, which is an integral part of the Canadian nation, faces new threats,\" he read. The speech, which was awarded a standing ovation by attendees, was largely written by officials working for Mr Carney's government, with Charles adding his own comments about his love for Canada. The King opening Canada's parliament is a \"clear message of sovereignty\" and \"not coincidental\", Mr Carney previously said. Read more from Sky News:Carney: Canadians facing 'biggest crisis' of their lifeCanada will 'never be part of US', country's PM says He also revealed that Canadians \"weren't impressed\" by the decision of the UK government to offer Mr Trump an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  Gayanne Potter is one of Britain's most recognisable voices - behind adverts for the likes of Estee Lauder, Apple, LBC radio, and B&Q. Now, an artificial intelligence (AI) version of her voice is being used on Scotland's nationalised train network, ScotRail. But the professional voiceover artist says she had no idea she had been transformed into a robot until a friend called her last week. \"I was devastated, I was furious, I feel completely violated,\" she told Sky News. \"My voice is my job, and I should be allowed to know who I am working with and what I am working on.\" Ms Potter, who lives on the outskirts of Edinburgh, believes the incident can be traced back to a job she completed during the COVID pandemic with Swedish company ReadSpeaker, where she recorded scripts for the visually impaired. Ms Potter alleges she was unaware the contract allowed her voice to be sold as part of AI years later. Sky News has seen correspondence where the company appeared to reassure Ms Potter's agents they \"would never sell them (the recordings) to anybody else\". Responding to concerns, ReadSpeaker insisted there was a \"very clear contract\" that allows it to \"use... synthesised voices for businesses and organisations\". ScotRail unveiled its new AI announcer, nicknamed \"Iona\", on board the railway network in Scotland this month. The new technology has drawn criticism for mispronouncing place names, with officials asking the public to \"give it time\". Sky News joined Ms Potter on board a train as she discussed the situation. She said: \"I literally didn't know. ScotRail never approached me, ReadSpeaker never approached me. \"ScotRail have said it is not a real person. It is a real person, and I am right here. \"This is a real threat. I have worked really hard for the past 20 years and built trust with clients I work with. And now to have my voice in this dreadful robot is demeaning to me.\" She added: \"I do not consent to my voice data being used. To find out that my personal human data is being used on the trains is appalling. \"I feel like my data is being burgled. I have no control over it.\" Read more:Cloned voices 'could become as common as stunt doubles'Stars release silent album in protest at AI copyright plans Union Equity, which represents workers in the creative industries, is helping Ms Potter fight her case. Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity, said: \"It is extremely exploitative for companies to use and commercialise voice recordings to create digital replicas of artists from contracts which pre-date the development of generative AI or were not drafted explicitly for this purpose. \"Gayanne is directly competing in a marketplace with a low-quality clone of her own voice that she claims was developed without her informed and explicit consent. \"Not only is this distressing for her, but it would represent an infringement of our members' data protection and other rights.\" Roy Lindemann, chief marketing officer at ReadSpeaker, dismissed questions from Sky News about Ms Potter's wishes to withdraw her voice from being sold. He said the firm was aware of Ms Potter's concerns, adding: \"ReadSpeaker and Ms Potter have a contract regarding the use of her voice. \"ReadSpeaker has comprehensively addressed Ms Potter's concerns with her legal representative several times in the past.\" ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish government, said it had \"no plans\" to remove its \"Iona\" AI announcer voice system and rejected questions about Ms Potter's concerns. Phil Campbell, ScotRail customer operations director, said: \"We are always looking at ways to improve the customer journey experience, and we know how important both on-train and at-station announcements are. \"The use of an automated voice allows us to have more control over the announcements being made, ensures consistency for customers, and gives us flexibility to make changes at short notice.\" A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \"While sub-contracts are a matter for ScotRail, the Scottish government expects it, as a publicly controlled organisation, to ensure all agreements entered into are within the parameters of Public Sector Procurement guidance and meet Fair Work principles. \"This includes the use of AI technology.\""

Sir Sadiq said a new report, published by the independent London Drugs Commission (LDC) today, provides \"a compelling, evidence-based case\" for the government to consider the move. Under current laws, cannabis is a Class B drug and people found in possession face a fine or imprisonment. The LDC, set up by the mayor in 2022 and chaired by former lord chancellor Lord Charlie Falconer, has said the current laws on cannabis are \"disproportionate to the harms it can pose\". Its study examined how the drug is policed around the world - and also found cannabis policing \"continues to focus on particular ethnic communities,\" damaging their relations with law enforcement. The commission stops short of calling for full decriminalisation and instead says \"natural\" cannabis should be moved from the Misuse of Drugs Act to the Psychoactive Substances Act. This would effectively legalise the possession of small amounts for personal use while continuing to prohibit importing, manufacturing or distributing the drug. \n                  Who are the gangs behind the cannabis home delivery service?\n                 \n                  The online drug trade behind QR code stickers plastered on streets across the UK \n                 \n                  Kara Alexander: Dagenham mother who murdered her two young sons in the bath jailed\n                 The LDC is also calling for improved addiction services and better education on the dangers of cannabis for young people. Sir Sadiq said: \"I've long been clear that we need fresh thinking on how to reduce the substantial harms associated with drug-related crime in our communities.\" The report \"makes a compelling, evidenced-based case for the decriminalisation of possession of small quantities of natural cannabis which the government should consider,\" he added. \"It says that the current sentencing for those caught in possession of natural cannabis cannot be justified given its relative harm and people's experience of the justice system. \"We must recognise that better education, improved healthcare and more effective, equitable policing of cannabis use are long overdue.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 Lord Falconer said: \"Legalisation is not the answer. The criminal justice system response needs to focus only on the dealers and not the users. \"Those who suffer from the adverse effects of cannabis - which may be a small percentage of users but it is a high number of people - need reliable, consistent medical and other support. And there needs to be much more education on the risks of cannabis use.\" Read more:What are cannabis stickers?Living beside a drugs consumption room  Government and Tories respond A Home Office spokesperson said the government \"has no intention of reclassifying cannabis from a Class B substance\". \"We will continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer,\" they added. The Conservatives have rubbished Sir Sadiq's suggestion, with shadow home secretary Chris Philp saying: \"Cannabis is associated with anti-social behaviour and heavy use can lead to serious psychosis and severed mental health problems. \"US and Canadian cities which tried this approach have ended up as crime-ridden ghettos with stupefied addicts on the streets and law-abiding citizens frightened to go there.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Sean \"Diddy\" Combs kidnapped a former aide at gunpoint to join him as he attempted to confront love rival rapper Kid Cudi, his sex-trafficking trial has been told. Capricorn Clark, who worked for the Bad Boy Records co-founder in different roles on and off for several years, told the court he banged on her door and told her: \"Get dressed, we're going to kill Mescudi.\" Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, last week testified himself about the alleged incident in December 2011. Ms Clark became tearful a few times as she gave evidence - which marked the start of the third week of the high-profile trial. She told the court her situation working for the hip-hop mogul was \"complicated\". Combs, 55, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, is accused of subjecting his former long-term partner Cassie and others to years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial: Day 10 - as it happened While giving her own evidence in the first week of the trial, Cassie told jurors she dated Cudi briefly during a difficult period in her on-off relationship with Combs. On Tuesday, Ms Clark said she warned Cassie about seeing Cudi, saying she took her to buy a burner phone as she thought it could be dangerous given how Combs might react. \"The way she was moving, she was going to get us all killed,\" Ms Clark said. Combs arrived at her home with a gun in his hand on the morning of the attempted confrontation with Cudi, she told the court, and looked \"furious\". She says she told him she did not want to go with him, to which he allegedly replied: \"I don't give a f**k what you want to do.\" Ms Clark said she had never seen \"anything like this before\", but got dressed and left with Combs in a black Cadillac to head to the property in the Hollywood Hills. She said she waited in the car as Combs went into the residence, and called Cassie to warn her. The rapper had her \"with a gun and brought me to Cudi's house to kill him\", she said she told her. Cudi could be heard in the background of the call, she said, asking: \"He's in my house?\" After the incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs warned her and Cassie not to speak to police and threatened to \"kill all you\" if they did not convince Cudi not to either. In the aftermath of this incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs \"came at\" Cassie with \"100% full force\", repeatedly kicking her while she crouched \"more and more\" into a foetal position and cried \"silently\". The rapper told Ms Clark that if she tried to intervene, \"he was going to f**k me up too\", she said. Earlier in her testimony, she told the court about the start of her employment with Combs and his label Bad Boy Records in 2004. She said after he discovered she had previously worked for Marion \"Suge\" Knight's Death Row Records - the West Coast rival to East Coast Bad Boy - he told her \"if anything happened, he would have to kill me\". Ms Clark said she perceived this as a \"very serious\" threat. She also told the court about another alleged incident just a few weeks into the job, when some diamond jewellery on loan to Combs went missing. She told the court she was taken to a building in Manhattan and forced to repeatedly take lie detector tests over five days. The man who carried out the test told her that if she failed, \"they're going to throw you in the East River\", she said. Combs was not present for the tests and never spoke to her about them, she said, when questioned by defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo. During her testimony, Ms Clark mentioned an incident involving fellow rapper 50 Cent's manager, after both 50 Cent and Combs had done interviews for MTV. Combs mentioned to the manager that they had some issues and told him, \"I like guns\", she said, which she perceived as a vague threat. Read more:Everything you need to know about the Sean Combs trialThe rise and fall of Sean 'Diddy' Combs Ms Clark also described attempting to leave Combs's home in Miami on one occasion in 2006, when she was allegedly told to \"get the f**k back here\" by the rapper. According to Ms Clark, he told her: \"Your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here.\" The trial continues tomorrow, with evidence expected from LA police and fire officers. If convicted, Combs could face between 15 years and life in prison."

        "Content": "\n          Data and forensics correspondent\n              @chesh\n  A car that began slowly nosing its way around pedestrians ended up ploughing into them - and a parade turned into panic. This was a terrifying and chaotic incident. Here's what Sky's Data and Forensics team has been able to reconstruct: exactly what happened, and when. This is what everyone was filling the streets to see - the Liverpool team bus on its victory parade. It began at 2.30pm on Bank Holiday Monday - here is the route the procession took. And that meant closures. Here are all of the roads that were shut to traffic, or should have been. Ahead of the parade, Liverpool City Council had strongly advised people not to drive - particularly in the city centre - and asked fans to walk instead. This is the first time we see the car involved. It's slowly moving west along Dale Street. The timestamp on this footage appears not to have been corrected - reading 4.58pm - likely showing it was filmed at 5.58pm, adjusting for summertime hours. We can see the car here again on that same street, before the worst happens. Footage shows somebody closing a door on the right-hand side, but it is unclear if he was a passenger. The driver reverses, hitting a nearby fan. The crowd reacts angrily - kicking and punching the vehicle. Blocked to the front by a stopped car, the people carrier then reverses at speed towards a man attacking the back window. The crowd then throws objects at the car as it speeds west along Dale Street. Meanwhile, the man reversed into earlier chases the car - smashing the back window with a folding chair. Read more:Victim says he's been left 'traumatised'Why police released 'unprecedented' details about suspect Dale Street turns into Water Street - and less than 100 yards later, on the junction with Rumford Street, police say a road block was in place. But this was lifted for an ambulance, and the car was able to follow in behind - despite its already erratic driving and multiple altercations with the surrounding crowd. After this is when the most damage was done. This video shows the car at a stop on Water Street, with an ambulance close behind. The crowd attacks the car while nearby police attempt to intervene.  It accelerates, hitting pedestrians. The car then swerves right into a crowd of people, before swerving left again and coming to a stop. If we cross reference the various videos to maps of the street, we can see the car covers 40m (131ft) in nine seconds - that means an average speed of 10mph - fast enough to inflict critical injuries. It finished here - with people seen trapped under the wheels. Officers quickly surrounded the car as witnesses attempted to stop the driver, who was eventually detained by police. Afterwards, bystanders were seen walking down the road in shock.  It's only a short stretch of road. But this was a bank holiday, and a big occasion. About one million people came to watch the parade - there were dense crowds everywhere. Police said emergency services responded within \"a matter of seconds\". But questions will now focus on how the suspect was able to drive along at least two streets crowded with people - coming into contact with them and causing casualties - without being stopped."

        "Content": " King Charles says Canada will remain \"strong and free\" - in a speech viewed by many Canadians as a show of support for the country's sovereignty following annexation threats by Donald Trump. It comes after Mr Trump repeatedly suggested that Canada should become America's 51st state. Prime Minister Mark Carney later invited Charles, who is the head of state in Canada, to the state opening of parliament. On Tuesday, Charles said in a speech, written by Mr Carney's government to open Canada's parliament, that the country would remain \"strong and free\", quoting the national anthem, but did not directly refer to Mr Trump's annexation threats. \"We must face reality: since the Second World War, our world has never been more dangerous and unstable. Canada is facing challenges that, in our lifetimes, are unprecedented,\" the King told politicians in the Senate Building in Ottawa in French. \"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them,\" he added. In the speech, he highlighted his admiration for \"Canada's unique identity, which is recognised across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values\". He set out the government's legislative agenda on the second day of his Canada visit, an honour usually reserved for the governor general. King Charles is only the second monarch, after his mother Queen Elizabeth II, to do so. The late queen delivered the speech at the state opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957, her first visit to the country as head of state, and again in 1977. He said that it has been nearly 70 years since his mother first opened the Canadian parliament, and at the time, World War II remained a painful memory while the Cold War was intensifying simultaneously. \"Freedom and democracy were under threat,\" the King said. \"Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\" Royal correspondent This trip was so much more than a royal visit, it was all about cementing Canada's sovereignty.  And what we've seen is two short days, poignantly packed with spectacle and symbolism. From an open-top carriage procession to a theatrical political ceremony - Canada wanted to put on a visual show of sovereignty, and this was a masterclass. All the stops were pulled out. The King must sit above politics, but this was a very political visit. He is King of Canada and head of state here. But he arrives at a time of fractious relations between Canada and the US. Putting him at the centre of Canada's parliament sends a strong signal to President Trump. During the speech, the King added his own warm words, speaking with deep affection about the country. He also spoke of how the crown brings Canada \"unity\" and represents \"stability and continuity\". And then, reading the words of his government, a punchy message to President Trump. Delivered by the King, the words hit home harder.  When he quoted the national anthem with the words Canada must stay \"strong and free\", the applause rose up. At a time when Canada feels threatened by the US, having the King on side matters. The King has been walking a delicate diplomatic tightrope in Ottawa. Here to celebrate Canada, without causing offence to politicians south of the border. President Trump can be unpredictable, but he affectionately holds the King and Royal Family in high regard, and that goes a long way. The King heads home after just twenty-three hours. Canada has been visibly boosted – the bond with its King has been renewed and strategically strengthened. He added that since Queen Elizabeth II's first Canadian parliament opening, the country \"has dramatically changed: repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth\". Addressing the protection of Canada's sovereignty, Charles read out a promise by the Canadian government that it would rebuild, rearm and reinvest in its armed forces. \"It will invest to strengthen its presence in the north, as this region, which is an integral part of the Canadian nation, faces new threats,\" he read. The speech, which was awarded a standing ovation by attendees, was largely written by officials working for Mr Carney's government, with Charles adding his own comments about his love for Canada. The King opening Canada's parliament is a \"clear message of sovereignty\" and \"not coincidental\", Mr Carney previously said.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @jamesmatthewsky\n  Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to the United States, has told Sky News he \"regrets\" his association with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson's links to the late billionaire were exposed in a 2019 report by JP Morgan bank, filed in a New York court. Epstein killed himself in August of that year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. He had previously served an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. Whilst serving that sentence, the JP Morgan report suggests that Mr Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan flat. Epstein wrote to his private banker on 17 June 2009: \"Peter will be staying at 71st over weekend…\" At the time, Lord Mandelson was the Business Secretary in the UK government under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was appointed UK ambassador to the United States in December 2024. Sky News asked him if he did, indeed, stay at Epstein's flat while the disgraced financier was in jail. He replied: \"I'm not answering any questions about him. My knowledge of him is something I regret, I wish I'd never met him in the first place.\" Asked why he had an association with Epstein whilst he was in jail, Lord Mandelson replied: \"Why did many people meet him? He was a prolific networker. And I wish I'd never met him in the first place.\" Read more from Sky News:Manhunt after two people shot dead in US parkKremlin accused Trump of 'emotional overload' As US ambassador, Lord Mandelson represents Britain's interests in Washington and has vowed to treat Donald Trump's administration with \"respect, seriousness and understanding of where they are coming from politically\". This comes after Lord Mandelson described the US president as a \"danger to the world\", for which he apologised earlier this year. He told the Alain Elkann Interviews podcast in 2019: \"What Donald Trump represents and believes is an anathema to mainstream British opinion.\" Lord Mandelson added: \"Even those who have a sneaking admiration for Donald Trump because of his personality, nonetheless regard him as reckless, and a danger to the world.\" But in January this year, Lord Mandelson said he now considered his remarks \"as ill-judged and wrong\"."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  Gayanne Potter is one of Britain's most recognisable voices - behind adverts for the likes of Estee Lauder, Apple, LBC radio, and B&Q. Now, an artificial intelligence (AI) version of her voice is being used on Scotland's nationalised train network, ScotRail. But the professional voiceover artist says she had no idea she had been transformed into a robot until a friend called her last week. \"I was devastated, I was furious, I feel completely violated,\" she told Sky News. \"My voice is my job, and I should be allowed to know who I am working with and what I am working on.\" Ms Potter, who lives on the outskirts of Edinburgh, believes the incident can be traced back to a job she completed during the COVID pandemic with Swedish company ReadSpeaker, where she recorded scripts for the visually impaired. Ms Potter alleges she was unaware the contract allowed her voice to be sold as part of AI years later. Sky News has seen correspondence where the company appeared to reassure Ms Potter's agents they \"would never sell them (the recordings) to anybody else\". Responding to concerns, ReadSpeaker insisted there was a \"very clear contract\" that allows it to \"use... synthesised voices for businesses and organisations\". ScotRail unveiled its new AI announcer, nicknamed \"Iona\", on board the railway network in Scotland this month. The new technology has drawn criticism for mispronouncing place names, with officials asking the public to \"give it time\". Sky News joined Ms Potter on board a train as she discussed the situation. She said: \"I literally didn't know. ScotRail never approached me, ReadSpeaker never approached me. \"ScotRail have said it is not a real person. It is a real person, and I am right here. \"This is a real threat. I have worked really hard for the past 20 years and built trust with clients I work with. And now to have my voice in this dreadful robot is demeaning to me.\" She added: \"I do not consent to my voice data being used. To find out that my personal human data is being used on the trains is appalling. \"I feel like my data is being burgled. I have no control over it.\" Read more:Cloned voices 'could become as common as stunt doubles'Stars release silent album in protest at AI copyright plans Union Equity, which represents workers in the creative industries, is helping Ms Potter fight her case. Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity, said: \"It is extremely exploitative for companies to use and commercialise voice recordings to create digital replicas of artists from contracts which pre-date the development of generative AI or were not drafted explicitly for this purpose. \"Gayanne is directly competing in a marketplace with a low-quality clone of her own voice that she claims was developed without her informed and explicit consent. \"Not only is this distressing for her, but it would represent an infringement of our members' data protection and other rights.\" Roy Lindemann, chief marketing officer at ReadSpeaker, dismissed questions from Sky News about Ms Potter's wishes to withdraw her voice from being sold. He said the firm was aware of Ms Potter's concerns, adding: \"ReadSpeaker and Ms Potter have a contract regarding the use of her voice. \"ReadSpeaker has comprehensively addressed Ms Potter's concerns with her legal representative several times in the past.\" ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish government, said it had \"no plans\" to remove its \"Iona\" AI announcer voice system and rejected questions about Ms Potter's concerns. Phil Campbell, ScotRail customer operations director, said: \"We are always looking at ways to improve the customer journey experience, and we know how important both on-train and at-station announcements are. \"The use of an automated voice allows us to have more control over the announcements being made, ensures consistency for customers, and gives us flexibility to make changes at short notice.\" A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \"While sub-contracts are a matter for ScotRail, the Scottish government expects it, as a publicly controlled organisation, to ensure all agreements entered into are within the parameters of Public Sector Procurement guidance and meet Fair Work principles. \"This includes the use of AI technology.\""

        "Content": "London mayor Sadiq Khan has backed calls for the possession of small quantities of natural cannabis to be decriminalised.  Sir Sadiq said a new report, published by the independent London Drugs Commission (LDC) today, provides \"a compelling, evidence-based case\" for the government to consider the move. Under current laws, cannabis is a Class B drug and people found in possession face a fine or imprisonment. The LDC, set up by the mayor in 2022 and chaired by former lord chancellor Lord Charlie Falconer, has said the current laws on cannabis are \"disproportionate to the harms it can pose\". Its study examined how the drug is policed around the world - and also found cannabis policing \"continues to focus on particular ethnic communities,\" damaging their relations with law enforcement. The commission stops short of calling for full decriminalisation and instead says \"natural\" cannabis should be moved from the Misuse of Drugs Act to the Psychoactive Substances Act. This would effectively legalise the possession of small amounts for personal use while continuing to prohibit importing, manufacturing or distributing the drug. \n                  Who are the gangs behind the cannabis home delivery service?\n                 \n                  The online drug trade behind QR code stickers plastered on streets across the UK \n                 \n                  Kara Alexander: Dagenham mother who murdered her two young sons in the bath jailed\n                 The LDC is also calling for improved addiction services and better education on the dangers of cannabis for young people. Sir Sadiq said: \"I've long been clear that we need fresh thinking on how to reduce the substantial harms associated with drug-related crime in our communities.\" The report \"makes a compelling, evidenced-based case for the decriminalisation of possession of small quantities of natural cannabis which the government should consider,\" he added. \"It says that the current sentencing for those caught in possession of natural cannabis cannot be justified given its relative harm and people's experience of the justice system. \"We must recognise that better education, improved healthcare and more effective, equitable policing of cannabis use are long overdue.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 Lord Falconer said: \"Legalisation is not the answer. The criminal justice system response needs to focus only on the dealers and not the users. \"Those who suffer from the adverse effects of cannabis - which may be a small percentage of users but it is a high number of people - need reliable, consistent medical and other support.

The Conservatives have rubbished Sir Sadiq's suggestion, with shadow home secretary Chris Philp saying: \"Cannabis is associated with anti-social behaviour and heavy use can lead to serious psychosis and severed mental health problems. \"US and Canadian cities which tried this approach have ended up as crime-ridden ghettos with stupefied addicts on the streets and law-abiding citizens frightened to go there.\""

        "Content": "\n          Politics reporter\n              @FaithLRidler\n A British trade envoy has visited Israel to \"promote trade\" between the two countries - a week after the UK suspended talks. Lord Ian Austin, who is the UK government's trade envoy to Israel, was welcomed to Haifa on Monday, just days after Foreign Secretary David Lammy paused negotiations. The British Embassy in Israel said Lord Austin had visited a number of projects - such as the Customs Scanning Centre, Haifa Bayport, and the Haifa-Nazareth Light Rail project - to \"witness co-operation at every stop\". Politics latest: Farage makes multibillion pound spending pledges  The independent peer said he was visiting Israel to \"meet businesses and officials to promote trade with the UK\". \"Trade with Israel provides many thousands of good jobs in the UK and brings people together in the great multi-cultural democracy that is Israel,\" he said. Last Tuesday, the government confirmed it was suspending its trade negotiations with Israel in the wake of an accelerated military offensive in Gaza and the country's decision to limit the amount of aid allowed into the Palestinian territory. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  Government accused of watering down environment rules in housebuilding proposals\n                 Mr Lammy told the Commons that Israel's actions were \"egregious\" and amounted to a \"dark new phase in this conflict\". But despite the suspension of any new trade talks with Israel, Number 10 has insisted that the UK still has a trading relationship with the country. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: \"We have always had a trading relationship, but are pausing any new ones.\" The UK has sanctioned a number of individuals and groups in the West Bank which it said have been linked with acts of violence against Palestinians - including Daniella Weiss, a leading settler activist who was the subject of Louis Theroux's recent documentary The Settlers. Israel criticised the UK government action as \"regrettable\" and said the free trade agreement talks, which ministers have now backed out of, were \"not being advanced at all by the UK government\". Lord Austin has previously stressed the importance of the UK's trading relationship with Israel, claiming it is \"worth billions and brings massive benefits to Britain\". Writing for Politics Home, he said: \"It is in our national interest, and the decision this week by the government to pause negotiations on a new Free Trade Agreement does not change that. \"The situation in Gaza is terrible, as it is in all wars, and the quickest way to get the aid in and save lives is for Hamas to stop fighting and release the hostages. That would end the conflict immediately.\""

        "Content": "The government has been accused of watering down rules that require developers to leave wildlife habitats in a better state than they found them when building new homes. Ministers are seeking to give a boost to smaller housing developments with faster planning decisions and financial backing to speed up building new homes. Under the proposals, Labour would cut red tape and shift planning decisions away from councillors and towards expert officers - all as part of efforts to meet Sir Keir Starmer's pledge to build 1.5 million homes by 2029-30. Politics latest: Farage says 'yes' he can be PM The consultation will also consider easing biodiversity net gain requirements for minor developments. At the moment, these mean builders must pay to boost nature habitats if they are impacted by the development process. But the government hopes to create a new category for medium-sized developments - those with between 10 and 49 homes - with fewer costs, simplified biodiversity net gain rules and an exemption from the building safety levy. An 89-strong coalition of environment groups has warned that these reduced biodiversity rules would mean the vast majority of housing developments would no longer need to compensate for nature loss. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  UK trade representative visits Israel after Britain suspends talks\n                 The Wildlife and Countryside Link also suggested that developers could be allowed to break up large projects into smaller ones to avoid the rules. Richard Banwell, the group's chief executive, has urged the government not to \"turn back the clock to the days of damaging development\" with changes to this system. He said: \"Exempting small sites would mean almost three-quarters of developments face no requirement to compensate for nature loss - let alone enhance it. \"These changes could leave the biodiversity net gain system dead in the water and, with it, the government's main guarantee of nature-positive planning.\" However, the government has described the simplified biodiversity net gain rules for medium-sized developments as a \"win-win for nature and development\".

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US, said on Tuesday it had distributed around 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to about 462,000 meals - just a fraction of what is needed, aid agencies say. The centres have opened as hundreds of legal professionals in the UK, including lawyers and former judges, accused Israel of \"genocide\" and \"war crimes\". Crowds including women and children could be seen at one centre in Rafah, southern Gaza, where people received packages including rice, flour, canned beans, pasta, olive oil, biscuits and sugar. Witnesses in Rafah said Israeli gunfire was heard after desperate people broke fences to reach supplies. The Israeli military said its forces did not direct aerial gunfire towards the centre, but rather fired warning shots in an area outside the hub.

Israeli officials said one advantage of the new aid system is the chance to screen recipients to exclude anyone they say is connected with Hamas. Humanitarian groups briefed on the plans say anyone receiving aid will have to submit to facial recognition technology - which many Palestinians fear will end up in Israeli hands to track and possibly target them. Father-of-seven Abu Ahmed said: \"As much as I want to go because I am hungry and my children are hungry, I am afraid.\" He continued: \"I am so scared because they said the company [GHF] belongs to Israel and is a mercenary, and also because the resistance [Hamas] said not to go.\" UN boycotts aid foundation Israel previously said its forces would not be involved in the distribution points but its endorsement of the plan, which resembles Israeli schemes floated previously, has led to many questioning the neutrality of GHF.

It continues: \"War crimes, crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law are being committed.\" Israel has consistently denied these accusations. As a small flow of aid has arrived in Gaza after Israel's months-long blockade, Israeli forces have kept up attacks on various targets in the territory. Some 3,901 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.  As the GHF centres opened on Monday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 36 people in a school-turned-shelter that was hit as people slept, according to local health officials.

Caroline Darian's father Dominique Pelicot admitted repeatedly drugging and raping his wife Gisele between 2011 and 2020, and inviting dozens of other men to their home in southern France to do the same. Gisele decided to waive her right to anonymity to hold the trial of her husband and 50 other men in public, saying: \"It is not for us to be ashamed, but for those men.\" Politics latest: Farage says 'yes' he can be PM Speaking to Ali Fortescue on The Politics Hub, Ms Darian said the UK government's plans to consider mandatory chemical castration could be \"one part of the solution\" for men like her father. She said: \"It's probably one part of the solution because you know when you're at that level of crime, that level of criminal, there is nothing else you can do.\" Asked if she believed \"men like your father\" could be rehabilitated, Ms Darian said \"no\" and \"never\".

Some denied the rape charges, claiming they believed Gisele had agreed to be drugged and was a willing participant in a sex game between the couple. But all the men charged were found guilty of at least one offence, with nearly all convicted of rape, after a trial that shocked France and made headlines around the world. The defendants were sentenced to a total of more than 400 years, with Pelicot being sentenced to 20 years in prison. Pelicot also took photos of his daughter Caroline semi-naked while she was asleep.

Speaking to French media, Beatrice Zavarro, Pelicot's lawyer, said Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising\". She added that prosecutors had said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on Ms Darian.

        "Content": " King Charles says Canada will remain \"strong and free\" - in a speech viewed by many Canadians as a show of support for the country's sovereignty following annexation threats by Donald Trump. It comes after Mr Trump repeatedly suggested that Canada should become America's 51st state. Prime Minister Mark Carney later invited Charles, who is the head of state in Canada, to the state opening of parliament. On Tuesday, Charles said in a speech, written by Mr Carney's government to open Canada's parliament, that the country would remain \"strong and free\", quoting the national anthem, but did not directly refer to Mr Trump's annexation threats. \"We must face reality: since the Second World War, our world has never been more dangerous and unstable. Canada is facing challenges that, in our lifetimes, are unprecedented,\" the King told politicians in the Senate Building in Ottawa in French. \"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them,\" he added. In the speech, he highlighted his admiration for \"Canada's unique identity, which is recognised across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values\". He set out the government's legislative agenda on the second day of his Canada visit, an honour usually reserved for the governor general. King Charles is only the second monarch, after his mother Queen Elizabeth II, to do so. The late queen delivered the speech at the state opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957, her first visit to the country as head of state, and again in 1977. He said that it has been nearly 70 years since his mother first opened the Canadian parliament, and at the time, World War II remained a painful memory while the Cold War was intensifying simultaneously. \"Freedom and democracy were under threat,\" the King said. \"Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\" Royal correspondent This trip was so much more than a royal visit, it was all about cementing Canada's sovereignty.  And what we've seen is two short days, poignantly packed with spectacle and symbolism. From an open-top carriage procession to a theatrical political ceremony - Canada wanted to put on a visual show of sovereignty, and this was a masterclass. All the stops were pulled out. The King must sit above politics, but this was a very political visit. He is King of Canada and head of state here. But he arrives at a time of fractious relations between Canada and the US. Putting him at the centre of Canada's parliament sends a strong signal to President Trump. During the speech, the King added his own warm words, speaking with deep affection about the country. He also spoke of how the crown brings Canada \"unity\" and represents \"stability and continuity\". And then, reading the words of his government, a punchy message to President Trump. Delivered by the King, the words hit home harder.  When he quoted the national anthem with the words Canada must stay \"strong and free\", the applause rose up. At a time when Canada feels threatened by the US, having the King on side matters. The King has been walking a delicate diplomatic tightrope in Ottawa. Here to celebrate Canada, without causing offence to politicians south of the border. President Trump can be unpredictable, but he affectionately holds the King and Royal Family in high regard, and that goes a long way. The King heads home after just twenty-three hours. Canada has been visibly boosted – the bond with its King has been renewed and strategically strengthened. He added that since Queen Elizabeth II's first Canadian parliament opening, the country \"has dramatically changed: repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth\". Addressing the protection of Canada's sovereignty, Charles read out a promise by the Canadian government that it would rebuild, rearm and reinvest in its armed forces. \"It will invest to strengthen its presence in the north, as this region, which is an integral part of the Canadian nation, faces new threats,\" he read. The speech, which was awarded a standing ovation by attendees, was largely written by officials working for Mr Carney's government, with Charles adding his own comments about his love for Canada. The King opening Canada's parliament is a \"clear message of sovereignty\" and \"not coincidental\", Mr Carney previously said. Read more from Sky News:Carney: Canadians facing 'biggest crisis' of their lifeCanada will 'never be part of US', country's PM says He also revealed that Canadians \"weren't impressed\" by the decision of the UK government to offer Mr Trump an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Politics reporter\n              @FaithLRidler\n A British trade envoy has visited Israel to \"promote trade\" between the two countries - a week after the UK suspended talks. Lord Ian Austin, who is the UK government's trade envoy to Israel, was welcomed to Haifa on Monday, just days after Foreign Secretary David Lammy paused negotiations. The British Embassy in Israel said Lord Austin had visited a number of projects - such as the Customs Scanning Centre, Haifa Bayport, and the Haifa-Nazareth Light Rail project - to \"witness co-operation at every stop\". Politics latest: Farage makes multibillion pound spending pledges  The independent peer said he was visiting Israel to \"meet businesses and officials to promote trade with the UK\". \"Trade with Israel provides many thousands of good jobs in the UK and brings people together in the great multi-cultural democracy that is Israel,\" he said. Last Tuesday, the government confirmed it was suspending its trade negotiations with Israel in the wake of an accelerated military offensive in Gaza and the country's decision to limit the amount of aid allowed into the Palestinian territory. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  Government accused of watering down environment rules in housebuilding proposals\n                 Mr Lammy told the Commons that Israel's actions were \"egregious\" and amounted to a \"dark new phase in this conflict\". But despite the suspension of any new trade talks with Israel, Number 10 has insisted that the UK still has a trading relationship with the country. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: \"We have always had a trading relationship, but are pausing any new ones.\" The UK has sanctioned a number of individuals and groups in the West Bank which it said have been linked with acts of violence against Palestinians - including Daniella Weiss, a leading settler activist who was the subject of Louis Theroux's recent documentary The Settlers. Israel criticised the UK government action as \"regrettable\" and said the free trade agreement talks, which ministers have now backed out of, were \"not being advanced at all by the UK government\". Lord Austin has previously stressed the importance of the UK's trading relationship with Israel, claiming it is \"worth billions and brings massive benefits to Britain\". Writing for Politics Home, he said: \"It is in our national interest, and the decision this week by the government to pause negotiations on a new Free Trade Agreement does not change that. \"The situation in Gaza is terrible, as it is in all wars, and the quickest way to get the aid in and save lives is for Hamas to stop fighting and release the hostages. That would end the conflict immediately.\""

The teenager, named locally as Ryan Satterthwaite, suffered a serious head injury when tackled in Palmerston North on Sunday afternoon and was taken to hospital by his friends, police said. However, Inspector Ross Grantham confirmed he died on Monday night. \"This young man's death is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts are with his family and friends,\" he said in a statement. The game he and his friends had been playing was based on the \"run it straight\" game, which has grown in popularity online and sees people compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear. Mr Grantham added: \"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity. \"We would urge anyone thinking about taking part in a game or event like this to consider the significant safety and injury risks.\" Police said they are not treating what happened as a criminal matter but will continue to investigate the incident on behalf of the coroner.

        "Content": " French President Emmanuel Macron has dismissed a video of him being pushed in the face by his wife as \"nonsense\". The clip, which shows Brigitte Macron place her hands on her husband's face as they prepare to exit their plane in Vietnam, sparked suggestions that the French first couple were caught in the middle of an argument. But Mr Macron said afterwards it was a case of \"simply joking with my wife, as we often do\". The pair's relationship has been in the headlines since Mr Macron's political career put him, and his loved ones, in the public eye. Both have been questioned about their 25-year age gap - he is 47 and she is 72 - as well as their unconventional meet. Use our slider below to look through some of the key moments of the Macrons' relationship. When Emmanuel met Brigitte Mr Macron met Brigitte Trogneux, as she was then known, in 1993 when he was 15. At the time, she worked as a teacher at his secondary school in the French city of Amiens. As a student, Mr Macron was not in the classes his future wife taught, but the pair spent time together while working on a school play and during theatre workshops she ran. She was almost 40, married to banker Andre Auziere and had three children, Sebastien, Laurence, and Tiphaine. According to biographer Anne Fulda, who interviewed the Macron family, the French leader's parents initially thought he had a crush on Laurence Auziere, who was in his class at school. But in fact it was her mum. Mr Macron's mother, Francoise, is quoted in Ms Fulda's book as saying: \"We couldn't believe it. What is clear is that when Emmanuel met Brigitte we couldn't just say: 'That's great!'\" His parents also allegedly told Brigitte to stay away from their son until he was 18, to which she replied: \"I cannot promise you anything.\" Years later, she would confide in a friend that being with the young French president was like \"working with Mozart\". 'I will marry you' Defying the orders from Mr Macron's parents, the pair kept in touch, even after he was sent to Paris to complete his education at one of France's finest schools. Now around the age of 17, Mr Macron told his future wife: \"I will be back for you. Whatever you do, I will marry you.\" In a 2017 interview with Elle France magazine, Mrs Macron said there was \"nothing between\" the two of them at the time he went to Paris, but it \"all unfolded very slowly\". She said: \"The great distances that separated us physically until 2007. But we wrote to each other all the time during that period. \"It all unfolded very slowly. I gradually brought my family to realise that. Emmanuel gradually brought his family to realise that.\" She admitted at the time she was concerned for her children as \"spiteful gossip\" had been \"making the rounds\". The couple eventually got married in 2007, a year after she divorced Mr Auziere. At the time of their wedding, he was 29 and she was 54. Life as the French first lady Nearly a decade after tying the knot, Mr Macron made a bid for the presidency, which he won in May 2017. From the moment Mr Macron started campaigning in 2016, his wife was with him on the election trail, during which he said he would \"clarify\" the role of the head of state's spouse. Shortly after becoming the first lady, Mrs Macron was asked about the relationship with her husband, and their age gap - which is the same as Donald and Melania Trump. She told Elle France that the difference in their ages is a \"joke between\" them, adding: \"Anything anyone might say about the 20 years' difference is just a big nothing.\" She said: \"Of course, we have breakfast, me with my wrinkles, him with his fresh face, but that's how it is. If I had not made that choice, I would have missed out on my life.\" Dispelling rumours As a couple, Mr and Mrs Macron have had to dispel various rumours that have emerged about them both. In 2017 Mr Macron laughed off rumours of a gay affair outside his marriage, saying: \"If you're told I lead a double life... it's because my hologram has escaped.\" Read more from Sky News:New Zealand teenager dies after viral tackling gameMount Everest guide breaks own record Then in 2022, Mrs Macron launched legal action over the spread of false claims that she was transgender. In September 2024, she was awarded €8,000 (£6,000) in damages by a Paris court after it found two women guilty of spreading the false allegations."

        "Content": "A British man has been jailed in Bali for drug offences - and a charge that carried the death penalty was dropped. A court on the Indonesian island sentenced Thomas Parker, from Cumbria, to 10 months in jail on Tuesday. He was spared the death penalty after a charge that could carry the punishment was dropped. Parker was arrested on 21 January at a villa near the popular Bali tourist spot, Kuta beach. Police said Parker was \"acting suspiciously\" when he collected a package containing drugs from a motorcycle taxi driver. He allegedly discarded the package in a panic and fled the scene when approached by police. The 32-year-old was able to prove that he did not order the package. It was sent by a drug dealer friend, identified only as Nicky, and Parker was told someone would pick it up from him shortly afterwards. The trial, which began at the Denpasar District Court last month, heard Parker initially refused to collect the package but was assured by Nicky that it was safe and would not put him in danger. Indonesia has very strict drug laws and people convicted of drug trafficking can be executed by a firing squad. After police established the package was not directly linked to Parker, the initial charge of drug trafficking was reduced to the lesser offence of hiding information from authorities. The prosecution had sought a year-long prison sentence for Parker, but judges reduced the term as the electrician regretted his actions and had no previous convictions.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Sean \"Diddy\" Combs kidnapped a former aide at gunpoint to join him as he attempted to confront love rival rapper Kid Cudi, his sex-trafficking trial has been told. Capricorn Clark, who worked for the Bad Boy Records co-founder in different roles on and off for several years, told the court he banged on her door and told her: \"Get dressed, we're going to kill Mescudi.\" Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, last week testified himself about the alleged incident in December 2011. Ms Clark became tearful a few times as she gave evidence - which marked the start of the third week of the high-profile trial. She told the court her situation working for the hip-hop mogul was \"complicated\". Combs, 55, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, is accused of subjecting his former long-term partner Cassie and others to years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial: Day 10 - as it happened While giving her own evidence in the first week of the trial, Cassie told jurors she dated Cudi briefly during a difficult period in her on-off relationship with Combs. On Tuesday, Ms Clark said she warned Cassie about seeing Cudi, saying she took her to buy a burner phone as she thought it could be dangerous given how Combs might react. \"The way she was moving, she was going to get us all killed,\" Ms Clark said. Combs arrived at her home with a gun in his hand on the morning of the attempted confrontation with Cudi, she told the court, and looked \"furious\". She says she told him she did not want to go with him, to which he allegedly replied: \"I don't give a f**k what you want to do.\" Ms Clark said she had never seen \"anything like this before\", but got dressed and left with Combs in a black Cadillac to head to the property in the Hollywood Hills. She said she waited in the car as Combs went into the residence, and called Cassie to warn her. The rapper had her \"with a gun and brought me to Cudi's house to kill him\", she said she told her. Cudi could be heard in the background of the call, she said, asking: \"He's in my house?\" After the incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs warned her and Cassie not to speak to police and threatened to \"kill all you\" if they did not convince Cudi not to either. In the aftermath of this incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs \"came at\" Cassie with \"100% full force\", repeatedly kicking her while she crouched \"more and more\" into a foetal position and cried \"silently\". The rapper told Ms Clark that if she tried to intervene, \"he was going to f**k me up too\", she said. Earlier in her testimony, she told the court about the start of her employment with Combs and his label Bad Boy Records in 2004. She said after he discovered she had previously worked for Marion \"Suge\" Knight's Death Row Records - the West Coast rival to East Coast Bad Boy - he told her \"if anything happened, he would have to kill me\". Ms Clark said she perceived this as a \"very serious\" threat. She also told the court about another alleged incident just a few weeks into the job, when some diamond jewellery on loan to Combs went missing. She told the court she was taken to a building in Manhattan and forced to repeatedly take lie detector tests over five days. The man who carried out the test told her that if she failed, \"they're going to throw you in the East River\", she said. Combs was not present for the tests and never spoke to her about them, she said, when questioned by defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo. During her testimony, Ms Clark mentioned an incident involving fellow rapper 50 Cent's manager, after both 50 Cent and Combs had done interviews for MTV. Combs mentioned to the manager that they had some issues and told him, \"I like guns\", she said, which she perceived as a vague threat.

According to Ms Clark, he told her: \"Your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here.\" The trial continues tomorrow, with evidence expected from LA police and fire officers. If convicted, Combs could face between 15 years and life in prison."

Lord Mandelson's links to the late billionaire were exposed in a 2019 report by JP Morgan bank, filed in a New York court. Epstein killed himself in August of that year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. He had previously served an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. Whilst serving that sentence, the JP Morgan report suggests that Mr Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan flat. Epstein wrote to his private banker on 17 June 2009: \"Peter will be staying at 71st over weekend…\" At the time, Lord Mandelson was the Business Secretary in the UK government under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was appointed UK ambassador to the United States in December 2024. Sky News asked him if he did, indeed, stay at Epstein's flat while the disgraced financier was in jail. He replied: \"I'm not answering any questions about him. My knowledge of him is something I regret, I wish I'd never met him in the first place.\" Asked why he had an association with Epstein whilst he was in jail, Lord Mandelson replied: \"Why did many people meet him?

This comes after Lord Mandelson described the US president as a \"danger to the world\", for which he apologised earlier this year. He told the Alain Elkann Interviews podcast in 2019: \"What Donald Trump represents and believes is an anathema to mainstream British opinion.\" Lord Mandelson added: \"Even those who have a sneaking admiration for Donald Trump because of his personality, nonetheless regard him as reckless, and a danger to the world.\" But in January this year, Lord Mandelson said he now considered his remarks \"as ill-judged and wrong\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The UK economy will grow more than previously thought, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has upgraded its latest forecast. It also said the Bank of England should \"continue to ease monetary policy gradually\", indicating it expected further reductions in interest rates. But it warned trade tensions linked to US tariff plans will reduce UK economic growth next year. The Washington-based UN financial agency said the UK economy will expand 1.2% this year and \"gain momentum next year\". The upgrade in forecasts, however, is slight, up from an expected 1.1% announced in April as the world reeled from the global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. That April figure was a 0.5% downgrade from the projected 1.6% growth for 2025 the IMF foresaw in January and the 1.5% forecast issued in October. It means the IMF expects the UK economy to grow less this year than it forecast in October and January. Money blog: Britons face 100% property tax in Spain Tariffs warnings  This anticipated lower growth is largely due to tariffs - taxes on goods imported to the United States - and the uncertainty caused by shifting trade policy in the US, the world's largest economy. While many tariffs have been paused until 8 July, it's unclear if deals will be in place by then and if pauses may be extended. The effect of this has been quantified as a 0.3 percentage points lower growth by 2026 in the UK, the IMF said. The organisation held its prediction that the UK economy will grow by 1.4% in 2026. \"The forecast assumes that global trade tensions lower the level of UK GDP by 0.3% by 2026, due to persistent uncertainty, slower activity in UK trading partners, and the direct impact of remaining US tariffs on the UK,\" it said.  It comes despite the UK having agreed a deal with the Trump administration to circumvent the 25% tariffs on cars and metals. The IMF also cautioned that \"weak productivity continues to weigh on medium-term growth prospects\". Lower productivity has been an issue since the global financial crash of 2008-2009, but has been caused by \"chronic under-investment\", low private sector research and development, limited access to finance for businesses to expand, skill gaps, and a \"deterioration in health outcomes\", it said. Interest rates Interest rates \"should\" continue to come down, making borrowing cheaper, though the IMF acknowledged rate-setters at the Bank of England now have a \"more complex\" job due to the recent rise in inflation and \"fragile\" growth. The author of the report on the UK, Luc Eyraud, said the IMF expected the Bank to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points every three months until they reach a level of around 3%, down from the current 4.25%. Praise was given to the UK government as the IMF said \"fiscal plans strike a good balance between supporting growth and safeguarding fiscal sustainability\". \"After a slowdown in the second half of 2024, an economic recovery is under way,\" the IMF said. Global factors - \"weaker export performance in the challenging global environment\" - are blamed for the slowdown last year. The news is being taken as a win by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. \"The UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 for the first three months of this year and today the IMF has upgraded our growth forecast,\" she said. \"We're getting results for working people through our plan for change - with three new trade deals protecting jobs, boosting investment and cutting prices, a pay rise for three million workers through the national living wage, and wages beating inflation by £1,000 over the past year.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government is considering getting rid of the two-child benefit cap first brought in by the Conservatives. The policy has caused considerable consternation within the Labour Party, with a growing number of MPs calling to scrap it and ministers so far refusing to. Farage says he can be PM - politics latest But now, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has given the government's strongest hint yet it may scrap the cap after she told Sky News ministers are \"considering\" lifting it. We look at what the cap is and the controversy over it. What is the two-child benefit cap? Since 2017, parents have only been able to claim child tax credit and universal credit for their first two children, if they were born after April 2017. An exception is made for children born as a result of rape.  Who introduced it? Then work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith first proposed the policy in 2012 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. It was not until 2015 that then chancellor George Osborne announced a cap would be introduced from the 2017/2018 financial year. The coalition said it made the system fairer for taxpayers and ensured households on benefits faced the same financial choices around having children as those not on benefits. Read more:Why PM's Reform strategy may backfireWinter fuel U-turn could have big consequences What is Labour's position on the cap? The party has long been divided over the issue, with Sir Keir Starmer ruling out scrapping the cap in 2023. He then said Labour wanted to remove it, but only when fiscal conditions allowed. Following Labour's landslide victory last July, the prime minister refused to bow to pressure within his party, and suspended seven MPs for six months for voting with the SNP to scrap the cap. Ministers have toed the party line for months, but the narrative started to shift in May, with Sir Keir reported to have asked the Treasury to see how scrapping it could be funded. The publication of Labour's child poverty strategy was delayed from the spring to autumn, fuelling speculation the government wants to use the next budget to scrap the cap. Then the education secretary told Sky News on 27 May lifting the cap is \"not off the table\" - and \"it's certainly something that we're considering\".  How many children does the cap affect? Government figures show one in nine children (1.6m) are impacted by the two-child limit. In the first three months Labour were in power, 10,000 children were pulled into poverty by the cap, the Child Poverty Action Group found. In May, it said another 109 children are pulled into poverty each day by the limit, adding to the 4.5 million already in poverty. The Resolution Foundation said the cap would increase the number of children in poverty to 4.8 million by the next election in 2029-30. Torsten Bell, the foundation's former chief executive and now a Labour Treasury minister, said scrapping the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty. How much would lifting the cap cost the taxpayer? The cap means for every subsequent child after the first two, families cannot claim benefits worth £3,455 a year, according to the Institute for Government. It estimates removing the limit would cost the government about £3.4bn a year - equal to roughly 3% of the total working-age benefit budget. It is also approximately the same cost as freezing fuel duties for the next parliament. Research has found the indirect fiscal impacts of lifting the cap could be higher, as some data shows investing in young children can pay for itself by causing better outcomes for them later in life."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n London's congestion charge could rise by 20% next year under new proposals, in the first hike since 2020. Transport for London (TfL) has started a consultation on behalf of London mayor Sadiq Khan to increase the daily charge from £15 to £18 from January 2026. The fee was last put up five years ago, with a 30% rise from £11.50. Combined with the £12.50 ultra-low emission zone charge, owners of older cars would have to pay £30.50 a day to drive in the capital. TfL said the cost could rise annually by 2026 and the proposed 20% rise is below the inflation increase for the six years it will have been since the last rise. Politics latest: Farage makes multibillion pound spending pledges A second proposal is a new cleaner vehicle discount which will see a 50% discount for electric vans, heavy goods vehicles and quadricycles using Auto Pay and a 25% discount for electric cars using Auto Pay. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  UK trade representative visits Israel after Britain suspends talks\n                 Currently, all electric vehicles can drive through the congestion zone for free but that is set to end on Christmas Day this year. The proposal also suggests electric vehicles should get less of a discount by 4 March 2030, with 25% for the first set of vehicles and 12.5% discount for electric cars. TfL said the discounts would be applied automatically based on DVLA data so eligible customers will no longer have to register for the cleaner vehicle discount and pay a registration fee. A third proposal would affect residents not using an electric car, as the current 90% blanket residents' discount would be removed from 1 March 2027. TfL said this would be appropriate to \"incentivise\" residents to own \"the cleanest available vehicles\". However, it said the removal of the 90% discount for non-EVs would only apply to new applicants, so those already registered for the residents' discount would not have to pay the charge each day. The consultation, which runs until 4 August on TfL's \"have your say\" website, said the changes will make the congestion charge \"more effective in managing traffic and congestion\". \"The mayor also has ambitions for London to become a net-zero carbon city by 2030 and for the World Health Organisation's air quality guidelines to be achieved as soon as possible,\" it adds.  Seb Dance, deputy mayor for transport, said: \"Keeping London moving by reducing congestion is vital for our city and for our economy. \"The congestion charge has been a huge success since its introduction, but we must ensure it is fit for purpose. \"Sticking to the status quo would see around 2,200 more vehicles using the congestion charging zone on an average weekday next year. \"At the same time, we must support Londoners and businesses to use greener and more sustainable travel. That's why I'm pleased we're proposing that substantial incentives remain in place for Londoners who switch to cleaner vehicles. \"We encourage everyone to have their say and respond to the public consultation.\" The congestion charge zone was first introduced by Ken Livingstone in 2003 at £5 a day and was doubled in 2010, then rose again in 2014 to £11.50. The zone is one of the largest in the world, despite it being reduced in 2007 and 2011. In 2019, the ultra-low emission zone was introduced for vehicles that do not meet the emissions standards, so they must pay both charges. It was expanded in 2023 to cover the whole of Greater London. Failure to pay the congestion charge on time can mean a fine of between £65 and £195."

        "Content": "Ministers have pledged to \"back the next generation\" by investing in tens of thousands of new apprenticeships and training opportunities. The government has promised to create 120,000 new training routes for construction workers, engineers, healthcare staff and other trades in England before the next general election. This is part of a wider effort to increase British workers' skills and cut net migration in the UK. Sir Keir Starmer's training hike will include an extra 30,000 apprenticeships in the next four years, with a budget of more than £3bn in the current financial year. Politics latest: More welfare headaches for Starmer Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Labour is investing in a \"shared, stronger economic future\" through Britain's young people. She said: \"A skilled workforce is the key to steering the economy forward, and today we're backing the next generation by giving young people more opportunities to learn a trade, earn a wage and achieve and thrive. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  UK trade representative visits Israel after Britain suspends talks\n                 \"But everyone has a role to play in a thriving economy, and we're taking our responsibility seriously providing more routes into employment, it's now the responsibility of young people to take them.\" From January 2026, funding will be shifted away from masters-level apprenticeships to focus on training at lower levels, although support will be maintained for those aged 16-21 and existing apprentices.  Neil O'Brien, the shadow education minister, has criticised this move, saying the \"decision to scrap higher apprenticeships will do damage to the public services, particularly the NHS\". He added: \"It will make it impossible for many young people who don't go to university to enter the professions. Numerous employers and professional bodies have warned about the damage scrapping higher apprenticeships will do, which is why this is being snuck out during recess. \"Bridget Phillipson's decision to axe almost all higher apprenticeships is compounding the damage done by increasing national insurance which is already increasing youth unemployment.\" Read more on Sky News:Dozens injured after car drove into crowd in LiverpoolTrump criticises Putin after deadly strikes across Ukraine The immigration White Paper published earlier this month set out plans to hike the immigration skills charge by 32% to \"upskill the domestic workforce and reduce reliance on migration\". Up to 45,000 of the government's new training places will be funded by this change. Sarah Yong, director of policy and public affairs at the Youth Futures Foundation said: \"International evidence shows apprenticeships are a highly impactful way to support young people to prepare for and access jobs, yet participation among under-25s, especially the most marginalised, has declined in recent years. \"With stubbornly high youth unemployment and inactivity, rebalancing the apprenticeship system can encourage investment in youth apprenticeships and is a first step in enabling more young people to access good work.\" Meanwhile, the Law Society urged the government to continue to fund masters-level apprenticeships for those aged over 21. They claimed that apprenticeships \"play a vital role in promoting social mobility\" in the UK."

        "Content": "\n          Live news reporter\n              @bradley_jyoung\n Abandoning her career to look after their two daughters was what Isobel's* ex-husband wanted. Six years after their divorce, she earns a quarter of his salary while caring for the children six out of seven days. Despite having two university degrees, she is \"trapped\" on universal credit and frustrated with a \"ludicrous\" divorce system that didn't account for years of unpaid work to support her ex and raise their family. \"I feel hugely let down and I feel cheated by a system that feels so orchestrated towards women being on the back foot,\" said Isobel, 44, from Berkshire.

Wives can expect their income to be halved on average in the year after ending the relationship, compared with a 30% drop for husbands. A closer look at Isobel's divorce settlement - and why half didn't seem anywhere near fair Isobel was earning £19,500 working for a pharmaceutical company in 2007 when she married her ex-husband. She took voluntary redundancy while on maternity leave in 2008 and over the next nine years only briefly worked part-time. \"It [the jobs] didn't last very long because he didn't manage very well with me being at work,\" she said. When they divorced in 2019, she had been back in work for two years. But her care assistant salary was just £17,000 - much less than her likely salary if she hadn't given up her career to be a mum. As for her husband - he was now taking home approximately £52,000. Read more from Money:12-hour days, £350k salary: Life as a divorce lawyerHow data roaming charges compare by network'My council tax band went up - what can I do?' In a roughly even settlement, she was awarded the car, one buy-to-let flat with £50,000 equity, and £55,000 of £200,000 equity from the family home, plus child maintenance. He was awarded the remainder of the equity and a separate buy-to-let flat. She spent £20,000 on solicitors' fees and, given her low wages, much of the rest of her capital was used to pay off debt accumulated after separating and renting from 2018 onwards, she said. \"Why on earth would it [the settlement] be a 50-50 split when my earning capability is a quarter of what he earns?\" said Isobel, who is now a nurse on £25,000 a year while her ex-husband earns six figures. \"I've had six years out of work, I'm the primary carer for the children, I'm never going to be able to get a job that gives me £100,000, am I? That's ludicrous. And why is that not taken into account?\" Some more data Double the number of divorced women (14%) have cut their hours to manage caring responsibilities compared with men (7%), Legal and General (L&G) found. \"Women still pick up the majority share of caring responsibilities, both for children as part of the family unit, but also elderly relatives,\" said Lorna Shah, managing director of retail retirement at the pension provider. Shah sees a lot of cases where married women prioritise the family unit over their own financial well-being and long-term earning potential. Emma Hitchings, professor of family law at the University of Bristol, agrees: \"Wives, and particularly mothers, are in a precarious financial position at the point of divorce.\" Her wide-ranging 2023 study, Fair Shares on Divorce, found married women were more likely to be employed part-time, with 28% taking home under £1,000 a month compared with 10% of men. One key asset that's often overlooked - pensions Pensions are one of the three main assets divvied up in any divorce settlement, alongside capital and housing. Yet Hitchings said her study found there is a \"lack of awareness, understanding and interest in pensions\" on divorce. \"Women are far more likely to surrender any rights over pensions,\" said Shah, adding they often prioritised the family home. Legal and General found 28% of women waived their rights to access their partner's pot, compared with 17% of men. This is despite women having smaller pensions for the same reasons their wages are lower post-divorce: the gender pay gap (which stands at 7%), longer parental leave and more career breaks for childcare. \"There's a reticence for some women to call on their partners' pensions,\" said Shah. \"I think it feels like it's not theirs, but obviously if they've had joint finances as part of a marriage, then actually they've contributed to that in other ways and therefore it should all be considered.\" Grace's divorce and her husband's 'hidden' pay rises Among the women waiving that right is Grace*, 48, from the Midlands, who feels \"forced to take the bare minimum\" in her ongoing divorce proceedings. Her husband has offered her £70,000 if she doesn't make a claim to his pension or future earnings, she said, and she feels she has to agree so she can leave their home as quickly as possible with a deposit for another house. \"I'm devastated if I'm being honest with you because all I ever worked for was just to have a solid home and a family.\" In 2005, she gave up her £26,000 job at an energy company and the £160,000 home she owned in Greater London to move in with her husband-to-be and his children. Grace said she invested £30,000 in renovating their home in the Midlands and, while still working full-time, took on the role of \"homemaker\". \"I would be the one looking after the house, the general running, the washing, the cleaning and all the typical wifey things.\" Her husband took control of all the finances - to the point she was \"shocked\" to find out he had not disclosed pay rises from £50,000 to £80,000. Grace earns £26,000. \"I feel incredibly ripped off - manipulated. I feel hopeless,\" she said, adding the house she once owned in Greater London is now worth approximately £400,000. \"The worst thing is that I feel it's really hard to wrap my head around everything after having let go for so many years to let him control everything - and then trying to make the right decisions when you're emotionally distraught all the time.\" Knowledge is power Lack of understanding is common in divorce proceedings, Professor Hitchings' study found. Again, the division of pensions provides a perfect illustration. That's because pension sharing requires a court order, and there is less understanding of the process since legal aid for private family proceedings in England and Wales was cut in 2015, she said. In 2023, only 11% of divorcees with a pension yet to be drawn had made an arrangement for pension sharing. Some 37% did not know the value of their own (let alone their ex-spouse's) pension. Around 10% of homeowners with a mortgage did not know what the equity in their home was at the point of divorce. Karen Stainton, 55, found her background in finance invaluable during a protracted and painful divorce 10 years ago. She offered to pay her ex-husband a £135,000 lump sum out of the proceeds of the house, in return for him waiving access to her pension. \"And why should he, after he'd not given me any child benefit or helped me look after the kids after the split,\" she said. She took on three jobs and worked seven days a week to earn the £45,000 she needed to look after their children, Joe, John and Peter, aged 18, 15 and eight, at the time of the divorce. \"I was completely running on adrenaline. It wasn't good,\" she said. But a decade later, her pension is valued at £450,000 - far more than the lump sum. Law 'definitely needs reform' Professor Hitchings added that there are areas of the law that \"definitely need reform\". It gives couples too much discretion at the expense of having a full account of all of their assets and their future prospects, particularly pensions. In December, the Law Commission published a scoping report on whether the existing law - the more than 50-year-old Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 - needs reform. The government was given six months to respond to the report and decide whether the commission should investigate further and suggest options for reform. \"We are grateful to the Law Commission for reviewing the current laws governing finances in divorce, including in relation to pensions,\" said a Ministry of Justice spokesperson. \"The government is carefully considering the findings of the report and will provide a response in due course.\" What divorcees can do Whether a divorcee should prioritise pension sharing, capital, or the family home depends on their circumstances, said Shah. \"Gather as much information as you can up front; try to get some financial advice if you can afford it or guidance otherwise,\" she added, pointing to a financial health checking service Legal and General provide online. \"Divorce is a really emotional time for everybody involved. But being able to take that step back and actually look at it from a logical perspective on really what is the best for both parties, both at the time and in the longer term, is really important.\" *Names have been changed to hide the identity of some interviewees."

Lord Mandelson's links to the late billionaire were exposed in a 2019 report by JP Morgan bank, filed in a New York court. Epstein killed himself in August of that year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. He had previously served an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. Whilst serving that sentence, the JP Morgan report suggests that Mr Mandelson stayed at Epstein's Manhattan flat. Epstein wrote to his private banker on 17 June 2009: \"Peter will be staying at 71st over weekend…\" At the time, Lord Mandelson was the Business Secretary in the UK government under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was appointed UK ambassador to the United States in December 2024. Sky News asked him if he did, indeed, stay at Epstein's flat while the disgraced financier was in jail. He replied: \"I'm not answering any questions about him. My knowledge of him is something I regret, I wish I'd never met him in the first place.\" Asked why he had an association with Epstein whilst he was in jail, Lord Mandelson replied: \"Why did many people meet him?

Sir Sadiq said a new report, published by the independent London Drugs Commission (LDC) today, provides \"a compelling, evidence-based case\" for the government to consider the move. Under current laws, cannabis is a Class B drug and people found in possession face a fine or imprisonment. The LDC, set up by the mayor in 2022 and chaired by former lord chancellor Lord Charlie Falconer, has said the current laws on cannabis are \"disproportionate to the harms it can pose\". Its study examined how the drug is policed around the world - and also found cannabis policing \"continues to focus on particular ethnic communities,\" damaging their relations with law enforcement. The commission stops short of calling for full decriminalisation and instead says \"natural\" cannabis should be moved from the Misuse of Drugs Act to the Psychoactive Substances Act.

Lord Ian Austin, who is the UK government's trade envoy to Israel, was welcomed to Haifa on Monday, just days after Foreign Secretary David Lammy paused negotiations.

Politics latest: Farage makes multibillion pound spending pledges  The independent peer said he was visiting Israel to \"meet businesses and officials to promote trade with the UK\". \"Trade with Israel provides many thousands of good jobs in the UK and brings people together in the great multi-cultural democracy that is Israel,\" he said.

But despite the suspension of any new trade talks with Israel, Number 10 has insisted that the UK still has a trading relationship with the country. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: \"We have always had a trading relationship, but are pausing any new ones.\" The UK has sanctioned a number of individuals and groups in the West Bank which it said have been linked with acts of violence against Palestinians - including Daniella Weiss, a leading settler activist who was the subject of Louis Theroux's recent documentary The Settlers. Israel criticised the UK government action as \"regrettable\" and said the free trade agreement talks, which ministers have now backed out of, were \"not being advanced at all by the UK government\". Lord Austin has previously stressed the importance of the UK's trading relationship with Israel, claiming it is \"worth billions and brings massive benefits to Britain\". Writing for Politics Home, he said: \"It is in our national interest, and the decision this week by the government to pause negotiations on a new Free Trade Agreement does not change that. \"The situation in Gaza is terrible, as it is in all wars, and the quickest way to get the aid in and save lives is for Hamas to stop fighting and release the hostages.

He said: \"Exempting small sites would mean almost three-quarters of developments face no requirement to compensate for nature loss - let alone enhance it. \"These changes could leave the biodiversity net gain system dead in the water and, with it, the government's main guarantee of nature-positive planning.\" However, the government has described the simplified biodiversity net gain rules for medium-sized developments as a \"win-win for nature and development\".

Caroline Darian's father Dominique Pelicot admitted repeatedly drugging and raping his wife Gisele between 2011 and 2020, and inviting dozens of other men to their home in southern France to do the same. Gisele decided to waive her right to anonymity to hold the trial of her husband and 50 other men in public, saying: \"It is not for us to be ashamed, but for those men.\" Politics latest: Farage says 'yes' he can be PM Speaking to Ali Fortescue on The Politics Hub, Ms Darian said the UK government's plans to consider mandatory chemical castration could be \"one part of the solution\" for men like her father. She said: \"It's probably one part of the solution because you know when you're at that level of crime, that level of criminal, there is nothing else you can do.\" Asked if she believed \"men like your father\" could be rehabilitated, Ms Darian said \"no\" and \"never\". For ten years, Pelicot repeatedly sedated his wife and invited strangers to abuse her after advertising sex with her on a French swinging website. Some denied the rape charges, claiming they believed Gisele had agreed to be drugged and was a willing participant in a sex game between the couple. But all the men charged were found guilty of at least one offence, with nearly all convicted of rape, after a trial that shocked France and made headlines around the world. The defendants were sentenced to a total of more than 400 years, with Pelicot being sentenced to 20 years in prison. Pelicot also took photos of his daughter Caroline semi-naked while she was asleep. Ms Darian is pressing charges against her father, having accused him of drugging and raping her. Pelicot has denied this. Speaking to French media, Beatrice Zavarro, Pelicot's lawyer, said Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising\". She added that prosecutors had said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on Ms Darian. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said last week that she will pursue \"a nationwide rollout\" of a scheme being piloted in southwest England to use medication to suppress the sexual drive of sex offenders.

Ms Mahmood said she is \"exploring whether mandating the approach is possible\". The trial is currently voluntary."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The UK economy will grow more than previously thought, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has upgraded its latest forecast. It also said the Bank of England should \"continue to ease monetary policy gradually\", indicating it expected further reductions in interest rates. But it warned trade tensions linked to US tariff plans will reduce UK economic growth next year. The Washington-based UN financial agency said the UK economy will expand 1.2% this year and \"gain momentum next year\". The upgrade in forecasts, however, is slight, up from an expected 1.1% announced in April as the world reeled from the global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. That April figure was a 0.5% downgrade from the projected 1.6% growth for 2025 the IMF foresaw in January and the 1.5% forecast issued in October. It means the IMF expects the UK economy to grow less this year than it forecast in October and January. Money blog: Britons face 100% property tax in Spain Tariffs warnings  This anticipated lower growth is largely due to tariffs - taxes on goods imported to the United States - and the uncertainty caused by shifting trade policy in the US, the world's largest economy. While many tariffs have been paused until 8 July, it's unclear if deals will be in place by then and if pauses may be extended. The effect of this has been quantified as a 0.3 percentage points lower growth by 2026 in the UK, the IMF said. The organisation held its prediction that the UK economy will grow by 1.4% in 2026. \"The forecast assumes that global trade tensions lower the level of UK GDP by 0.3% by 2026, due to persistent uncertainty, slower activity in UK trading partners, and the direct impact of remaining US tariffs on the UK,\" it said.  It comes despite the UK having agreed a deal with the Trump administration to circumvent the 25% tariffs on cars and metals. The IMF also cautioned that \"weak productivity continues to weigh on medium-term growth prospects\". Lower productivity has been an issue since the global financial crash of 2008-2009, but has been caused by \"chronic under-investment\", low private sector research and development, limited access to finance for businesses to expand, skill gaps, and a \"deterioration in health outcomes\", it said. Interest rates Interest rates \"should\" continue to come down, making borrowing cheaper, though the IMF acknowledged rate-setters at the Bank of England now have a \"more complex\" job due to the recent rise in inflation and \"fragile\" growth. The author of the report on the UK, Luc Eyraud, said the IMF expected the Bank to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points every three months until they reach a level of around 3%, down from the current 4.25%. Praise was given to the UK government as the IMF said \"fiscal plans strike a good balance between supporting growth and safeguarding fiscal sustainability\". \"After a slowdown in the second half of 2024, an economic recovery is under way,\" the IMF said. Global factors - \"weaker export performance in the challenging global environment\" - are blamed for the slowdown last year. The news is being taken as a win by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. \"The UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 for the first three months of this year and today the IMF has upgraded our growth forecast,\" she said. \"We're getting results for working people through our plan for change - with three new trade deals protecting jobs, boosting investment and cutting prices, a pay rise for three million workers through the national living wage, and wages beating inflation by £1,000 over the past year.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n London's congestion charge could rise by 20% next year under new proposals, in the first hike since 2020. Transport for London (TfL) has started a consultation on behalf of London mayor Sadiq Khan to increase the daily charge from £15 to £18 from January 2026. The fee was last put up five years ago, with a 30% rise from £11.50. Combined with the £12.50 ultra-low emission zone charge, owners of older cars would have to pay £30.50 a day to drive in the capital. TfL said the cost could rise annually by 2026 and the proposed 20% rise is below the inflation increase for the six years it will have been since the last rise. Politics latest: Farage makes multibillion pound spending pledges A second proposal is a new cleaner vehicle discount which will see a 50% discount for electric vans, heavy goods vehicles and quadricycles using Auto Pay and a 25% discount for electric cars using Auto Pay. \n                  'I wish I'd never met him': Peter Mandelson 'regrets' association with Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  UK trade representative visits Israel after Britain suspends talks\n                 Currently, all electric vehicles can drive through the congestion zone for free but that is set to end on Christmas Day this year. The proposal also suggests electric vehicles should get less of a discount by 4 March 2030, with 25% for the first set of vehicles and 12.5% discount for electric cars. TfL said the discounts would be applied automatically based on DVLA data so eligible customers will no longer have to register for the cleaner vehicle discount and pay a registration fee. A third proposal would affect residents not using an electric car, as the current 90% blanket residents' discount would be removed from 1 March 2027. TfL said this would be appropriate to \"incentivise\" residents to own \"the cleanest available vehicles\". However, it said the removal of the 90% discount for non-EVs would only apply to new applicants, so those already registered for the residents' discount would not have to pay the charge each day. The consultation, which runs until 4 August on TfL's \"have your say\" website, said the changes will make the congestion charge \"more effective in managing traffic and congestion\". \"The mayor also has ambitions for London to become a net-zero carbon city by 2030 and for the World Health Organisation's air quality guidelines to be achieved as soon as possible,\" it adds.  Seb Dance, deputy mayor for transport, said: \"Keeping London moving by reducing congestion is vital for our city and for our economy. \"The congestion charge has been a huge success since its introduction, but we must ensure it is fit for purpose. \"Sticking to the status quo would see around 2,200 more vehicles using the congestion charging zone on an average weekday next year. \"At the same time, we must support Londoners and businesses to use greener and more sustainable travel. That's why I'm pleased we're proposing that substantial incentives remain in place for Londoners who switch to cleaner vehicles. \"We encourage everyone to have their say and respond to the public consultation.\" The congestion charge zone was first introduced by Ken Livingstone in 2003 at £5 a day and was doubled in 2010, then rose again in 2014 to £11.50. The zone is one of the largest in the world, despite it being reduced in 2007 and 2011. In 2019, the ultra-low emission zone was introduced for vehicles that do not meet the emissions standards, so they must pay both charges. It was expanded in 2023 to cover the whole of Greater London. Failure to pay the congestion charge on time can mean a fine of between £65 and £195."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n The government is considering getting rid of the two-child benefit cap first brought in by the Conservatives. The policy has caused considerable consternation within the Labour Party, with a growing number of MPs calling to scrap it and ministers so far refusing to. Farage says he can be PM - politics latest But now, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has given the government's strongest hint yet it may scrap the cap after she told Sky News ministers are \"considering\" lifting it. We look at what the cap is and the controversy over it. What is the two-child benefit cap? Since 2017, parents have only been able to claim child tax credit and universal credit for their first two children, if they were born after April 2017. An exception is made for children born as a result of rape.  Who introduced it? Then work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith first proposed the policy in 2012 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. It was not until 2015 that then chancellor George Osborne announced a cap would be introduced from the 2017/2018 financial year. The coalition said it made the system fairer for taxpayers and ensured households on benefits faced the same financial choices around having children as those not on benefits. Read more:Why PM's Reform strategy may backfireWinter fuel U-turn could have big consequences What is Labour's position on the cap? The party has long been divided over the issue, with Sir Keir Starmer ruling out scrapping the cap in 2023. He then said Labour wanted to remove it, but only when fiscal conditions allowed. Following Labour's landslide victory last July, the prime minister refused to bow to pressure within his party, and suspended seven MPs for six months for voting with the SNP to scrap the cap. Ministers have toed the party line for months, but the narrative started to shift in May, with Sir Keir reported to have asked the Treasury to see how scrapping it could be funded. The publication of Labour's child poverty strategy was delayed from the spring to autumn, fuelling speculation the government wants to use the next budget to scrap the cap. Then the education secretary told Sky News on 27 May lifting the cap is \"not off the table\" - and \"it's certainly something that we're considering\".  How many children does the cap affect? Government figures show one in nine children (1.6m) are impacted by the two-child limit. In the first three months Labour were in power, 10,000 children were pulled into poverty by the cap, the Child Poverty Action Group found. In May, it said another 109 children are pulled into poverty each day by the limit, adding to the 4.5 million already in poverty. The Resolution Foundation said the cap would increase the number of children in poverty to 4.8 million by the next election in 2029-30. Torsten Bell, the foundation's former chief executive and now a Labour Treasury minister, said scrapping the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty. How much would lifting the cap cost the taxpayer? The cap means for every subsequent child after the first two, families cannot claim benefits worth £3,455 a year, according to the Institute for Government. It estimates removing the limit would cost the government about £3.4bn a year - equal to roughly 3% of the total working-age benefit budget. It is also approximately the same cost as freezing fuel duties for the next parliament. Research has found the indirect fiscal impacts of lifting the cap could be higher, as some data shows investing in young children can pay for itself by causing better outcomes for them later in life."

Now, an artificial intelligence (AI) version of her voice is being used on Scotland's nationalised train network, ScotRail. But the professional voiceover artist says she had no idea she had been transformed into a robot until a friend called her last week. \"I was devastated, I was furious, I feel completely violated,\" she told Sky News. \"My voice is my job, and I should be allowed to know who I am working with and what I am working on.\" Ms Potter, who lives on the outskirts of Edinburgh, believes the incident can be traced back to a job she completed during the COVID pandemic with Swedish company ReadSpeaker, where she recorded scripts for the visually impaired. Ms Potter alleges she was unaware the contract allowed her voice to be sold as part of AI years later. Sky News has seen correspondence where the company appeared to reassure Ms Potter's agents they \"would never sell them (the recordings) to anybody else\". Responding to concerns, ReadSpeaker insisted there was a \"very clear contract\" that allows it to \"use... synthesised voices for businesses and organisations\".

Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity, said: \"It is extremely exploitative for companies to use and commercialise voice recordings to create digital replicas of artists from contracts which pre-date the development of generative AI or were not drafted explicitly for this purpose. \"Gayanne is directly competing in a marketplace with a low-quality clone of her own voice that she claims was developed without her informed and explicit consent. \"Not only is this distressing for her, but it would represent an infringement of our members' data protection and other rights.\" Roy Lindemann, chief marketing officer at ReadSpeaker, dismissed questions from Sky News about Ms Potter's wishes to withdraw her voice from being sold. He said the firm was aware of Ms Potter's concerns, adding: \"ReadSpeaker and Ms Potter have a contract regarding the use of her voice. \"ReadSpeaker has comprehensively addressed Ms Potter's concerns with her legal representative several times in the past.\" ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish government, said it had \"no plans\" to remove its \"Iona\" AI announcer voice system and rejected questions about Ms Potter's concerns. Phil Campbell, ScotRail customer operations director, said: \"We are always looking at ways to improve the customer journey experience, and we know how important both on-train and at-station announcements are. \"The use of an automated voice allows us to have more control over the announcements being made, ensures consistency for customers, and gives us flexibility to make changes at short notice.\" A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \"While sub-contracts are a matter for ScotRail, the Scottish government expects it, as a publicly controlled organisation, to ensure all agreements entered into are within the parameters of Public Sector Procurement guidance and meet Fair Work principles. \"This includes the use of AI technology.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Regulators are due to meet fishing industry representatives on Wednesday as the sector grapples with an \"explosion\" of octopus in British waters. Fishers along England's southwest coast have noticed a boom in the numbers and size of common octopus in the last few months. \"As of February this year, there was just a massive explosion in the population of octopus,\" said Alan Steer, a crab fisher based in Devon. \"We went from catching nothing to catching 1,000 kilograms a day,\" with each cephalopod weighing between 2.5-3.5kg, he told Sky News. The octopus is a valuable catch, fetching more at the fish market than the crab that many local fleets are designed to fish for. And it's just as well, because the eight-limbed creatures are also devouring local crab and lobster species, leaving some fishers empty-handed. \"Since the octopus have turned up now, we are seeing massive devastation to the crab and lobster and scallop stocks in the pots,\" he said, with just empty crab and lobster shells rattling around inside. \n                  SpaceX Starship rocket spins out of control on test flight, marking third failure in a row\n                 \n                  Voiceover artist Gayanne Potter urging ScotRail to remove her voice from new AI announcements\n                 \n                  Four Just Stop Oil activists jailed for plotting to disrupt Manchester Airport\n                 He reckons his crab and lobster catches are down by about 70%. More research needed The common octopus has long been present in British waters, but scientists say more research is needed to understand the causes of the recent bloom. It could be due to warmer waters or that there are fewer predators like tuna, cod, and sharks. The octopus can creep in and out of the pots through small openings designed to allow small crabs and lobsters to escape, a conservation measure to maintain the populations. But the boon for those cashing in on the octopus may be short-lived. Previous \"blooms\" of octopus, recorded in 1899, 1950 and 2022, saw the animals stick around for a season or two, before disappearing in cold winters. It can then take crab and lobster stocks three or four years to recover, Mr Steer told Sky News. 'Real concern' \"It's good at the minute... but our real concern is this is another cycle that we've seen in the past and they will disappear along with any crab fishery that was already there,\" he said. In the meantime, the conservation body that enforces the escape hatch rule has come with a workaround. The Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) said the escape holes can be closed off if fishers were trying to catch octopus only, in which case they'd have to throw any other catch back into the sea. Read more from Sky News:Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube to be broadcast into spaceJust Stop Oil activists jailed for plotting to disrupt airport Sarah Clark, its deputy chief officer, told Sky News the influx was a \"concern\". She said: \"We're going to be trying to gather as much information about octopus and what we do in the next coming months, years, if the octopus fishery remains within the South West. And that's obviously a big 'if', because we don't know if the octopus will be here again next year.\" On Wednesday, they will meet government regulator the Marine Management Organisation and the fishing industry, to find out what support fishers need. A series of meetings are focussing on collecting data, the impact on other species and how to determine whether the octopus are here to stay. Dr Zoe Jacobs, from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), said the recent \"marine heatwave\", which has seen water temperatures 2.3C higher than average, might be behind the reported early sightings of barrel jellyfish, increased numbers of seabass and pods of dolphins spotted in shallow inshore regions. She said: \"It may also be behind the recent spike in octopus. We need to improve our monitoring of such species to collect as much evidence as we can to understand if the marine heatwave is indeed driving this sudden influx of warm-water species into coastal waters.\""

        "Content": "Police are urging the public to take steps to protect their devices and finances. The Metropolitan Police said its officers have responded to a number of cases of organised gangs gaining access to victims' mobile banking and financial apps. In some cases, the gangs have cleared their victims' accounts and taken out loans. The Met said there would be increased patrols in hotspot areas, with a recent two-week crackdown on this type of offending having resulted in 292 arrests across London. Kush Chaudary had his phone stolen by a group of men outside a bar in the Soho area of the city on 9 September 2023. The group started speaking to Mr Chaudary and waited for him to unlock his phone before they took it from him. \"With my phone unlocked, they targeted anything they could gain immediate access to including my bank and crypto accounts,\" he said. \n                  Teenage girl remains in critical condition following deadly house fire\n                 \n                  Man arrested on suspicion of murder as mother and her three children die in house fire\n                 \n                  Two teenagers plead guilty to murdering schoolboy in machete bus attack\n                 'Exposed and vulnerable' Within minutes, the gang had changed his passcode, transferred £5,000 from his crypto wallet and stole several thousands more from his bank accounts. They also took out fraudulent loans of £22,000 and spent around £8,000 on designer clothes and electrical products using Apple Pay. \"Seeing that unfold in front of my eyes was difficult. This was hard-earned savings I had that was being spent by strangers and I felt very exposed and vulnerable as I didn't know when it would stop,\" Mr Chaudary added. The gang behind Mr Chaudary's theft was convicted and jailed after a Met investigation. Its members stole a total of £225,000 in central London between December 2022 and November 2023. Jacob Raki, 23, was jailed for 33 months for six counts of handling stolen goods, two counts of attempted fraud and one count of robbery; Joseph Serry-Kamal, 19, was jailed for 24 months for one count of robbery; and Herman Solomon, 33, was jailed for 31 weeks for handling stolen goods and fraud. Smon Tecle, 27, received a suspended sentence for one count of theft and two counts of fraud. The Met Police are urging people to follow three steps to protect their phones - to turn on \"stolen device\" or \"anti-theft\" features on their mobile, use strong separate passwords, and watch out for people looking over them when using their phone.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Sean \"Diddy\" Combs kidnapped a former aide at gunpoint to join him as he attempted to confront love rival rapper Kid Cudi, his sex-trafficking trial has been told. Capricorn Clark, who worked for the Bad Boy Records co-founder in different roles on and off for several years, told the court he banged on her door and told her: \"Get dressed, we're going to kill Mescudi.\" Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, last week testified himself about the alleged incident in December 2011. Ms Clark became tearful a few times as she gave evidence - which marked the start of the third week of the high-profile trial. She told the court her situation working for the hip-hop mogul was \"complicated\". Combs, 55, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, is accused of subjecting his former long-term partner Cassie and others to years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial: Day 10 - as it happened While giving her own evidence in the first week of the trial, Cassie told jurors she dated Cudi briefly during a difficult period in her on-off relationship with Combs. On Tuesday, Ms Clark said she warned Cassie about seeing Cudi, saying she took her to buy a burner phone as she thought it could be dangerous given how Combs might react. \"The way she was moving, she was going to get us all killed,\" Ms Clark said. Combs arrived at her home with a gun in his hand on the morning of the attempted confrontation with Cudi, she told the court, and looked \"furious\". She says she told him she did not want to go with him, to which he allegedly replied: \"I don't give a f**k what you want to do.\" Ms Clark said she had never seen \"anything like this before\", but got dressed and left with Combs in a black Cadillac to head to the property in the Hollywood Hills. She said she waited in the car as Combs went into the residence, and called Cassie to warn her. The rapper had her \"with a gun and brought me to Cudi's house to kill him\", she said she told her. Cudi could be heard in the background of the call, she said, asking: \"He's in my house?\" After the incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs warned her and Cassie not to speak to police and threatened to \"kill all you\" if they did not convince Cudi not to either. In the aftermath of this incident, Ms Clark alleged Combs \"came at\" Cassie with \"100% full force\", repeatedly kicking her while she crouched \"more and more\" into a foetal position and cried \"silently\". The rapper told Ms Clark that if she tried to intervene, \"he was going to f**k me up too\", she said. Earlier in her testimony, she told the court about the start of her employment with Combs and his label Bad Boy Records in 2004. She said after he discovered she had previously worked for Marion \"Suge\" Knight's Death Row Records - the West Coast rival to East Coast Bad Boy - he told her \"if anything happened, he would have to kill me\". Ms Clark said she perceived this as a \"very serious\" threat. She also told the court about another alleged incident just a few weeks into the job, when some diamond jewellery on loan to Combs went missing. She told the court she was taken to a building in Manhattan and forced to repeatedly take lie detector tests over five days. The man who carried out the test told her that if she failed, \"they're going to throw you in the East River\", she said. Combs was not present for the tests and never spoke to her about them, she said, when questioned by defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo. During her testimony, Ms Clark mentioned an incident involving fellow rapper 50 Cent's manager, after both 50 Cent and Combs had done interviews for MTV. Combs mentioned to the manager that they had some issues and told him, \"I like guns\", she said, which she perceived as a vague threat.

According to Ms Clark, he told her: \"Your problem is you want a life, and you can't have that here.\" The trial continues tomorrow, with evidence expected from LA police and fire officers. If convicted, Combs could face between 15 years and life in prison."

She said: \"I think so many women, especially, were taught to not even talk about money. And there's lots of guilt mentality surrounding having a lot.\" \"It wasn't until the 70s that women could even have a credit card, a line of credit on a credit card without her husband.\" The discussion, which was wide-ranging in nature, also foregrounded the importance of self-care. \"I remember my acupuncturist in the UK said to me, and it has always stayed with me, he said, if the baby's crying, treat the mother. \"It all starts with us.
