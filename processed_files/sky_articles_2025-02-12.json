        "Content": " Donald Trump says there has been agreement to begin negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, after holding phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It is the US president's first big step towards diplomacy over a conflict which he promised to end within 24 hours of being inaugurated. \"We both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,\" Mr Trump posted on Truth Social following discussions with Russia's president. He said the pair would \"work together, very closely\" towards winding down the conflict and \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\". A Kremlin spokesperson said Mr Putin and Mr Trump had agreed to meet, with the Russian president inviting the US leader to visit Moscow. Ukraine latest: Trump's plan to end war \"President Putin, for his part, mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement can be achieved through peaceful negotiations,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president wrote on X that he had a \"meaningful conversation\" by phone with Mr Trump to discuss \"opportunities to achieve peace\" and the preparation of a document governing security and economic cooperation. \"No one wants peace more than Ukraine. Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace,\" he said.  Mr Trump added that his phone conversation with Mr Zelenskyy \"went very well\", suggesting that \"he [Mr Zelenskyy], like President Putin, wants to make PEACE\". On social media, the US president said: \"It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!\" International affairs editor Some of the fundamental principles underlying Western security and prosperity were today abandoned or weakened by the Trump administration. After 80 years of underwriting security in Europe, America told Europeans they canâ€™t take that for granted anymore.  \n The principle that aggression cannot be rewarded has been central to the post-war world order. Today the US told Ukrainians, that Russians will be able to keep some of the land they have taken by force. A principle of US policy for the last three years has been the West would not negotiate unless Ukraine was involved. Trump seemed to undermine that commitment today. Read more from Dominic here.

Separately the US and Russia agreed to a prisoner swap. America freed a Russian cybercrime boss in return for Moscow's release of schoolteacher Marc Fogel, a US official said on Wednesday. Meanwhile at a White House news conference on Wednesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she was \"not aware of\" Mr Trump putting any preconditions on his meeting with Mr Putin. Mr Trump said the peace negotiations will be led by secretary of state Marco Rubio, director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, national security advisor Michael Waltz, and ambassador Steve Witkoff."

        "Content": "By Mark Stone, US correspondent, and Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent  Donald Trump has promised peace talks and teased the prospect of ending the war in Ukraine but, in the background, there are potential complications. Here's what Sky News' experts think about what America's new military policy and these planned negotiations could mean for Russia, the US, and Ukraine - along with its aspirations to join its European allies in NATO. A short-term win that risks rewarding Putinby Mark Stone, US correspondent In the Oval Office, President Trump refused to say that Ukraine is an equal member of the negotiation with Russia to end the war. That refusal marks the end of a remarkable day. I think what we have seen over the day, from an American perspective, is the confirmation of a profound shift in American influence, power and footprint in Europe. A ground-shifting moment.  The post-WWII principle of American leadership, of America as the leading protector of Western principles and Western territory, seems to have been deeply eroded, maybe abandoned. For the first time, America has said that its priorities prevent it from being focused on Europe. \n                  Europe must finally get serious when it comes to its own defence\n                 \n                  'We'll bring hygge to Hollywood': Danes offer to buy California after Trump's Greenland claims\n                 \n                  US defence secretary signals dramatic shift in American military policy away from Europe, warning allies about 'stark strategic realities'\n                 The call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is the first by a US president since Biden spoke to Putin in December 2021 - before the invasion. Ukraine latest: Trump and Putin plan to meet President Trump was effusive in how he framed the call which was an hour and a half long - it was positive and we're told he sees Russia as a 'great competitor and at times an adversary'. We don't know what President Trump said to President Putin, what he committed to him, what he didn't. The US defence secretary certainly seems to have conceded some key bargaining chips to Russia - land, no NATO membership or protection for Ukraine. Trump's mission has been to stop the fighting. He might do that - a big short-term win for him to trumpet to the American people. The concern in Europe is that it's a short-term win; that it will reward Putin; that America's retreat will weaken Europe and maybe leave Putin to fight another day. Putin's red lines on NATO expansion haven't shiftedby Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent We knew there'd be contact between the two leaders at some point but this is still a hugely significant moment. It fires the starting gun on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, and it may prove a watershed moment for other matters too - NATO unity, Ukrainian sovereignty and Russia-US cooperation. Ukraine seems to be the issue on which everything else hinges when it comes to Washington and Moscow resuming ties - unlock that and Trump seems to believe a relationship can blossom: \"We each talked about the strengths of our respective nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together\". But at what cost? It's a question Kyiv will be asking itself with trepidation. Read more from Sky News:British woman fatally shot in TexasEurope needs to get serious about defenceGlee actress' final words revealed Donald Trump clearly wants to be remembered as the president who ended the war and healed the world, and it seems he's even willing to travel to Moscow in order to make that happen. For Bill Clinton and George W Bush it was a regular port of call, visiting five times and seven times respectively. Barack Obama came twice, but after his trip in 2013 for a G20 summit, the visits suddenly stopped. The reason - Russia annexed Crimea. So given everything that's happened since then, it would be quite the coup for the Kremlin if Donald Trump did visit. Russia's so-called special military operation wasn't supposed to end in negotiations, but the leader of the free world flying into Moscow on a peace mission? You can see how Russia could spin that as a victory over the collective West. But that's not to say that a peace deal will be easy. There's one line in the Kremlin's read-out of the call that makes you wonder. It reads: \"President Putin, for his part, mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict\". When Vladimir Putin talks about root causes, he means NATO expansion. That's what he claims is the reason for the war in Ukraine. And stating this in the call with Trump suggests his red lines haven't shifted - no NATO membership for Ukraine, and that Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the four Ukrainian territories Russia currently occupies."

        "Content": "Drivers speeding at more than 90mph on 30mph roads were caught by nearly half (48%) of UK police forces over a year and a half. The RAC, which obtained the figures, said they demonstrate \"incredibly dangerous actions\" by motorists.

The figures were obtained through Freedom of Information requests to 45 police forces for the period from the start of January 2023 to the end of August 2024 - 40 forces provided data. Some 311 people died in crashes on Britain's roads in 2023 in which a driver exceeding the speed limit was a contributory factor, according to separate Department for Transport (DfT) statistics.

Last year the RAC carried out a survey which indicated 55% of drivers believe there is a culture among UK road users that it is acceptable to speed, with only 23% disagreeing with that assertion. The RAC called on the government to use its forthcoming road safety strategy to tackle \"avoidable casualties\" in crashes involving speeding drivers. Speed is leading cause of deaths on UK roads RAC road safety spokesman Rod Dennis said: \"Although this data is a snapshot, it shines a light on the incredibly dangerous actions of a few, that are putting law-abiding road users at serious risk. Thankfully, the police were on hand to catch these drivers. \"There is no place for the vastly excessive speeds that some people are prepared to drive. \"Speed is the leading cause of deaths on UK roads. \"We look forward to the government's forthcoming road safety strategy understanding what can be done to reduce such avoidable casualties on the UK's roads.\" 'Reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable' Chief Constable Jo Shiner, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said: \"We know that some incidents of going over the speed limit can be genuine mistakes or errors, but the speeds cited here are clearly drivers taking deliberate decisions to travel at excessive speeds, putting everyone at risk. \"Speed limits are set based on many factors, including the road layout, what's in the surrounding area and taking into account where there might be more vulnerable road users. \"Choosing to drive above those limits is reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable.\""

        "Content": "By Adele Robinson, news correspondent  The government is continuing to put Post Office victims through \"hell\" in their fight for redress, Sir Alan Bates has told Sky News. More than 240 former sub-postmasters are still waiting for financial compensation years after they won their High Court battle. Sir Alan's comments come after another former sub-postmaster, Terry Walters from Wilmslow in Cheshire, died without receiving financial redress. He is survived by his wife Janet. Hundreds were wrongly accused of stealing from their Post Office branches between 1999 and 2015 as a result of faulty Horizon computer software. Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has described government officials as living in \"ivory towers totally removed from the hell the victims have gone through day after day, year after year\". He told Sky News they \"haven't the slightest inkling of what hell they continue to put the victims (through)\". \"It's all well and good meeting a few of them every now and then, patting them on the head and making noises about how hard they are working to sort everything out,\" he added. \"When the figures alone prove how badly they are able to finalise cases - that is unless victims want to sell themselves short for a quick settlement.\"  Sir Alan wrote to the Post Office minister in January putting forward a proposal to help speed along redress delivered to victims who are part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme. On behalf of the JFSA (Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance) he suggested a \"compulsory mediation scheme\" that could be inserted into the process to \"create an opportunity for early resolution\". In his letter, seen by Sky News, he wrote that this should happen within four weeks from the point at which the initial offer of financial redress is rejected by a victim. \"Key to this proposal,\" he continued, \"is getting rid of the lawyers, for a whole host of reasons, not least the ridiculous amount being spent on themâ€¦\" He added that their input should be \"kept to a minimum\". Sir Alan said the mediations should also be \"time limited\" and undertaken by a \"party neutral\" law firm. Describing the current situation on redress as \"unacceptable\", he wrote: \"We are not prepared just to sit back and let time pass as far too many have already died along the way, and this matter needs to be brought to completion now.\" He also described a 40-day \"delay\" to claims before victims receive their initial offer as \"extremely unfair\" and projected that at the \"current rate\" redress would not be paid to everyone until 2027.  Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has since written to Sir Alan following on from his correspondence with the prime minister last year. In his letter he said it is \"likely\" that all GLO claims will be \"settled this year\". \"Ministers and civil servants in the department (for business and trade) will continue to do everything we can to ensure claims that we receive are handled in a prompt way,\" he wrote. The business secretary added that payments for \"complete claims\" received by the end of last year are expected to be paid before the end of March. Sir Alan has previously said that victims may consider further legal action on financial redress and demanded a deadline of March 2025 for payment to all. Read more:Judge-led inquiry to be held into Nottingham attacksBritish woman shot dead during Texas holiday In his letter, Mr Reynolds said that \"setting a deadline\" would \"run counter\" to \"easing the strain\" on the \"most vulnerable claimants\" who have \"found it stressful to engage with the process\". He continued: \"It could be damaging to some GLO members' mental health and might limit their ability to claim their full redress.\" The secretary of state added that the department shared Sir Alan's view that the \"victims of the horrendous scandal deserve closure as soon as possible\". In addition, Mr Reynolds invited Sir Alan to a meeting to \"discuss any ideas\" for \"practical ways in which we can improve matters for the GLO group\". A spokesperson from the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates and the tireless campaigning he has done to get justice for the thousands of innocent postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal. \"Postmasters have already had to wait far too long for justice which is why we are working relentlessly to provide full and fair redress and have doubled the number of payments since July.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  A \"verbally incontinent spinster, who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother\" - not an auspicious introduction to Bridget Rose Jones, but accurate. On paper, it doesn't sound like the dream role, but RenÃ©e Zellweger disagrees, telling Sky News: \"It's the best job in the world to step into her shoes for a while\". Three decades after the character came to life on the page, and following a trio of earlier films, Zellweger has returned to \"this just endearing character\" for a fourth movie, Mad About The Boy. With returning characters including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, new relationships are also introduced, with Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor joining the cast. Zellweger goes on: \"I love her. I love her humour. I love her vulnerability. I love her imperfection. I love the opportunity to play out her miscalculating a plan and it maybe, surprising her in her execution. I love all of it.\" The first film earned Zellweger an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Bridget, and the character's name has gone into the lexicon. Mad About The Boy director Michael Morris - the first male director to step into the franchise - told Sky News: \"When you see Bridget, you realize how many, how few characters there are in film that are just unapologetically human. It's weird. There should be moreâ€¦ \n                  Bridget Jones: A heroine of our time or an absolute disgrace?\n                 \n                  Golden Globes 2025: The full list of nominees\n                 \n                  Hugh Grant settles court case against The Sun's publisher 'for enormous sum of money'\n                 \"She looks the way she looks when she gets up. She's late for school. She drops things when she shouldn't drop them. She makes the wrong speech when she needs to give the right speech. And all of those things make you just fall in love with her.\" Read more: Bridget Jones: A heroine of our time or an absolute disgrace? After years of soul-searching, her creator, Helen Fielding, has decided the key to Bridget's appeal lies in her revealing \"the gap between how you feel you are supposed to be and how you really are inside.\" Fielding's anonymous columns for The Independent, first published in 1995, were a word-of-mouth hit. The four subsequent books were bestsellers. Produced by Working Title - the production company behind British hits including Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually and Notting Hill - the first film took more than $280m (Â£225m) worldwide. Studio bosses will be hoping Mad About The Boy will work a similar magic, and with ticket pre-sales proving bigger than Barbie, it's looking promising.  Digging down into Bridget's enduring appeal, Angela McRobbie, Professor of Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths University of London, told Sky News the character's timely merging of political and popular culture sent out a positive message to young women in the 90s and early 2000s. \"The figure of Bridget Jones, both in writing and then in film represented a new kind of young woman who had been to university, who knew her Jane Austen, and who knew a little bit about feminism. \"There was a sense in which the knowledge of feminism haunted the Bridget Jones phenomena, but in a way that she wanted to discard it and put it in the past. \"She wanted to be feminine. She wanted to be sexy. She wanted to [wear a] Playboy bunny outfit. And in her dream landscape, she imagined a white wedding with lots of kids in the Home Counties. There was a sense in which what the column and then the film did was offered a kind of release from the burden of being feminist\". She says Bridget wearing a see-through shirt and miniskirt into the office was her way of saying: \"We have to live with sexual inequality, it's not such a bad thing. I want to be a real girl. I want to enjoy my sexuality if it gets me the attention I want from the boss\". McRobbie goes on: \"In some ways, you could say she was legitimising a kind of sexual inequality in the workplace, but in a fun, light-hearted way.\" Emotional intelligence coach and Bridget Jones fan Miriam Bross told Sky News she can see why Bridget has been described as \"feminist Marmite\". \"I think one of the reasons why people react strongly to her is because she was turned into an icon. She was supposed to be the woman of the 90sâ€¦ \"That's when you get this polarisation where you feel like you have to either be in favour of Bridget or not. But actually, she's such a complex character that there's something for everybody. \"She was this single woman who had fun. Yes, she ends up with a man in the end. But that isn't the main part. The main part is that she is successful. Even though she makes mistakes, she is a normal weight and is still chased by men. \"Why Bridget still lives on is because she gave people the main message - be yourself and you're going to be okay.\" Bross also says that Bridget helped prove that a film focused on the female experience could be as successful as a male-led movie. \"In the 80s, rom coms were all about neurotic men finding loveâ€¦ The female leads in them had very little to say.\" A case in point is Julia Roberts's actress heroine in Notting Hill - as Bross says - \"her silence is so normalised that Ronan Keating wrote the song When You Say Nothing At All celebrating her silence\". But then in comes Bridget: \"She talks. She has voiceovers. We see her thoughts. It's about her. It's not just about her and love, it's about her in her job, we see her working. We see her making mistakes. We see her.\" Bross goes on: \"Who doesn't like to see themselves represented on film? Representation matters very much. And here was this flawed woman who got the guy in the end.\" Both McRobbie and Bross say they will be watching Mad About The Boy. But is it the same old Bridget we'll see in the new film? With a very different tone to previous instalments, can fans look forward to the dollop of nostalgia they're likely craving? As McRobbie rightly notes, the experience of the Gen Z audience watching the movie today is very different to that of their predecessors. \"It's a much tougher world than it was certainly in the early 2000s and even in the second film. Young women have to deal with toxic masculinity, and they have to navigate their way through sexuality and they're much more aware of sexual violence.\" It begs the question, will Bridget have the same appeal in 2025 as she did in 2001? Bross says she still has much to offer: \"This character is like an old friend. So even if she's not entirely up to date, you will still love herâ€¦ \"When people are stressed, when they're anxious, they turn to the familiar. People do need something soothing. They need narratives that help them calm down in stressful times.\" Meanwhile, Zellweger promises Bridget will still exhibit all the qualities that have made her beloved worldwide. \"I think it's just a continuation of these authentic representations of a person's experience and different life chapters. \"It feels like the essence of the person is the same and her very familiar optimism, her vulnerability and her sweetness and her humour, all that's the same.\" Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy is in cinemas now."

It is understood that this reduction in time will not include relaxing safety regulations, but rather extra resources to make the current steps faster. Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said: \"I will not run away from the tough choices to fix the housing crisis we inherited that has left thousands of families on housing waiting lists, allowed homelessness to spiral out of control, and stopped an entire generation from picking up the keys to their first home.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The government also reiterated its plans to overrule local concerns about the environment - exemplified by the bat tunnel near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.

        "Headline": "It won awards at Cannes last year and several Golden Globes at the start of 2025. But as Emilia Perez became an Oscars and BAFTAs frontrunner and its profile grew, so did the criticism - and scrutiny of its themes and stars.",
        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n At the start of awards season, Emilia Perez looked like it could come away as one of this year's big success stories. First there was a slew of gongs at the Golden Globes, including best comedy or musical film, and then came the Oscar nominations - it leads the race with 13 nods, and broke the record to become the most nominated non-English language film in the history of the awards. At the BAFTAs this weekend, it is shortlisted for 11 prizes; just pipped by papal thriller Conclave, which has 12. And star Karla Sofia Gascon has made history as a trans woman nominated for best actress at both ceremonies. Set in Mexico but mostly filmed in France, Emilia Perez is an operatic Spanish-language musical which tells the story of a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirmation surgery. In May last year, it won the Cannes Film Festival jury prize, setting it on its trajectory to 2025 awards season success. The film's acknowledgement seemingly reflected the more progressive attitudes of voters in recent years - but as its profile rose, so did the scrutiny. US LGBTQ+ advocacy and cultural change group GLAAD has described Emilia Perez as a \"step backward for trans representation\", and highlighted reviews by transgender critics who \"understand how inauthentic portrayals of trans people are offensive and even dangerous\". The film has also come under fire for stereotypical depictions of Mexico and an apparent minimal inclusion of Mexican people among the main cast and crew. Of its main stars, Gascon is Spanish, US actress Zoe Saldana is of Dominican Republic and Puerto Rican descent, and Selena Gomez is American, though her father was of Mexican descent. Adriana Paz is Mexican. In a post on X in January viewed more than 2.7m times, Mexican screenwriter HÃ©ctor GuillÃ©n shared a mock-up poster saying: \"Mexico hates Emilia PÃ©rez/ Racist Euro Centrist Mockery/ Almost 500K dead and France decides to do a musical/ No Mexicans in their cast or crew.\" While stories about \"narco\" crime in Latin America have long been depicted on screen, Emilia Perez has been particularly criticised for its handling of the subject. Since 2006, a bloody war between Mexican authorities and the drug cartels has raged, claiming the lives of more than 400,000 people, according to government data. More than 100,000 have gone missing. Read more:Mexico: Women at warThe city ravaged by a brutal and deadly drugs gang war  Offensive? Or a 'crazy marvel'? General audiences appear to have made their thoughts clear. On film database site IMDB, Emilia Perez gets 5.5 out of 10, while its nine competitors in the running for best picture at the Oscars rate between 7.3, for The Substance, and 8.8 for I'm Still Here. On review site Rotten Tomatoes, Emilia Perez gets a 72% from critics, but just 17% from audiences; again, the rest of its Oscars competitors range from Wicked's 88% critics' score to I'm Still Here's 96%, or Nickel Boy's 65% audience score to I'm Still Here's 99%. The two takeways? The gap is clear whichever way you look at it; watch I'm Still Here. That's not to say Emilia Perez does not have its supporters. Speaking after a screening in October, Oscar-winning Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said it was \"so beautiful to see a movie that is cinema\", and hailed director Jacques Audiard as \"one of the most amazing filmmakers alive\". A review in US entertainment outlet Deadline in May during Cannes last year was headlined, \"Jacques Audiard's musical is crazy, but also a marvel\", with the writer saying the \"sparkle never outshines the essential seriousness of the subject\". In Variety, another US entertainment publication, the headline praised Gascon's electrifying performance. Paz, who shared the Cannes best actress prize with her co-stars last year, has questioned the criticism about the film being \"offensive\" to Mexico, saying: \"I really want to know why, because I didn't feel that way.\" Carlos Aguilar, a film critic originally from Mexico City who writes for the Roger Ebert film website, was generally positive in his review, giving the film three out of four stars. However, he highlights that Emilia Perez is \"not a Mexican film\" and notes \"Mexican audiences have grown accustomed to American perspectives exploiting narco-related afflictions for narratives unconcerned with addressing its root causes\". Questioning intentions behind these productions is valid, he says, \"but to decry Audiard for partaking in the common filmmaking practice of telling stories away from what's immediately familiar to him would seem an overly simplistic assessment\". Karla Sofia Gascon's resurfaced tweets But the criticism from some trans people and some Mexicans is not a good look for a supposedly progressive film about a trans woman in Mexico. All publicity is good publicity does not apply here. A lot of this criticism, though, had been made before the Oscar and BAFTA nominations. Emilia Perez was still riding high at that point. The nail in the coffin came after those nominations were announced, when offensive tweets posted by Gascon were unearthed. They were old, but not that old; the first dated back to 2016, but some were more recent. In the since-deleted posts, Gascon took aim at Muslims' dress, language and culture in her native Spain and suggested Islam should be banned. And less than a month after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in 2020, which prompted a global reckoning about police brutality and racism, Gascon called Floyd a drug addict who \"very few people ever cared\" for. Writer Sarah Hagi, who screenshotted the posts and shared them, wrote: \"This is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh. Gascon, who was a regular in Mexican telenovelas before transitioning in 2018, issued an apology after the posts emerged, saying that \"as someone in a marginalised community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\". She added: \"All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\" 'This is an opera, not a criticism of Mexico' At the London Critics' Circle Awards earlier this month, Gascon's co-star Saldana called for people to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\" and to keep \"minds and your hearts open, always\". But it looks like the damage has been done. While Saldana is still favourite to win best supporting actress at both the BAFTAs and the Oscars, and the film may win gongs for its music and maybe technical accolades, it seems the momentum for taking home any bigger prizes has gone. As the backlash intensified, Audiard gave an interview to Deadline last week. He said he had not been in touch with Gascon and that he was \"very sad\" to see the issue \"taking up all the space\" around the film. What she said in her tweets was \"inexcusable\", he added. Read more:Oscars 2025: The full list of nomineesBAFTAs 2025: The full list of nominees The filmmaker also addressed criticism about representation of cartels and drug crime, saying: \"Opera has psychological limitations. It seems I'm being attacked in the court of realism.\" Audiard said he never claimed to have made a \"realistic\" work or a documentary. \"For example, I read a review where it said that night markets in Mexico City don't have photocopiers. Well, in night markets in Mexico City, one also doesn't sing and dance. You have to accept that is part of the magic here. This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico.\" Finally, asked if he had any regrets or if there was anything he would do differently, he said the one regret was that the film was not made in Mexico. \"And the simple reason for that is that the film funding, the public funding for film in Mexico was not as good for us as what was available to us in France\". Emilia Perez now heads to the BAFTAs and Oscars embroiled in controversy. But it is not the first. Remember British star Angela Riseborough's nomination in 2023? Some, like Green Book in 2019, weathered it out to win. And Will Smith won his Oscar just moments after slapgate in 2022. We'll see at the BAFTAs on Sunday and at the Oscars next month, how forgiving voters will be about Emilia Perez."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       A \"loophole\" that allowed a Palestinian family to be granted the right to come to the UK under a Ukrainian resettlement scheme was the subject of a lot of debate in the House of Commons today. Both the prime minister and leader of the opposition criticised a decision by a judge to allow the family of six the right to enter the UK. Sir Keir pledged to close the \"loophole\" after he was asked about it by Kemi Badenoch - but could not elaborate on what it was. Sky News has read through the judgment given by Judge Hugo Norton-Taylor to understand what happened. Politics latest: 'Leak' probe launched at Treasury Why did the family apply? The family of six, a husband and wife and their children aged 18, 17, eight and seven, lived in Gaza and their homes were destroyed after the 7 October attacks and subsequent conflict. They ended up living in a humanitarian zone and then a refugee camp. In January 2024, the family applied to come to the UK via the Ukraine Family Scheme form, in a bid to join one of the parent's brothers, who is a British citizen and has lived in the UK since 2007. While they acknowledged they were not eligible for the Ukraine scheme, the family chose to apply in an attempt to use the Home Office's policy on \"applications for entry clearance outside the rules\". The Home Office rejected the request, saying they were not satisfied there were \"compelling, compassionate circumstances\" to justify a request outside the rules. They also noted the lack of a resettlement scheme for Palestinians. Read more:Judge 'wrong' to let Gaza family settle in UKPalestinian family allowed to settle in UK The appeals Despite the Home Office saying there were no grounds to appeal, the family launched one against the decision on human rights grounds. A judge then ruled that the initial rejection constituted a rejection of human rights, and so allowed an appeal. Part of this appeal was under Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a family life between the man living in Britain and his family in Gaza. This appeal was rejected, with a lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme noted as a reason. An appeal was launched at a higher tribunal - and one of the arguments was that the case should be considered on its own merits and not allow the lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme to outweigh other arguments.  The loophole It is here that the \"loophole\" seems to have appeared. At this point. Judge Norton-Taylor heard the case and allowed the appeal. In his judgment, he stated that it was \"wrong to have taken the absence of a resettlement scheme into account at all\". The judge added that there was \"no evidence\" he had seen that the Home Office had made a deliberate decision not to implement a Palestinian resettlement scheme. He also noted that the lack of immigration rules on a topic should not count against someone. In layman's terms, the argument seems to be that just because a scheme to resettle people does not exist it does not mean they are banned from coming to the UK via humanitarian routes. The judgment said the absence of a \"resettlement scheme was irrelevant\" to their decision. What next? Judge Norton-Taylor went on to back the claim from the family in Gaza based on the ECHR and the right to a family life between them and their relative in Britain. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Ukraine Family scheme was clearly set out for Ukrainians. We have been clear that we do not agree with this judgment and we twice vigorously contested this case. \"As the prime minister made clear, article 8, the right to a family life, should be interpreted much more narrowly. It is for the government and Parliament to decide who should be covered by the UK's safe and legal routes. \"We are pursuing all legal avenues to address the legal loophole which has been exploited in this case. The home secretary is urgently reviewing this case to ensure the correct processes are always followed and existing laws correctly interpreted.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ They added that there was no evidence to support the argument and that data from the government shows a \"very small\" number of Gazans have been allowed to enter the UK - equal to roughly 150. Sir Keir said he was planning to close the loophole, but it is not clear what this will entail."

In recent weeks, documents released as part of court proceedings involving an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo, have thrown light on the extent to which the Duke of York and his advisors have been keen to resurrect his Dragons' Den-style project as a \"possible source of funding\". The palace has in the past insisted it was not involved in Prince Andrew's financial matters, saying they were private because he was no longer a working member of the royal family. But it is now understood that last summer, at a time when King Charles was still funding his brother, a meeting took place with Startupbootcamp, a Dutch company that funds startup businesses around the world, that was interested in the Pitch@Palace Global network. While the King's advisors were not involved in negotiating any details of a potential deal, it appears they were keen to get reassurances that any future links would not cause problems for the wider royal family. The King no longer provides financial support to his brother. Described as \"Dragons' Den-style\" events for tech startups, Pitch@Palace was set up in 2014 and seen as Prince Andrew's charitable project, helping connect entrepreneurs with potential investors. But a Pitch@Palace Global private company was also set up in 2017. In 2019, Prince Andrew was forced to step away from public life following an interview about his links to Jeffrey Epstein. Sky News has seen documents released as part of the recent Chinese spy investigation that show, since 2019, the Duke's intention to carry on with Pitch@Palace in some form. A document dated 21 August 2021 clearly states the Duke needed money at the time, and \"saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\". And as late as 22 May 2024, Mr Yang says in a further document: \"The intention is still to resurrect the Pitch program, under the new brand and name, Innovate Global.\" More from Sky News:Andrew's emails to Epstein revealedWho is Yang Tenbo? This week there have been reports the Duke's youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, attended an event in Tokyo last year, run by Innovate Global and Startup bootcamp, the company the palace had its meeting with last summer. There remains a huge interest in Prince Andrew and how he is funding his private life away from public duties."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has told the families of those killed in the Nottingham attacks that a judge-led public inquiry will start in \"a matter of weeks\". The families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates were told at an emotionally charged meeting at Number 10 that a \"number of different agencies\" would be scrutinised by the probe. Students Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and 65-year-old caretaker Mr Coates were killed by Valdo Calocane before he attempted to kill three other people in a spate of attacks in the city in June 2023. Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in January last year after admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility and attempted murder. Prosecutors accepted a plea of manslaughter after experts agreed his schizophrenia meant he was not fully responsible for his actions. The families said recently he had \"got away with murder\". Speaking outside Downing Street on Wednesday, Emma Webber, Barnaby's mother, said: \"It's the first bit of positive news that we've been able to have for a very, very long time. We're still processing it.\" Dr Sanjoy Kumar, Grace's father, added: \"As we have always said as families, everywhere that Valdo Calocane intersected with the authorities, we were let down.\" He then said the public inquiry \"has been fantastic news for all of us, we welcome it, we've been working so hard to it\". \"Everyone who has also suffered the way we had, we will make sure that changes come from our inquiry for the betterment of our country that makes... the land safer for all of us.\" Mrs Webber also said the families were told the inquiry would be concluded within two years, and Dr Kumar thanked the prime minister \"from a father to a father\". During the meeting, Sir Keir said focusing on just one aspect of the case would not be right as he did not \"think that will do justice,\" and said it would be a statutory inquiry. He added a retired judge is set to be appointed in due course, and said: \"As soon as that happens, the process will start.\" Read more from Sky News:Sir David Amess' killer 'exited' from Prevent 'too quickly'NHS trust fined Â£1.6m over deaths of babies Speaking later to Sky News's The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee, Mrs Webber said the families had to endure \"torture\" to \"get this far\". She added: \"Had we not as a collective had sheer doggedness, I don't believe for a single moment that we would have been sat there (in Number 10) today.\" Mrs Webber went on: \"I wanted and needed to hear one word today - statutory. I think we made our case quite clear last week [on] why it had to be a statutory public inquiry, which would be judge-led, because only then will the truth come out. \"Answers will be found, there will be accountability, and there will be change.\" Dr Sinead O'Malley-Kumar, Grace's mother, told Sky News: \"We need to find out where patients are slipping through the cracks, why patients aren't being treated properly, where the pressures are. Are there no beds for these patients, are the managers pressurised? The patients aren't getting the treatment they need. It's putting patients at risk and families at risk and the public at risk.\" The meeting came after NHS England's report into Calocane's mental health care in the lead-up to the attacks, which found treatment available to him \"was not always sufficient to meet his needs\". The report detailed four hospital admissions between 2020 and 2022 and multiple contacts with community teams before he was discharged to his GP because of a lack of interaction with mental health services. It also found Calocane was allowed to avoid taking long-lasting antipsychotic medication as he did not like needles, and did not consider himself to have a mental health condition."

        "Content": "An NHS trust has been fined Â£1.6m after admitting it failed to provide safe care and treatment to three babies who died within days of their births. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) had charged Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust over the deaths, which all occurred in 2021. The trust pleaded guilty to six charges of failing to provide safe care and treatment to the three children and their mothers at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. The charges were in connection to the deaths of Adele O'Sullivan, who was 26 minutes old when she died on 7 April 2021, four-day-old Kahlani Rawson, who died on 15 June 2021, and Quinn Parker, who was one day old when he died on 16 July 2021. District Judge Grace Leong told the hearing, which was attended by the trust's chief executive since September 2022 Anthony May, that the \"catalogue of failures\" in the trust's maternity unit were \"avoidable and should never have happened\". Family members cried in the courtroom as the judge expressed her \"deepest sympathy\" to each of them and said the trust they put in NUH to deliver their babies safely had been broken. \"The death of a child is a tragedy beyond words, and where that loss is avoidable the pain is even more profound,\" she said. \"Three-and-a-half years have gone by, yet for the families no doubt their grief remains as raw as ever and a constant presence in their lives that is woven into every moment. \"The grief of a baby is not just about the past, it is about the future that is stolen. It is a lifetime of missing first words, first steps, first days of school, missing memories that should have been made. \"It is very difficult, if not impossible, to move on from the failures of the trust and its maternity unit. \"The weight of what should have been done differently will linger indefinitely.\" 'Systematic failures' District Judge Leong highlighted concerns over a lack of escalation of care, an inadequate communications system and a failure to provide \"clear and complete\" information sharing. She said: \"I accept there were systems in place but there were so many procedures where guidance was not followed or adhered to. \"The failures in combination amounted to systematic failures in the provision of care and treatment.\" The trust has an average turnover of Â£612m, but District Judge Leong said she was \"acutely aware\" that all its funds as a publicly funded body were accounted for and that the trust is currently operating at a deficit of around Â£100m. \"I can't ignore the negative impact this will have... but the significant financial penalty has to be fixed to mark the gravity of these offences and hold the trust to account for their failings,\" the judge said.

Lawyers acting on behalf of the trust told the families in court they offered their \"profound apologies and regrets\" and that improvements have been made, including hiring more midwives and providing further training to staff. 'Contemptuous and inhumane' The court was told that one of the pregnant women, Emmie Studencki, went to the hospital four times suffering bleeding before her son Quinn was born. On the final occasion before Quinn was born, Ms Studencki called an ambulance at around 6.15am on 14 July 2021 with paramedics estimating she had lost around 1.2 litres of blood both at home and in the ambulance on the way to City Hospital. Despite this, the paramedics' observations did not \"find its way into the hospital's notes\", with staff only recording a 200ml blood loss. Quinn was \"pale and floppy\" when he was born via emergency Caesarean section that evening, and despite several blood transfusions, he was pronounced dead after suffering multiple organ failure and lack of oxygen to the brain. An inquest concluded it was a \"possibility\" he would have survived had a Caesarean section been carried out earlier. In a statement, Ms Studencki said the trust's treatment of her, her son, and her partner Ryan Parker had been \"contemptuous and inhumane\". 'We lost our beautiful daughter' Adele O'Sullivan died 26 minutes after being born following an emergency Caesarean at 29 weeks in April 2021, the court also heard. Her mother Daniela had noticed bleeding and suffered abdominal pain but in a victim impact statement said she was left \"screaming in pain\" with no painkillers. Despite having a high-risk pregnancy, she was not examined for eight hours before Adele was born. Adele was born in \"poor condition\" and a decision was made to withdraw care, with a post-mortem examination finding she died as a result of severe intrapartum hypoxia. Daniela said: \"People who were supposed to help me did not help but harmed me mentally and physically forever. \"We lost our beautiful daughter. Instead of bringing her home I had to leave the labour suite empty-handed in a lot of physical and mental pain.\" The trust also admitted liability in another case involving mother Ellise Rawson, who had reported abdominal pain and reduced foetal movements. She was delayed in receiving an emergency Caesarean section in June 2021. Her son Kahlani suffered a brain injury and died four days later. Kahlani's grandmother Amy Rawson told the court that her grandson's death was a \"preventable tragedy\" that had left the family \"devastated, broken and numb\". This case is the second time the CQC has prosecuted the trust over failures in maternity care. It was fined Â£800,000 for a \"catalogue of failings and errors\" that led to the death of a baby 23 minutes after she was born at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in September 2019. NUH is also at the centre of the largest maternity inquiry in NHS history, with midwife Donna Ockenden leading the investigation. In February she confirmed the number of families taking part has increased to 2,032 - forcing a delay to her report's publication until June 2026. 'We fully accept the findings' In a statement released after the hearing, NUH chief executive, Mr May said: \"The mothers and families of these babies have had to endure things that no family should after the care provided by our hospitals failed them, and for that I am truly sorry. \"Today's judgment is against the trust, and I also apologise to staff who we let down when it came to providing the right environment and processes to enable them to do their jobs safely. \"We fully accept the findings in court today and have already implemented changes to help prevent incidences like this from this happening again.\" He added that a CQC report published in September 2023 showed there had been an improvement in the overall rating for the trust's maternity services. Helen Rawlings, CQC's director of operations in the Midlands, said in a statement after the sentencing: \"The care that these mothers received, and the death of these three babies is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts are with their families and all those grieving their loss under such sad circumstances. \"All mothers have a right to safe care and treatment when having a baby, so it's unacceptable that their safety was not well managed by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. \"The vast majority of people receive good care when they attend hospital, but whenever a registered health care provider puts people in its care at risk of harm, we seek to take action to hold it to account and protect people. \"This is the second time we have prosecuted the trust for not providing safe care and treatment in its maternity services, and we will continue to monitor the trust closely to ensure they are making and embedding improvements so that women and babies receive the safe care they deserve.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       A \"loophole\" that allowed a Palestinian family to be granted the right to come to the UK under a Ukrainian resettlement scheme was the subject of a lot of debate in the House of Commons today. Both the prime minister and leader of the opposition criticised a decision by a judge to allow the family of six the right to enter the UK. Sir Keir pledged to close the \"loophole\" after he was asked about it by Kemi Badenoch - but could not elaborate on what it was. Sky News has read through the judgment given by Judge Hugo Norton-Taylor to understand what happened. Politics latest: 'Leak' probe launched at Treasury Why did the family apply? The family of six, a husband and wife and their children aged 18, 17, eight and seven, lived in Gaza and their homes were destroyed after the 7 October attacks and subsequent conflict. They ended up living in a humanitarian zone and then a refugee camp. In January 2024, the family applied to come to the UK via the Ukraine Family Scheme form, in a bid to join one of the parent's brothers, who is a British citizen and has lived in the UK since 2007. While they acknowledged they were not eligible for the Ukraine scheme, the family chose to apply in an attempt to use the Home Office's policy on \"applications for entry clearance outside the rules\". The Home Office rejected the request, saying they were not satisfied there were \"compelling, compassionate circumstances\" to justify a request outside the rules. They also noted the lack of a resettlement scheme for Palestinians. Read more:Judge 'wrong' to let Gaza family settle in UKPalestinian family allowed to settle in UK The appeals Despite the Home Office saying there were no grounds to appeal, the family launched one against the decision on human rights grounds. A judge then ruled that the initial rejection constituted a rejection of human rights, and so allowed an appeal. Part of this appeal was under Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a family life between the man living in Britain and his family in Gaza. This appeal was rejected, with a lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme noted as a reason. An appeal was launched at a higher tribunal - and one of the arguments was that the case should be considered on its own merits and not allow the lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme to outweigh other arguments.  The loophole It is here that the \"loophole\" seems to have appeared. At this point. Judge Norton-Taylor heard the case and allowed the appeal. In his judgment, he stated that it was \"wrong to have taken the absence of a resettlement scheme into account at all\". The judge added that there was \"no evidence\" he had seen that the Home Office had made a deliberate decision not to implement a Palestinian resettlement scheme. He also noted that the lack of immigration rules on a topic should not count against someone. In layman's terms, the argument seems to be that just because a scheme to resettle people does not exist it does not mean they are banned from coming to the UK via humanitarian routes. The judgment said the absence of a \"resettlement scheme was irrelevant\" to their decision. What next? Judge Norton-Taylor went on to back the claim from the family in Gaza based on the ECHR and the right to a family life between them and their relative in Britain. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Ukraine Family scheme was clearly set out for Ukrainians. We have been clear that we do not agree with this judgment and we twice vigorously contested this case. \"As the prime minister made clear, article 8, the right to a family life, should be interpreted much more narrowly. It is for the government and Parliament to decide who should be covered by the UK's safe and legal routes. \"We are pursuing all legal avenues to address the legal loophole which has been exploited in this case. The home secretary is urgently reviewing this case to ensure the correct processes are always followed and existing laws correctly interpreted.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ They added that there was no evidence to support the argument and that data from the government shows a \"very small\" number of Gazans have been allowed to enter the UK - equal to roughly 150. Sir Keir said he was planning to close the loophole, but it is not clear what this will entail."

        "Content": "By Adele Robinson, news correspondent  The government is continuing to put Post Office victims through \"hell\" in their fight for redress, Sir Alan Bates has told Sky News. More than 240 former sub-postmasters are still waiting for financial compensation years after they won their High Court battle. Sir Alan's comments come after another former sub-postmaster, Terry Walters from Wilmslow in Cheshire, died without receiving financial redress. He is survived by his wife Janet. Hundreds were wrongly accused of stealing from their Post Office branches between 1999 and 2015 as a result of faulty Horizon computer software. Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has described government officials as living in \"ivory towers totally removed from the hell the victims have gone through day after day, year after year\". He told Sky News they \"haven't the slightest inkling of what hell they continue to put the victims (through)\". \"It's all well and good meeting a few of them every now and then, patting them on the head and making noises about how hard they are working to sort everything out,\" he added. \"When the figures alone prove how badly they are able to finalise cases - that is unless victims want to sell themselves short for a quick settlement.\"  Sir Alan wrote to the Post Office minister in January putting forward a proposal to help speed along redress delivered to victims who are part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme. On behalf of the JFSA (Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance) he suggested a \"compulsory mediation scheme\" that could be inserted into the process to \"create an opportunity for early resolution\". In his letter, seen by Sky News, he wrote that this should happen within four weeks from the point at which the initial offer of financial redress is rejected by a victim. \"Key to this proposal,\" he continued, \"is getting rid of the lawyers, for a whole host of reasons, not least the ridiculous amount being spent on themâ€¦\" He added that their input should be \"kept to a minimum\". Sir Alan said the mediations should also be \"time limited\" and undertaken by a \"party neutral\" law firm. Describing the current situation on redress as \"unacceptable\", he wrote: \"We are not prepared just to sit back and let time pass as far too many have already died along the way, and this matter needs to be brought to completion now.\" He also described a 40-day \"delay\" to claims before victims receive their initial offer as \"extremely unfair\" and projected that at the \"current rate\" redress would not be paid to everyone until 2027.  Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has since written to Sir Alan following on from his correspondence with the prime minister last year. In his letter he said it is \"likely\" that all GLO claims will be \"settled this year\". \"Ministers and civil servants in the department (for business and trade) will continue to do everything we can to ensure claims that we receive are handled in a prompt way,\" he wrote. The business secretary added that payments for \"complete claims\" received by the end of last year are expected to be paid before the end of March. Sir Alan has previously said that victims may consider further legal action on financial redress and demanded a deadline of March 2025 for payment to all. Read more:Judge-led inquiry to be held into Nottingham attacksBritish woman shot dead during Texas holiday In his letter, Mr Reynolds said that \"setting a deadline\" would \"run counter\" to \"easing the strain\" on the \"most vulnerable claimants\" who have \"found it stressful to engage with the process\". He continued: \"It could be damaging to some GLO members' mental health and might limit their ability to claim their full redress.\" The secretary of state added that the department shared Sir Alan's view that the \"victims of the horrendous scandal deserve closure as soon as possible\". In addition, Mr Reynolds invited Sir Alan to a meeting to \"discuss any ideas\" for \"practical ways in which we can improve matters for the GLO group\". A spokesperson from the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates and the tireless campaigning he has done to get justice for the thousands of innocent postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal. \"Postmasters have already had to wait far too long for justice which is why we are working relentlessly to provide full and fair redress and have doubled the number of payments since July.\""

The RAC called on the government to use its forthcoming road safety strategy to tackle \"avoidable casualties\" in crashes involving speeding drivers. Speed is leading cause of deaths on UK roads RAC road safety spokesman Rod Dennis said: \"Although this data is a snapshot, it shines a light on the incredibly dangerous actions of a few, that are putting law-abiding road users at serious risk. Thankfully, the police were on hand to catch these drivers. \"There is no place for the vastly excessive speeds that some people are prepared to drive. \"Speed is the leading cause of deaths on UK roads. \"We look forward to the government's forthcoming road safety strategy understanding what can be done to reduce such avoidable casualties on the UK's roads.\" 'Reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable' Chief Constable Jo Shiner, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said: \"We know that some incidents of going over the speed limit can be genuine mistakes or errors, but the speeds cited here are clearly drivers taking deliberate decisions to travel at excessive speeds, putting everyone at risk. \"Speed limits are set based on many factors, including the road layout, what's in the surrounding area and taking into account where there might be more vulnerable road users. \"Choosing to drive above those limits is reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable.\""

It also said: \"The Commission will seek assurance from the clubs that they have carried out due diligence on their white label partners and that consumers in Great Britain cannot transact with the unlicensed sites.\" In a warning to Everton, the Commission added \"club officers may be liable to prosecution and, if convicted, face a fine, imprisonment or both if they promoted unlicensed gambling businesses that transact with consumers in Great Britain\". Stake calls itself \"the world's leading cryptocurrency casino and sportsbook,\" and allows customers to bet with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital coins. It does not offer crypto gambling in the UK, and the front page of the company's website says it is unable to accept players from the UK \"due to our gambling licence\". TGP runs Stake through what is called a white label agreement, which are regularly used by international gambling firms to launch in the UK without having to invest large sums in development and infrastructure.

The clip, where she talked about having sex with \"barely legal 18-year-olds\" in their first year at Nottingham University, featured the Stake logo across the screen. It was posted by an account claiming to be affiliated with the gambling company, rather than an official account, and has since been deleted. It is unclear whether Bonnie Blue - whose real name is Tia Billinger - was involved in the post, and if the account had created the video or reposted it from elsewhere. Sky News has contacted Everton for comment."

The body of James Lee Williams, who performed as the drag queen, was found at their home in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on Sunday 5 January. Cheshire Coroner's Court in Warrington opened an inquest at a short hearing on Wednesday. Williams, 32, was found in their bathroom, the court heard. Police attended and confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances. Coroner's officer Amanda Edgar said postmortem testing had taken place and identified \"an unnatural cause of death\". Williams was identified by their father, the court heard. Area coroner Victoria Davies said: \"Given the unnatural cause of death identified on postmortem testing it is appropriate for me to formally open the inquest into the death of James Lee Williams.\" Further investigations are required, she said, and the case was adjourned for a full inquest, set for 30 June. Williams, who grew up in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, before moving to Liverpool, won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK and came third in the 2023 edition of Dancing On Ice. Their drag name came from their love of legendary British designer Vivienne Westwood. RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage was among those who paid tribute after news of their death emerged, saying she was \"utterly heartbroken\" by the news.

NATO spending Mr Trump - a long-time critic of the alliance, which he sees as containing freeloaders that benefit from American military strength without investing in their own security - has said all NATO allies should increase defence spending to 5% of GDP. This is more than double the current target. The UK is only spending 2.3%. While still supportive of NATO, Mr Hegseth warned that America's patience was limited. \"Our transatlantic alliance has endured for decades. And we fully expect it will sustained for generations more. But this won't just happen,\" he said. He continued: \"It will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on this continent. \"The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe. \"Our relationship will prioritise empowering Europe to own responsibility for its security.\" Ukraine-Russia war Mr Hegseth also had strong words about Russia's war in Ukraine, which he said \"must end\". Speaking frankly, he dismissed a fundamental Ukrainian goal to recapture all its territory - including Crimea and swathes of the Donbas that were seized by Russia in 2014 when Mr Putin first invaded his neighbour. This aim had previously been backed by the UK and other allies.

It was not immediately clear, however, whether the US military may help to provide protection from a distance. \"These security guarantees should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\" the US defence secretary said. \"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact.\" Article 5 of NATO says an armed attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Read more: What is Article 5? Mr Hegseth continued: \"To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine.\" His words will be a significant setback for Kyiv. President Zelenskyy told Sky News last week that any peacekeeping force that did not include a US element would be a \"major mistake\", signalling that he did not believe European militaries alone could deter Moscow. The retreat of the US from its leadership role in Ukraine was clear in the choreography of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting - an alignment of allies gathered together by Washington under Joe Biden and his defence secretary Loyd Austin after Russia launched its full-scale invasion almost exactly three years ago. Future of European security The regular meetings have until now always been chaired by the US. Wednesday's meeting, however, was led by John Healey, the UK defence secretary. Mr Hegseth made clear that European allies would need to step up and take on much more of the effort to provide Ukraine with weapons and non-military support. \"Safeguarding European security is an imperative for European members of NATO. As part of this, Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine,\" he said. This means donating more ammunition, expanding Europe's defence industrial base and rallying the public to be willing to respond to the threat the continent faces. \"Part of this is speaking frankly with your people about how this threat can only be met by spending more on defence and investing strategically,\" Mr Hegseth said. \"Increasing your commitment to your own security is a down payment for the future.\" Earlier, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he agreed with US president Donald Trump on the need for Washington and European allies to share the burden of military aid for Ukraine more equally."

Here's what Sky News' experts think about what America's new military policy and these planned negotiations could mean for Russia, the US, and Ukraine - along with its aspirations to join its European allies in NATO. A short-term win that risks rewarding Putinby Mark Stone, US correspondent In the Oval Office, President Trump refused to say that Ukraine is an equal member of the negotiation with Russia to end the war. That refusal marks the end of a remarkable day. I think what we have seen over the day, from an American perspective, is the confirmation of a profound shift in American influence, power and footprint in Europe. A ground-shifting moment.  The post-WWII principle of American leadership, of America as the leading protector of Western principles and Western territory, seems to have been deeply eroded, maybe abandoned. For the first time, America has said that its priorities prevent it from being focused on Europe. \n                  Europe must finally get serious when it comes to its own defence\n                 \n                  'We'll bring hygge to Hollywood': Danes offer to buy California after Trump's Greenland claims\n                 \n                  US defence secretary signals dramatic shift in American military policy away from Europe, warning allies about 'stark strategic realities'\n                 The call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is the first by a US president since Biden spoke to Putin in December 2021 - before the invasion. Ukraine latest: Trump and Putin plan to meet President Trump was effusive in how he framed the call which was an hour and a half long - it was positive and we're told he sees Russia as a 'great competitor and at times an adversary'. We don't know what President Trump said to President Putin, what he committed to him, what he didn't. The US defence secretary certainly seems to have conceded some key bargaining chips to Russia - land, no NATO membership or protection for Ukraine. Trump's mission has been to stop the fighting. He might do that - a big short-term win for him to trumpet to the American people. The concern in Europe is that it's a short-term win; that it will reward Putin; that America's retreat will weaken Europe and maybe leave Putin to fight another day. Putin's red lines on NATO expansion haven't shiftedby Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent We knew there'd be contact between the two leaders at some point but this is still a hugely significant moment. It fires the starting gun on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, and it may prove a watershed moment for other matters too - NATO unity, Ukrainian sovereignty and Russia-US cooperation. Ukraine seems to be the issue on which everything else hinges when it comes to Washington and Moscow resuming ties - unlock that and Trump seems to believe a relationship can blossom: \"We each talked about the strengths of our respective nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together\". But at what cost? It's a question Kyiv will be asking itself with trepidation. Read more from Sky News:British woman fatally shot in TexasEurope needs to get serious about defenceGlee actress' final words revealed Donald Trump clearly wants to be remembered as the president who ended the war and healed the world, and it seems he's even willing to travel to Moscow in order to make that happen. For Bill Clinton and George W Bush it was a regular port of call, visiting five times and seven times respectively. Barack Obama came twice, but after his trip in 2013 for a G20 summit, the visits suddenly stopped. The reason - Russia annexed Crimea. So given everything that's happened since then, it would be quite the coup for the Kremlin if Donald Trump did visit. Russia's so-called special military operation wasn't supposed to end in negotiations, but the leader of the free world flying into Moscow on a peace mission? You can see how Russia could spin that as a victory over the collective West. But that's not to say that a peace deal will be easy. There's one line in the Kremlin's read-out of the call that makes you wonder. It reads: \"President Putin, for his part, mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict\". When Vladimir Putin talks about root causes, he means NATO expansion. That's what he claims is the reason for the war in Ukraine. And stating this in the call with Trump suggests his red lines haven't shifted - no NATO membership for Ukraine, and that Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the four Ukrainian territories Russia currently occupies."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n At the start of awards season, Emilia Perez looked like it could come away as one of this year's big success stories. First there was a slew of gongs at the Golden Globes, including best comedy or musical film, and then came the Oscar nominations - it leads the race with 13 nods, and broke the record to become the most nominated non-English language film in the history of the awards. At the BAFTAs this weekend, it is shortlisted for 11 prizes; just pipped by papal thriller Conclave, which has 12. And star Karla Sofia Gascon has made history as a trans woman nominated for best actress at both ceremonies. Set in Mexico but mostly filmed in France, Emilia Perez is an operatic Spanish-language musical which tells the story of a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirmation surgery. In May last year, it won the Cannes Film Festival jury prize, setting it on its trajectory to 2025 awards season success. The film's acknowledgement seemingly reflected the more progressive attitudes of voters in recent years - but as its profile rose, so did the scrutiny. US LGBTQ+ advocacy and cultural change group GLAAD has described Emilia Perez as a \"step backward for trans representation\", and highlighted reviews by transgender critics who \"understand how inauthentic portrayals of trans people are offensive and even dangerous\". The film has also come under fire for stereotypical depictions of Mexico and an apparent minimal inclusion of Mexican people among the main cast and crew. Of its main stars, Gascon is Spanish, US actress Zoe Saldana is of Dominican Republic and Puerto Rican descent, and Selena Gomez is American, though her father was of Mexican descent. Adriana Paz is Mexican. In a post on X in January viewed more than 2.7m times, Mexican screenwriter HÃ©ctor GuillÃ©n shared a mock-up poster saying: \"Mexico hates Emilia PÃ©rez/ Racist Euro Centrist Mockery/ Almost 500K dead and France decides to do a musical/ No Mexicans in their cast or crew.\" While stories about \"narco\" crime in Latin America have long been depicted on screen, Emilia Perez has been particularly criticised for its handling of the subject. Since 2006, a bloody war between Mexican authorities and the drug cartels has raged, claiming the lives of more than 400,000 people, according to government data. More than 100,000 have gone missing. Read more:Mexico: Women at warThe city ravaged by a brutal and deadly drugs gang war  Offensive? Or a 'crazy marvel'? General audiences appear to have made their thoughts clear. On film database site IMDB, Emilia Perez gets 5.5 out of 10, while its nine competitors in the running for best picture at the Oscars rate between 7.3, for The Substance, and 8.8 for I'm Still Here. On review site Rotten Tomatoes, Emilia Perez gets a 72% from critics, but just 17% from audiences; again, the rest of its Oscars competitors range from Wicked's 88% critics' score to I'm Still Here's 96%, or Nickel Boy's 65% audience score to I'm Still Here's 99%. The two takeways? The gap is clear whichever way you look at it; watch I'm Still Here. That's not to say Emilia Perez does not have its supporters. Speaking after a screening in October, Oscar-winning Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said it was \"so beautiful to see a movie that is cinema\", and hailed director Jacques Audiard as \"one of the most amazing filmmakers alive\". A review in US entertainment outlet Deadline in May during Cannes last year was headlined, \"Jacques Audiard's musical is crazy, but also a marvel\", with the writer saying the \"sparkle never outshines the essential seriousness of the subject\". In Variety, another US entertainment publication, the headline praised Gascon's electrifying performance. Paz, who shared the Cannes best actress prize with her co-stars last year, has questioned the criticism about the film being \"offensive\" to Mexico, saying: \"I really want to know why, because I didn't feel that way.\" Carlos Aguilar, a film critic originally from Mexico City who writes for the Roger Ebert film website, was generally positive in his review, giving the film three out of four stars. However, he highlights that Emilia Perez is \"not a Mexican film\" and notes \"Mexican audiences have grown accustomed to American perspectives exploiting narco-related afflictions for narratives unconcerned with addressing its root causes\". Questioning intentions behind these productions is valid, he says, \"but to decry Audiard for partaking in the common filmmaking practice of telling stories away from what's immediately familiar to him would seem an overly simplistic assessment\". Karla Sofia Gascon's resurfaced tweets But the criticism from some trans people and some Mexicans is not a good look for a supposedly progressive film about a trans woman in Mexico. All publicity is good publicity does not apply here. A lot of this criticism, though, had been made before the Oscar and BAFTA nominations. Emilia Perez was still riding high at that point. The nail in the coffin came after those nominations were announced, when offensive tweets posted by Gascon were unearthed. They were old, but not that old; the first dated back to 2016, but some were more recent. In the since-deleted posts, Gascon took aim at Muslims' dress, language and culture in her native Spain and suggested Islam should be banned. And less than a month after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in 2020, which prompted a global reckoning about police brutality and racism, Gascon called Floyd a drug addict who \"very few people ever cared\" for. Writer Sarah Hagi, who screenshotted the posts and shared them, wrote: \"This is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh. Gascon, who was a regular in Mexican telenovelas before transitioning in 2018, issued an apology after the posts emerged, saying that \"as someone in a marginalised community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\". She added: \"All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\" 'This is an opera, not a criticism of Mexico' At the London Critics' Circle Awards earlier this month, Gascon's co-star Saldana called for people to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\" and to keep \"minds and your hearts open, always\". But it looks like the damage has been done. While Saldana is still favourite to win best supporting actress at both the BAFTAs and the Oscars, and the film may win gongs for its music and maybe technical accolades, it seems the momentum for taking home any bigger prizes has gone. As the backlash intensified, Audiard gave an interview to Deadline last week. He said he had not been in touch with Gascon and that he was \"very sad\" to see the issue \"taking up all the space\" around the film. What she said in her tweets was \"inexcusable\", he added. Read more:Oscars 2025: The full list of nomineesBAFTAs 2025: The full list of nominees The filmmaker also addressed criticism about representation of cartels and drug crime, saying: \"Opera has psychological limitations. It seems I'm being attacked in the court of realism.\" Audiard said he never claimed to have made a \"realistic\" work or a documentary. \"For example, I read a review where it said that night markets in Mexico City don't have photocopiers. Well, in night markets in Mexico City, one also doesn't sing and dance. You have to accept that is part of the magic here. This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico.\" Finally, asked if he had any regrets or if there was anything he would do differently, he said the one regret was that the film was not made in Mexico. \"And the simple reason for that is that the film funding, the public funding for film in Mexico was not as good for us as what was available to us in France\". Emilia Perez now heads to the BAFTAs and Oscars embroiled in controversy. But it is not the first. Remember British star Angela Riseborough's nomination in 2023? Some, like Green Book in 2019, weathered it out to win. And Will Smith won his Oscar just moments after slapgate in 2022. We'll see at the BAFTAs on Sunday and at the Oscars next month, how forgiving voters will be about Emilia Perez."

After 80 years of underwriting security in Europe, America told Europeans they canâ€™t take that for granted anymore.  \n The principle that aggression cannot be rewarded has been central to the post-war world order. Today the US told Ukrainians, that Russians will be able to keep some of the land they have taken by force. A principle of US policy for the last three years has been the West would not negotiate unless Ukraine was involved. Trump seemed to undermine that commitment today. Read more from Dominic here.

Here's what Sky News' experts think about what America's new military policy and these planned negotiations could mean for Russia, the US, and Ukraine - along with its aspirations to join its European allies in NATO. A short-term win that risks rewarding Putinby Mark Stone, US correspondent In the Oval Office, President Trump refused to say that Ukraine is an equal member of the negotiation with Russia to end the war. That refusal marks the end of a remarkable day. I think what we have seen over the day, from an American perspective, is the confirmation of a profound shift in American influence, power and footprint in Europe. A ground-shifting moment.  The post-WWII principle of American leadership, of America as the leading protector of Western principles and Western territory, seems to have been deeply eroded, maybe abandoned. For the first time, America has said that its priorities prevent it from being focused on Europe. \n                  Europe must finally get serious when it comes to its own defence\n                 \n                  'We'll bring hygge to Hollywood': Danes offer to buy California after Trump's Greenland claims\n                 \n                  US defence secretary signals dramatic shift in American military policy away from Europe, warning allies about 'stark strategic realities'\n                 The call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is the first by a US president since Biden spoke to Putin in December 2021 - before the invasion. Ukraine latest: Trump and Putin plan to meet President Trump was effusive in how he framed the call which was an hour and a half long - it was positive and we're told he sees Russia as a 'great competitor and at times an adversary'. We don't know what President Trump said to President Putin, what he committed to him, what he didn't. The US defence secretary certainly seems to have conceded some key bargaining chips to Russia - land, no NATO membership or protection for Ukraine. Trump's mission has been to stop the fighting. He might do that - a big short-term win for him to trumpet to the American people. The concern in Europe is that it's a short-term win; that it will reward Putin; that America's retreat will weaken Europe and maybe leave Putin to fight another day. Putin's red lines on NATO expansion haven't shiftedby Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent We knew there'd be contact between the two leaders at some point but this is still a hugely significant moment. It fires the starting gun on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, and it may prove a watershed moment for other matters too - NATO unity, Ukrainian sovereignty and Russia-US cooperation. Ukraine seems to be the issue on which everything else hinges when it comes to Washington and Moscow resuming ties - unlock that and Trump seems to believe a relationship can blossom: \"We each talked about the strengths of our respective nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together\". But at what cost? It's a question Kyiv will be asking itself with trepidation. Read more from Sky News:British woman fatally shot in TexasEurope needs to get serious about defenceGlee actress' final words revealed Donald Trump clearly wants to be remembered as the president who ended the war and healed the world, and it seems he's even willing to travel to Moscow in order to make that happen. For Bill Clinton and George W Bush it was a regular port of call, visiting five times and seven times respectively. Barack Obama came twice, but after his trip in 2013 for a G20 summit, the visits suddenly stopped. The reason - Russia annexed Crimea. So given everything that's happened since then, it would be quite the coup for the Kremlin if Donald Trump did visit. Russia's so-called special military operation wasn't supposed to end in negotiations, but the leader of the free world flying into Moscow on a peace mission? You can see how Russia could spin that as a victory over the collective West. But that's not to say that a peace deal will be easy. There's one line in the Kremlin's read-out of the call that makes you wonder. It reads: \"President Putin, for his part, mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict\". When Vladimir Putin talks about root causes, he means NATO expansion. That's what he claims is the reason for the war in Ukraine. And stating this in the call with Trump suggests his red lines haven't shifted - no NATO membership for Ukraine, and that Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the four Ukrainian territories Russia currently occupies."

NATO spending Mr Trump - a long-time critic of the alliance, which he sees as containing freeloaders that benefit from American military strength without investing in their own security - has said all NATO allies should increase defence spending to 5% of GDP. This is more than double the current target. The UK is only spending 2.3%. While still supportive of NATO, Mr Hegseth warned that America's patience was limited. \"Our transatlantic alliance has endured for decades. And we fully expect it will sustained for generations more. But this won't just happen,\" he said. He continued: \"It will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on this continent. \"The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe. \"Our relationship will prioritise empowering Europe to own responsibility for its security.\" Ukraine-Russia war Mr Hegseth also had strong words about Russia's war in Ukraine, which he said \"must end\". Speaking frankly, he dismissed a fundamental Ukrainian goal to recapture all its territory - including Crimea and swathes of the Donbas that were seized by Russia in 2014 when Mr Putin first invaded his neighbour. This aim had previously been backed by the UK and other allies.

But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\" he said. \"Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\" The US defence secretary said that a durable peace must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war won't begin again - but he made clear that the US would not be part of that effort on the ground and it could not be a NATO operation. It was not immediately clear, however, whether the US military may help to provide protection from a distance. \"These security guarantees should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\" the US defence secretary said. \"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact.\" Article 5 of NATO says an armed attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Read more: What is Article 5? Mr Hegseth continued: \"To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine.\" His words will be a significant setback for Kyiv. President Zelenskyy told Sky News last week that any peacekeeping force that did not include a US element would be a \"major mistake\", signalling that he did not believe European militaries alone could deter Moscow. The retreat of the US from its leadership role in Ukraine was clear in the choreography of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting - an alignment of allies gathered together by Washington under Joe Biden and his defence secretary Loyd Austin after Russia launched its full-scale invasion almost exactly three years ago. Future of European security The regular meetings have until now always been chaired by the US. Wednesday's meeting, however, was led by John Healey, the UK defence secretary. Mr Hegseth made clear that European allies would need to step up and take on much more of the effort to provide Ukraine with weapons and non-military support. \"Safeguarding European security is an imperative for European members of NATO. As part of this, Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine,\" he said. This means donating more ammunition, expanding Europe's defence industrial base and rallying the public to be willing to respond to the threat the continent faces. \"Part of this is speaking frankly with your people about how this threat can only be met by spending more on defence and investing strategically,\" Mr Hegseth said. \"Increasing your commitment to your own security is a down payment for the future.\" Earlier, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he agreed with US president Donald Trump on the need for Washington and European allies to share the burden of military aid for Ukraine more equally."

Speaking to People, the 41-year-old actor said that \"the last thing she said was his (her son's) name, and then she went under, and he didn't see her anymore\". The Glee actress, 33, died after drowning in a California lake in July 2020 - when she was swimming with her young son Josey. Josey, who was four at the time, told police his mother had boosted him on to the deck - after their boat had drifted away. Local police said they believe that after saving her son, Rivera did not have enough energy to save herself. Dorsey says his son, now nine, told him he was worried about getting into the water - and that Rivera had said, \"don't be silly!\". \"Something he's said over and over is that he was trying to find a life raft, and there was a rope, but there was a big spider on the rope, and he was too scared to throw it,\" Dorsey told People. \"I keep reassuring him, buddy, that rope wasn't going to be long enough.'\" Dorsey added: \"It just rocks my world that he had to witness her last moments.\" The actor says he found out that Rivera was first missing after receiving a call from her stepfather - while he was in a supermarket buying food for a friend's barbeque. \"I collapsed into a pallet of drinks,\" Dorsey said. \"I feared the worst.\" Dorsey said he immediately got into his car and drove 145 miles to Lake Piru, where Rivera and their son had been swimming. \"I drove 100-and-Â­something the whole way with my four-way hazards on, chain-smoking cigarettes - and I don't even smoke, really - and just crying,\" he says. \"I just wanted to get to Josey. \"If we'd have lost both Naya and Josey, I don't know how I would continue on with my life.\" He added: \"When it happened, I just found myself shaking my head, like, I can't believe she's gone. It's still so surreal every day.\" Read more on Sky News:A$AP Rocky not giving evidence at gun trialRuPaul star had 'unnatural' death Dorsey says the holiday period is particularly tough for his nine-year-old son. He said: \"We made this book of memories for Josey that sits by his bed, and during the holidays he was crying looking at it. \"You can only give him a hug and tell him, 'I know, life is not fair. Bad things happen and there's no reason for it, and you just have to do your best to be a good person.'\" In 2022, a lawsuit filed by Rivera's family against Ventura County, California, over her drowning was privately settled. The lawsuit for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress was filed on behalf of her son. The family also sued the United Water Conservation District and Parks and Recreation Management, accusing them of failing to warn visitors of the danger of boating and swimming in the lake, and saying Rivera's death was \"utterly preventable\". They said the rented pontoon boat was not equipped with flotation or lifesaving devices, a ladder, rope, anchor, or any equipment designed to keep swimmers from being separated from their boat. However, Ventura County officials said the death wasn't their fault, and said the actress had declined to wear a life jacket. They said the rental agent had put the life jacket in the boat nevertheless."

        "Content": "The state of Missouri has sued Starbucks, claiming its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies have led to customers paying more and waiting longer for their coffees. The US state alleged the coffee chain used a commitment to diversity as a pretext to systematically discriminate based on race, gender and sexual orientation. In the complaint, filed in St Louis federal court, Missouri also claimed executive pay was tied to the company achieving race and gender-based hiring quotas. \"Starbucks has decided to require outright race and sex-based discrimination in hiring via quotas, segregate employees on unlawful bases, and single out preferred groups for additional training and employment benefits,\" the lawsuit read. It added Starbucks' actions had led to customers paying more and waiting longer for its goods and services as \"the most qualified workers\" weren't hired. Starbucks described the allegations as \"inaccurate\" and added: \"We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programmes and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\" The move from Republican attorney general Andrew Bailey marks the latest efforts in the US to push back DEI policies, led by Donald Trump's new administration. Mr Trump has tried to shut down such efforts inside the federal government and some companies have followed suit. On Tuesday, Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs cancelled a policy to take companies public only if they had two diverse board members. Last week meanwhile, Google got rid of its diversity-based hiring targets and Amazon.com removed a reference to inclusion and diversity from its annual report. The policies under question were adopted by Starbucks in 2020, in the surging Black Lives Matter movement that followed the murder of George Floyd. Missouri added that Starbucks' alleged behaviour \"should come as no surprise,\" pointing to new chief executive Brian Niccol's support of environmental, social and governance goals while leading Chipotle.

Mr Boyajian, an Armenian-American, has owned Diamond Straws since 1995. His factory produces more than 800 straws a minute, supplying large US cafes and restaurants, including Peet's Coffee and BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. Diamond Straws currently employs 15 people but is anticipating an uptick in business in the wake of President Trump's executive order declaring that the US is \"going back to plastic straws\" and moving away from paper straws. \"It was one of our happiest days when I heard him say that,\" says Mr Boyajian. \"Our whole business completely switched. Previously everybody was worrying about 'what are you doing in this business, you're going to be out of business because nobody is buying plastic straws'. So thank you, Trump.\" Cardboard boxes emblazoned with \"made in USA\" are stacked around the factory. It is just one of a handful of factories remaining in the US manufacturing plastic straws after much of the industry moved abroad to China. Mr Trump has repeatedly railed against paper straws. His 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws. His executive order will reverse a Biden administration policy to phase out government purchases of plastic straws, as well as plastic cutlery and packaging by 2027. Environmentalists have long been concerned about the use of plastic straws, although they say the issue is much bigger than straws alone.

The ADF described the shirt, which was on sale for $20 (Â£16) as \"further proof\" of West's antisemitism. The e-commerce platform Spotify, which hosts many online shops and businesses, later deactivated his site.

        "Content": "By Adele Robinson, news correspondent  The government is continuing to put Post Office victims through \"hell\" in their fight for redress, Sir Alan Bates has told Sky News. More than 240 former sub-postmasters are still waiting for financial compensation years after they won their High Court battle. Sir Alan's comments come after another former sub-postmaster, Terry Walters from Wilmslow in Cheshire, died without receiving financial redress. He is survived by his wife Janet. Hundreds were wrongly accused of stealing from their Post Office branches between 1999 and 2015 as a result of faulty Horizon computer software. Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has described government officials as living in \"ivory towers totally removed from the hell the victims have gone through day after day, year after year\". He told Sky News they \"haven't the slightest inkling of what hell they continue to put the victims (through)\". \"It's all well and good meeting a few of them every now and then, patting them on the head and making noises about how hard they are working to sort everything out,\" he added. \"When the figures alone prove how badly they are able to finalise cases - that is unless victims want to sell themselves short for a quick settlement.\"  Sir Alan wrote to the Post Office minister in January putting forward a proposal to help speed along redress delivered to victims who are part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme. On behalf of the JFSA (Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance) he suggested a \"compulsory mediation scheme\" that could be inserted into the process to \"create an opportunity for early resolution\". In his letter, seen by Sky News, he wrote that this should happen within four weeks from the point at which the initial offer of financial redress is rejected by a victim. \"Key to this proposal,\" he continued, \"is getting rid of the lawyers, for a whole host of reasons, not least the ridiculous amount being spent on themâ€¦\" He added that their input should be \"kept to a minimum\". Sir Alan said the mediations should also be \"time limited\" and undertaken by a \"party neutral\" law firm. Describing the current situation on redress as \"unacceptable\", he wrote: \"We are not prepared just to sit back and let time pass as far too many have already died along the way, and this matter needs to be brought to completion now.\" He also described a 40-day \"delay\" to claims before victims receive their initial offer as \"extremely unfair\" and projected that at the \"current rate\" redress would not be paid to everyone until 2027.  Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has since written to Sir Alan following on from his correspondence with the prime minister last year. In his letter he said it is \"likely\" that all GLO claims will be \"settled this year\". \"Ministers and civil servants in the department (for business and trade) will continue to do everything we can to ensure claims that we receive are handled in a prompt way,\" he wrote. The business secretary added that payments for \"complete claims\" received by the end of last year are expected to be paid before the end of March. Sir Alan has previously said that victims may consider further legal action on financial redress and demanded a deadline of March 2025 for payment to all. Read more:Judge-led inquiry to be held into Nottingham attacksBritish woman shot dead during Texas holiday In his letter, Mr Reynolds said that \"setting a deadline\" would \"run counter\" to \"easing the strain\" on the \"most vulnerable claimants\" who have \"found it stressful to engage with the process\". He continued: \"It could be damaging to some GLO members' mental health and might limit their ability to claim their full redress.\" The secretary of state added that the department shared Sir Alan's view that the \"victims of the horrendous scandal deserve closure as soon as possible\". In addition, Mr Reynolds invited Sir Alan to a meeting to \"discuss any ideas\" for \"practical ways in which we can improve matters for the GLO group\". A spokesperson from the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates and the tireless campaigning he has done to get justice for the thousands of innocent postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal. \"Postmasters have already had to wait far too long for justice which is why we are working relentlessly to provide full and fair redress and have doubled the number of payments since July.\""

Fran Horowitz, who has led the US-based company since the departure of Mr Jeffries, signalled in an interview with Sky News that A&F had examined and transformed its culture. She told Business Live presenter Darren McCaffrey: \"We're appalled and disgusted at the allegations. Money latest: Oasis reacts to cancelled tickets \"What we do at Abercrombie is continue to do what we set out to do which is set the new values for the company... and keep our associates focused on that.\" Ms Horowitz was speaking as A&F - known in its heyday for jeans and T-shirts - opened a new store on London's Oxford Street. She expressed confidence in the brand's more broad offering these days and the UK economy, despite the current malaise for growth amid continued weak consumer confidence. She said she could \"not be prouder\" of what the retailer had become during her decade in charge. A&F's brand took a hit when the claims against Mr Jeffries - relating to his behaviour while running the fashion and accessories company - first emerged.

A total of 15 men allege, in the indictment unveiled in October, that they were induced by \"force, fraud and coercion\" to engage in drug-fuelled sex parties. The claims relate to the period of 2008 to 2015 and, according to the court documents, took place globally in locations including New York and London. It emerged in December that Mr Jeffries's legal team was questioning his fitness to stand trial on the grounds he has dementia. Ms Horowitz signalled in her interview that she was fully focused on continuing to lead the fightback for the brand and its evolution towards an omnichannel \"lifestyle brand\" aimed at customers of all ages. A&F, which is preparing its full-year results for 2024, had said following the core Christmas sales season that it expected to complete the year with net sales growth around 15% and that a turnaround plan, aimed at bolstering profitability, was significantly ahead of target. But it has suffered a 27% decline in its share price in the year to date - with investors apparently questioning whether momentum can be maintained. She said of her confidence in its UK operations: \"The UK is our second-largest business. We've had terrific growth here. \"I always say despite the economic times, the customer has a choice of where to shop and they have been choosing us.\""

TOFS is an independent discount retail chain trading from more than 180 stores across the UK. Rival bidders for the business are said to have included Mike Ashley's Frasers Group and Poundstretcher, which is owned by the investment group Fortress.

It was posted by an account claiming to be affiliated with the gambling company, rather than an official account, and has since been deleted. It is unclear whether Bonnie Blue - whose real name is Tia Billinger - was involved in the post, and if the account had created the video or reposted it from elsewhere.

        "Content": "The state of Missouri has sued Starbucks, claiming its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies have led to customers paying more and waiting longer for their coffees. The US state alleged the coffee chain used a commitment to diversity as a pretext to systematically discriminate based on race, gender and sexual orientation. In the complaint, filed in St Louis federal court, Missouri also claimed executive pay was tied to the company achieving race and gender-based hiring quotas. \"Starbucks has decided to require outright race and sex-based discrimination in hiring via quotas, segregate employees on unlawful bases, and single out preferred groups for additional training and employment benefits,\" the lawsuit read. It added Starbucks' actions had led to customers paying more and waiting longer for its goods and services as \"the most qualified workers\" weren't hired. Starbucks described the allegations as \"inaccurate\" and added: \"We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programmes and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\" The move from Republican attorney general Andrew Bailey marks the latest efforts in the US to push back DEI policies, led by Donald Trump's new administration. Mr Trump has tried to shut down such efforts inside the federal government and some companies have followed suit. On Tuesday, Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs cancelled a policy to take companies public only if they had two diverse board members. Last week meanwhile, Google got rid of its diversity-based hiring targets and Amazon.com removed a reference to inclusion and diversity from its annual report. The policies under question were adopted by Starbucks in 2020, in the surging Black Lives Matter movement that followed the murder of George Floyd. Missouri added that Starbucks' alleged behaviour \"should come as no surprise,\" pointing to new chief executive Brian Niccol's support of environmental, social and governance goals while leading Chipotle.

Sky News has learnt that Eric French, the food delivery service's chief operating officer since 2021, has told colleagues that he will step down later this year. His departure has yet to be announced internally. Mr French joined Deliveroo in January 2021, having spent 15 years at Amazon in a number of senior roles. Money latest: Oasis reacts to cancelled tickets His most recent post at the US-based internet giant - which took a stake in Deliveroo in 2019 - was as vice-president of its US consumables business, where he was responsible for its household, beauty, baby and grocery categories. Sources said his plan to leave Deliveroo was unconnected to ongoing discussions in the company's boardroom about succession planning for Mr Shu. \n                  Sub-postmasters still going through hell, lead campaigner Sir Alan Bates says\n                 \n                  Abercrombie & Fitch boss 'appalled and disgusted' by Jeffries sex trafficking claims\n                 \n                  Hobbycraft owner in late swoop to snatch The Original Factory Shop\n                 Sky News revealed on Tuesday that directors had begun actively debating the prospective timing of Mr Shu's exit, with one scenario under consideration that he would leave towards the end of this year. Carlo Mocci, Deliveroo's chief business officer, is regarded as the internal favourite to replace Mr Shu when he stands down. Deliveroo responded to the story by saying there were \"no plans for Will to step down\". \"Will remains relentlessly focused on the long term future of Deliveroo and delivering for consumers, merchants and riders,\" it said. Insiders labelled the statement 'a non-denial denial' and confirmed that headhunters were engaged in CEO succession planning at the company, which counts Pizza Express and Waitrose among its delivery partners. Mr Shu co-founded the company up in 2013 and has become one of the most prominent business leaders in Britain, steering a business which now employs thousands of people. Despite the slump in its stock market valuation since it went public in 2021, Deliveroo is one of Britain's biggest consumer technology successes of recent years. It has also encountered severe reputational challenges, notably over its treatment of so-called gig economy workers and their lack of employment rights. In recent months there has been growing speculation that Deliveroo will attract a takeover offer from an international suitor. Berlin-based Delivery Hero sold its 4.5% stake in Deliveroo last year for roughly Â£77m, although more recent market chatter has centred on Doordash, the American takeaway delivery service. A golden share held by Mr Shu that was put in place at the time of its IPO expired last year, removing the company's automatic protection against any unwanted bid. On Wednesday, Deliveroo shares were trading at around 139.8p, giving the company a market capitalisation of about Â£2.15bn. The stock has risen by about 15% over the last year. Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a Deliveroo spokesman said: \"Eric first raised with Will his desire to move on in autumn last year as part of Eric's plans to relocate to the US. \"Eric has worked with the company for over four years, scaling the grocery business and playing a leadership role in helping the company reach key financial milestones. \"Will and Eric continue to work closely together and are entirely focused on growing the business and ensuring a smooth transition. Eric will be with Deliveroo until the summer.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Thames Water is being investigated over late delivery of environmental improvement schemes, the industry regulator has announced. Ofwat said the enforcement case against the company, currently fighting to secure its financial future amid a Â£19bn debt pile, aimed to determine whether it had breached its legal obligations. The watchdog said that Thames Water itself had been in contact to alert it and the Environment Agency that it will be unlikely to deliver more than 100 of 812 improvements it had promised by a 31 March deadline. Money latest: Scrapping cash ISAs would be a 'big mistake' The schemes fall under the Water Industry National Environmental Programme (WINEP) during the current 2020-2025 pricing period. That concludes at the end of March when Thames customers face inflation-busting increases to bills over the next five years from April to pay for further infrastructure improvements, which include widespread storm overflow upgrades to prevent sewage spills. Lynn Parker, Ofwat's senior director for enforcement, said: \"Customers have paid for Thames Water to carry out these essential environmental schemes. \"We take any indication that water companies are not meeting their legal obligations very seriously. Therefore, we have launched an investigation to understand whether the delayed delivery of environmental schemes means that Thames Water has breached its obligations. \"If we find reason to act, we will use our full range of powers to hold Thames to account for any failures and will require them to put things right.\" The regulator ultimately has the power to fine the relevant part of the business up to 10% of its annual turnover. Previous, and recent, penalties paid by Thames include an Â£18m fine in December for breaking shareholder payout rules while it was also slapped with a Â£104m bill last summer for sewage failings.  Thames Water is grappling with pressure over improvements to its day-to-day operations while scrambling to secure its financial future. It has previously warned it will run out of money next month, raising the prospect of the utility entering a special administration regime, unless new financing and new equity are secured. The company's preferred rescue plan is currently hanging in the balance due to a High Court fight between bondholders. Thames is also yet to confirm whether it will appeal Ofwat's final ruling on how much it is allowed to raise bills during 2025-30. The average water and wastewater bill across England and Wales is set to go up from Â£480 to Â£603 during 2025/26 alone - an increase of about Â£10 a month. Thames Water's 16 million customers face a 31% hike to Â£639 - a rise of Â£151. It had sought an increase above 50% across the pricing period. Read more from Sky News:Heathrow set to announce multibillion-pound investment'Big opportunity' for Chinese electric carmakers in UK A Thames Water spokesperson said of the investigation: \"We note Ofwat's decision to open an enforcement case into the delayed delivery of WINEP7 and will cooperate fully. \"Customers will not pay twice for investment that has already been funded through customer bills. \"We've been very open about the challenges of delivering all the elements of our WINEP 7 programme, which has been impacted by cost increases that are higher than the inflation index applied to our allowances. We informed Ofwat of this in August 2023. \"We remain committed to delivering all our WINEP commitments.\""

Sir David was stabbed to death by Islamic State (ISIS) supporter Ali Harbi Ali during a constituency surgery at a church hall in Leigh-on-Sea in October 2021. The killer, who was given a whole-life sentence, had become radicalised by ISIS propaganda and had been referred to the anti-terror programme Prevent before the attack. Politics latest: PM and Badenoch in rare agreement over judge's decision on Gazan refugees His case had been closed five years before, after just one meeting for coffee at a McDonald's to deal with his interpretation of \"haram\" (forbidden under Islamic law), as well as texts and calls with an \"intervention provider\". Despite Prevent policy and guidance at the time being \"mostly followed\", his case was \"exited too quickly\", security minister Dan Jarvis told the House of Commons on Wednesday. Following the publication of a review into Prevent's handling of Southport child killer Axel Rudakubana earlier this month, Mr Jarvis said a Prevent learning review into Sir David's killing would be released this week in a commitment to transparency over the anti-terror programme. However, Sir David's daughter, Katie, has dismissed it as a \"paper exercise\" with no proper accountability and is pushing for a \"full public open inquiry\". Matt Juke, head of counter-terrorism policing, said it's clear the management and handling of Ali's case by Prevent \"should have been better\" and it is \"critical\" the review is acted on \"so that other families are spared the pain felt by the loved ones of Sir David\". The review found: â€¢ Ali was referred to Prevent in 2014 by his school after teachers said his demeanour, appearance and behaviour changed from a previously \"engaging student with a bright future\" with aspirations to be a doctor to failing his A-levels and wanting to move to a \"more Islamic state because he could no longer live among unbelievers\" â€¢ Prevent quickly took his case on and he was referred to Channel, part of the programme that aims to prevent involvement in extremism â€¢ He was \"exited from Prevent too quickly\", Mr Jarvis said, just five months later \"after his terrorism risk was assessed as low\" â€¢ A review by police 12 months after he was released from Prevent \"also found no terrorism concerns\" and the case was closed. This was not uploaded for eight more months due to an \"IT issue\"â€¢ People released from Prevent are meant to have a review at six and 12 months â€¢ The assessment of Ali's vulnerabilities \"was problematic and outdated\" as it did not follow the proper procedure, which led to \"questionable decision-making and sub-optimal handling of the case\" â€¢ Ali's symptoms were prioritised over addressing the underlying causes of his vulnerabilities - and support provided did not tackle those issues â€¢ Record keeping of decisions, actions and rationale was \"problematic, disjointed and lacked clarity\" â€¢ The rationale for certain decisions was \"not explicit\" â€¢ Ali's school was not involved in discussions to help determine risk and provide appropriate support - they were only called once to be told the \"matter was being dealt with\" â€¢ A miscommunication led to only one intervention session being provided, instead of two. Read more:Sir David Amess' daughter taking legal action  The review found most of the failures in Ali's case would not be repeated today as the guidance and requirements are much clearer. It said referrers, in Ali's case his school, are kept informed and engaged, and different departments and agencies - not just police - have clear roles. Which records need to be kept is now clear and guidance for detecting underlying vulnerabilities has changed and would have made a difference, the review added. It said a Prevent \"intervention provider\" met Ali at a McDonald's to deal with his understanding of \"haram\" (forbidden under Islamic law). No risk assessment was made but they suggested one more meeting, however a breakdown in communication between the police and the provider meant there were no more meetings. Training for providers is \"substantially different\" now and the review says this would not be repeated today, with the provider in question saying the process is \"a completely different one today\". However, the review said there are still problems - not just in Ali's case - with the Vulnerability Assessment Form, an \"incredibly complex document that is vital to Channel\" and the progression of a case. It also found a more recent decision by the College of Police to only hold Prevent case data for five years \"may prove to be problematic\" and if Ali's case material had been deleted under that ruling \"it would have been nigh on impossible to conduct this review\". 'Dad deserved better from friends in parliament' Katie Amess welcomed Wednesday's announcement of a public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks but said every victim failed by Prevent deserved the same. She told The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee she had been briefed on the findings of the learning review last year. Ms Amess said she had to sign \"a contract to say I wouldn't tell anybody what was in it otherwise I'd go to prison or be fined\". She dismissed the review as woefully insufficient and said it was just put together from existing paperwork and email logs.  The 39-year-old, who is taking legal action against Essex Police and the Home Office, told Sky News her father deserved better from his \"friends\" in parliament after the decades he served as an MP. Ms Amess also criticised Yvette Cooper's reticence to approve a public inquiry as she was not in office when her father was murdered. The MP's daughter said other inquiries had been signed off by home secretaries in similar circumstances. \"I want to know what is being covered up and why they're not committing to an inquiry for myself and other victims,\" she told Sky News. Ms Amess said the information that's emerged so far vividly shows the weakness of the Prevent programme, with \"no clear form of communication between police and Prevent and other channels\". She told Sarah-Jane Mee: \"He [Ali] even stood up in his trial and made a mockery of Prevent; he said all you need to say is 'I'm not a terrorist and they stop following you' - what message does that send?\""

Politics latest: Follow the latest update As part of today's announcement, a first draft of the blueprint for the 100 new towns will be published.

The government says more than 100 sites in England have \"come forward\" to be considered to be a new town. Most of these are in London, the south or the east. Sir Keir said: \"We're urgently using all levers available to build the homes we need so more families can get on the housing ladder.

In today's announcement, the government says it plans to unblock another 700,000 homes across 350 sites. This will include speeding up the process for building \"tall buildings\" - those of 18 metres or more. It is understood that this reduction in time will not include relaxing safety regulations, but rather extra resources to make the current steps faster. Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said: \"I will not run away from the tough choices to fix the housing crisis we inherited that has left thousands of families on housing waiting lists, allowed homelessness to spiral out of control, and stopped an entire generation from picking up the keys to their first home.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to Politics At Jack And Sam's on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ The government also reiterated its plans to overrule local concerns about the environment - exemplified by the bat tunnel near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       A \"loophole\" that allowed a Palestinian family to be granted the right to come to the UK under a Ukrainian resettlement scheme was the subject of a lot of debate in the House of Commons today. Both the prime minister and leader of the opposition criticised a decision by a judge to allow the family of six the right to enter the UK. Sir Keir pledged to close the \"loophole\" after he was asked about it by Kemi Badenoch - but could not elaborate on what it was. Sky News has read through the judgment given by Judge Hugo Norton-Taylor to understand what happened. Politics latest: 'Leak' probe launched at Treasury Why did the family apply? The family of six, a husband and wife and their children aged 18, 17, eight and seven, lived in Gaza and their homes were destroyed after the 7 October attacks and subsequent conflict. They ended up living in a humanitarian zone and then a refugee camp. In January 2024, the family applied to come to the UK via the Ukraine Family Scheme form, in a bid to join one of the parent's brothers, who is a British citizen and has lived in the UK since 2007. While they acknowledged they were not eligible for the Ukraine scheme, the family chose to apply in an attempt to use the Home Office's policy on \"applications for entry clearance outside the rules\". The Home Office rejected the request, saying they were not satisfied there were \"compelling, compassionate circumstances\" to justify a request outside the rules. They also noted the lack of a resettlement scheme for Palestinians. Read more:Judge 'wrong' to let Gaza family settle in UKPalestinian family allowed to settle in UK The appeals Despite the Home Office saying there were no grounds to appeal, the family launched one against the decision on human rights grounds. A judge then ruled that the initial rejection constituted a rejection of human rights, and so allowed an appeal. Part of this appeal was under Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a family life between the man living in Britain and his family in Gaza. This appeal was rejected, with a lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme noted as a reason. An appeal was launched at a higher tribunal - and one of the arguments was that the case should be considered on its own merits and not allow the lack of a Palestinian resettlement scheme to outweigh other arguments.  The loophole It is here that the \"loophole\" seems to have appeared. At this point. Judge Norton-Taylor heard the case and allowed the appeal. In his judgment, he stated that it was \"wrong to have taken the absence of a resettlement scheme into account at all\". The judge added that there was \"no evidence\" he had seen that the Home Office had made a deliberate decision not to implement a Palestinian resettlement scheme. He also noted that the lack of immigration rules on a topic should not count against someone. In layman's terms, the argument seems to be that just because a scheme to resettle people does not exist it does not mean they are banned from coming to the UK via humanitarian routes. The judgment said the absence of a \"resettlement scheme was irrelevant\" to their decision. What next? Judge Norton-Taylor went on to back the claim from the family in Gaza based on the ECHR and the right to a family life between them and their relative in Britain. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Ukraine Family scheme was clearly set out for Ukrainians. We have been clear that we do not agree with this judgment and we twice vigorously contested this case. \"As the prime minister made clear, article 8, the right to a family life, should be interpreted much more narrowly. It is for the government and Parliament to decide who should be covered by the UK's safe and legal routes. \"We are pursuing all legal avenues to address the legal loophole which has been exploited in this case. The home secretary is urgently reviewing this case to ensure the correct processes are always followed and existing laws correctly interpreted.\" ðŸ‘‰Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast appðŸ‘ˆ They added that there was no evidence to support the argument and that data from the government shows a \"very small\" number of Gazans have been allowed to enter the UK - equal to roughly 150. Sir Keir said he was planning to close the loophole, but it is not clear what this will entail."

'No?,' he replied, quizzically. I'm the first to break it to him. \"'Well, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this - but apparently, you've been suspended from the Labour Party.' \"At that moment, he looked as if the world had been taken out from under his feet... \"'WHAT?!?' \"At this point, his aides came over - alerted by the outburst and the expression on his face, in that it had dropped a mile and turned rather pale. \"I repeated the news I'd just delivered. What followed from his team was a furious rifling through news feeds, social media accounts and emails - and a lot of expletives. \"'Would you be prepared to give us a statement?,' I interjected. Mr Corbyn was obviously still quite shocked by the news. And by this time, his team had flown into damage control mode. \"As he'd not seen the ruling, he didn't want to comment until he'd read it. 'I completely understand,' I said calmly. 'Look - I'm not going anywhere, and Joe will be back shortly. We'll wait right here.

He was speaking as the UK finalises a strategic defence review, which the government has promised to release in the first half of this year.

The work was ordered to deliver answers for a defence budget that will increase to 2.5% during the course of the parliament - even though the government has yet to commit to a timeline.  However, defence insiders widely acknowledge this is nowhere near enough given the size of the threat and the need for the UK and European allies to take on more of the burden of securing Europe, as the United States under Mr Trump shifts attention elsewhere. Mr Healey brushed off concerns that the UK's relationship with the US might be damaged if it fails to boost the defence budget to a level closer to Mr Trump's demands. \"I'm deeply confident in our relationship with the US,\" he said. \"We have a security relationship which we do unique things that nobody else does together.

The prime minister said the government was working to close a \"loophole\" that led to the specific case, blaming the legal framework in place under the Conservatives. It emerged on Wednesday that a Palestinian family of six that fled Gaza had been granted the right to live in the UK following an appeal - after they applied to enter the country through a Ukrainian refugee scheme. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch raised the case at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), saying: \"This decision is completely wrong. It cannot be allowed to stand. Is the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and if so, which ones?\". Sir Keir replied: \"Let me be clear. I do not agree with the decisions. She's right.\" However, he said Ms Badenoch had not \"done her homework\", claiming \"the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to the legal framework of the last government\". He added that the Home Office was looking at the details of the case so it doesn't happen again. He said: \"It should be parliament that makes the rules on immigration. It should be the government that makes the policy. That is the principle. \"And the Home Secretary is already looking up the legal loophole, which we need to close in this particular case.\" The case involved a mother, father and their four children who were displaced after their home was destroyed by an airstrike in the Israel-Hamas war. They applied for entry to the UK using the Ukraine Family Scheme to join the father's brother, who had lived in the county since 2007 and was a British citizen. The Ukraine Family Scheme allows those fleeing the Russian invasion to join relatives already living in Britain, but there is no such scheme for Palestinian refugees. The family's application was refused in May last year and then again in September following an appeal. However, they were subsequently granted the right to live in the UK after upper tribunal judges allowed a further appeal, on the grounds of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protects the right to family life. Read More:Migrants arriving illegally to be refused British citizenshipCandidate for borders watchdog would commute from Finland Judge Hugo Norton-Taylor said there were \"compelling\" and \"exceptional\" circumstances in the case, including that the security and humanitarian situation in Gaza remained \"exceptionally dangerous\" and \"dire\". Ms Badenoch pressed Sir Keir to appeal the decision, bring forward new legislation or amend existing proposals going through the Commons, suggesting the case sets a precedent for \"millions of people all around the world in terrible situations\" to come to the UK. Sir Keir said that was not necessary but did not elaborate on what loophole would be closed, or when. The PM's spokesperson also would not be drawn on the specifics, saying Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was \"looking at plans to tighten application rules in cases like this\" and proposals would be brought forward \"in the next few weeks\"."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n Has Sir Keir Starmer raised his game at Prime Minister's Questions?  Suddenly, he's less wooden, robotic and lawyerly and much more aggressive against the Conservatives and Reform UK. It has been noticeable in the past few weeks how he's taken the gloves off in his attacks on Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage. The new style at PMQs coincides with Labour attack ads against Reform and hard-hitting videos selling the government's crackdown on illegal immigration. Of course, macho Keir is part of the Labour fightback in response to the Sky News/YouGov poll that put Reform ahead of Labour for the first time. So in the last PMQs for two weeks - yes, there's yet another parliamentary recess next week - Sir Keir slammed the Tories and Reform UK for voting against Labour's borders bill on Monday. That's right: immigration, the issue another opinion poll at the weekend suggested is the biggest issue for Reform voters and Tory voters considering switching to Reform UK. \n                  More than 100 new towns being considered by ministers\n                 \n                  King Charles invites Sir Keir Starmer and devolved government leaders for dinner at Windsor Castle\n                 \n                  Sue Gray takes up seat in House of Lords - and receives new title\n                  In a pantomime-style routine with Labour backbenchers joining in, Sir Keir said theatrically: \"They voted against - that's Reform and the Tories. \"They voted against making it an offence to organise the buying, selling and transport of small boats.\" Labour MPs repeatedly shouted \"Against!\" as Sir Keir continued: \"Against making an offence to endanger lives at sea, against a power to arrest suspected people smugglers before the smuggling takes place. \"They voted against, they voted for open borders, both of them.\" Read More:Migrants arriving illegally to be refused British citizenshipCandidate for borders watchdog would commute from Finland At one point during PMQs, the newly combative Sir Keir even had the brass neck to claim that \"farming is top of the agenda as far as I'm concerned\". Really? He was rightly challenged by new Tory MP Harriet Cross - who looks like one to watch - about a Labour minister declaring that farmers were \"not high on the pecking order\" for the government.  Another party leader on good form at PMQs these days is Sir Ed Davey, who is regularly asking the serious questions on the big issues that the Tory leader is ignoring. This week it was President Trump's threats on Ukraine and tariffs. He even had a good joke which MPs seemed to miss, calling for tariffs on American electric cars. That's right, Elon Musk's Teslas. On the other hand, PMQs is poorer for hearing fewer questions from Stephen Flynn now the SNP is no longer the third biggest party. His direct style usually hits the target and is sorely missed. Which brings us to Kemi Badenoch. Is Sir Keir looking better because she's poor, as some critics claim? Her approach is still too scattergun and the PM is winning their weekly battles as his more aggressive approach pays off."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has told the families of those killed in the Nottingham attacks that a judge-led public inquiry will start in \"a matter of weeks\". The families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates were told at an emotionally charged meeting at Number 10 that a \"number of different agencies\" would be scrutinised by the probe. Students Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and 65-year-old caretaker Mr Coates were killed by Valdo Calocane before he attempted to kill three other people in a spate of attacks in the city in June 2023. Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in January last year after admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility and attempted murder. Prosecutors accepted a plea of manslaughter after experts agreed his schizophrenia meant he was not fully responsible for his actions. The families said recently he had \"got away with murder\". Speaking outside Downing Street on Wednesday, Emma Webber, Barnaby's mother, said: \"It's the first bit of positive news that we've been able to have for a very, very long time. We're still processing it.\" Dr Sanjoy Kumar, Grace's father, added: \"As we have always said as families, everywhere that Valdo Calocane intersected with the authorities, we were let down.\" He then said the public inquiry \"has been fantastic news for all of us, we welcome it, we've been working so hard to it\". \"Everyone who has also suffered the way we had, we will make sure that changes come from our inquiry for the betterment of our country that makes... the land safer for all of us.\" Mrs Webber also said the families were told the inquiry would be concluded within two years, and Dr Kumar thanked the prime minister \"from a father to a father\". During the meeting, Sir Keir said focusing on just one aspect of the case would not be right as he did not \"think that will do justice,\" and said it would be a statutory inquiry. He added a retired judge is set to be appointed in due course, and said: \"As soon as that happens, the process will start.\" Read more from Sky News:Sir David Amess' killer 'exited' from Prevent 'too quickly'NHS trust fined Â£1.6m over deaths of babies Speaking later to Sky News's The UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee, Mrs Webber said the families had to endure \"torture\" to \"get this far\". She added: \"Had we not as a collective had sheer doggedness, I don't believe for a single moment that we would have been sat there (in Number 10) today.\" Mrs Webber went on: \"I wanted and needed to hear one word today - statutory. I think we made our case quite clear last week [on] why it had to be a statutory public inquiry, which would be judge-led, because only then will the truth come out. \"Answers will be found, there will be accountability, and there will be change.\" Dr Sinead O'Malley-Kumar, Grace's mother, told Sky News: \"We need to find out where patients are slipping through the cracks, why patients aren't being treated properly, where the pressures are. Are there no beds for these patients, are the managers pressurised? The patients aren't getting the treatment they need. It's putting patients at risk and families at risk and the public at risk.\" The meeting came after NHS England's report into Calocane's mental health care in the lead-up to the attacks, which found treatment available to him \"was not always sufficient to meet his needs\". The report detailed four hospital admissions between 2020 and 2022 and multiple contacts with community teams before he was discharged to his GP because of a lack of interaction with mental health services. It also found Calocane was allowed to avoid taking long-lasting antipsychotic medication as he did not like needles, and did not consider himself to have a mental health condition."

The \"Good Character\" guidance for immigration staff has been changed to say people who have arrived in the UK illegally \"having made a dangerous journey... will normally be refused citizenship\" from 10 February, regardless of when they arrived. It says a dangerous journey includes \"but is not limited to, travelling by small boat or concealed in a vehicle or other conveyance\". Politics latest: Justice secretary announces reforms to probation service The guidance clarifies this does not include arriving as a passenger on a commercial airline. Previously, refugees who arrived by irregular routes had to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship.

It is also the second highest figure since records began in 2018. Some Labour MPs and the Refugee Council have condemned the latest guidance as they say it will mean refugees can live in the UK but will not be allowed to have a place in society. Labour MP Stella Creasy said on X the guidance \"should be changed asap\". \"If we give someone refugee status, it can't be right to then refuse them route to become a British citizen,\" she wrote. \"To say they can have a home in our country, but never a place in our society and be forever second class.\" Read more:Palestinian family allowed to remain in UK after applying through Ukrainian refugee schemeLabour suspends 11 councillors over WhatsApp scandal The Refugee Council said the change \"flies in the face of reason\" and said the British public want refugees in the UK \"to integrate and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers\". \"We urge ministers to urgently reconsider,\" Enver Solomon, CEO of the NGO said. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"There are already rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. \"This policy guidance further strengthens measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.\"  Labour's manifesto promised to \"smash the gangs\", with the government creating a Border Security Command and introducing new powers for authorities to prevent people smugglers from travelling, stop mobile phone use and shut down bank accounts. On Monday, the second reading of the government's Border, Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill was passed with an overwhelming majority. The bill officially scraps the Conservatives' plan to send illegal immigrants to Rwanda and provides the legal backing to boost police powers against people smugglers. The Conservatives have not yet responded to the new guidance but leader Kemi Badenoch last week said she would toughen up citizenship rules to make it more difficult for new immigrants to be able to permanently settle in the UK."

        "Content": "\n          Science and Technology reporter\n       World leaders and tech bros descended on Paris this week, with some determined to show a united stance on artificial intelligence.Â  But at the end of the two-day summit, the UK and the US walked away empty-handed, having refused to sign a global declaration on AI. Earlier on Tuesday, US vice president JD Vance told his audience in Paris that too much regulation could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and Donald Trump has already signed an executive order removing rules imposed by Joe Biden. But for the UK, the declaration did go far enough. \"The declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance and [didn't] sufficiently address harder questions around national security,\" said a UK government spokesperson.  So what is the UK government so concerned everyone is missing? Aside from taking jobs and stealing data, there are other existential threats to worry about, according to Carsten Jung, the head of AI at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). \n                  Has Elon Musk just put OpenAI in a tricky situation?\n                 \n                  In China's Silicon Valley, where founder of DeepSeek Liang Wenfeng keeps a low profile\n                 \n                  Musk v Altman: The battle to become king of AI\n                 He listed the ways AI can be dangerous, from enabling hackers to break into computer systems to losing control of AI bots that \"run wild\" on the internet to even helping terrorists to create bioweapons. \"This isn't science fiction,\" he said. One scientist in Paris warned the people most at risk of unregulated AI are those with the least to do with it. \"For a lot of us, we're on our phones all the time and we want that to be less,\" said Dr Jen Schradie, an associate professor at Sciences Po University who sits on the International Panel on the Information Environment. \"But for a lot of people who don't have regular, consistent [internet] access or have the skills and even the time to post content, those voices are left out of everything.\" They are left out of the data sets fed into AI, as well as the solutions proposed by it, to workforces, healthcare and more, according to Dr Schradie.

Just two months after it launched, ChatGPT was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing app in history. A global phenomenon needs a global solution, according to Mr Jung. \"If we all race ahead and try to come first as fast as possible and are not jointly managing the risks, bad things can happen,\" he said."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Beavers can help tackle Britain's rising flooding problems, according to a government-sponsored report, as the political debate over whether to reintroduce them continues. The review found that boosting natural infrastructure like animal habitats, forests, sand dunes, and mudflats, can play a \"major role\" in protecting people from flooding, by slowing and absorbing the flow of water. The Environment Agency said it is \"mainstreaming\" the use of natural protections against flooding, alongside the use of engineered defences, backed by Â£25m in funding. For the first time its guidance, last updated in 2017, included an assessment of the role beavers, oyster reefs, and underwater seagrass and kelp can play in protecting against floods and coastal erosion. It found the beavers - which engineer the ecosystem through building dams and channels - can reduce peak flows, increase groundwater storage, trap sediment, connect up floodplains, support other wildlife and store carbon. But it says more evidence is needed on the number of dams and how to manage the semi-aquatic mammals. They were hunted to extinction in Britain around 400 years ago, but have recently made a limited comeback, through trial schemes, escapes from enclosures, and illegal releases. Their formal reintroduction has bounced up and down the agenda as ministers and governments have come and gone.  The first trial in the UK was hailed a success when it concluded in 2009, and the animals were allowed to stay put in Argyll, Scotland. In 2021, Boris Johnson as the prime minister promised to \"build back beaver\". But then-environment secretary Therese Coffey later dropped the issue over \"other priorities\". Kitty Thompson from the Conservative Environment Network said: \"Despite progress behind the scenes, this unsteady outward attitude towards species reintroductions has been a shame.\" A licensing system would be a \"win\" for nature, she said, and for farmers by providing guidance if the rodents create problems. The new Labour government, elected last summer on a mandate to protect the environment, is yet to issue a formal strategy or licences for wild releases, despite mounting evidence and pressure. In January, Downing Street blocked such plans because some Labour aides viewed it as a \"Tory Legacy\", The Guardian reported. At the time, The Wildlife Trusts called it \"extremely frustrating that wild beaver licences have been blocked\". Today, a spokesperson for the environment said they are \"working closely with Natural England to review options on species reintroduction, including beavers\". Six in ten people in the UK back beaver reintroduction, according to polling in January by More in Common, including voters from all parties. Conservation charities have lobbied the government to bring back beavers as soon as possible. However, fears have been raised about their potential impact on other species, while farmers have concerns about damage to their land and crops. Dr Owen Middleton, from conservation consultancy Biodiversify, said: \"As the UK faces increasingly frequent and severe flooding, it's heartening to see the government embracing nature-based solutions.\" Flood defences created by beavers are faster and cheaper than human interventions, he said. The UK's climate has been getting wetter in recent decades, especially in winter, and is expected to get wetter still under climate change, according to the Met Office, raising the risk of flooding. The climate and nature crises have renewed interest in natural ways to protect people and the environment. The review also found tree-planting, pioneered to help combat climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide, also tackles flooding by slowing the flow of water, while saltmarshes and mudflats protect coastal areas from storms."

Mr Boyajian, an Armenian-American, has owned Diamond Straws since 1995. His factory produces more than 800 straws a minute, supplying large US cafes and restaurants, including Peet's Coffee and BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. Diamond Straws currently employs 15 people but is anticipating an uptick in business in the wake of President Trump's executive order declaring that the US is \"going back to plastic straws\" and moving away from paper straws. \"It was one of our happiest days when I heard him say that,\" says Mr Boyajian. \"Our whole business completely switched. Previously everybody was worrying about 'what are you doing in this business, you're going to be out of business because nobody is buying plastic straws'. So thank you, Trump.\" Cardboard boxes emblazoned with \"made in USA\" are stacked around the factory. It is just one of a handful of factories remaining in the US manufacturing plastic straws after much of the industry moved abroad to China. Mr Trump has repeatedly railed against paper straws. His 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws. His executive order will reverse a Biden administration policy to phase out government purchases of plastic straws, as well as plastic cutlery and packaging by 2027. Environmentalists have long been concerned about the use of plastic straws, although they say the issue is much bigger than straws alone.

The London borough had an estimated 417 outlets for every 100,000 people living there in 2024, data from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) found. That is more than double its total in 2017, when the survey was last compiled. Neighbouring Westminster is second with 248, followed by Blackpool and Southwark, one of five London local authority areas in the top 10. Manchester completed the top five. Hackney in east London saw the number of outlets rise by more than a third to 166, climbing from 58th place to ninth and Liverpool also entered the top 10, with 175 per 100,000. Bury, which led the previous survey with 256, dropped to 10th place last year, while Wokingham in Berkshire still has the fewest outlets, with 39, and Hartlepool (138) and Darlington (145) also saw large declines. The data takes in a range of shops selling foods including, but not limited to, burgers, pizza, kebabs, chicken, Indian takeaways, Chinese takeaways, and fish and chips. Deprived areas have more than twice the number (147) of fast food outlets per population than the least deprived areas (73), the analysis showed.

        "Headline": "Bridget Jones's Diary saw Renee Zellweger nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of a single, female 30-something looking for love. Now, three decades and multiple films later, she's back. Will Bridget have the same appeal in 2025 as she did in 2001?",
        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  A \"verbally incontinent spinster, who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother\" - not an auspicious introduction to Bridget Rose Jones, but accurate. On paper, it doesn't sound like the dream role, but RenÃ©e Zellweger disagrees, telling Sky News: \"It's the best job in the world to step into her shoes for a while\". Three decades after the character came to life on the page, and following a trio of earlier films, Zellweger has returned to \"this just endearing character\" for a fourth movie, Mad About The Boy. With returning characters including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, new relationships are also introduced, with Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor joining the cast. Zellweger goes on: \"I love her. I love her humour. I love her vulnerability. I love her imperfection. I love the opportunity to play out her miscalculating a plan and it maybe, surprising her in her execution. I love all of it.\" The first film earned Zellweger an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Bridget, and the character's name has gone into the lexicon. Mad About The Boy director Michael Morris - the first male director to step into the franchise - told Sky News: \"When you see Bridget, you realize how many, how few characters there are in film that are just unapologetically human. It's weird. There should be moreâ€¦ \n                  Bridget Jones: A heroine of our time or an absolute disgrace?\n                 \n                  Golden Globes 2025: The full list of nominees\n                 \n                  Hugh Grant settles court case against The Sun's publisher 'for enormous sum of money'\n                 \"She looks the way she looks when she gets up. She's late for school. She drops things when she shouldn't drop them. She makes the wrong speech when she needs to give the right speech. And all of those things make you just fall in love with her.\" Read more: Bridget Jones: A heroine of our time or an absolute disgrace? After years of soul-searching, her creator, Helen Fielding, has decided the key to Bridget's appeal lies in her revealing \"the gap between how you feel you are supposed to be and how you really are inside.\" Fielding's anonymous columns for The Independent, first published in 1995, were a word-of-mouth hit. The four subsequent books were bestsellers. Produced by Working Title - the production company behind British hits including Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually and Notting Hill - the first film took more than $280m (Â£225m) worldwide. Studio bosses will be hoping Mad About The Boy will work a similar magic, and with ticket pre-sales proving bigger than Barbie, it's looking promising.  Digging down into Bridget's enduring appeal, Angela McRobbie, Professor of Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths University of London, told Sky News the character's timely merging of political and popular culture sent out a positive message to young women in the 90s and early 2000s. \"The figure of Bridget Jones, both in writing and then in film represented a new kind of young woman who had been to university, who knew her Jane Austen, and who knew a little bit about feminism. \"There was a sense in which the knowledge of feminism haunted the Bridget Jones phenomena, but in a way that she wanted to discard it and put it in the past. \"She wanted to be feminine. She wanted to be sexy. She wanted to [wear a] Playboy bunny outfit. And in her dream landscape, she imagined a white wedding with lots of kids in the Home Counties. There was a sense in which what the column and then the film did was offered a kind of release from the burden of being feminist\". She says Bridget wearing a see-through shirt and miniskirt into the office was her way of saying: \"We have to live with sexual inequality, it's not such a bad thing. I want to be a real girl. I want to enjoy my sexuality if it gets me the attention I want from the boss\". McRobbie goes on: \"In some ways, you could say she was legitimising a kind of sexual inequality in the workplace, but in a fun, light-hearted way.\" Emotional intelligence coach and Bridget Jones fan Miriam Bross told Sky News she can see why Bridget has been described as \"feminist Marmite\". \"I think one of the reasons why people react strongly to her is because she was turned into an icon. She was supposed to be the woman of the 90sâ€¦ \"That's when you get this polarisation where you feel like you have to either be in favour of Bridget or not. But actually, she's such a complex character that there's something for everybody. \"She was this single woman who had fun. Yes, she ends up with a man in the end. But that isn't the main part. The main part is that she is successful. Even though she makes mistakes, she is a normal weight and is still chased by men. \"Why Bridget still lives on is because she gave people the main message - be yourself and you're going to be okay.\" Bross also says that Bridget helped prove that a film focused on the female experience could be as successful as a male-led movie. \"In the 80s, rom coms were all about neurotic men finding loveâ€¦ The female leads in them had very little to say.\" A case in point is Julia Roberts's actress heroine in Notting Hill - as Bross says - \"her silence is so normalised that Ronan Keating wrote the song When You Say Nothing At All celebrating her silence\". But then in comes Bridget: \"She talks. She has voiceovers. We see her thoughts. It's about her. It's not just about her and love, it's about her in her job, we see her working. We see her making mistakes. We see her.\" Bross goes on: \"Who doesn't like to see themselves represented on film? Representation matters very much. And here was this flawed woman who got the guy in the end.\" Both McRobbie and Bross say they will be watching Mad About The Boy. But is it the same old Bridget we'll see in the new film? With a very different tone to previous instalments, can fans look forward to the dollop of nostalgia they're likely craving? As McRobbie rightly notes, the experience of the Gen Z audience watching the movie today is very different to that of their predecessors. \"It's a much tougher world than it was certainly in the early 2000s and even in the second film. Young women have to deal with toxic masculinity, and they have to navigate their way through sexuality and they're much more aware of sexual violence.\" It begs the question, will Bridget have the same appeal in 2025 as she did in 2001? Bross says she still has much to offer: \"This character is like an old friend. So even if she's not entirely up to date, you will still love herâ€¦ \"When people are stressed, when they're anxious, they turn to the familiar. People do need something soothing. They need narratives that help them calm down in stressful times.\" Meanwhile, Zellweger promises Bridget will still exhibit all the qualities that have made her beloved worldwide. \"I think it's just a continuation of these authentic representations of a person's experience and different life chapters. \"It feels like the essence of the person is the same and her very familiar optimism, her vulnerability and her sweetness and her humour, all that's the same.\" Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy is in cinemas now."

        "Headline": "It won awards at Cannes last year and several Golden Globes at the start of 2025. But as Emilia Perez became an Oscars and BAFTAs frontrunner and its profile grew, so did the criticism - and scrutiny of its themes and stars.",
        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n At the start of awards season, Emilia Perez looked like it could come away as one of this year's big success stories. First there was a slew of gongs at the Golden Globes, including best comedy or musical film, and then came the Oscar nominations - it leads the race with 13 nods, and broke the record to become the most nominated non-English language film in the history of the awards. At the BAFTAs this weekend, it is shortlisted for 11 prizes; just pipped by papal thriller Conclave, which has 12. And star Karla Sofia Gascon has made history as a trans woman nominated for best actress at both ceremonies. Set in Mexico but mostly filmed in France, Emilia Perez is an operatic Spanish-language musical which tells the story of a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirmation surgery. In May last year, it won the Cannes Film Festival jury prize, setting it on its trajectory to 2025 awards season success. The film's acknowledgement seemingly reflected the more progressive attitudes of voters in recent years - but as its profile rose, so did the scrutiny. US LGBTQ+ advocacy and cultural change group GLAAD has described Emilia Perez as a \"step backward for trans representation\", and highlighted reviews by transgender critics who \"understand how inauthentic portrayals of trans people are offensive and even dangerous\". The film has also come under fire for stereotypical depictions of Mexico and an apparent minimal inclusion of Mexican people among the main cast and crew. Of its main stars, Gascon is Spanish, US actress Zoe Saldana is of Dominican Republic and Puerto Rican descent, and Selena Gomez is American, though her father was of Mexican descent. Adriana Paz is Mexican. In a post on X in January viewed more than 2.7m times, Mexican screenwriter HÃ©ctor GuillÃ©n shared a mock-up poster saying: \"Mexico hates Emilia PÃ©rez/ Racist Euro Centrist Mockery/ Almost 500K dead and France decides to do a musical/ No Mexicans in their cast or crew.\" While stories about \"narco\" crime in Latin America have long been depicted on screen, Emilia Perez has been particularly criticised for its handling of the subject. Since 2006, a bloody war between Mexican authorities and the drug cartels has raged, claiming the lives of more than 400,000 people, according to government data. More than 100,000 have gone missing. Read more:Mexico: Women at warThe city ravaged by a brutal and deadly drugs gang war  Offensive? Or a 'crazy marvel'? General audiences appear to have made their thoughts clear. On film database site IMDB, Emilia Perez gets 5.5 out of 10, while its nine competitors in the running for best picture at the Oscars rate between 7.3, for The Substance, and 8.8 for I'm Still Here. On review site Rotten Tomatoes, Emilia Perez gets a 72% from critics, but just 17% from audiences; again, the rest of its Oscars competitors range from Wicked's 88% critics' score to I'm Still Here's 96%, or Nickel Boy's 65% audience score to I'm Still Here's 99%. The two takeways? The gap is clear whichever way you look at it; watch I'm Still Here. That's not to say Emilia Perez does not have its supporters. Speaking after a screening in October, Oscar-winning Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said it was \"so beautiful to see a movie that is cinema\", and hailed director Jacques Audiard as \"one of the most amazing filmmakers alive\". A review in US entertainment outlet Deadline in May during Cannes last year was headlined, \"Jacques Audiard's musical is crazy, but also a marvel\", with the writer saying the \"sparkle never outshines the essential seriousness of the subject\". In Variety, another US entertainment publication, the headline praised Gascon's electrifying performance. Paz, who shared the Cannes best actress prize with her co-stars last year, has questioned the criticism about the film being \"offensive\" to Mexico, saying: \"I really want to know why, because I didn't feel that way.\" Carlos Aguilar, a film critic originally from Mexico City who writes for the Roger Ebert film website, was generally positive in his review, giving the film three out of four stars. However, he highlights that Emilia Perez is \"not a Mexican film\" and notes \"Mexican audiences have grown accustomed to American perspectives exploiting narco-related afflictions for narratives unconcerned with addressing its root causes\". Questioning intentions behind these productions is valid, he says, \"but to decry Audiard for partaking in the common filmmaking practice of telling stories away from what's immediately familiar to him would seem an overly simplistic assessment\". Karla Sofia Gascon's resurfaced tweets But the criticism from some trans people and some Mexicans is not a good look for a supposedly progressive film about a trans woman in Mexico. All publicity is good publicity does not apply here. A lot of this criticism, though, had been made before the Oscar and BAFTA nominations. Emilia Perez was still riding high at that point. The nail in the coffin came after those nominations were announced, when offensive tweets posted by Gascon were unearthed. They were old, but not that old; the first dated back to 2016, but some were more recent. In the since-deleted posts, Gascon took aim at Muslims' dress, language and culture in her native Spain and suggested Islam should be banned. And less than a month after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in 2020, which prompted a global reckoning about police brutality and racism, Gascon called Floyd a drug addict who \"very few people ever cared\" for. Writer Sarah Hagi, who screenshotted the posts and shared them, wrote: \"This is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh. Gascon, who was a regular in Mexican telenovelas before transitioning in 2018, issued an apology after the posts emerged, saying that \"as someone in a marginalised community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\". She added: \"All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\" 'This is an opera, not a criticism of Mexico' At the London Critics' Circle Awards earlier this month, Gascon's co-star Saldana called for people to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\" and to keep \"minds and your hearts open, always\". But it looks like the damage has been done. While Saldana is still favourite to win best supporting actress at both the BAFTAs and the Oscars, and the film may win gongs for its music and maybe technical accolades, it seems the momentum for taking home any bigger prizes has gone. As the backlash intensified, Audiard gave an interview to Deadline last week. He said he had not been in touch with Gascon and that he was \"very sad\" to see the issue \"taking up all the space\" around the film. What she said in her tweets was \"inexcusable\", he added. Read more:Oscars 2025: The full list of nomineesBAFTAs 2025: The full list of nominees The filmmaker also addressed criticism about representation of cartels and drug crime, saying: \"Opera has psychological limitations. It seems I'm being attacked in the court of realism.\" Audiard said he never claimed to have made a \"realistic\" work or a documentary. \"For example, I read a review where it said that night markets in Mexico City don't have photocopiers. Well, in night markets in Mexico City, one also doesn't sing and dance. You have to accept that is part of the magic here. This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico.\" Finally, asked if he had any regrets or if there was anything he would do differently, he said the one regret was that the film was not made in Mexico. \"And the simple reason for that is that the film funding, the public funding for film in Mexico was not as good for us as what was available to us in France\". Emilia Perez now heads to the BAFTAs and Oscars embroiled in controversy. But it is not the first. Remember British star Angela Riseborough's nomination in 2023? Some, like Green Book in 2019, weathered it out to win. And Will Smith won his Oscar just moments after slapgate in 2022. We'll see at the BAFTAs on Sunday and at the Oscars next month, how forgiving voters will be about Emilia Perez."

On Sunday the US rapper bought a Super Bowl advert which directed people to his website, which featured nothing but a single white T-shirt with a swastika on the front alongside the code \"HH-01\" - which the Anti-Defamation League (ADF) said was code for \"Heil Hitler\". The ADF described the shirt, which was on sale for $20 (Â£16) as \"further proof\" of West's antisemitism. The e-commerce platform Spotify, which hosts many online shops and businesses, later deactivated his site. In an emailed statement to Sky News' partner network NBC News, Shopify said: \"All merchants are responsible for following the rules of our platform. This merchant did not engage in authentic commerce practices and violated our terms so we removed them from Shopify.\" Antisemitic online posts In recent days West posted antisemitic messages on X, as well as \"I love Hitler\" and \"I'm a Nazi\". His account then had a \"sensitive content warning\" added before he deactivated it on Monday. His spokesperson Milo Yiannopoulos said: \"Ye is an intergenerational artist and icon who continues to redefine the limits of creativity and free expression. He has deactivated his X account for the time being.\" The Campaign Against Antisemitism was joined by Friends star David Schwimmer, who features in the AI video, in calling for Elon Musk to remove West from X over a string of offensive posts."

        "Content": "A$AP Rocky will not give evidence at his trial over allegations he fired a gun at a former friend and collaborator. In court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, the 36-year-old rapper was asked by Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold if he had discussed the issue with his lawyers. \"Absolutely, your honour,\" Rocky replied, saying he would invoke America's Fifth Amendment right to silence. \"I want my right not to testify.\" The star's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, previously said he was \"eager to tell his story\" and would \"love the opportunity to do so\", but putting a defendant through a potentially long cross-examination can often be risky in criminal cases. Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, a former friend and member of the A$AP crew of collaborators they were part of at school in New York. Ephron gave evidence earlier in the trial, saying their friendship had broken down and a feud allegedly came to a head on an evening in November 2021. At the start of the trial, jurors were shown surveillance videos that prosecutors argue make it clear Rocky fired a gun at Ephron outside a parking garage in Hollywood. However, Mr Tacopina said in his defence opening statement that the gun was not real, but rather a starter pistol carried as a prop. Ephron has been driven by \"jealousy, lies and greed\", he told the court. 'Non-lethal form of self-defence' On Monday, Rocky's tour manager Lou Levin became the second witness from his inner circle to testify that he carried a fake gun for security. The star's house had previously been broken into by a stalker and others, he said, so he told him it made sense to carry it. \"Security and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Mr Levin told the court. \"It's just a non-lethal form of self-defence.\" The gun had come from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, he said, about three months before the night in question. The defence has said it does not have the starter pistol now. The authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege was used. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. Ahead of the trial, he turned down a plea deal that could have led to a 180-day jail sentence, in exchange for a guilty plea on one count. He faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted. The defence has now rested its case, with closing arguments from both sides expected later this week. A Grammy-nominated music star, actor and fashion mogul, Rocky is the partner of pop superstar Rihanna, and the couple have two young sons. Rihanna has attended court on several days to show support."

Dorsey says his son, now nine, told him he was worried about getting into the water - and that Rivera had said, \"don't be silly!\". \"Something he's said over and over is that he was trying to find a life raft, and there was a rope, but there was a big spider on the rope, and he was too scared to throw it,\" Dorsey told People. \"I keep reassuring him, buddy, that rope wasn't going to be long enough.'\" Dorsey added: \"It just rocks my world that he had to witness her last moments.\" The actor says he found out that Rivera was first missing after receiving a call from her stepfather - while he was in a supermarket buying food for a friend's barbeque. \"I collapsed into a pallet of drinks,\" Dorsey said. \"I feared the worst.\" Dorsey said he immediately got into his car and drove 145 miles to Lake Piru, where Rivera and their son had been swimming. \"I drove 100-and-Â­something the whole way with my four-way hazards on, chain-smoking cigarettes - and I don't even smoke, really - and just crying,\" he says. \"I just wanted to get to Josey. \"If we'd have lost both Naya and Josey, I don't know how I would continue on with my life.\" He added: \"When it happened, I just found myself shaking my head, like, I can't believe she's gone. It's still so surreal every day.\" Read more on Sky News:A$AP Rocky not giving evidence at gun trialRuPaul star had 'unnatural' death Dorsey says the holiday period is particularly tough for his nine-year-old son. He said: \"We made this book of memories for Josey that sits by his bed, and during the holidays he was crying looking at it. \"You can only give him a hug and tell him, 'I know, life is not fair. Bad things happen and there's no reason for it, and you just have to do your best to be a good person.'\" In 2022, a lawsuit filed by Rivera's family against Ventura County, California, over her drowning was privately settled. The lawsuit for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress was filed on behalf of her son. The family also sued the United Water Conservation District and Parks and Recreation Management, accusing them of failing to warn visitors of the danger of boating and swimming in the lake, and saying Rivera's death was \"utterly preventable\". They said the rented pontoon boat was not equipped with flotation or lifesaving devices, a ladder, rope, anchor, or any equipment designed to keep swimmers from being separated from their boat. However, Ventura County officials said the death wasn't their fault, and said the actress had declined to wear a life jacket. They said the rental agent had put the life jacket in the boat nevertheless."

        "Content": "Further investigation is needed into the death of RuPaul's Drag Race star The Vivienne, a coroner has said, after postmortem testing revealed an \"unnatural\" cause. The body of James Lee Williams, who performed as the drag queen, was found at their home in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on Sunday 5 January. Cheshire Coroner's Court in Warrington opened an inquest at a short hearing on Wednesday. Williams, 32, was found in their bathroom, the court heard. Police attended and confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances. Coroner's officer Amanda Edgar said postmortem testing had taken place and identified \"an unnatural cause of death\". Williams was identified by their father, the court heard. Area coroner Victoria Davies said: \"Given the unnatural cause of death identified on postmortem testing it is appropriate for me to formally open the inquest into the death of James Lee Williams.\" Further investigations are required, she said, and the case was adjourned for a full inquest, set for 30 June. Williams, who grew up in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, before moving to Liverpool, won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK and came third in the 2023 edition of Dancing On Ice. Their drag name came from their love of legendary British designer Vivienne Westwood. RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage was among those who paid tribute after news of their death emerged, saying she was \"utterly heartbroken\" by the news. RuPaul said the world had lost an \"incredibly talented queen and a lovely human being\".

Williams also performed as the Wicked Witch of the West in a tour of The Wizard Of Oz musical across the UK and Ireland, and reprised the role in the West End in 2024. They were due to be back on stage this month as the Childcatcher in a tour of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, a role they first portrayed last year."

        "Content": "A light-hearted petition has been launched in Denmark to buy the state of California after Donald Trump said he wanted to take over Greenland. The petition, which promises to \"bring hygge to Hollywood\", asks: \"Have you ever looked at a map and thought: 'You know what Denmark needs? More sunshine, palm trees, and roller skates?' \"Well, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make that dream a reality.\" The petition's website claimed more than 200,000 people had signed it by Wednesday lunchtime, although it is not clear how long it has been running. The petition adds: \"It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation, so California will become New Denmark.\" Under their scheme, Disneyland will be renamed \"Hans Christian Andersenland\". \"Mickey Mouse in a Viking helmet? Yes, please,\" the petition said. Promising to send \"Lego executives and the cast of Borgen\" to make the deal, the petition to turn Los Angeles into \"LÃ¸s Ã…ngeles\" adds that \"rule of law, universal health care, and fact-based politics might apply\".  Of course, every petition needs some fine print, and it can be found way down at the bottom: \"Disclaimer: This campaign is 100% real... in our dreams.\" There's also a financial target of \"one trillion dollars (give or take a few billion)\". According to the site, that means \"just 200,000 kroner (Â£22,335) from every Dane\". During his first term as US president, Mr Trump discussed the possibility of claiming Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous Danish territory, and a vast and mineral-rich Arctic island In 2019, he scrapped a trip to Denmark over Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's \"nasty\" response to his idea, and a full-scale diplomatic row developed over the issue. Before taking office for his second White House term, Mr Trump said he would not rule out using military force to seize control of the island, calling it vital to US national security. At a joint news conference in Copenhagen last month, Ms Frederiksen and Mute B Egede, Greenland's Prime Minister, rejected the plan. Mr Egede said: \"Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic.\" Read more on Sky News:Man may buy waste dump to recover Bitcoin fortuneMonkey 'caused nationwide power outage'Daffodil hunt launched The US President's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, visited Greenland last month and told citizens: \"We're going to treat you well.\""
