        "Content": " David Lammy has confirmed there will be an independent investigation into the accidental release of a migrant jailed for sex offences, as he blamed \"human error\" for the incident. The deputy prime minister and justice secretary told MPs he was \"livid\" on behalf of Hadush Kebatu's victims and he would be deported back to Ethiopia \"as quickly as possible\". Politics latest: Epping MP calls on Lammy to commit to closing the Bell Hotel Kebatu, who was found guilty in September of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, was freed in error from HMP Chelmsford in Essex on Friday instead of being handed over to immigration officials for deportation. His accidental release sparked widespread alarm and a manhunt that resulted in him being found and arrested by the Metropolitan Police in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8.30am on Sunday. The incident has sparked questions over how the man, whose crimes sparked protests in Epping over the use of asylum hotels, was able to be freed. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Lammy said the mistake should not have happened as he sought to lay part of the blame on to the Conservatives over the state of the prison system over the past 14 years. He said \"there must and there will be accountability\" for the mistaken release of Kebatu from prison. \"I've been clear from the outset that a mistake of this nature is unacceptable,\" he said. \"We must get to the bottom of what happened and take immediate action to try and prevent similar releases in error to protect the public from harm.\" Mr Lammy said he ordered an \"urgent review\" into the checks that take place when an offender is released from prison, and new safeguards have been added that amount to the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\". The justice secretary said the investigation would be led by former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, who also used to lead the National Crime Agency.  He also said the investigation would have the same status as high-profile probes into other prison incidents, including the attack on three prison officers at HMP Franklin in April of this year and the escape of Daniel Khalife from HMP Wandsworth in 2023. 'Calamity Lammy' Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick referred to a report by Sky News which detailed how a witness present at the prison observed Kebatu appearing \"confused\" upon his release. The witness said Kebatu had in fact tried to go back into the prison several times, but was instead guided to Chelmsford station, where he caught a train to London. Mr Jenrick claimed the case was proof \"the only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK\". \"Dear oh dear,\" he said. \"Where to begin? This justice secretary could not deport the only small boat migrant who wanted - no - who tried to be deported. \"Having been mistakenly released, Hadush Kebatu came back to prison asking to be deported not once, not twice, but five times, but he was turned away.\" He went on: \"The only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK. \"His officials, briefing the press, called it the mother of all - yeah, they're not wrong, are they?\" Read more:Reform UK's Zia Yusuf defends MP accused of 'racism'A colossal repair job is desperately needed after Kebatu debacle Mr Jenrick, who served as immigration minister under the previous Conservative government, branded his opposite number \"calamity Lammy\". \"It's a national embarrassment and today the justice secretary feigns anger at what happened.\" Continuing with his attack, Mr Jenrick asked Mr Lammy whether he would resign if Kebatu was not deported \"by the end of the week\" - to which he received no reply. But asked later by an MP whether he was considering his position, Mr Lammy replied: \"A ridiculous question, the answer is no.\" The new checks announced by Mr Lammy on Monday involve five pages of instructions and require more senior prison staff to sign off a release, according to documents obtained by Sky News. The instructions are effective from Monday."

        "Content": " The King has been heckled over his brother Prince Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a visit to a cathedral. The monarch was shouted at by a man in the crowd outside Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire, who asked: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\" The protester, who was filming on a mobile phone, also said: \"Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?\" The King did not respond to the comments. The crowd appeared to turn on the person shouting at the monarch, with one telling him to \"shut up\". Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, said he believed the heckler was \"one of our own members but doing their own thing\". He said: \"The royals need to be challenged, and if the politicians won't do the job and the police won't investigate, then more and more members of the public will be asking tough questions. \n                  No charges over images of Trump and Epstein projected onto Windsor Castle during president's visit\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew: Government faces growing calls to formally strip Duke of York title\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew allegations should be examined in 'proper and fullest ways', palace source says\n                 \"We want to see broadcasters invite Charles into a studio and ask him the same questions.\" Andrew under increasing pressure Pressure has been rapidly increasing on the King's sibling, who announced earlier this month he would stop using his Duke of York title and his knighthood, after revelations in the posthumous memoir of his sex assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The prince has always strenuously denied all allegations against him from Ms Giuffre. Reports also emerged that claimed Prince Andrew asked a royal close protection officer to \"dig up dirt\" on the late Ms Giuffre. As a result of these new allegations, the Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively looking into the claims\". Calls to revoke dukedom There are growing calls for his dukedom to be formally revoked, which can only be done by an act of parliament, and for him to give up his 30-room Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park after it emerged he paid a peppercorn (nominal) rent for more than 20 years. Andrew has been hit with criticism focused on the property he has lived in effectively rent-free since 2003. Obstacles to a settlement are reportedly where Andrew, who is eighth in line to the throne, will live and what financial recompense he will receive for the funds he spent renovating the home. After the visit to the cathedral, the King laid flowers at the UK's first national memorial commemorating LGBT armed forces. He was joined by dozens of serving and former members of the armed forces, as he met veterans who told of the trauma inflicted by the military's former \"gay ban\". The memorial, titled An Opened Letter, was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum."

        "Content": "The alleged stalker of Madeleine McCann's family had a \"genuine belief\" she was the missing girl, a court heard. Julia Wandelt, 24, from Lubin, south-west Poland, denied claiming to be Madeleine for attention or financial gain on Monday. She told the trial that she is still questioning her identity now. Wandelt says she \"could only remember abuse\" after experiences with her step-grandfather, adding she \"could not be able to heal from my trauma if I never fully know who I am\". Prosecutors accuse Wandelt of peddling the myth she was Madeleine, who went missing aged three on holiday in Portugal, in 2007, by sending emails, making phone calls and turning up at the address of parents Kate and Gerry McCann. Madeleine McCann trial latest She says she self-harmed and attempted to take her own life after she was abused by the step-grandfather. Wandelt told the court her father told her, in 2022, that the man who abused her had \"been involved in kidnapping\", so she searched databases for missing people. After being asked if anyone matched her, she replied: \"There were not actually a lot of people my age or around my age, but that is how I found Madeleine.\" Asked about her motivation, she added: \"I just wanted to find out who I am. I could not be able to heal from my trauma if I never fully know who I am, what happened to me and if my parents are my parents.\" 'I think I could be Maddie' Tom Price KC, for the defence, said the defendant had a \"genuine and honestly held belief she is Madeleine McCann\". The court heard she emailed the parents of the missing girl, on 24 June, 2022, a message that read: \"Hello I'm writing you because I think I could be Madeleine McCann, the reason why I think I could be Maddie. \"One, I saw the pictures when I was younger, I had the mark on my eye, it's a little faded now.\" She then goes on to give a number of reasons as to why she believes she may be the missing girl. This includes that her \"documents\" might be faked and she may be younger, that her parents would not show her her birth certificate and that she lacks memories before she was nine.  She added that a talk with a psychologist made her question her life. 'I realised I only remember abuse' Wandelt told jurors, \"she made me reflect on my life more and think about everything that happened. I realised I only remember abuse. My friends, they could remember things\". She continued: \"I started with asking questions because I just could not believe there was nothing else in the story of what happened to me. \"I started asking my parents about everything. What are your blood groups? Is there anything else happened to me you don't tell me about?\" Asked if she still questions her identity, she replied: \"Yes, I do.\" 'I didn't expect them to refuse' She claims her parents, who she alleges refused a DNA test, had a different appearance from her, with dark hair and eyes. Wandelt said: \"It made me feel a bit surprised because I didn't expect them to refuse, especially because at that time I still dealt with a lot of emotional problems.\" Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau, Cardiff, both deny one count of stalking between June 2022 and February this year. The trial continues."

        "Content": "By Jenness Mitchell, Scotland reporter, and Connor Gillies, Scotland correspondent   Members of a Romanian grooming gang have been jailed for raping and sexually exploiting 10 vulnerable women in Dundee. Four men and one woman were found guilty in January of dozens of offences - including rape - following an investigation into sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and the supply of drugs in the Tayside area. The gang plied their victims with drugs, including crack cocaine, at various properties between June 2021 and September 2022. Some of those who were preyed upon became addicted to the illicit substances, leading them to be blackmailed into unwanted sexual activity. Mircea Marian Cumpanasoiu, 38, Remus Stan, 35, Catalin Dobre, 45, Cristian Urlateanu, 41, and Alexandra Bugonea, 35, denied any wrongdoing but were convicted following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Scott said the gang \"deflected, minimised, denied and lied\" about their offending. He told them: \"It may be that you thought that no one cared for your victims, meaning you could do whatever you wanted to them without consequence. If so, events have proved you wrong. \"Each of the women who gave evidence against you found the strength to do so despite their difficulties.\" The judge said the women had taken \"significant steps\" to move on from that stage in their lives. He added: \"I commend them for having taken back control of their lives to the extent that they've been able to do that and for being able to testify about the abuse they suffered at your hands.\" Returning to the dock on Monday, ringleader Cumpanasoiu was handed a 24-year extended sentence, with 20 years in jail and four years on licence once released back into the community. Stan was sentenced to 12 years in jail; Dobre was sentenced to 10 years in jail; Urlateanu was handed a 20-year extended sentence, with 18 years in jail and two years on licence; and Bugonea was sentenced to eight years in jail. Lord Scott told the gang it would be a matter for the Home Office, but it was likely they would be deported on the completion of their sentences. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts are with the victims and survivors who have shown immense bravery throughout their pursuit of justice. \"We will do everything in our power to deport these vile individuals.\" 'The criminals were prowling the streets of Dundee' Speaking to Sky News, the boss of a charity that aims to tackle modern slavery said the case was \"particularly shocking\" as the victims were \"handpicked because of their vulnerabilities\". James Clarry, chief executive of Justice and Care, added: \"The criminals were prowling the streets of Dundee looking for women who matched the conditions that they knew would make them particularly vulnerable, and then off the back of that, exploited them sexually on a sustained and brutal basis.\" Detective Inspector Scott Carswell called the offenders \"deplorable\". He told Sky News the gang supplied the women with alcohol and free Class A drugs at parties, before coercing them into sexual activity, \"which a lot of them didn't want to do\". \"They were so addicted to the drugs that they knew the only way they could get the drugs was to perform the sexual acts that they were having to get involved in,\" he said. DI Carswell said the gang got the women addicted in a bid to control them and keep them coming back for more. He added: \"They've had no thought as to the impact this is having on the victims. It's been quite controlled in that they knew what they were doing.\" Police Scotland said the offenders were arrested and charged as part of Operation Recloir, launched in late 2021 to target a gang of suspected human traffickers in the Tayside area. Officers uncovered evidence of serious sexual offending, prostitution, drug supply and trafficking during their enquiries. 'Groomed and used' DI Carswell said the inquiry initially focused on brothel-keeping in Dundee and the suspected trafficking of Romanian women into the country. \"However, into the summer of 2022 we started to receive information that the crime group were targeting vulnerable Dundee females,\" he added. \"And it looked like they were grooming them and coercing them with gifts of free drugs and other things until it moved on to the victims having to get involved in sexual activity to get the free drugs. \"Unfortunately, this got them addicted to the Class A drugs that had been provided.\" DI Carswell said many of the victims believed they were the girlfriends of the men involved and did not realise they were being \"groomed and used\". He said the women were looking to be \"cared for\", noting: \"I believe that the end goal here was to groom the females and possibly move them into prostitution.\" Following the arrest of suspects Cumpanasoiu and Stan, their co-accused Urlateanu and Bugonea were located in Belgium and extradited. Dobre was traced in the Czech Republic and brought back to Scotland for the trial, which lasted six weeks. 'Smirking, winking pimp' The offences took place at various locations in Dundee, including properties on Bright Street, Gellatly Street and Perth Road. Cumpanasoiu, also known as \"Mario\", was described in court as a \"smirking, winking pimp\" who funded his lifestyle and drug habit from prostitution. He was found guilty of 15 charges, including running brothels and 10 counts of rape. Cumpanasoiu also supplied drugs to multiple women and was involved in sexual coercion. The court heard how he trafficked one vulnerable woman into prostitution by convincing her she stood to make large sums of money. The brothel-keeper then advertised her services online and drove her to meet clients before taking a portion of her earnings. Cumpanasoiu earlier pleaded guilty to a further three charges - attempting to pervert the course of justice, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and possession of a knife. Urlateanu was found guilty of nine charges, including rape, assault, living off the earnings of prostitution and the supply of cocaine. At the time of the offending, he lived with his partner and co-accused Bugonea, who was working as a sex worker. The court heard how he used the money given to him by Bugonea to fund his crack cocaine habit and pay household bills. One victim told the trial how she was lured to a flat in Bright Street, where she described there being an unlimited supply of crack cocaine and whisky. Games such as spin the bottle and truth or dare were often played, where clothing was removed while Urlateanu asked questions of a sexual nature. He went on to forcibly rape the woman in a bedroom. Urlateanu and Bugonea were also both found guilty of raping the same woman together on various occasions at the flat. Stan was found guilty of eight charges, including trafficking a woman into prostitution with his co-accused Cumpanasoiu. The predator supplied the victim with drugs and decided what prices she should charge clients, all while making her think he was her boyfriend. He was convicted of raping the woman on several occasions, including one incident where he attacked her alongside Cumpanasoiu. Stan was additionally found guilty of raping a further two women. Dobre, also known as \"Luigi\", was found guilty of five charges, including the gang rape of one woman alongside Urlateanu and Stan. He was further convicted of attempted rape, sexual coercion and sexual assault. Bugonea was convicted of five charges. This included providing drugs to multiple women, sexual coercion, rape and sexual assault by penetration. In addition to the jail sentences, the gang members were also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely. Stan was separately handed a five-year Trafficking and Exploitation Prevention Order (TEPO). Fiona Kirkby, procurator fiscal for high court sexual offences, said: \"This gang ruthlessly exploited vulnerable women for their own gain, without any regard for the suffering and trauma they caused. \"Urlateanu, Bugonea and Dobre's attempts to escape justice by fleeing abroad failed when police found and returned them to Scotland to await trial.\" Ms Kirby branded the crimes \"reprehensible\" as she praised the courage of the victims in speaking out. She added: \"Thanks to their bravery, and the support given to them by charity organisations and justice partners, this prosecution was made possible, ensuring other women and girls are protected from these offenders.\""

        "Content": "Brendan Rodgers has resigned as manager of Celtic, the club have announced. The champions had made a disappointing start to their Scottish Premiership campaign, trailing leaders Hearts by eight points after nine games. The club said in a statement on Monday evening, the Northern Irishman had resigned from his role. They added that former boss Martin O'Neill, along with ex-Celtic star Shaun Maloney, will take over on an interim basis. 'Process to appoint a new permanent manager is under way' A statement read: \"Celtic Football Club can confirm that football manager Brendan Rodgers has today tendered his resignation. It has been accepted by the club and Brendan will leave his role with immediate effect. \"The club appreciates Brendan's contribution to Celtic during his two very successful periods at the club. \"Brendan leaves Celtic with our thanks for the role he has played during a period of continued success for the club and we wish him further success in the future. \"The process to appoint a new permanent manager is under way and the club will update supporters further on this as soon as possible. \"We are pleased that during this interim period, former Celtic manager, Martin O'Neill and former Celtic player, Shaun Maloney have agreed to take charge of Celtic first-team matters. Further details will be confirmed shortly.\" Celtic suffered a 3-1 defeat away to Hearts on Sunday. They will play Falkirk next at home on Wednesday evening. There had been growing discontent among Celtic fans this season over a perceived lack of investment in the squad. In response to the transfer window, Rodgers had said: \"There's no way you'll go into a race and be given the keys to a Honda Civic and say 'I want you to drive it like a Ferrari'. It's not going to happen.\" Following the resignation, Celtic's principal shareholder, Dermot Desmond, released a statement branding the former Liverpool boss as \"toxic\". 'Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false' Mr Desmond said: \"In June, both Michael Nicholson (chief executive) and I expressed to Brendan that we were keen to offer him a contract extension, to reaffirm the club's full backing and long-term commitment to him. \"He said he would need to think about it and revert. Yet in subsequent press conferences, Brendan implied that the club had made no commitment to offer him a contract. That was simply untrue. \"Every player signed and every player sold during his tenure was done so with Brendan's full knowledge, approval, and endorsement. Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false. \"His later public statements about transfers and club operations came entirely out of the blue. At no point prior to those remarks had he raised any such concerns with me, Michael, or any member of the board or executive team. \"In reality, he was given final say over all football matters and was consistently backed in the recruitment process - including record investment in players he personally identified and approved.\" 'Misleading and self-serving' He added: \"Regrettably, his words and actions since then have been divisive, misleading, and self-serving. \"They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\" Rodgers, who returned for his second spell in 2023, had also been under increasing pressure over results. They crashed out of Champions League qualifying with a shock defeat to Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty in August. Rodgers' first spell at Parkhead ran from May 2016 to February 2019 before leaving for Premier League side Leicester City. In his first season, Celtic finished with a record 106 points and became the first Scottish side to complete a top-flight season undefeated since 1899."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  US warships in the region, the green light for covert operations, and deadly strikes on what the Trump administration claims are \"narco terrorists\" - could America's next move be to strike Venezuela? President Donald Trump has accused President Nicolas Maduro of leading an organised crime gang (without providing evidence) and declined to answer when questioned if the CIA has the authority to assassinate him. In return, the Venezuelan leader has accused Mr Trump of seeking regime change and of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country, as he appealed to the American people for peace. The rhetoric coming out of the White House, coupled with the presence of military ships in the region, has raised questions about a possible armed conflict between the US and Venezuela. The question in the air is: Will the US actually attack Venezuela? What are US warships doing? The docking of the USS Gravely guided missile destroyer in the capital of Trinidad and Tobago - just 25 miles from the coast of Venezuela - is the latest incident to escalate tensions. Venezuela's government condemned the arrival and called it a provocation by Trinidad and Tobago and the US. The USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier - the largest warship in the world - is also moving closer to Venezuela. It comes as the US has acknowledged carrying out at least seven strikes since September on vessels near Venezuela that it claims were transporting drugs, killing at least 32 people. Venezuela's government says the strikes are illegal, amount to murder, and are acts of aggression. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations - including lethal operations - in Venezuela. The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, with actions varying widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint. What could happen? To get an idea of what could happen next, Sky News spoke to Dr Carlos Solar, an expert on Latin American security at the RUSI defence thinktank. He says the level of military strategy the US is applying around Venezuela seems \"unproportionate\" for the task of tackling drug trafficking. \"A build-up this size can only suggest there's a strategic military goal,\" he added. Dr Solar says the role of the CIA is \"not surprising\", as the US often deploys spying capabilities in countries deemed adversarial. \"With the chances of a military conflict looming, having the most intelligence capable on the ground would be reasonable.\" Asked what could happen next, Dr Solar told Sky News: \"One scenario is Trump authorises a round of long-range precision attacks in Venezuela's territory linked to drug trafficking operations, eventually forcing Maduro to reciprocate later. \"We saw this early in the year when the US attacked Iran's nuclear facilitates and Tehran returned missiles to US bases in Qatar. \"If the US decides to move more strongly, destroying all critical military targets from the Venezuelan forces, then the US could have Maduro surrender and leave the country immediately. \"This would be the least disruptive without causing greater destabilisation of the country.\"  What does Trump say about Venezuela? Trump said his reasons for the strikes on vessels were the migration of Venezuelans, allegedly including former prisoners, to the US - and drug trafficking. \"I authorised for two reasons really,\" he said. \"Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America...they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,\" he told reporters. \"And the other thing are drugs.\" He has accused Venezuela of trafficking huge amounts of cocaine into the US, and alleged Mr Maduro is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang - a claim most of his own intelligence agencies do not support. The US leader has not provided evidence for the claim about prisoners, and Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay pointed out the fentanyl drug that is causing destruction in America is largely manufactured in Mexico, not Venezuela. \"We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" Mr Trump added. It is not clear what actions this could entail. The Pentagon recently disclosed to US Congress that the president has determined the US is engaged in \"a non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. When asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, which would be a massive intervention, Trump declined to answer. Instead, he said: \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\" Read more:Venezuela opposition leader wins Nobel Peace PrizeTrump may have another motive in escalation of war on drugs What does Venezuela's leader say? Maduro has been in power since 2013, including re-elections in contests marred by accusations of fraud. The last decade has seen his country gripped by spiralling hyperinflation and a humanitarian crisis that has seen an estimated eight million Venezuelans flee the country. As the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier moved closer to Venezuela, Maduro accused the US government of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war that we will avoid,\" he said in a national address. \"They are fabricating an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one,\" he added, perhaps a reference to Trump's claim that he is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang and that his country trafficks cocaine into the US. \"Venezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves.\" Tren de Aragua, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but instead for its involvement in contract killings, extortion, and people smuggling. Venezuela has raised a complaint to the UN Security Council and demanded accountability from the US."

        "Headline": "Justice secretary is labelled \"calamity Lammy' by his shadow Robert Jenrick - who says he must resign if Hadush Kebatu is not deported this week.",
        "Content": " David Lammy has confirmed there will be an independent investigation into the accidental release of a migrant jailed for sex offences, as he blamed \"human error\" for the incident. The deputy prime minister and justice secretary told MPs he was \"livid\" on behalf of Hadush Kebatu's victims and he would be deported back to Ethiopia \"as quickly as possible\". Politics latest: Epping MP calls on Lammy to commit to closing the Bell Hotel Kebatu, who was found guilty in September of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, was freed in error from HMP Chelmsford in Essex on Friday instead of being handed over to immigration officials for deportation. His accidental release sparked widespread alarm and a manhunt that resulted in him being found and arrested by the Metropolitan Police in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8.30am on Sunday. The incident has sparked questions over how the man, whose crimes sparked protests in Epping over the use of asylum hotels, was able to be freed. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Lammy said the mistake should not have happened as he sought to lay part of the blame on to the Conservatives over the state of the prison system over the past 14 years. He said \"there must and there will be accountability\" for the mistaken release of Kebatu from prison. \"I've been clear from the outset that a mistake of this nature is unacceptable,\" he said. \"We must get to the bottom of what happened and take immediate action to try and prevent similar releases in error to protect the public from harm.\" Mr Lammy said he ordered an \"urgent review\" into the checks that take place when an offender is released from prison, and new safeguards have been added that amount to the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\". The justice secretary said the investigation would be led by former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, who also used to lead the National Crime Agency.  He also said the investigation would have the same status as high-profile probes into other prison incidents, including the attack on three prison officers at HMP Franklin in April of this year and the escape of Daniel Khalife from HMP Wandsworth in 2023. 'Calamity Lammy' Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick referred to a report by Sky News which detailed how a witness present at the prison observed Kebatu appearing \"confused\" upon his release. The witness said Kebatu had in fact tried to go back into the prison several times, but was instead guided to Chelmsford station, where he caught a train to London. Mr Jenrick claimed the case was proof \"the only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK\". \"Dear oh dear,\" he said. \"Where to begin? This justice secretary could not deport the only small boat migrant who wanted - no - who tried to be deported. \"Having been mistakenly released, Hadush Kebatu came back to prison asking to be deported not once, not twice, but five times, but he was turned away.\" He went on: \"The only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK. \"His officials, briefing the press, called it the mother of all - yeah, they're not wrong, are they?\" Read more:Reform UK's Zia Yusuf defends MP accused of 'racism'A colossal repair job is desperately needed after Kebatu debacle Mr Jenrick, who served as immigration minister under the previous Conservative government, branded his opposite number \"calamity Lammy\". \"It's a national embarrassment and today the justice secretary feigns anger at what happened.\" Continuing with his attack, Mr Jenrick asked Mr Lammy whether he would resign if Kebatu was not deported \"by the end of the week\" - to which he received no reply. But asked later by an MP whether he was considering his position, Mr Lammy replied: \"A ridiculous question, the answer is no.\" The new checks announced by Mr Lammy on Monday involve five pages of instructions and require more senior prison staff to sign off a release, according to documents obtained by Sky News. The instructions are effective from Monday."

        "Content": " The King has been heckled over his brother Prince Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a visit to a cathedral. The monarch was shouted at by a man in the crowd outside Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire, who asked: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\" The protester, who was filming on a mobile phone, also said: \"Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?\" The King did not respond to the comments. The crowd appeared to turn on the person shouting at the monarch, with one telling him to \"shut up\". Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, said he believed the heckler was \"one of our own members but doing their own thing\". He said: \"The royals need to be challenged, and if the politicians won't do the job and the police won't investigate, then more and more members of the public will be asking tough questions. \n                  No charges over images of Trump and Epstein projected onto Windsor Castle during president's visit\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew: Government faces growing calls to formally strip Duke of York title\n                 \n                  Prince Andrew allegations should be examined in 'proper and fullest ways', palace source says\n                 \"We want to see broadcasters invite Charles into a studio and ask him the same questions.\" Andrew under increasing pressure Pressure has been rapidly increasing on the King's sibling, who announced earlier this month he would stop using his Duke of York title and his knighthood, after revelations in the posthumous memoir of his sex assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The prince has always strenuously denied all allegations against him from Ms Giuffre. Reports also emerged that claimed Prince Andrew asked a royal close protection officer to \"dig up dirt\" on the late Ms Giuffre. As a result of these new allegations, the Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively looking into the claims\". Calls to revoke dukedom There are growing calls for his dukedom to be formally revoked, which can only be done by an act of parliament, and for him to give up his 30-room Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park after it emerged he paid a peppercorn (nominal) rent for more than 20 years. Andrew has been hit with criticism focused on the property he has lived in effectively rent-free since 2003. Obstacles to a settlement are reportedly where Andrew, who is eighth in line to the throne, will live and what financial recompense he will receive for the funds he spent renovating the home. After the visit to the cathedral, the King laid flowers at the UK's first national memorial commemorating LGBT armed forces. He was joined by dozens of serving and former members of the armed forces, as he met veterans who told of the trauma inflicted by the military's former \"gay ban\". The memorial, titled An Opened Letter, was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum."

        "Content": "The alleged stalker of Madeleine McCann's family had a \"genuine belief\" she was the missing girl, a court heard. Julia Wandelt, 24, from Lubin, south-west Poland, denied claiming to be Madeleine for attention or financial gain on Monday. She told the trial that she is still questioning her identity now. Wandelt says she \"could only remember abuse\" after experiences with her step-grandfather, adding she \"could not be able to heal from my trauma if I never fully know who I am\". Prosecutors accuse Wandelt of peddling the myth she was Madeleine, who went missing aged three on holiday in Portugal, in 2007, by sending emails, making phone calls and turning up at the address of parents Kate and Gerry McCann. Madeleine McCann trial latest She says she self-harmed and attempted to take her own life after she was abused by the step-grandfather. Wandelt told the court her father told her, in 2022, that the man who abused her had \"been involved in kidnapping\", so she searched databases for missing people. After being asked if anyone matched her, she replied: \"There were not actually a lot of people my age or around my age, but that is how I found Madeleine.\" Asked about her motivation, she added: \"I just wanted to find out who I am. I could not be able to heal from my trauma if I never fully know who I am, what happened to me and if my parents are my parents.\" 'I think I could be Maddie' Tom Price KC, for the defence, said the defendant had a \"genuine and honestly held belief she is Madeleine McCann\". The court heard she emailed the parents of the missing girl, on 24 June, 2022, a message that read: \"Hello I'm writing you because I think I could be Madeleine McCann, the reason why I think I could be Maddie. \"One, I saw the pictures when I was younger, I had the mark on my eye, it's a little faded now.\" She then goes on to give a number of reasons as to why she believes she may be the missing girl. This includes that her \"documents\" might be faked and she may be younger, that her parents would not show her her birth certificate and that she lacks memories before she was nine.  She added that a talk with a psychologist made her question her life. 'I realised I only remember abuse' Wandelt told jurors, \"she made me reflect on my life more and think about everything that happened. I realised I only remember abuse. My friends, they could remember things\". She continued: \"I started with asking questions because I just could not believe there was nothing else in the story of what happened to me. \"I started asking my parents about everything. What are your blood groups? Is there anything else happened to me you don't tell me about?\" Asked if she still questions her identity, she replied: \"Yes, I do.\" 'I didn't expect them to refuse' She claims her parents, who she alleges refused a DNA test, had a different appearance from her, with dark hair and eyes. Wandelt said: \"It made me feel a bit surprised because I didn't expect them to refuse, especially because at that time I still dealt with a lot of emotional problems.\" Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau, Cardiff, both deny one count of stalking between June 2022 and February this year. The trial continues."

        "Content": "By Jenness Mitchell, Scotland reporter, and Connor Gillies, Scotland correspondent   Members of a Romanian grooming gang have been jailed for raping and sexually exploiting 10 vulnerable women in Dundee. Four men and one woman were found guilty in January of dozens of offences - including rape - following an investigation into sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and the supply of drugs in the Tayside area. The gang plied their victims with drugs, including crack cocaine, at various properties between June 2021 and September 2022. Some of those who were preyed upon became addicted to the illicit substances, leading them to be blackmailed into unwanted sexual activity. Mircea Marian Cumpanasoiu, 38, Remus Stan, 35, Catalin Dobre, 45, Cristian Urlateanu, 41, and Alexandra Bugonea, 35, denied any wrongdoing but were convicted following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Scott said the gang \"deflected, minimised, denied and lied\" about their offending. He told them: \"It may be that you thought that no one cared for your victims, meaning you could do whatever you wanted to them without consequence. If so, events have proved you wrong. \"Each of the women who gave evidence against you found the strength to do so despite their difficulties.\" The judge said the women had taken \"significant steps\" to move on from that stage in their lives. He added: \"I commend them for having taken back control of their lives to the extent that they've been able to do that and for being able to testify about the abuse they suffered at your hands.\" Returning to the dock on Monday, ringleader Cumpanasoiu was handed a 24-year extended sentence, with 20 years in jail and four years on licence once released back into the community. Stan was sentenced to 12 years in jail; Dobre was sentenced to 10 years in jail; Urlateanu was handed a 20-year extended sentence, with 18 years in jail and two years on licence; and Bugonea was sentenced to eight years in jail. Lord Scott told the gang it would be a matter for the Home Office, but it was likely they would be deported on the completion of their sentences. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts are with the victims and survivors who have shown immense bravery throughout their pursuit of justice. \"We will do everything in our power to deport these vile individuals.\" 'The criminals were prowling the streets of Dundee' Speaking to Sky News, the boss of a charity that aims to tackle modern slavery said the case was \"particularly shocking\" as the victims were \"handpicked because of their vulnerabilities\". James Clarry, chief executive of Justice and Care, added: \"The criminals were prowling the streets of Dundee looking for women who matched the conditions that they knew would make them particularly vulnerable, and then off the back of that, exploited them sexually on a sustained and brutal basis.\" Detective Inspector Scott Carswell called the offenders \"deplorable\". He told Sky News the gang supplied the women with alcohol and free Class A drugs at parties, before coercing them into sexual activity, \"which a lot of them didn't want to do\". \"They were so addicted to the drugs that they knew the only way they could get the drugs was to perform the sexual acts that they were having to get involved in,\" he said. DI Carswell said the gang got the women addicted in a bid to control them and keep them coming back for more. He added: \"They've had no thought as to the impact this is having on the victims. It's been quite controlled in that they knew what they were doing.\" Police Scotland said the offenders were arrested and charged as part of Operation Recloir, launched in late 2021 to target a gang of suspected human traffickers in the Tayside area. Officers uncovered evidence of serious sexual offending, prostitution, drug supply and trafficking during their enquiries. 'Groomed and used' DI Carswell said the inquiry initially focused on brothel-keeping in Dundee and the suspected trafficking of Romanian women into the country. \"However, into the summer of 2022 we started to receive information that the crime group were targeting vulnerable Dundee females,\" he added. \"And it looked like they were grooming them and coercing them with gifts of free drugs and other things until it moved on to the victims having to get involved in sexual activity to get the free drugs. \"Unfortunately, this got them addicted to the Class A drugs that had been provided.\" DI Carswell said many of the victims believed they were the girlfriends of the men involved and did not realise they were being \"groomed and used\". He said the women were looking to be \"cared for\", noting: \"I believe that the end goal here was to groom the females and possibly move them into prostitution.\" Following the arrest of suspects Cumpanasoiu and Stan, their co-accused Urlateanu and Bugonea were located in Belgium and extradited. Dobre was traced in the Czech Republic and brought back to Scotland for the trial, which lasted six weeks. 'Smirking, winking pimp' The offences took place at various locations in Dundee, including properties on Bright Street, Gellatly Street and Perth Road. Cumpanasoiu, also known as \"Mario\", was described in court as a \"smirking, winking pimp\" who funded his lifestyle and drug habit from prostitution. He was found guilty of 15 charges, including running brothels and 10 counts of rape. Cumpanasoiu also supplied drugs to multiple women and was involved in sexual coercion. The court heard how he trafficked one vulnerable woman into prostitution by convincing her she stood to make large sums of money. The brothel-keeper then advertised her services online and drove her to meet clients before taking a portion of her earnings. Cumpanasoiu earlier pleaded guilty to a further three charges - attempting to pervert the course of justice, knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and possession of a knife. Urlateanu was found guilty of nine charges, including rape, assault, living off the earnings of prostitution and the supply of cocaine. At the time of the offending, he lived with his partner and co-accused Bugonea, who was working as a sex worker. The court heard how he used the money given to him by Bugonea to fund his crack cocaine habit and pay household bills. One victim told the trial how she was lured to a flat in Bright Street, where she described there being an unlimited supply of crack cocaine and whisky. Games such as spin the bottle and truth or dare were often played, where clothing was removed while Urlateanu asked questions of a sexual nature. He went on to forcibly rape the woman in a bedroom. Urlateanu and Bugonea were also both found guilty of raping the same woman together on various occasions at the flat. Stan was found guilty of eight charges, including trafficking a woman into prostitution with his co-accused Cumpanasoiu. The predator supplied the victim with drugs and decided what prices she should charge clients, all while making her think he was her boyfriend. He was convicted of raping the woman on several occasions, including one incident where he attacked her alongside Cumpanasoiu. Stan was additionally found guilty of raping a further two women. Dobre, also known as \"Luigi\", was found guilty of five charges, including the gang rape of one woman alongside Urlateanu and Stan. He was further convicted of attempted rape, sexual coercion and sexual assault. Bugonea was convicted of five charges. This included providing drugs to multiple women, sexual coercion, rape and sexual assault by penetration. In addition to the jail sentences, the gang members were also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely. Stan was separately handed a five-year Trafficking and Exploitation Prevention Order (TEPO). Fiona Kirkby, procurator fiscal for high court sexual offences, said: \"This gang ruthlessly exploited vulnerable women for their own gain, without any regard for the suffering and trauma they caused. \"Urlateanu, Bugonea and Dobre's attempts to escape justice by fleeing abroad failed when police found and returned them to Scotland to await trial.\" Ms Kirby branded the crimes \"reprehensible\" as she praised the courage of the victims in speaking out. She added: \"Thanks to their bravery, and the support given to them by charity organisations and justice partners, this prosecution was made possible, ensuring other women and girls are protected from these offenders.\""

        "Content": "By Duncan Gardham, security journalist  A care plan for the Southport killer that warned he could be \"cold and calculating\" and was \"angry\" when things went wrong was watered down, the inquiry into the murders has heard. Repeated references to Axel Rudakubana's \"perceived sense of injustice\" were removed and replaced after discussions with his parents, the hearing was told. The inquiry also heard that Rudakubana did not attend school for two years, but when the school attempted to remove him from the roll, his family objected saying it would affect their benefits. Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July last year by Rudakubana, then aged 17. He was jailed in January for a minimum of 52 years. The inquiry, sitting at Liverpool Town Hall, was shown edits to Rudakubana's education health and care plan (EHCP) designed to deal with his autism spectrum disorder. One note saying Rudakubana \"does not like perceived injustice\" from 6 May 2021 was deleted and replaced by: \"Axel has a good sense of right and wrong, but requires support to work through scenarios where an injustice may have occurred.\" A report from The Acorns School in March 2020 stating that Rudakubana was \"unable to let go of any form of perceived injustice\" was also deleted. 'Sinister, inappropriate' behaviour The original report also stated: \"There are concerns of occasions where Axel would say and do things which have been described as sinister, inappropriate.\" That sentence was deleted along with a line which stated: \"Axel can also appear to be cold and calculating.\" Another line that Rudakubana can have difficulty managing when things go wrong and \"then becomes very angry\" was also deleted. Nicholas Moss KC, for the inquiry, asked Kate Dixon, of the Department for Education: \"Some critical analysis might point towards the fact that during that same time as the EHCP was being formulated, there was a parent-led process by which information about the risk to others was being watered down. \"Do you know if anything has so far been done in terms of considering the need to ensure that information about risk to others is not inappropriately edited out of EHCPs?\" Ms Dixon said: \"There are other parts of the process and system where that risk should be should be written down and transferred.\" The inquiry was told that Presfield School, a specialist school for children with autism, agreed to take Rudakubana on as a pupil after he spent two years at The Acorns' temporary pupil referral unit. They were aware he had been excluded from Range High School, Formby, for taking a knife into class, but did not access his records about incidents at The Acorns.

Father's benefit 'entitlement' concern Despite repeated attempts to get Rudakubana to turn up by getting him to come in to play basketball or eat pizza, his attendance was only 0.7%. Ms McLoughlin tried to visit him at home several times, but told the inquiry: \"Quite often, I couldn't get in the house.\" Two years after enrolling, Rudakubana was notified that they were removing him from the school roll. His father appealed the decision, saying it would \"affect the family financially, because it would impact their entitlement to benefits\", the hearing was told. The inquiry continues."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A key witness in the failed prosecution of two men accused of spying for China said he was \"surprised\" the case had collapsed, given he had said Beijing posed a range of threats. Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser, also told a parliamentary hearing on Monday that he had been \"disappointed\" at the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service in September to drop the legal proceedings. Yet the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, appearing before the same committee of MPs and peers, said an inability by Mr Collins specifically to describe the Chinese state as a national security threat was a \"fatal\" blow to their case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. Mr Parkinson similarly said he had been \"disappointed and frustrated\" at the collapse of the high-profile trial. But he claimed his team of prosecutors had tried every avenue and concluded that a successful prosecution would not be possible. Despite the strong defence of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision, members of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy appeared visibly bemused about why the trial was derailed, given the evidence available of the threat posed by China.

I was somewhat surprised that the intention was to drop the case,\" he said. Appearing separately, though, Mr Parkinson explained that his team \"weren't quite there\" when it came to establishing that Beijing posed a threat to the UK's national security between 2021 and 2023 when the alleged offences took place. He said he had thought it would be easy to obtain in writing from Mr Collins a statement about the threat that met the threshold to be able to bring the case to trial. Fourteen months of waiting - then a 'no' But the director of public prosecutions said this proved to be a \"sticking point\" and after 14 months of waiting for a reply from him, it came back as \"no\". \"It took quite a lot of effort on our part to try to get the answer,\" he told the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. \"What you could not do as a prosecutor is tell people what to say.\" Asked whether he felt disappointed at the failure to prosecute the case, Mr Parkinson said: \"We did feel disappointed and frustrated.\" Tom Little KC, first senior treasury council, who was a key prosecutor involved in the case, said the inability of Mr Collins to state in his witness statement that China was a threat to national security during the relevant period brought the case to a \"crashing halt\". Read more on Sky News:Romanian grooming gang jailed24 hours in Ukraine's kill zonePresident re-elected aged 92 However, Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser and a member of the committee, pointed out that Mr Collins, who once worked for him, was only able to reflect government policy, which sees China as posing security threats but also economic opportunities. He asked Mr Parkinson why prosecutors did not seek other witnesses, such as former intelligence chiefs who could clearly state as fact that China posed a threat to national security. Mr Little and Mr Parkinson, however, said in their judgement that the inability of Mr Collins to make that statement would have derailed the case. Mr Cash and Mr Berry have always denied any wrongdoing."

Neighbours witnessed plumes of smoke and heard loud bangs coming from Harry Whittaker's makeshift laboratory in the garden of the home he shared with his mother, the Old Bailey was told. Whittaker's stash of explosives was uncovered by police after the 33-year-old dialled 999 asking for medical help for a life-threatening allergic reaction last April at the address in the Bedfordshire village of Caddington, near Luton. Whittaker has now been convicted of two charges of possession of explosive substances and two charges of making them on or before 6 May last year. At his trial, the jury, which deliberated for eight hours and 53 minutes, cleared the defendant of two further charges of possessing explosives. Following his conviction, Paul Goddard, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Whittaker's thoughtless actions put not only his own safety at risk - but that of his family and neighbours, too.\" The court had heard how paramedics went to the defendant's home after they were alerted to a possible anaphylactic shock. Whittaker told them he had been carrying out experiments with chemicals in his laboratory and took them to his shed. He said a window had broken on the shed after an explosion from one of his experiments, the court was told. The medics reported their concerns to the police, who searched the Caddington address on 6 May 2024. What was discovered? Prosecutor Emily Dummett outlined the explosive substances found in Whittaker's bedroom and shed, which included: black powder; blank and a round of live ammunition; chemicals; lethal poisons; and suspected improvised explosive devices. Police also found radioactive materials and white phosphorus, a substance which can spontaneously ignite in air and is so dangerous that it had to be destroyed by controlled explosion by the military, the court was told. After his arrest, police uncovered a stream of racist chat on WhatsApp in which Whittaker vented hate towards a Luton mosque.

The defendant, who has autism spectrum disorder, also told police that he used heroin in the evenings, but it did not affect him. Giving evidence in his trial, Whittaker denied having any previous convictions relating to his chemistry experiments or any racially aggravated public order offences. Under cross-examination, he accepted that he did have one previous conviction for causing actual bodily harm, which he admitted at Luton Crown Court in 2020. The charge related to an incident in 2019 in which his mother and a neighbour had attempted to stop him from reversing out of his driveway while he was experiencing drug withdrawal symptoms. Whittaker had admitted a charge under the Poisons Act and having ammunition without a licence. Judge Simon Mayo KC remanded Whittaker into custody and adjourned sentencing until 9 January."

        "Content": "Brendan Rodgers has resigned as manager of Celtic, the club have announced. The champions had made a disappointing start to their Scottish Premiership campaign, trailing leaders Hearts by eight points after nine games. The club said in a statement on Monday evening, the Northern Irishman had resigned from his role. They added that former boss Martin O'Neill, along with ex-Celtic star Shaun Maloney, will take over on an interim basis. 'Process to appoint a new permanent manager is under way' A statement read: \"Celtic Football Club can confirm that football manager Brendan Rodgers has today tendered his resignation. It has been accepted by the club and Brendan will leave his role with immediate effect. \"The club appreciates Brendan's contribution to Celtic during his two very successful periods at the club. \"Brendan leaves Celtic with our thanks for the role he has played during a period of continued success for the club and we wish him further success in the future. \"The process to appoint a new permanent manager is under way and the club will update supporters further on this as soon as possible. \"We are pleased that during this interim period, former Celtic manager, Martin O'Neill and former Celtic player, Shaun Maloney have agreed to take charge of Celtic first-team matters. Further details will be confirmed shortly.\" Celtic suffered a 3-1 defeat away to Hearts on Sunday. They will play Falkirk next at home on Wednesday evening. There had been growing discontent among Celtic fans this season over a perceived lack of investment in the squad. In response to the transfer window, Rodgers had said: \"There's no way you'll go into a race and be given the keys to a Honda Civic and say 'I want you to drive it like a Ferrari'. It's not going to happen.\" Following the resignation, Celtic's principal shareholder, Dermot Desmond, released a statement branding the former Liverpool boss as \"toxic\". 'Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false' Mr Desmond said: \"In June, both Michael Nicholson (chief executive) and I expressed to Brendan that we were keen to offer him a contract extension, to reaffirm the club's full backing and long-term commitment to him. \"He said he would need to think about it and revert. Yet in subsequent press conferences, Brendan implied that the club had made no commitment to offer him a contract. That was simply untrue. \"Every player signed and every player sold during his tenure was done so with Brendan's full knowledge, approval, and endorsement. Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false. \"His later public statements about transfers and club operations came entirely out of the blue. At no point prior to those remarks had he raised any such concerns with me, Michael, or any member of the board or executive team. \"In reality, he was given final say over all football matters and was consistently backed in the recruitment process - including record investment in players he personally identified and approved.\" 'Misleading and self-serving' He added: \"Regrettably, his words and actions since then have been divisive, misleading, and self-serving. \"They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\" Rodgers, who returned for his second spell in 2023, had also been under increasing pressure over results. They crashed out of Champions League qualifying with a shock defeat to Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty in August. Rodgers' first spell at Parkhead ran from May 2016 to February 2019 before leaving for Premier League side Leicester City. In his first season, Celtic finished with a record 106 points and became the first Scottish side to complete a top-flight season undefeated since 1899."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  US warships in the region, the green light for covert operations, and deadly strikes on what the Trump administration claims are \"narco terrorists\" - could America's next move be to strike Venezuela? President Donald Trump has accused President Nicolas Maduro of leading an organised crime gang (without providing evidence) and declined to answer when questioned if the CIA has the authority to assassinate him. In return, the Venezuelan leader has accused Mr Trump of seeking regime change and of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country, as he appealed to the American people for peace. The rhetoric coming out of the White House, coupled with the presence of military ships in the region, has raised questions about a possible armed conflict between the US and Venezuela. The question in the air is: Will the US actually attack Venezuela? What are US warships doing? The docking of the USS Gravely guided missile destroyer in the capital of Trinidad and Tobago - just 25 miles from the coast of Venezuela - is the latest incident to escalate tensions. Venezuela's government condemned the arrival and called it a provocation by Trinidad and Tobago and the US. The USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier - the largest warship in the world - is also moving closer to Venezuela. It comes as the US has acknowledged carrying out at least seven strikes since September on vessels near Venezuela that it claims were transporting drugs, killing at least 32 people. Venezuela's government says the strikes are illegal, amount to murder, and are acts of aggression. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations - including lethal operations - in Venezuela. The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, with actions varying widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint. What could happen? To get an idea of what could happen next, Sky News spoke to Dr Carlos Solar, an expert on Latin American security at the RUSI defence thinktank. He says the level of military strategy the US is applying around Venezuela seems \"unproportionate\" for the task of tackling drug trafficking. \"A build-up this size can only suggest there's a strategic military goal,\" he added. Dr Solar says the role of the CIA is \"not surprising\", as the US often deploys spying capabilities in countries deemed adversarial. \"With the chances of a military conflict looming, having the most intelligence capable on the ground would be reasonable.\" Asked what could happen next, Dr Solar told Sky News: \"One scenario is Trump authorises a round of long-range precision attacks in Venezuela's territory linked to drug trafficking operations, eventually forcing Maduro to reciprocate later. \"We saw this early in the year when the US attacked Iran's nuclear facilitates and Tehran returned missiles to US bases in Qatar. \"If the US decides to move more strongly, destroying all critical military targets from the Venezuelan forces, then the US could have Maduro surrender and leave the country immediately. \"This would be the least disruptive without causing greater destabilisation of the country.\"  What does Trump say about Venezuela? Trump said his reasons for the strikes on vessels were the migration of Venezuelans, allegedly including former prisoners, to the US - and drug trafficking. \"I authorised for two reasons really,\" he said. \"Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America...they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,\" he told reporters. \"And the other thing are drugs.\" He has accused Venezuela of trafficking huge amounts of cocaine into the US, and alleged Mr Maduro is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang - a claim most of his own intelligence agencies do not support. The US leader has not provided evidence for the claim about prisoners, and Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay pointed out the fentanyl drug that is causing destruction in America is largely manufactured in Mexico, not Venezuela. \"We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" Mr Trump added. It is not clear what actions this could entail. The Pentagon recently disclosed to US Congress that the president has determined the US is engaged in \"a non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. When asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, which would be a massive intervention, Trump declined to answer. Instead, he said: \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\" Read more:Venezuela opposition leader wins Nobel Peace PrizeTrump may have another motive in escalation of war on drugs What does Venezuela's leader say? Maduro has been in power since 2013, including re-elections in contests marred by accusations of fraud. The last decade has seen his country gripped by spiralling hyperinflation and a humanitarian crisis that has seen an estimated eight million Venezuelans flee the country. As the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier moved closer to Venezuela, Maduro accused the US government of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war that we will avoid,\" he said in a national address. \"They are fabricating an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one,\" he added, perhaps a reference to Trump's claim that he is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang and that his country trafficks cocaine into the US. \"Venezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves.\" Tren de Aragua, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but instead for its involvement in contract killings, extortion, and people smuggling. Venezuela has raised a complaint to the UN Security Council and demanded accountability from the US."

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is aware of small numbers of cases of this strain in Portugal, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the US. It says most of the new cases identified have been in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, a population in which clade Ib mpox transmission has not previously been observed. There are 16 clade Ib cases in the UK to date - all in England and unrelated to transmission within GBMSM (Gay, bisexual and other men-who-have-sex-with-men) community, a spokesperson for the agency said. \"The ways in which we are seeing mpox continue to spread globally is a reminder to come forward for the vaccine, if you are eligible,\" said Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA. The UK has a routine mpox vaccination programme in place for eligible groups, including those who: Although there are no studies on vaccine effectiveness against clade Ib mpox, studies show that the vaccine is around 75 to 80% effective in protecting people against clade II. The UKHSA said that since the last technical assessment on 19 December last year, the \"probability of importation into the UK has increased from medium to high\". The agency said, however, that the risk of onwards transmission in the UK is \"likely to be controlled to some degree by the existing GBMSM vaccination programme and remains low to medium at present\". Mpox is generally a mild infection, and clade Ib and la strains are no longer classified as a high-consequence infectious disease, but it can be severe in some cases, the UKHSA said.

A war that should have taken one week is now in its soon fourth year,\" he said. \"That's what you ought to do, instead of testing missiles.\" A Kremlin spokesperson claimed the missile reflects Moscow's determination to look out for its security interests. \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security,\" Dmitry Peskov said when asked if the missile announcement was a response to tough new US sanctions imposed on Russia and a signal to the West. \"Ensuring security is a vital issue for Russia, especially against the backdrop of the militaristic sentiment that we are currently hearing, primarily from the Europeans,\" he added."

        "Content": "Ten people accused of cyberbullying Brigitte Macron are going on trial in Paris after allegedly making \"malicious\" comments claiming the French first lady is a man. Emmanuel Macron's wife has long been the subject of conspiracy theories saying she was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux (her brother's name), and took the name Brigitte as a transgender woman. Eight men and two women are accused of making posts repeating the claims, as well as others about her sexuality and mentioning the 24-year age gap to her husband as \"paedophilia\". The accused are between 41 and 60 and include a teacher, computer scientist, an elected official, and a woman who presents herself as a medium and advertising executive. The trial, due to begin Monday, is expected to last two days and comes after the Macrons filed a defamation case in the US this summer over conservative influencer Candace Owens repeating the claims. The French president has claimed that taking legal action against Ms Owens was about \"defending his honour\", Mrs Macron and her brother won also another French defamation case last year against two women who were initially ordered to pay damages and a fine. \n                  EU must cut red tape to boost growth, urge major European leaders\n                 \n                  French PM Sebastien Lecornu shelves Emmanuel Macron's pension reform in bid for political survival\n                 \n                  Emmanuel Macron reappoints Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister - four days after he quit\n                 However, the decision was overturned and Mrs Macron and her brother have appealed to France's highest court. The Macrons met at a secondary school where Brigitte was teaching when Emmanuel was 15. They married in 2007 and Mr Macron became president in 2017. Earlier this year, the first lady was caught on camera pushing her husband in the face as he prepared to get off a plane. Mr Macron later said it was a case of \"simply joking with my wife as we often do\".

        "Headline": "A report says uncontacted people are under unprecedented threat from the rest of civilisation, and that they could be wiped out if things do not change.",
        "Content": "The world's almost 200 groups of uncontacted people are suffering from what an indigenous rights organisation calls \"silent genocides\". The tribes, predominantly sharing the Amazon rainforest in the South American nations, live off the land through hunting, fishing and sometimes planting, maintaining ancient languages and traditions. They want nothing that modern society has to offer, living in isolation by choice - yet their ability to continue doing so is under unprecedented threat, according to London based organisation Survival International. Its new report warns 50% of them \"could be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act\". But what are the threats to the uncontacted people, why do they choose to live this way and what can be done to help them? Why do uncontacted people live this way? Survival International's new report estimates there are at least 196 uncontacted indigenous groups in 10 countries - roughly 95% of whom live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Some romanticise them as \"lost tribes\" frozen in time, but the reality is that they are contemporary societies which deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease, according to Fiona Watson, Survival's research and advocacy director. The non-profit says the denial of contact is a clear expression of their autonomy and self-determination. \"They don't need anything from us,\" says Ms Watson, who has worked on indigenous rights for more than three decades. \"They're happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing - essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\" Survival says most are nomadic, moving around their territories as they need, living off the land, building shelters or communal houses, and using their expert botanical knowledge to produce everything they need. When they are thriving, it benefits us too, the charity says, as their way of living protects biodiversity-rich lands - often islands of green in areas of deforestation. What are the threats to uncontacted people? The Survival report says more than 90% of uncontacted peoples face threats from legal and illegal forms of resource extraction, including: • Logging - the felling of trees • Mining • Agribusiness These modern changes lead to the land the uncontacted people live off being torn up, often leaving their food and water sources destroyed and polluted, bringing starvation, trauma and collapse, according to Survival. \"These are what I would call silent genocides - there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they're happening now,\" says Ms Watson. International law requires free, prior and informed consent - known as FPIC - before any activity on indigenous lands, while international treaties give indigenous people the right to self-determination and to remain uncontacted if they choose. But local laws and enforcement of those laws vary widely, and much of the threat to indigenous people comes from drug traffickers and illegal gold miners moving deep into their territories across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Violence and risk of illness Those who intend to capitalise on the uncontacted people's land can use violence to intimidate them, including the use of guns, experts say. But there are some actors who make unwanted contact with the indigenous tribes for social motives. Evangelical missionaries often break local laws to threaten the indigenous people as they seek to convert them, Survival says. In the worst cases, such as with the Ayoreo people in Paraguay, this has led to \"man hunts\" where the people have been captured and killed. These problems go back decades, but a newer phenomenon is that of online influencers attempting to contact the tribes for their content. In March, American YouTuber Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, was arrested after setting foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe. He failed to find them, leaving a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as an \"offering\" for the tribe. Even outsiders who have good intentions risk the tribe's lives by trying to meet them, as they are susceptible to diseases from which they have no immunity. \"Any chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\" Ms Watson says. Dr Subhra Bhattacharjee, an indigenous rights expert based in Germany, says a \"simple cold that you and I recover from in a week\" can kill uncontacted people. Contact can also put outsiders at risk of violence, as the deeply untrusting uncontacted people can use bows and arrows to attack intruders on sight. Last year, two loggers were killed by bow and arrow after allegedly encroaching the land of the uncontacted Mashco Piro indigenous tribe deep in Peru's Amazon. Another incident includes an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach being killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach in 2018. In 2006, the Sentinelese killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore. What do indigenous rights activists want to change? Activists are calling for governments to formally recognise all indigenous territories, making them off-limits to extractive industries. Survival International's report urges a global no-contact policy, which would mean legal recognition of uncontacted territories, suspension of mining, oil and agribusiness projects in or near those lands and prosecution of crimes against indigenous groups. Dr Bhattacharjee says it is crucial to map the approximate territories of uncontacted peoples, but that it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups' health or autonomy. Activists are also calling for corporations and consumers to help stop the flow of money driving destruction, calling for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from indigenous lands. They say it's also crucial that there must be a shift in how the world views uncontacted people, with a need to recognise that they are not relics of the past, but communities with rights, and which play a role in stabilising the global climate."

Mr Trump called the results \"a big win\" for his ally, praising him for \"doing a wonderful job\" as his party's performance exceeded expectations. \"Congratulations to President Javier Milei on his landslide victory in Argentina.

The Trump administration extended a bailout potentially worth $40 billion (£30 billion) to help stabilise Argentina's peso. Mr Trump's support ahead of the vote included a $20 billion currency swap and a proposed $20 billion debt investment facility. As part of its economic assistance to Argentina, Washington is also considering buying Argentine beef to bring down prices in the US. That proposal has angered American cattle ranchers, but Mr Trump has downplayed their concerns. \"We're going to get the price of beef down, and I'm going to make sure the cattle ranchers don't get hurt,\" Mr Trump said. Building momentum nationwide The election results showed Mr Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, winning in parts of the country long dominated by Peronism. In the Buenos Aires province, a traditional Peronist stronghold representing nearly 40% of voters, La Libertad Avanza narrowly won edged out a win Sunday - just a month after the Peronists had defeated Milei's party there by 14 points in local elections. Nationwide, La Libertad Avanza increased its representation in the House of Deputies, the lower chamber of parliament, from 37 to 64 seats out of a total of 127. Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the leading figure in the Peronist opposition, has criticised Trump for influencing the election.

The president has said he expects a cabinet shake-up after the election that could include members of the centrist PRO party, a frequent ally of the government in Congress led by former President Mauricio Macri."

On Sunday, the RSF advanced into the heart of the city and captured the 6th Infantry Division of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in central Al Fashir, after three days of intensified ground battles. In propaganda videos shared on RSF social media channels, their troops waved their assault rifles in the yard of the garrison and celebrated victory in front of a bullet-ridden wall marked with an emblem of the Sudanese military. The RSF claimed to have taken over the city and completed their military control of the Darfur region, where the administration of former US president Joe Biden has accused them of committing genocide. Al Fashir is currently in a telecommunications blackout, an ominous sign that has marked previous takeovers by the paramilitary group. United Nations experts accused the RSF of killing 10,000 to 15,000 people in ethnically motivated attacks in the city of Al Geneina in West Darfur. They were later accused of killing hundreds more months later in rampant ethnic violence as they captured the city. \n                  Hurricane Melissa live: World's strongest storm this year heads towards Jamaica - as 200 Britons 'locked down in hotel'\n                 \n                  Warships, the CIA and potential 'precision attacks' - the US-Venezuela crisis explained\n                 \n                  24 hours in the kill zone: How high-tech drones have transformed Ukraine war\n                 The Sudan Doctors Network is initially reporting from their field teams that the RSF has killed dozens of unarmed civilians in Al Fashir on ethnic grounds in the hours after capturing the army garrison in the city.  Thousands of civilians are still trapped in the city and several sources have told Sky News that negotiations are still ongoing to secure safe passage across political, military and diplomatic channels. After 18 months of his forces fending RSF attacks to capture Al Fashir, the SAF-aligned Governor of Darfur Mini Minnawi shared this post on X on Monday morning: \"The fall of Al Fashir does not mean squandering the future of Darfur in favour of violent groups or the interests of corruption and agents. \"We demand the protection of civilians, the disclosure of the fate of the displaced, and an independent investigation into the violations and massacres carried out by the militia away from prying eyes. Every inch will return to its rightful owners.\" Sudanese army soldiers and civilian resistance fighters had initially denounced the RSF's declaration of full victory and said battles were ongoing to fend off the city's capture. A wedge of military-held territory had remained on the western edge of Al Fashir, where many civilians are now squeezed in as the RSF cements their full control. \"I left because all of the residents and forces have been intensely concentrated in Al-Daraja Owla neighbourhood. It was too much, people started fleeing en masse,\" says aid worker and resident Adam Al Rashid, who left Al Fashir a day before the army garrison was captured.

So many have been killed by gunfire and shelling from battles. It was clear this was coming. The RSF has been advancing on the 6th infantry division for three days.\" Around 5,000 people fled Al Fashir between 23 and 26 October, according to initial assessments by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Videos shared on RSF channels show masses fleeing on foot; some filmed by an RSF surveillance drone scattered across a field and others left in long, sombre queues as RSF soldiers yelled at them from inside their trucks. Other videos show men of fighting age rounded up and kneeling on the ground as RSF troops yell at them \"you are all army\". Sources told Sky News that those fleeing faced mass arrests and extra-judicial killings on their way out. Journalist Muammer Ibrahim is one of those who has been held by RSF fighters as he tried to escape the city. Videos shared on RSF channels show him surrounded by armed men in fatigues as he declares his neutrality. In one video, he is helpless, crouching on the ground as fighters tower over him and urge him to make a statement. \"The RSF now controls Al Fashir in full and has completed their control of Darfur,\" he says under duress. Mr Muammer has bravely reported on the RSF siege of Al Fashir for 18 months, even as his own well-being and safety have been threatened by enforced starvation and daily shelling. Sara Qudah, regional director for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), called Mr Muammer's abduction \"a grave and alarming reminder\" that journalists in Al Fasher are being targeted \"simply for telling the truth\". \"Detaining a journalist who has spent two years documenting the human cost of this war is not only an assault on press freedom in Sudan, it is an attempt to silence an entire city under siege and erase its suffering from the world's conscience,\" she said. In a recent message from his embattled hometown, he told Sky News: \"I hope this tragedy will end soon.\""

Paul Biya, 92, who has been in power since 1982 and could remain there beyond 100, angered the country's youth and opposition with his decision to stand for re-election, with their supporters accusing authorities of seeking to rig the vote. Four protesters were shot dead during clashes with security forces in Douala, the economic capital, on Sunday, while more than 100 were arrested as demonstrators took to the streets to demand credible results from the October 12 presidential election.

Several members of the security forces were also injured in Douala by the protesters, according to Samuel Dieudonne Ivaha Diboua, governor of the Littoral Region that includes Douala. Videos online showed demonstrators clashing with security forces, who fired tear gas and tried to disperse the protesters barricading major roads in Douala and other cities, including Garoua and Maroua in the north. Mr Tchiroma had claimed victory days before the election, citing results he said were collated by his party, but Mr Biya dismissed the claim.

CAIR's deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said Hamdi had previously denied supporting Islamic militants. \"Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticise the Israeli government's genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,\" CAIR said in a statement. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are in contact with the family of a British man detained in the USA and are in touch with the local authorities.\" Since January, the Trump administration has pursued a sweeping crackdown on immigration, including increasing social media vetting, revoking visas for people it claims praised the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and deporting student visa and green card holders who have voiced support for Palestinians and criticised Israel's conduct in the Gaza war.

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n  US warships in the region, the green light for covert operations, and deadly strikes on what the Trump administration claims are \"narco terrorists\" - could America's next move be to strike Venezuela? President Donald Trump has accused President Nicolas Maduro of leading an organised crime gang (without providing evidence) and declined to answer when questioned if the CIA has the authority to assassinate him. In return, the Venezuelan leader has accused Mr Trump of seeking regime change and of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country, as he appealed to the American people for peace. The rhetoric coming out of the White House, coupled with the presence of military ships in the region, has raised questions about a possible armed conflict between the US and Venezuela. The question in the air is: Will the US actually attack Venezuela? What are US warships doing? The docking of the USS Gravely guided missile destroyer in the capital of Trinidad and Tobago - just 25 miles from the coast of Venezuela - is the latest incident to escalate tensions. Venezuela's government condemned the arrival and called it a provocation by Trinidad and Tobago and the US. The USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier - the largest warship in the world - is also moving closer to Venezuela. It comes as the US has acknowledged carrying out at least seven strikes since September on vessels near Venezuela that it claims were transporting drugs, killing at least 32 people. Venezuela's government says the strikes are illegal, amount to murder, and are acts of aggression. Earlier this month, Trump confirmed he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations - including lethal operations - in Venezuela. The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, with actions varying widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint. What could happen? To get an idea of what could happen next, Sky News spoke to Dr Carlos Solar, an expert on Latin American security at the RUSI defence thinktank. He says the level of military strategy the US is applying around Venezuela seems \"unproportionate\" for the task of tackling drug trafficking. \"A build-up this size can only suggest there's a strategic military goal,\" he added. Dr Solar says the role of the CIA is \"not surprising\", as the US often deploys spying capabilities in countries deemed adversarial. \"With the chances of a military conflict looming, having the most intelligence capable on the ground would be reasonable.\" Asked what could happen next, Dr Solar told Sky News: \"One scenario is Trump authorises a round of long-range precision attacks in Venezuela's territory linked to drug trafficking operations, eventually forcing Maduro to reciprocate later. \"We saw this early in the year when the US attacked Iran's nuclear facilitates and Tehran returned missiles to US bases in Qatar. \"If the US decides to move more strongly, destroying all critical military targets from the Venezuelan forces, then the US could have Maduro surrender and leave the country immediately. \"This would be the least disruptive without causing greater destabilisation of the country.\"  What does Trump say about Venezuela? Trump said his reasons for the strikes on vessels were the migration of Venezuelans, allegedly including former prisoners, to the US - and drug trafficking. \"I authorised for two reasons really,\" he said. \"Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America...they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,\" he told reporters. \"And the other thing are drugs.\" He has accused Venezuela of trafficking huge amounts of cocaine into the US, and alleged Mr Maduro is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang - a claim most of his own intelligence agencies do not support. The US leader has not provided evidence for the claim about prisoners, and Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay pointed out the fentanyl drug that is causing destruction in America is largely manufactured in Mexico, not Venezuela. \"We are looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" Mr Trump added. It is not clear what actions this could entail. The Pentagon recently disclosed to US Congress that the president has determined the US is engaged in \"a non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. When asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, which would be a massive intervention, Trump declined to answer. Instead, he said: \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\" Read more:Venezuela opposition leader wins Nobel Peace PrizeTrump may have another motive in escalation of war on drugs What does Venezuela's leader say? Maduro has been in power since 2013, including re-elections in contests marred by accusations of fraud. The last decade has seen his country gripped by spiralling hyperinflation and a humanitarian crisis that has seen an estimated eight million Venezuelans flee the country. As the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier moved closer to Venezuela, Maduro accused the US government of \"fabricating a new eternal war\" against his country. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war that we will avoid,\" he said in a national address. \"They are fabricating an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one,\" he added, perhaps a reference to Trump's claim that he is the leader of the Tren de Aragua gang and that his country trafficks cocaine into the US. \"Venezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves.\" Tren de Aragua, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but instead for its involvement in contract killings, extortion, and people smuggling. Venezuela has raised a complaint to the UN Security Council and demanded accountability from the US."

The 55-year-old music mogul was given a 50-month sentence and a $500,000 fine earlier this month for flying people around the US and abroad for sexual encounters, including his then-girlfriend and male sex workers, in violation of prostitution laws. According to Sky News' US partner NBC News, his expected release date is 8 May 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Prosecutors had pushed for Combs, serving his first criminal conviction, to serve 11 years in prison. Combs, who has been detained since his arrest in September 2024, was acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence. 'Disgusting, shameful and sick' Combs, who told a federal district court in New York he admitted his past behaviour was \"disgusting, shameful and sick\", is set to appeal the conviction and sentence. During a seven-week trial, four days of testimony was heard from Cassie, now Cassie Venture Fine, who told the court she was coerced and sometimes blackmailed into sexual encounters with male workers.

Daniel Parmenter, 44, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of making a bomb hoax on 22 November last year. The US Embassy, in Nine Elms, south London, went into lockdown, and bomb disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion, after a bag containing wires and an iPad was left outside, the court heard. Mr Parmenter has denied intending to cause alarm. He claimed in a formal police interview that it was an \"art installation\", the court was told. Opening his trial on Monday, prosecutor Lucy Organ told how Mr Parmenter had left the suspicious item in an alleyway by the embassy around 6am. A civilian embassy guard noticed what she thought looked like a bomb on a routine patrol, and \"panicked\". Ms Organ said. The guard raised the alarm. Jurors were told a police officer on duty at the embassy walked down the alleyway and saw a number of objects, including photo frames and a metal tray with a skull and crossbones on it. \n                  David Lammy blames 'human error' for release of migrant sex offender - as confirms independent investigation\n                 \n                  King heckled over Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein during visit\n                 \n                  Alleged Madeleine McCann family stalker had 'genuine belief' she was missing girl\n                 Ms Organ said: \"Next to all of this on the floor next to the wall was what appeared to be an IED (improvised explosive device), it was an old-style iPad with a key pad and firework wires all taped.\" There was also a box of dates marked for the attention of the US Navy with the words \"do not X-ray, please inspect. Radiation. Hazard\". Mr Parmenter was identified following an examination of CCTV from the area. He was arrested at the home he shares with his mother, wearing the same hat and jumper he had on in the CCTV footage, two days later. On being arrested on suspicion of planting a device at the US Embassy, the defendant replied \"I did\" even before the officer had finished speaking, the court was told. Mr Parmenter denied meaning any harm, saying: \"It is basically a form of slightly sophisticated graffiti art of the non-vandal type.\" The defendant's basement flat, described as a \"hoarder's property\", was searched, and police found what appeared to be a cross between a petrol bomb and a pipe bomb at the property, the court heard.

Sky News has learnt that KKR is among a small number of parties in talks with The Coca-Cola Company and its advisers at Lazard, the investment bank, about a deal. KKR's involvement in the process is unexpected because it had appeared to drop its interest in a potential bid in late August, soon after news of the auction was revealed by Sky News. Money blog: 'We protect the UK, our salaries can be limitless' Further details of KKR's offer were unclear on Monday, although one source said its interest remained fluid, and it was possible that it could still decide against a binding offer or choose to team up with another party. It joins rival bidders including Bain Capital, the part-owner of bakery chain Gail's, and TDR Capital, whose portfolio includes Asda. Sources said that management presentations with potential bidders were due to get underway this week. \n                  Tesco rolls out body cams to delivery staff 'vulnerable to attack' due to expanded age checks\n                 \n                  Retail sales the highest in three years in a surprise to economists\n                 \n                  Shoe chain Russell & Bromley puts best foot forward with debt plan\n                 Coca-Cola intends to retain ownership of Costa's ready-to-drink portfolio, which is also sold through other retailers. Further bids for the business are understood to be due shortly. One insider has suggested that the value placed on Costa could be as low as £1.5bn, well under half the £3.9bn paid by Coca-Cola in 2021. It was unclear whether Coca-Cola would be prepared to offload the business at that price. Costa trades from more than 2,000 stores in the UK and well over 3,000 globally. It has been reported to have a global workforce numbering 35,000, although Coca-Cola has not responded to any questions from Sky News about the Costa business or sale process. Accounts filed at Companies House for Costa show that in 2023 the coffee chain recorded revenues of £1.22bn. While this represented a 9% increase on the previous year, it was below the £1.3bn recorded in 2018, the final year before Coca-Cola took control of the business. Coca-Cola has been grappling with the weak performance of Costa for some time, with Coca-Cola boss James Quincey saying on an earnings call during the summer: \"We're in the mode of reflecting on what we've learned, thinking about how we might want to find new avenues to grow in the coffee category while continuing to run the Costa business successfully.\" \"It's still a lot of money we put down, and we wanted that money to work as hard as possible.\" The deal was intended to provide Coca-Cola with a global platform in a growing area of the beverages market. Costa trades in dozens of countries, including India, Japan, Mexico and Poland, and operates a network of thousands of coffee vending machines internationally under the Costa Express brand. The chain was founded in 1971 by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa. It was sold to Whitbread for £19m in 1995, when it traded from fewer than 40 stores. KKR declined to comment."

For mid-level roles it's £65k to £100k+. With real-world scars from red-team ops (test scenarios) or live incidents, you're trusted to protect things that matter. Add strong communication and people skills, and you're valuable. If you're advanced, you can earn £125k+. These are deep technical and strategic thinkers - the ones who understand how attackers really operate can make leadership-level money; and at this level there are usually bonuses and incentives on top. You get paid mostly salary plus bonus or day-rates (£600 - £2,500). The best go on to build businesses or advise governments; that's where \"sky's the limit\" stops being a figure of speech. Hackers never sleep... and companies tend to ask for help checking systems when they've been tickled from the dark side. Traditional red teaming tends to be in traditional work hours, but firefighting stuff means the hours can swing with the threat landscape: quiet weeks when systems behave, then 2am firefights when they don't. Formally, it's about 37-40 hours a week on paper, with 20-25 days' holiday, plus bank holidays. In practice, you'll sometimes be tempted to swap downtime for adrenaline, but smart teams make sure it evens out. Head to the Money blog for latest consumer finance tips Many of us come from deeply technical backgrounds, so translating complex risks into PowerPoint-friendly soundbites can feel painful... You spend days unpicking a subtle chain of vulnerabilities, only to be asked \"but are we safe now?\", as if that's ever a yes/no question. If I could swap one meeting for a few quiet hours with a packet sniffer (a software that analyses data in a computer network) and coffee, I probably would. The stereotype of a hacker being nerdy, socially awkward and operating alone used to be fairly true... Many of us preferred machines to meetings. But the world caught up. The so-called \"geeks\" once seen as second-class citizens now walk the corridors with heads held high. We've learnt that creativity, focus and curiosity matter more than small talk. Most ethical hackers I know are still introverted, but they're collaborative, inventive and driven by purpose. The modern hacker is part engineer, part detective, part artist. The stereotype hasn't vanished, it's just been upgraded. Hackers are not portrayed very accurately in films... Hollywood loves the image of a lone genius hammering a keyboard and shouting \"I'm in!\", but real hacking is far more nuanced and human. An ethical hacker's toolkit isn't just code, it's psychology, persuasion, pattern recognition. You might spend more time analysing behaviour, crafting believable disinformation or charming access through social engineering than actually typing exploits. Businesses pay ransoms to bad hackers too often... When lives, supply chains or national security are at risk, the moral answer becomes academic in the face of immediate harm. Hospitals, manufacturers with cascading dependencies or operations holding defence-sensitive data face agonising choices. Law enforcement and insurers can help, but the systems and capability to resolve this cleanly aren't always there. The real measure of success isn't whether you'd refuse to pay, it's whether you never have to make that call. The threat of cyber attacks are enormous and growing fast... The UK's own cyber agency reports a 50% rise in serious incidents this year, with four nationally significant attacks every week. That's not hype; it's the new normal. For businesses, cyber risk now sits alongside inflation and geopolitics as a top board concern. Attacks are more automated, data-driven and commercially motivated, and many exploit human psychology as much as code. For individuals, it's constant low-level warfare: phishing, deepfake scams, identity theft and data leaks. We live inside digital systems that are under continuous stress. The bad news is the threat is systemic. The good news? So is the defence, we're finally learning to detect, contain and recover as part of daily business resilience, not afterthought. Read more from Sky News:What it's really like being a bodyguardThe private investigator - 'here's how much we cost'£200k salaries - secrets of a pilot Here are my three top tips to keep your data safe... 1. Strong authentication. Yes, passwords still matter, but pair them with multi-factor authentication and good privilege management. Most breaches start with someone logging in who shouldn't. Devil in the detail suggests ethical hackers have a strong testing and checking role here. 2. Hygiene, not heroics. Keep software patched, segment networks and monitor for odd behaviour. It's dull, repetitive and absolutely vital. Security is 90% housekeeping, 10% brilliance. Another major area for ethical hackers to continuously check and test! 3. Backup… Offline. Offline. Offline. Back up your critical data, and then disconnect that backup from the network. Ransomware can't encrypt what it can't reach. It's astonishing how many companies forget this until it's too late. In short: authenticate hard, maintain hygiene and always have an air-gapped safety net. The most common mistake is... carelessness. Most breaches trace back to unpatched systems, weak or reused passwords or access that should've been revoked but wasn't. People relax their discipline because \"it worked yesterday\". Security fails in the details: an open port left from testing, a missed patch, a user who disables MFA \"just for now\". Attackers live for those cracks. Another blind spot is supply chain trust, organisations assume partners and software vendors are secure, when often they're not. Usually, there isn't a sign that you've been hacked... not at first. Attackers today don't smash in; they settle in. They might be using your systems to mine crypto, to pivot toward a bigger target or simply watching and waiting. Early clues are subtle: unexplained outbound traffic, sluggish servers, new admin accounts, strange scheduled tasks or webshells, bits of hidden code dropped into a web app so they can slip back in later. By the time you see blue screens, Bitcoin demands or a flurry of odd emails, you're already at the endgame. The trick is catching the whispers, not the explosions, that's what good detection and disciplined monitoring are for. I've not been tempted to go to the dark side... There's a clear moral divide. You're either a criminal or you're not. Most people are wired, neurologically and socially, to know the difference. But the landscape is shifting. The rise of gaming cheats, exploit marketplaces and online rewards has blurred the lines for a new generation. Many young, technically gifted players slide into grey areas, writing or selling cheats, testing exploits, without realising how close they've drifted to criminality. That's exactly what The Hacking Games was created to address. The choice isn't about temptation; it's about direction. Ethical hackers are really the ones protecting the UK's national security... though the real heavy hitters sit inside elite agencies like the National Cyber Force (UK), the US Cyber Command and NSA. Ethical hackers in the wider community play a vital supporting role, finding vulnerabilities before criminals do, hardening critical infrastructure and sharing intelligence. Together they form the ecosystem that keeps national systems upright. The threat is entirely real. A well-timed attack on power grids, transport or finance could paralyse daily life and ripple through the economy in hours. The quiet reality is that every day, hundreds of skilled defenders, many from our own ethical-hacker community, stop those scenarios before the public ever hears about them. The strangest jobs are usually the ones you don't take... I've been asked more than once to use my skills offensively, to dig up information or break into a competitor's systems \"just to see what's possible\". That's where the ethical line matters most, and I've always refused. On the lighter side... I once helped a major retailer track down a mysterious Wi-Fi signal that was disrupting their tills, it turned out to be a smart fridge in the staff kitchen endlessly trying to update itself. So, yes, the weird jobs range from the morally ambiguous to the mildly ridiculous. I didn't spot the hacker wiring in my brain until my early 20s... That's when a proper, successful hack clicked for me. The feeling is addictive: a mix of intellectual flow and the quiet satisfaction of having out-thought a system. We want young gamer-hackers to get that buzz sooner, but safely. Three quick tips for anyone who's just found the bug... learn the rules first, find good mentors and compete in safe CTFs or bug-bounty programmes - practice hard, but within the lines. The future of hacking will change dramatically but... it's not inevitable doom. The real shift isn't lone AIs running riot; it's co-intelligence, humans working with powerful AI assistants. That partnership amplifies reach and speed. But there's a mirror side: defenders get the same amplification. AI will massively improve detection, triage and automated containment, if organisations invest in data, playbooks and people who can use these tools. What to worry about most... What needs to be done...  So it is about continuous vigilance, with pragmatism. The future is hard, fast and interesting. We need smarter people working with smarter tools. This is exactly the problem The Hacking Games is built to solve."

The group's operations will continue to trade, and options for restructuring of the company and a possible merger or acquisition are being actively explored with its key creditors, the company said on Monday. People close to the company say they are hopeful a buyer can be found swiftly for its North Sea operations, with one suggesting that it could even happen in the coming days. Money blog: 'We protect the UK, our salaries can be limitless' Administrators will work alongside company management to \"preserve value, operational capability and ongoing delivery\", its announcement read.

Its slide into insolvency was triggered by last week's cancellation of a major contract by its biggest customer, but the failure of a company once valued at more than £6bn has been a long time coming. Administrators at Teneo will now attempt to salvage what they can from Petrofac's wreckage. For thousands of employees, the future is now uncertain, although people close to the company say they are hopeful that a buyer can be found swiftly for its North Sea operations, with one suggesting that it could even happen in the coming days.\n That would be a relief to Mr Miliband, whose energy policy has come under growing scrutiny in recent months amid dire warnings about the future of Britain's offshore oil industry. An advisory firm, Kroll, had been engaged by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to work with ministers and officials on the unfolding crisis for the company. What is Petrofac? Petrofac employs about 7,300 people globally, according to a recent stock exchange filing. It designs, constructs and operates offshore equipment for energy companies. The company has been valued at more than £6bn but has been struggling with debt. It also faced a Serious Fraud Office investigation, which resulted in a 2021 conviction for failing to prevent bribery, and the payment of millions of pounds in penalties.  Founded in 1981 in Texas, the business has been in talks about a far-reaching financial restructuring for more than a year. A formal restructuring plan was sanctioned by the High Court in May this year with the aim of writing off much of its debt and injecting new cash into the business. This was subsequently overturned, prompting talks with creditors about a revised agreement. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said, \"The UK arm of Petrofac has not entered administration and is continuing to operate as normal, as an in-demand business with a highly skilled workforce and many successful contracts.\" \"Petrofac's administration is a product of longstanding issues in their global business. \"The government will continue to work with the UK company as it focuses on its long-term future.\""

        "Content": " David Lammy has confirmed there will be an independent investigation into the accidental release of a migrant jailed for sex offences, as he blamed \"human error\" for the incident. The deputy prime minister and justice secretary told MPs he was \"livid\" on behalf of Hadush Kebatu's victims and he would be deported back to Ethiopia \"as quickly as possible\". Politics latest: Epping MP calls on Lammy to commit to closing the Bell Hotel Kebatu, who was found guilty in September of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, was freed in error from HMP Chelmsford in Essex on Friday instead of being handed over to immigration officials for deportation. His accidental release sparked widespread alarm and a manhunt that resulted in him being found and arrested by the Metropolitan Police in the Finsbury Park area of London at around 8.30am on Sunday. The incident has sparked questions over how the man, whose crimes sparked protests in Epping over the use of asylum hotels, was able to be freed. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Lammy said the mistake should not have happened as he sought to lay part of the blame on to the Conservatives over the state of the prison system over the past 14 years. He said \"there must and there will be accountability\" for the mistaken release of Kebatu from prison. \"I've been clear from the outset that a mistake of this nature is unacceptable,\" he said. \"We must get to the bottom of what happened and take immediate action to try and prevent similar releases in error to protect the public from harm.\" Mr Lammy said he ordered an \"urgent review\" into the checks that take place when an offender is released from prison, and new safeguards have been added that amount to the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\". The justice secretary said the investigation would be led by former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, who also used to lead the National Crime Agency.  He also said the investigation would have the same status as high-profile probes into other prison incidents, including the attack on three prison officers at HMP Franklin in April of this year and the escape of Daniel Khalife from HMP Wandsworth in 2023. 'Calamity Lammy' Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick referred to a report by Sky News which detailed how a witness present at the prison observed Kebatu appearing \"confused\" upon his release. The witness said Kebatu had in fact tried to go back into the prison several times, but was instead guided to Chelmsford station, where he caught a train to London. Mr Jenrick claimed the case was proof \"the only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK\". \"Dear oh dear,\" he said. \"Where to begin? This justice secretary could not deport the only small boat migrant who wanted - no - who tried to be deported. \"Having been mistakenly released, Hadush Kebatu came back to prison asking to be deported not once, not twice, but five times, but he was turned away.\" He went on: \"The only illegal migrants this government are stopping are those that actually want to leave the UK. \"His officials, briefing the press, called it the mother of all - yeah, they're not wrong, are they?\" Read more:Reform UK's Zia Yusuf defends MP accused of 'racism'A colossal repair job is desperately needed after Kebatu debacle Mr Jenrick, who served as immigration minister under the previous Conservative government, branded his opposite number \"calamity Lammy\". \"It's a national embarrassment and today the justice secretary feigns anger at what happened.\" Continuing with his attack, Mr Jenrick asked Mr Lammy whether he would resign if Kebatu was not deported \"by the end of the week\" - to which he received no reply. But asked later by an MP whether he was considering his position, Mr Lammy replied: \"A ridiculous question, the answer is no.\" The new checks announced by Mr Lammy on Monday involve five pages of instructions and require more senior prison staff to sign off a release, according to documents obtained by Sky News. The instructions are effective from Monday."

        "Headline": "The expected cost of housing asylum seekers has tripled to £15bn after a \"dramatic increase\" in demand.",
        "Content": " Billions of pounds are being wasted by the Home Office on asylum hotels, a committee of MPs say. A damning report by the Home Affairs Committee says the expected cost of housing asylum seekers has tripled from £4.5bn to £15.3bn. This follows a \"dramatic increase\" in demand following the COVID pandemic and rising numbers of those arriving by small boat. The report, referring to accommodation contracts for 2019-2029, criticises the Home Office for failing to reclaim excess profits from asylum accommodation providers totalling tens of millions of pounds owed to the department. The government has promised to end the housing of asylum seekers in hotels by 2029, amid mounting pressure over costs and a backlash in local communities. Sir Keir Starmer blamed the Conservatives, saying Labour \"inherited a huge mess in relation to pretty well all departments in government, and that includes the Home Office\". He said his government is processing asylum claims \"much more quickly\" than under the Tories and they are removing people \"who have no right to be in our country\" at a \"higher rate than the best part of a decade\". Communities Secretary Steve Reed told Sky News the government was \"working at pace to fix the problems we inherited\", including expanding the number of caseworkers examining asylum cases. \"The Home Secretary... has been involved in conversations about how you can look at using disused military bases, for instance, instead of hotels, to accommodate people far more cheaply. \"But it takes time to get your hands on those sites, construct the accommodation and then move people into it. But we've already saved £1 billion. So it's starting to go down.\"  The report said that, without a clear plan for alternative accommodation, the government risks \"under-delivery and consequently undermining public trust still further\". It added that the Home Office repeatedly cut corners in its \"chaotic\" response to pressures. Committee chair Dame Karen Bradley called for the government to \"get a grip\" on the system \"in order to bring costs down\" and learn from its mistakes, or it is \"doomed to repeat them\". She added: \"The Home Office has not proved able to develop a long-term strategy for the delivery of asylum accommodation. It has instead focused on short-term, reactive responses.\" Speaking to Sky News, she said the Home Office \"isn't fit for purpose\" should be split up, with one department for crime and one for policing, as the two areas \"require different skill sets\". However the prime minister's official spokesman said there was no plans to do that. The committee's report also noted the Home Office failed to engage with communities and local residents who have \"genuine concerns\" over asylum hotels in their area, as well as people travelling from other areas \"to promote divisive agendas or instigate disorder\". MPs have pressed for the Home Office to prioritise closing hotels where there have been \"significant community cohesion issues\" - including in Epping, Essex, where demonstrations outside the Bell Hotel were held after migrant Hadush Kebatu was charged and later jailed for sexual assault.  The report said: \"The Home Office has undoubtedly been operating in an extremely challenging environment, but its chaotic response has demonstrated that it has not been up to the challenge. \"The 2026 break clause and end of the contracts in 2029 represent opportunities to draw a line under the current failed, chaotic and expensive system and move to a model that is more effective and offers value for money. \"The lack of engagement and transparency has left space for misinformation and mistrust to grow, which in too many areas has led to tensions and undermined the ability of local partners to promote social cohesion.\" It also said the government has mismanaged contracts handed to hotels used to house asylum seekers. This includes a lack of fines for hotels that have poor performance and not claiming tens of millions of pounds in excess profits. Read more:Who says what on asylum hotelsWhere could asylum seekers go?How many asylum seekers are in hotels The committee has instead called for a future accommodation system to be based on fairness rather than cost alone, to improve communication with local communities and be flexible to meet unpredictable demands. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The government is furious about the number of illegal migrants in this country and in hotels. \"That is why we will close every single asylum hotel - saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. \"We have already taken action - closing hotels, slashing asylum costs by nearly £1bn and exploring the use of military bases and disused properties.\" One of the hotels mentioned in the report, Mears, said: \"Profit margins are contractually agreed at a level which demonstrates value for money for the taxpayer for the services provided and risks managed by Mears. Mears operating margin on the contract of 5%-6% is in line with or below typical margins on large public sector service contracts. The contracts include clauses for payments to be reconciled over time and for profits above a tendered contractual level to be shared back to the Home Office. We work on an open book basis with the Home Office and following an independent audit, Mears has made appropriate and agreed payments back to the Home Office.\" On hotel use, they added: \"Mears has reduced hotel use by half as we work towards ending the use of hotels.\" Serco, which also provides hotels, said: \"Serco wants to see an end to the use of hotels and agree with both the Government and Select Committee that this should be a priority. Since 2023, we have exited half of the hotels we operated. \"We have viable solutions to end hotel use and continue to work with the Home Office to deliver a long-term strategy which delivers for taxpayers.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  A key witness in the failed prosecution of two men accused of spying for China said he was \"surprised\" the case had collapsed, given he had said Beijing posed a range of threats. Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser, also told a parliamentary hearing on Monday that he had been \"disappointed\" at the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service in September to drop the legal proceedings. Yet the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, appearing before the same committee of MPs and peers, said an inability by Mr Collins specifically to describe the Chinese state as a national security threat was a \"fatal\" blow to their case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. Mr Parkinson similarly said he had been \"disappointed and frustrated\" at the collapse of the high-profile trial. But he claimed his team of prosecutors had tried every avenue and concluded that a successful prosecution would not be possible. Despite the strong defence of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision, members of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy appeared visibly bemused about why the trial was derailed, given the evidence available of the threat posed by China.

I was somewhat surprised that the intention was to drop the case,\" he said. Appearing separately, though, Mr Parkinson explained that his team \"weren't quite there\" when it came to establishing that Beijing posed a threat to the UK's national security between 2021 and 2023 when the alleged offences took place. He said he had thought it would be easy to obtain in writing from Mr Collins a statement about the threat that met the threshold to be able to bring the case to trial. Fourteen months of waiting - then a 'no' But the director of public prosecutions said this proved to be a \"sticking point\" and after 14 months of waiting for a reply from him, it came back as \"no\". \"It took quite a lot of effort on our part to try to get the answer,\" he told the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. \"What you could not do as a prosecutor is tell people what to say.\" Asked whether he felt disappointed at the failure to prosecute the case, Mr Parkinson said: \"We did feel disappointed and frustrated.\" Tom Little KC, first senior treasury council, who was a key prosecutor involved in the case, said the inability of Mr Collins to state in his witness statement that China was a threat to national security during the relevant period brought the case to a \"crashing halt\". Read more on Sky News:Romanian grooming gang jailed24 hours in Ukraine's kill zonePresident re-elected aged 92 However, Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser and a member of the committee, pointed out that Mr Collins, who once worked for him, was only able to reflect government policy, which sees China as posing security threats but also economic opportunities. He asked Mr Parkinson why prosecutors did not seek other witnesses, such as former intelligence chiefs who could clearly state as fact that China posed a threat to national security. Mr Little and Mr Parkinson, however, said in their judgement that the inability of Mr Collins to make that statement would have derailed the case. Mr Cash and Mr Berry have always denied any wrongdoing."

        "Content": " Nigel Farage has said he is \"unhappy\" with his MP, Sarah Pochin, for making comments that have been widely condemned as racist. The Reform UK leader was asked to give his view on Ms Pochin after she told a viewer on Talk TV that it \"drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people\". Politics latest: Starmer 'angry' after report reveals 'billions' wasted on asylum hotels Ms Pochin, the MP for Runcorn and Helsby, said such adverts did not \"reflect our society\" and added: \"I feel that your average white person, average white family is… not represented any more.\" She has since apologised for her remarks and said they were \"poorly phrased\". However, she said the point she was trying to make was that advertising had gone \"DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] mad\" and adverts were now \"unrepresentative of British society as a whole\". Sir Keir Starmer has said he believes her comments are an example of \"shocking racism\" that could \"tear our country apart\". \n                  Harriet Harman: Jess Phillips can repair relations with grooming gang survivors so inquiry can go ahead\n                 \n                  PM has 'confidence' in Jess Phillips after grooming survivors demanded her resignation\n                 \n                  Candidates to lead grooming gangs inquiry may now think twice about role\n                 \"It tells you everything about Reform,\" the prime minister told the BBC. \"Nigel Farage has got some questions to answer because either he doesn't consider it racist, which in my view is shocking in itself, or he does think it's racist and he's shown absolutely no leadership. \"I'm the prime minister of the whole of our country - our reasonable, tolerant, diverse country - and I want to serve the whole country. He can't even call out racism.\" Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Mr Farage said Ms Pochin's suggestion that there were too many black and Asian people in adverts was \"ugly\" and \"taken on their own could be read to be very, very unpleasant indeed\". \"I am unhappy with what she has done,\" he said. However, he echoed previous comments made by Zia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy, who said her comments had to be \"put into context\" and people must be able to \"talk about\" representation in television advertising. Mr Farage agreed, saying Ms Pochin's comments came in the context of \"DEI madness\" and were not \"racist\". He added: \"I understand the basic point, but the way she put it, the way she worded it, was wrong and was ugly, and if I thought that the intention behind it was racist, I would have taken a lot more action than I have to date.\" Mr Farage was speaking during a press conference in Westminster in which he said parliament needed to \"step up\" and form a commission to intervene in the grooming gang scandal. He was joined by child sexual abuse survivor Ellie-Ann Reynolds, who resigned from the inquiry's victims and survivors liaison panel over concerns that racial and religious motivations were being downplayed. It comes as the inquiry established by the government faces pressure after a group of survivors quit the inquiry and said they would only rejoin it on the condition that safeguarding minister Jess Phillips resigned. Ms Phillips is facing calls to resign after she was accused of trying to expand the inquiry's scope beyond grooming gangs. Read more:Stronger oversight of social media needed to protect MPsWhat is Labour's Renters' Rights Bill? A separate group of survivors wrote to the prime minister to say they will only continue to work with the inquiry if Ms Phillips remains in post. Sir Keir has defended Ms Phillips, saying he had \"confidence\" in her and she had \"devoted\" her life to tackling violence against women and girls. He has also written to some of the survivors asking them to rejoin the inquiry. Appearing at a press conference in central London, the Reform UK leader said he would be speaking to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and would write to the Home Affairs Select Committee about parliament using its \"extraordinary powers\" to investigate the scandal. He suggested both the House of Lords and the House of Commons could be involved in a \"commission\". \"Here is the most enormous opportunity for parliament, and indeed for this government, to restore some public trust in the institution and those that currently inhabit it on an issue that has been gnawing away at our public consciences for well over a decade,\" he said."

        "Content": "A report has called for greater oversight of social media platforms to protect MPs from abuse and intimidation. The Speakers Conference, a cross-party group of MPs, has put together recommendations to address the \"current climate of toxic political discourse\". Politics Live: Billions wasted on asylum hotels The recommendations include the introduction of an elections code of practice by Ofcom, the media regulator, and new legislation under the Online Safety Act to address emerging threats such as disinformation, deepfakes, and doxing. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons and chair of the conference, said: \"Standing for election and representing your community is something anyone should be able to aspire to. \"But the current climate of toxic political discourse is having a corrosive effect on our democracy, and is discouraging people from participating in our democratic process. The perception that it is acceptable to abuse public figures must end.\" The report also calls for a review of how misogynistic abuse is treated under hate crime legislation and urges political parties to provide tailored support for female candidates. \n                  David Lammy blames 'human error' for release of migrant sex offender - as confirms independent investigation\n                 \n                  Billions of pounds wasted by Home Office on asylum hotels, MPs say\n                 \n                  Why Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have both left the country\n                 It advocates for improved citizenship education in schools and a national public awareness campaign to challenge the normalisation of abuse towards MPs and promote respectful political engagement. It also includes recommendations for greater media regulation, including encouraging politicians and the press to participate more in long-form interviews to avoid over simplification and misrepresentation of stories. Sir Lindsay said: \"The Speaker's Conference report makes clear recommendations to government, the police, the media and wider civil society on how we can uphold freedom of speech and ensure accountability, while reducing threats and ensuring greater security for candidates, MPs and our democratic institutions. \"The onus is on all of us to moderate political discourse and ensure it does not cross the line into abuse, intimidation or violence. I will continue to work with all relevant groups to protect and defend our democracy.\" The Speaker's Conference was formed last year and was brought together to consider specific topics. It has similar powers to select committees and can request documents, call witnesses and take oral and written evidence. The conference published its first report in June which made recommendations on how the response to threats against MPs, candidates and elections can be strengthened. This report found that 96% of MPs surveyed had experienced abuse, and nearly half of their staff had felt unsafe as a result of abuse. The second phase of work focused on \"what can be done to reduce the level of threat posed to MPs and candidates\"."

The 55-year-old music mogul was given a 50-month sentence and a $500,000 fine earlier this month for flying people around the US and abroad for sexual encounters, including his then-girlfriend and male sex workers, in violation of prostitution laws. According to Sky News' US partner NBC News, his expected release date is 8 May 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Prosecutors had pushed for Combs, serving his first criminal conviction, to serve 11 years in prison. Combs, who has been detained since his arrest in September 2024, was acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence. 'Disgusting, shameful and sick' Combs, who told a federal district court in New York he admitted his past behaviour was \"disgusting, shameful and sick\", is set to appeal the conviction and sentence. During a seven-week trial, four days of testimony was heard from Cassie, now Cassie Venture Fine, who told the court she was coerced and sometimes blackmailed into sexual encounters with male workers.

The Alan Partridge star, his firm Baby Cow, and Pathe Productions have settled a libel claim over how Richard Taylor was portrayed in the 2022 movie The Lost King after he sued them. Coogan, who co-wrote the screenplay and also starred in the film, said The Lost King was \"the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did\" following the settlement in the High Court on Monday. The movie tells of how Philippa Langley led the search for the king's skeleton. The lost remains of the Plantagenet monarch, who ruled England between June 1483 and August 1485, were discovered in a Leicester car park in August 2012, more than 500 years after his death. In June last year, Judge Jaron Lewis ruled that the film portrayed Mr Taylor, who was deputy registrar at the University of Leicester at the time of the discovery, as \"knowingly misrepresented facts [about the find] to the media and the public\". Mr Taylor was also shown to be \"smug, unduly dismissive and patronising\", which had a defamatory meaning, the judge said. \n                  Steve Coogan avoids driving ban after plea to save new TV show The Trip with Rob Brydon\n                 \n                  Steve Coogan being sued by man portrayed in his film The Lost King\n                 \n                  Steve Coogan praises 'brave' Prince Harry for bringing phone hacking case\n                 The case was due to proceed to trial, but lawyers for Mr Taylor, who is now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, told a hearing at the High Court on Monday that the parties had settled the claim. Depiction caused serious harm - lawyer His barrister, William Bennett KC, said Mr Taylor felt \"the depiction of him in this untrue way in the film caused serious harm to his professional and personal reputations and caused enormous distress and embarrassment to him\". \"The defendants have now settled Mr Taylor's claim in the libel against them for the publication of the film by paying him substantial damages. \"Furthermore, they have agreed to make changes to the film in order to withdraw the allegations complained of and to pay him his legal costs.\" The University of Leicester played a \"crucial role in providing funds and academic expertise\" for the project to find the remains, with Mr Taylor the \"key co-ordinator of the university's involvement\", Mr Bennett said. On-screen clarification to be added to start of film Coogan, and the production companies were not represented and did not attend but in a joint statement following the hearing, they said they were \"incredibly proud of this film and are pleased this matter has now been settled\". An on-screen clarification will be added to the start of the film, saying the portrayal of Mr Taylor in the film is \"fictional and does not represent the actions of the real Mr Taylor\", who \"acted with integrity during the events portrayed\". In a separate statement, Coogan said Philippa Langley \"instigated the search for Richard III. Philippa Langley insisted on the dig in the northern area of the social services car park where the remains were found. Philippa Langley raised the majority of the money for his exhumation\". \"If it wasn't for Philippa Langley, Richard III would still be lying under a car park in Leicester. It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity. \"The only changes to the film will be a front card, which will follow the existing card, which says that this film is a true story, Philippa Langley's story. That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.\" Read more on Sky News:Romanian grooming gang jailed24 hours in Ukraine's kill zonePresident re-elected aged 92 Mr Taylor said that he felt \"cross\" and \"completely helpless\" when the film was released, but the outcome represented \"success and vindication\" after \"a long and gruelling battle\".
