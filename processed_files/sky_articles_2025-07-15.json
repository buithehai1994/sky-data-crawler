        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @kvittozzi\n  Ava was heading home from Pizza Hut when she found out her dad had been arrested.   Warning: This article includes references to indecent images of children and suicide that some readers may find distressing It had been \"a really good evening\" celebrating her brother's birthday.  Ava (not her real name) was just 13, and her brother several years younger. Their parents had divorced a few years earlier and they were living with their mum.  Suddenly Ava's mum, sitting in the front car seat next to her new boyfriend, got a phone call.   \"She answered the phone and it was the police,\" Ava remembers.   \"I think they realised that there were children in the back so they kept it very minimal, but I could hear them speaking.\"   \"I was so scared,\" she says, as she overheard about his arrest.  \"I was panicking loads because my dad actually used to do a lot of speeding and I was like: 'Oh no, he's been caught speeding, he's going to get in trouble.'\"  But Ava wasn't told what had really happened until many weeks later, even though things changed immediately.  \"We found out that we weren't going to be able to see our dad for, well we didn't know how long for - but we weren't allowed to see him, or even speak to him. I couldn't text him or anything. I was just wondering what was going on, I didn't know. I didn't understand.\"  Ava's dad, John, had been arrested for looking at indecent images of children online.  We hear this first-hand from John (not his real name), who we interviewed separately from Ava.  What he told us about his offending was, of course, difficult to hear. His offending went on for several years, looking at indecent images and videos of young children. His own daughter told us she was \"repulsed\" by what he did. But John wanted to speak to us, frankly and honestly. He told us he was \"sorry\" for what he had done, and that it was only after counselling that he realised the \"actual impact on the people in the images\" of his crime. By sharing his story, he hopes to try to stop other people doing what he did and raise awareness about the impact this type of offence has - on everyone involved, including his unsuspecting family. John tells us he'd been looking at indecent images and videos of children since 2013.  \"I was on the internet, on a chat site,\" he says. \"Someone sent a link. I opened it, and that's what it was. \"Then more people started sending links and it just kind of gathered pace from there really. It kind of sucks you in without you even realising it. And it becomes almost like a drug, to, you know, get your next fix.\"  John says he got a \"sexual kick\" from looking at the images and claims \"at the time, when you're doing it, you don't realise how wrong it is\". 'I told them exactly what they would find' At the point of his arrest, John had around 1,000 indecent images and videos of children on his laptop - some were Category A, the most severe.  Referencing the counselling that he since received, John says he believes the abuse he received as a child affected the way he initially perceived what he was doing. \"I had this thing in my mind,\" he says, \"that the kids in these were enjoying it.\" \"Unfortunately, [that] was the way that my brain was wired up\" and \"I'm not proud of it\", he adds. John had been offending for several years when he downloaded an image that had been electronically tagged by security agencies. It flagged his location to police.  John was arrested at his work and says he \"straight away just admitted everything\". \"I told them exactly what they would find, and they found it.\" The police bailed John - and he describes the next 24 hours as \"hell\".  \"I wanted to kill myself,\" he remembers. \"It was the only way I could see out of the situation. I was just thinking about my family, my daughter and my son, how is it going to affect them?\"  But John says the police had given information about a free counselling service, a helpline, which he called that day.   \"It stopped me in my tracks and probably saved my life.\"  'My world was crumbling around me' Six weeks later, John was allowed to make contact with Ava.   By this point she describes how she was \"hysterically crying\" at school every day, not knowing what had happened to her dad.  But once he told her what he'd done, things got even worse.  \"When I found out, it genuinely felt like my world was crumbling around me,\" Ava says.  \"I felt like I couldn't tell anyone. I was so embarrassed of what people might think of me. It sounds so silly, but I was so scared that people would think that I would end up like him as well, which would never happen. \"It felt like this really big secret that I just had to hold in.\"  \"I genuinely felt like the only person that was going through something like this,\" Ava says.   She didn't know it then, but her father also had a sense of fear and shame. \"You can't share what you've done with anybody because people can get killed for things like that,\" he says. \"It would take a very, very brave man to go around telling people something like that.\"  And as for his kids? \"They wouldn't want to tell anybody, would they?\" he says.   For her, Ava says \"for a very, very long time\" things were \"incredibly dark\".   \"I turned to drugs,\" she says. \"I was doing lots of like Class As and Bs and going out all the time, I guess because it just was a form of escape. \"There was a point in my life where I just I didn't believe it was going to get better. I really just didn't want to exist. I was just like, if this is what life is like then why am I here?\"  'The trauma is huge for those children' Ava felt alone, but research shows this is happening to thousands of British children every year.   Whereas suspects like John are able to access free services, such as counselling, there are no similar automatic services for their children - unless families can pay.    Professor Rachel Armitage, a criminology expert, set up a Leeds-based charity called Talking Forward in 2021.  It's the only free, in-person, peer support group for families of suspected online child sex offenders in England. But it does not have the resources to provide support for under-18s.  \"The trauma is huge for those children,\" Prof Armitage says.  \"We have families that are paying for private therapy for their children and getting in a huge amount of debt to pay for that.\"  Prof Armitage says if these children were legally recognised as victims, then if would get them the right level of automatic, free support.   It's not unheard of for \"indirect\" or \"secondary\" victims to be recognised in law. Currently, the Domestic Abuse Act does that for children in a domestic abuse household, even if the child hasn't been a direct victim themselves.  In the case of children like Ava, Prof Armitage says it would mean \"they would have communication with the parents in terms of what was happening with this offence; they would get the therapeutic intervention and referral to school to let them know that something has happened, which that child needs consideration for\". We asked the Ministry of Justice whether children of online child sex offenders could be legally recognised as victims.   \"We sympathise with the challenges faced by the unsuspecting families of sex offenders and fund a helpline for prisoners' families which provides free and confidential support,\" a spokesperson said.  But when we spoke with that helpline, and several other charities that the Ministry of Justice said could help, they told us they could only help children with a parent in prison - which for online offences is, nowadays, rarely the outcome.   None of them could help children like Ava, whose dad received a three-year non-custodial sentence, and was put on the sex offenders' register for five years.  \"These children will absolutely fall through the gap,\" Prof Armitage says.  \"I think there's some sort of belief that these families are almost not deserving enough,\" she says. \"That there's some sort of hierarchy of harms, and that they're not harmed enough, really.\"  'People try to protect kids from people like me' Ava says there is simply not enough help - and that feels unfair.   \"In some ways we're kind of forgotten about by the services,\" she says. \"It's always about the offender.\"  John agrees with his daughter.  \"I think the children should get more support than the offender because nobody stops and ask them really, do they?\" he says. \"Nobody thinks about what they're going through.\"  Although Ava and John now see each other, they have never spoken about the impact that John's offending had on his daughter.   Ava was happy for us to share with John what she had gone through.   \"I never knew it was that bad,\" he says.  \"I understand that this is probably something that will affect her the rest of her life.   \"You try to protect your kids, don't you. People try to protect their kids from people like me.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

In her second annual Mansion House speech to the financial sector, Rachel Reeves said she recognised \"differing views\" over the popular tax-free savings accounts, in which savers can currently put up to £20,000 a year. She was reportedly considering reducing the annual limit for cash ISAs to as low as £4,000 a year, in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead. However, the chancellor has shelved any immediate planned changes after a fierce backlash from building societies and consumer groups. In her speech to key industry figures on last night, Ms Reeves said: \"I will continue to consider further changes to ISAs, engaging widely over the coming months and recognising that despite the differing views on the right approach, we are united in wanting better outcomes for both savers and for the UK economy.\" She added: \"For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks, without giving proper weight to the benefits.\" Read analysis from our economics editor Ed Conway  Ms Reeves's speech, the first major one since the welfare bill climbdown two weeks ago, appeared to encourage regulators to focus less on risks and more on the benefits of investing in things like the stock market and government bonds (loans issued by states to raise funds with an interest rate paid in return). She welcomed action by the financial regulator to review risk warning rules and the campaign to promote retail investment, which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is launching next year. \"Our tangled system of financial advice and guidance has meant that people cannot get the right support to make decisions for themselves\", Ms Reeves told the event in London.

Yesterday, she said she would announce a package of City changes - including a new competitive framework for a part of the insurance industry and a regulatory regime for asset management. In response to her address, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Rachel Reeves should have used her speech this evening to rule out massive tax rises on businesses and working people.

Bradley John Murdoch murdered the 28-year-old and assaulted his girlfriend Joanne Lees at gunpoint on a remote stretch of road near Barrow Creek in Australia's Northern Territory on 14 July 2001. Mr Falconio and Ms Lees, both from Yorkshire, had stopped their camper van after Murdoch pulled up beside them, claiming to have seen sparks coming from their vehicle. He shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the van, before forcing Ms Lees into his vehicle and binding her wrists with cable ties. She managed to escape, hiding in the outback for hours before flagging down a passing truck. Murdoch was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for at least 28 years. The 67-year-old was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was moved to palliative care from Alice Springs Correctional Centre last month. A Northern Territory Department of Corrections spokesperson said: \"I can confirm that Bradley Murdoch passed away last night in the palliative care unit at Alice Springs Hospital. \"The death will be subject to investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner.\" During his trial, prosecutors argued that Murdoch was likely to have disposed of Mr Falconio's body somewhere in the vast, remote expanse of desert between Alice Springs and Broome, covering more than 1,200 miles.

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  The parents of a woman who died after her blood clot was misdiagnosed by someone who she thought was a doctor have called a government-ordered review \"a missed opportunity\". Marion and Brendan Chesterton have welcomed many of the recommendations in Professor Gillian Leng's review of the role that physician associates (PAs) perform in the NHS, but say \"they don't go far enough\". Emily died in November 2022 after suffering a pulmonary embolism. She went to see her GP twice in the weeks before her death - and on both occasions was seen by a physician associate who missed the blood clot and instead prescribed propranolol for anxiety. She had told her worried parents that she had been seen by a doctor, but she had not. Her father Brendan told Sky News: \"If she come out and said I've seen someone called the physician's associate I'm sure we would have insisted that, you know, let's go back and insist that you see a doctor. She never knew.\" Now a government-ordered review led by Prof Leng, president of the Royal Society of Medicine, has recommended NHS physician associates should be banned from diagnosing patients who have not already had contact with a doctor for their illness. The report suggests a major change to the role of PAs after it acknowledged they have been used as substitutes for doctors, despite having significantly less training. \n                  World's biggest human imaging project reaches new milestone after scanning 100,000th UK volunteer\n                 \n                  Measles 'circulating' in area where child died from disease, expert warns\n                 \n                  Child dies as measles cases surge at Liverpool hospital\n                 More than 3,500 PAs and 100 anaesthesia associates (AAs) are working in the NHS and there have been previous calls for an expansion in their number. But a general lack of support for the roles from the medical profession - plus high-profile deaths of patients who were misdiagnosed by PAs - led Health Secretary Wes Streeting to order a review. Presenting her findings, Prof Leng said: \"Crucially I'm recommending that PAs should not see undifferentiated or untriaged patients. \"If (patients) are triaged, they (PAs) should be able to see adult patients with minor ailments in line with relevant guidance from the Royal College of GPs.\" She said more detail was needed on which patients can be seen by PAs and national clinical protocols should be developed in this area. She added: \"Let's be clear, (the role of PAs) is working well in some places, but there indeed has been some substitution and any substitution is clearly risky and confusing for patients.\" Prof Leng also recommended PAs should be renamed \"physician assistants\" to position them \"as a supportive, complementary member of the medical team\" - and have standardised uniforms to distinguish them from doctors - while AAs should be renamed \"physician assistants in anaesthesia\". Newly qualified PAs should also work in hospitals for two years before they are allowed to work in GP surgeries or mental health trusts. The report said that while research suggests patients are satisfied after seeing a PA, some did not know they were not seeing a doctor. Prof Leng concluded there were \"no convincing reasons to abolish the roles of AA or PA\", but there is also no case \"for continuing with the roles unchanged\". Read more from Sky News:Human scanning project hits milestoneMeasles warning after child's deathDoctors' strikes are 'gift to Nigel Farage' She recommended that both PAs and AAs should have the opportunity for ongoing training and development, with potential to prescribe medicines in the future, and they should also have the opportunity to become an \"advanced\" PA or AA. Six patient deaths linked to contact with PAs have been recorded by coroners in England. Emily's mother Marion said some of the review's findings were significant and her daughter would still be alive if the recommendations had been in place when she fell ill. She said: \"I think so, yes, which is so important, which is why we're so pleased that this review has been made.\" But Mrs Chesterton added that more could have done, including stopping all PAs from prescribing drugs. \"We feel it's a missed opportunity. It could have gone all the way there and cleared things up totally. Our daughter died. She was prescribed a drug that she should not have been prescribed. And it had absolutely catastrophic circumstances. She died for goodness sake.\" The Chestertons' concerns are shared by the British Medical Association (BMA). Dr Emma Runswick, BMA's deputy chair, said: \"It is definitely a problem that the roles of doctors and now physician assistants has been blurred and it's positive that their name is going to change, that there will be a uniform. \"But whilst they continue to be deployed in a way that mimics doctors at the behest of any local employer decision, we have to have ongoing concerns about their safety.\" But UMAPs, the trade union which represents both PAs and AAs, has warned the changes will undermine their qualifications and their role, lengthen waiting lists and worsen the impact of any strike action. \"By trying to placate them, at a time when they're striking - and they want their strikes to bite the hardest by taking us out of the workforce - we're now putting patients at risk,\" said Steve Nash, general secretary of UMAPs. \"I think the biggest patient safety risk, out there right now, is the BMA,\" he added. Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who ordered this review, is expected to implement all the recommendations of the report."

The US president told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday that he will meet with Sir Keir Starmer \"probably in Aberdeen\". Politics latest: Reeves committed to 'non-negotiable' fiscal rules Mr Trump is expected to travel to Scotland in the coming weeks to visit his golf courses ahead of an official state visit in September. \"We're going to be meeting with the British prime minister, very respectful, and we are going to have a meeting with him, probably in Aberdeen, and we're going to do a lot of different things. \"We're going to also refine the trade deal that we've made. \"So we'll be meeting mostly [...] at probably one of my properties, or maybe not, depending on what happens, but we'll be in Aberdeen, in Scotland, meeting with the prime minister.\" The UK and US signed a trade deal earlier this year that reduced car and aerospace tariffs, but questions have remained about a promise from Washington to slash steel tariffs. In May, the White House said it would exempt the UK from plans for a 25% tariff on global steel imports but that is yet to be ratified and the levy has since been doubled on all other countries. Mr Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of a metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, when wider \"Liberation Day\" tariff pauses were expected to expire, he would slap the UK with a 50% rate as well.  However that pause was extended until 1 August, with the US president saying nations would instead get letters informing them of his plans. As Sky News' economics and data editor Ed Conway has reported, the metals deal has floundered on two key issues, including that while the government has taken control of British Steel, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Downing Street is still hoping it can secure 0% tariffs on steel. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson played down the significance of the meeting in Scotland, stressing it was a private trip so it \"will not be a formal bilateral\". Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on countries across the world in a bid to boost domestic production and address trade deficits.

The UK was the first to hash out a deal on exemptions after a successful charm offensive by Sir Keir. Mr Trump has praised the PM, telling the BBC earlier on Tuesday: \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal.\" There are also plans for Scottish First Minister John Swinney to meet Mr Trump during his trip. It will be followed by the official state visit between 17-19 September, when Mr Trump will be hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle and accompanied by his wife Melania. It will be Mr Trump's second state visit to the UK, having previously been hosted during his first term in 2019."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @kvittozzi\n  Ava was heading home from Pizza Hut when she found out her dad had been arrested.   Warning: This article includes references to indecent images of children and suicide that some readers may find distressing It had been \"a really good evening\" celebrating her brother's birthday.  Ava (not her real name) was just 13, and her brother several years younger. Their parents had divorced a few years earlier and they were living with their mum.  Suddenly Ava's mum, sitting in the front car seat next to her new boyfriend, got a phone call.   \"She answered the phone and it was the police,\" Ava remembers.   \"I think they realised that there were children in the back so they kept it very minimal, but I could hear them speaking.\"   \"I was so scared,\" she says, as she overheard about his arrest.  \"I was panicking loads because my dad actually used to do a lot of speeding and I was like: 'Oh no, he's been caught speeding, he's going to get in trouble.'\"  But Ava wasn't told what had really happened until many weeks later, even though things changed immediately.  \"We found out that we weren't going to be able to see our dad for, well we didn't know how long for - but we weren't allowed to see him, or even speak to him. I couldn't text him or anything. I was just wondering what was going on, I didn't know. I didn't understand.\"  Ava's dad, John, had been arrested for looking at indecent images of children online.  We hear this first-hand from John (not his real name), who we interviewed separately from Ava.  What he told us about his offending was, of course, difficult to hear. His offending went on for several years, looking at indecent images and videos of young children. His own daughter told us she was \"repulsed\" by what he did. But John wanted to speak to us, frankly and honestly. He told us he was \"sorry\" for what he had done, and that it was only after counselling that he realised the \"actual impact on the people in the images\" of his crime. By sharing his story, he hopes to try to stop other people doing what he did and raise awareness about the impact this type of offence has - on everyone involved, including his unsuspecting family. John tells us he'd been looking at indecent images and videos of children since 2013.  \"I was on the internet, on a chat site,\" he says. \"Someone sent a link. I opened it, and that's what it was. \"Then more people started sending links and it just kind of gathered pace from there really. It kind of sucks you in without you even realising it. And it becomes almost like a drug, to, you know, get your next fix.\"  John says he got a \"sexual kick\" from looking at the images and claims \"at the time, when you're doing it, you don't realise how wrong it is\". 'I told them exactly what they would find' At the point of his arrest, John had around 1,000 indecent images and videos of children on his laptop - some were Category A, the most severe.  Referencing the counselling that he since received, John says he believes the abuse he received as a child affected the way he initially perceived what he was doing. \"I had this thing in my mind,\" he says, \"that the kids in these were enjoying it.\" \"Unfortunately, [that] was the way that my brain was wired up\" and \"I'm not proud of it\", he adds. John had been offending for several years when he downloaded an image that had been electronically tagged by security agencies. It flagged his location to police.  John was arrested at his work and says he \"straight away just admitted everything\". \"I told them exactly what they would find, and they found it.\" The police bailed John - and he describes the next 24 hours as \"hell\".  \"I wanted to kill myself,\" he remembers. \"It was the only way I could see out of the situation. I was just thinking about my family, my daughter and my son, how is it going to affect them?\"  But John says the police had given information about a free counselling service, a helpline, which he called that day.   \"It stopped me in my tracks and probably saved my life.\"  'My world was crumbling around me' Six weeks later, John was allowed to make contact with Ava.   By this point she describes how she was \"hysterically crying\" at school every day, not knowing what had happened to her dad.  But once he told her what he'd done, things got even worse.  \"When I found out, it genuinely felt like my world was crumbling around me,\" Ava says.  \"I felt like I couldn't tell anyone. I was so embarrassed of what people might think of me. It sounds so silly, but I was so scared that people would think that I would end up like him as well, which would never happen. \"It felt like this really big secret that I just had to hold in.\"  \"I genuinely felt like the only person that was going through something like this,\" Ava says.   She didn't know it then, but her father also had a sense of fear and shame. \"You can't share what you've done with anybody because people can get killed for things like that,\" he says. \"It would take a very, very brave man to go around telling people something like that.\"  And as for his kids? \"They wouldn't want to tell anybody, would they?\" he says.   For her, Ava says \"for a very, very long time\" things were \"incredibly dark\".   \"I turned to drugs,\" she says. \"I was doing lots of like Class As and Bs and going out all the time, I guess because it just was a form of escape. \"There was a point in my life where I just I didn't believe it was going to get better. I really just didn't want to exist. I was just like, if this is what life is like then why am I here?\"  'The trauma is huge for those children' Ava felt alone, but research shows this is happening to thousands of British children every year.   Whereas suspects like John are able to access free services, such as counselling, there are no similar automatic services for their children - unless families can pay.    Professor Rachel Armitage, a criminology expert, set up a Leeds-based charity called Talking Forward in 2021.  It's the only free, in-person, peer support group for families of suspected online child sex offenders in England. But it does not have the resources to provide support for under-18s.  \"The trauma is huge for those children,\" Prof Armitage says.  \"We have families that are paying for private therapy for their children and getting in a huge amount of debt to pay for that.\"  Prof Armitage says if these children were legally recognised as victims, then if would get them the right level of automatic, free support.   It's not unheard of for \"indirect\" or \"secondary\" victims to be recognised in law. Currently, the Domestic Abuse Act does that for children in a domestic abuse household, even if the child hasn't been a direct victim themselves.  In the case of children like Ava, Prof Armitage says it would mean \"they would have communication with the parents in terms of what was happening with this offence; they would get the therapeutic intervention and referral to school to let them know that something has happened, which that child needs consideration for\". We asked the Ministry of Justice whether children of online child sex offenders could be legally recognised as victims.   \"We sympathise with the challenges faced by the unsuspecting families of sex offenders and fund a helpline for prisoners' families which provides free and confidential support,\" a spokesperson said.  But when we spoke with that helpline, and several other charities that the Ministry of Justice said could help, they told us they could only help children with a parent in prison - which for online offences is, nowadays, rarely the outcome.   None of them could help children like Ava, whose dad received a three-year non-custodial sentence, and was put on the sex offenders' register for five years.  \"These children will absolutely fall through the gap,\" Prof Armitage says.  \"I think there's some sort of belief that these families are almost not deserving enough,\" she says. \"That there's some sort of hierarchy of harms, and that they're not harmed enough, really.\"  'People try to protect kids from people like me' Ava says there is simply not enough help - and that feels unfair.   \"In some ways we're kind of forgotten about by the services,\" she says. \"It's always about the offender.\"  John agrees with his daughter.  \"I think the children should get more support than the offender because nobody stops and ask them really, do they?\" he says. \"Nobody thinks about what they're going through.\"  Although Ava and John now see each other, they have never spoken about the impact that John's offending had on his daughter.   Ava was happy for us to share with John what she had gone through.   \"I never knew it was that bad,\" he says.  \"I understand that this is probably something that will affect her the rest of her life.   \"You try to protect your kids, don't you. People try to protect their kids from people like me.\" Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

        "Content": "\n          Health correspondent\n              @ashishskynews\n  The parents of a woman who died after her blood clot was misdiagnosed by someone who she thought was a doctor have called a government-ordered review \"a missed opportunity\". Marion and Brendan Chesterton have welcomed many of the recommendations in Professor Gillian Leng's review of the role that physician associates (PAs) perform in the NHS, but say \"they don't go far enough\". Emily died in November 2022 after suffering a pulmonary embolism. She went to see her GP twice in the weeks before her death - and on both occasions was seen by a physician associate who missed the blood clot and instead prescribed propranolol for anxiety. She had told her worried parents that she had been seen by a doctor, but she had not. Her father Brendan told Sky News: \"If she come out and said I've seen someone called the physician's associate I'm sure we would have insisted that, you know, let's go back and insist that you see a doctor. She never knew.\" Now a government-ordered review led by Prof Leng, president of the Royal Society of Medicine, has recommended NHS physician associates should be banned from diagnosing patients who have not already had contact with a doctor for their illness. The report suggests a major change to the role of PAs after it acknowledged they have been used as substitutes for doctors, despite having significantly less training. \n                  World's biggest human imaging project reaches new milestone after scanning 100,000th UK volunteer\n                 \n                  Measles 'circulating' in area where child died from disease, expert warns\n                 \n                  Child dies as measles cases surge at Liverpool hospital\n                 More than 3,500 PAs and 100 anaesthesia associates (AAs) are working in the NHS and there have been previous calls for an expansion in their number. But a general lack of support for the roles from the medical profession - plus high-profile deaths of patients who were misdiagnosed by PAs - led Health Secretary Wes Streeting to order a review. Presenting her findings, Prof Leng said: \"Crucially I'm recommending that PAs should not see undifferentiated or untriaged patients. \"If (patients) are triaged, they (PAs) should be able to see adult patients with minor ailments in line with relevant guidance from the Royal College of GPs.\" She said more detail was needed on which patients can be seen by PAs and national clinical protocols should be developed in this area. She added: \"Let's be clear, (the role of PAs) is working well in some places, but there indeed has been some substitution and any substitution is clearly risky and confusing for patients.\" Prof Leng also recommended PAs should be renamed \"physician assistants\" to position them \"as a supportive, complementary member of the medical team\" - and have standardised uniforms to distinguish them from doctors - while AAs should be renamed \"physician assistants in anaesthesia\". Newly qualified PAs should also work in hospitals for two years before they are allowed to work in GP surgeries or mental health trusts. The report said that while research suggests patients are satisfied after seeing a PA, some did not know they were not seeing a doctor. Prof Leng concluded there were \"no convincing reasons to abolish the roles of AA or PA\", but there is also no case \"for continuing with the roles unchanged\". Read more from Sky News:Human scanning project hits milestoneMeasles warning after child's deathDoctors' strikes are 'gift to Nigel Farage' She recommended that both PAs and AAs should have the opportunity for ongoing training and development, with potential to prescribe medicines in the future, and they should also have the opportunity to become an \"advanced\" PA or AA. Six patient deaths linked to contact with PAs have been recorded by coroners in England. Emily's mother Marion said some of the review's findings were significant and her daughter would still be alive if the recommendations had been in place when she fell ill. She said: \"I think so, yes, which is so important, which is why we're so pleased that this review has been made.\" But Mrs Chesterton added that more could have done, including stopping all PAs from prescribing drugs. \"We feel it's a missed opportunity. It could have gone all the way there and cleared things up totally. Our daughter died. She was prescribed a drug that she should not have been prescribed. And it had absolutely catastrophic circumstances. She died for goodness sake.\" The Chestertons' concerns are shared by the British Medical Association (BMA). Dr Emma Runswick, BMA's deputy chair, said: \"It is definitely a problem that the roles of doctors and now physician assistants has been blurred and it's positive that their name is going to change, that there will be a uniform. \"But whilst they continue to be deployed in a way that mimics doctors at the behest of any local employer decision, we have to have ongoing concerns about their safety.\" But UMAPs, the trade union which represents both PAs and AAs, has warned the changes will undermine their qualifications and their role, lengthen waiting lists and worsen the impact of any strike action. \"By trying to placate them, at a time when they're striking - and they want their strikes to bite the hardest by taking us out of the workforce - we're now putting patients at risk,\" said Steve Nash, general secretary of UMAPs. \"I think the biggest patient safety risk, out there right now, is the BMA,\" he added. Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who ordered this review, is expected to implement all the recommendations of the report."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Almost 7,000 Afghan nationals are being relocated to the UK following a massive data breach by the British military that successive governments tried to keep secret with a superinjunction. The blunder exposed the personal information of close to 20,000 individuals, endangering them and their families - with as many as 100,000 people impacted in total. The UK only informed everyone on Tuesday - three-and-a-half years after their data was compromised. Politics latest: Minister sorry after 'extraordinary secrecy' concealed data leak The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the relocation costs alone directly linked to the data breach will be around £850m. An internal government document from February this year said the cost could rise to £7bn, but an MoD spokesperson said that this was an outdated figure. However, the total cost to the taxpayer of existing schemes to assist Afghans who are deemed eligible for British support, as well as the additional cost from the breach, will come to at least £6bn. In addition, litigation against the UK arising from the mistake could add additional cost, as well as whatever the government has already spent on the superinjunction. Details about the blunder can finally be made public after a judge lifted the injunction that had been sought by the government.  Barings Law, a law firm that is representing around 1,000 of the victims, accused the government of trying to hide the truth from the public following a lengthy legal battle. Defence Secretary John Healey offered a \"sincere apology\" for the data breach in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He said he had felt \"deeply concerned about the lack of transparency\" around the data breach, adding: \"No government wishes to withhold information from the British public, from parliamentarians or the press in this manner.\" The previous Conservative government set up a secret scheme in 2023 - which can only now be revealed - to relocate Afghan nationals impacted by the data breach but who were not eligible for an existing programme to relocate and assist individuals who had worked for the British government in Afghanistan. Some 6,900 Afghans - comprising 1,500 people named on the list as well as their dependents - are being relocated to the UK as part of this programme. This comes on top of the many thousands more who are being moved until the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP). A lot of these individuals are also caught up in the data breach. The Times, which has been battling the injunction, said a total of 18,500 people have so far been relocated to the UK, including those directly impacted plus their dependents.

The rest of the affected Afghans will be left behind, the newspaper reported. How did the data breach happen? The disaster is thought to have been triggered by the careless handling of an email that contained a list of the names and other details of 18,714 Afghan nationals. They had been trying to apply to a British government scheme to support those who helped or worked with UK forces in Afghanistan that were fighting the Taliban between 2001 and 2021. The collapse of the western-backed Afghan government that year saw the Taliban return to power. The new government regards anyone who worked with British or other foreign forces during the previous two decades as a traitor. A source said a small number of people named on the list are known to have subsequently been killed, though it is not clear if this was a direct result of the data breach. It is also not clear whether the Taliban has the list - only that the MoD lost control of the information. Adnan Malik, head of data protection at Barings Law, said: \"This is an incredibly serious data breach, which the Ministry of Defence has repeatedly tried to hide from the British public. \"It involved the loss of personal and identifying information about Afghan nationals who have helped British forces to defeat terrorism and support security and stability in the region. \"A total of around 20,000 individuals have been affected, putting them and their loved ones at serious risk of violence from opponents and armed groups.\" The law firm is working with around 1,000 of those impacted \"to pursue potential legal action\". Read more:British couple held in AfghanistanICC prosecutor calls for arrest of Taliban duo It is thought that only a minority of the names on the list - about 10 to 15% - would have been eligible for help under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP). The breach occurred in February 2022, when Boris Johnson was prime minister, but was only discovered by the British military in August 2023. A superinjunction - preventing the reporting of the mistake - was imposed in September of that year. It meant the extraordinary - and costly - plan to transport thousands of Afghans to the UK took place in secret until now. Sir Keir Starmer's government inherited the scandal. In UK law, a superinjunction prevents the publication of certain information. However, unlike a regular injunction, it also prevents the media from reporting on the existence of the injunction itself. Superinjunctions can only be granted by the high court, with applicants required to meet stringent legal tests of necessity, proportionality and the risk of serious harm. They are most commonly used in cases involving breaches of privacy, confidential business information, or where there is a risk of significant reputational damage. Why was superinjunction lifted? An internal review into the affair was launched at the start of this year by Paul Rimmer, a retired civil servant. It played down the risk to those whose data is included in the breached dataset should it fall into the hands of the Taliban. The review said it was \"unlikely to substantially change an individual's existing exposure given the volume of data already available\". It also concluded that \"it appears unlikely that merely being on the dataset would be grounds for targeting\" and it is \"therefore also unlikely that family members... will be targeted simply because the 'principal' appears... in the dataset\". This is why a High Court judge ruled that the superinjunction could be lifted. Mr Malik, however, said that he believes there is still a risk to those named in the breach. He added: \"Our claimants continue to live with the fear of reprisal against them and their families, when they should have been met with gratitude and discretion for their service. \"We would expect substantial financial payments for each claimant in any future legal action. While this will not fully undo the harm they have been exposed to, it will enable them to move forward and rebuild their lives.\" Latest MoD data breach While the MoD's data breach is by far the largest involving Afghan nationals, it is not the first. Earlier this month, the MoD said Afghans impacted by a separate mistake could claim up to £4,000 in compensation four years after the incident happened. Human error resulted in the personal information of 265 Afghans who had worked alongside British troops being shared with hundreds of others who were on the same email distribution list in September 2021. In December 2023, the UK Information Commissioner fined the MoD £350,000 and said the \"egregious\" breach could have been life-threatening."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The chancellor has confirmed she is considering \"changes\" to ISAs - and said there has been too much focus on the \"risk\" of consumers investing. In her second annual Mansion House speech to the financial sector, Rachel Reeves said she recognised \"differing views\" over the popular tax-free savings accounts, in which savers can currently put up to £20,000 a year. She was reportedly considering reducing the annual limit for cash ISAs to as low as £4,000 a year, in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead. However, the chancellor has shelved any immediate planned changes after a fierce backlash from building societies and consumer groups. In her speech to key industry figures on last night, Ms Reeves said: \"I will continue to consider further changes to ISAs, engaging widely over the coming months and recognising that despite the differing views on the right approach, we are united in wanting better outcomes for both savers and for the UK economy.\" She added: \"For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks, without giving proper weight to the benefits.\" Read analysis from our economics editor Ed Conway  Ms Reeves's speech, the first major one since the welfare bill climbdown two weeks ago, appeared to encourage regulators to focus less on risks and more on the benefits of investing in things like the stock market and government bonds (loans issued by states to raise funds with an interest rate paid in return). She welcomed action by the financial regulator to review risk warning rules and the campaign to promote retail investment, which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is launching next year. \"Our tangled system of financial advice and guidance has meant that people cannot get the right support to make decisions for themselves\", Ms Reeves told the event in London.

The fact that she didn't should send a shiver down the spine of taxpayers across the country.\" 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈   The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, also spoke at the Mansion House event and said Donald Trump's taxes on US imports would slow the economy and trade imbalances should be addressed. \"Increasing tariffs creates the risk of fragmenting the world economy, and thereby reducing activity\", he said."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  The real story from Tuesday night's Mansion House was more what didn't happen than what did happen. These speeches are traditionally the chancellor's big annual opportunity to announce reforms to the financial sector, and to the way the government taxes and regulates the money system. Speculation was rife in the run-up to this one that Rachel Reeves would impose new constraints on the amount that people can put into tax-free ISA savings. Some wondered, too, whether the chancellor would impose new taxes on the banking system, softening the blow slightly by loosening the capital requirements and certification rules that make it harder to recruit top bankers. In the event, neither happened. The chancellor did not announce any changes to the ISA scheme, though she added that she \"will continue to consider further changes to ISAs\". She didn't announce an increase of the bank levy, as some suspected, though she did loosen some of the regulations facing bankers. \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves considering 'changes' to ISAs - and says there's too much focus on 'risk' in investing\n                 \n                  Is there £15bn of wiggle room in Rachel Reeves's fiscal rules?\n                 \n                  Can Rachel make things cheaper?\n                 Read more:Should you get Lifetime ISA? Two key issues to considerIs there £15bn of wiggle room in Reeves's fiscal rules? There was a host of other plans announced, collected into a package Ms Reeves has dubbed the \"Leeds Reforms\" (after the city which contains her constituency - also home to many financial firms). The chancellor said these amounted to \"the most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\". But given the previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, made very similar noises three years ago when he announced his own \"Edinburgh Reforms\", and given many in the financial sector judge that very little has changed, you have reason to be a little sceptical. Impactful reforms  None of which is to say you won't be affected by any of the reforms announced on Tuesday night. If you are planning to buy a home, one change just announced (actually by the Bank of England, not the Treasury) should serve to make more high loan-to-value mortgages available for buyers - in particular, mortgages at more than 4.5 times a buyer's income. However, perhaps the most significant of all the elements of the chancellor's speech wasn't the \"Leeds Reforms\" or the fact that there weren't changes to the ISA regime or the bank levy - it was the fiscal elephant in the room. Because only a couple of weeks ago, everything changed. The government performed a drastic u-turn on its welfare reforms, leaving a gaping hole in the public finances, that (all else equal) will have to be filled with either higher taxes, less spending or more borrowing. Shortly afterwards, the chancellor was pictured in tears in the House of Commons. Markets responded dramatically. This was the chancellor's first speech since that moment. So the real question on Tuesday night was whether she would refer either to the black hole or to the tears. Well, there was a glancing reference to the latter. Referring to a recent visit to a school, where she was asked what job she most wanted in the world, the chancellor said: \"Given the events of the last few weeks, I suspect many of you would sympathise if I had said: 'anything but chancellor.' \"But I didn't. \"I am proud to stand here tonight and address you for a second time at Mansion House as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" Speaking of the fiscal rules hemming her in, she also said: \"This government and I remain committed to our non-negotiable rules.\" All of which raises the question: how will the government meet those rules? The most likely answer is: higher taxes. The real question is: which taxes, and when do we learn about them? The Mansion House speech provided no further answers."

Bradley John Murdoch murdered the 28-year-old and assaulted his girlfriend Joanne Lees at gunpoint on a remote stretch of road near Barrow Creek in Australia's Northern Territory on 14 July 2001. Mr Falconio and Ms Lees, both from Yorkshire, had stopped their camper van after Murdoch pulled up beside them, claiming to have seen sparks coming from their vehicle. He shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the van, before forcing Ms Lees into his vehicle and binding her wrists with cable ties. She managed to escape, hiding in the outback for hours before flagging down a passing truck. Murdoch was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for at least 28 years. The 67-year-old was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was moved to palliative care from Alice Springs Correctional Centre last month. A Northern Territory Department of Corrections spokesperson said: \"I can confirm that Bradley Murdoch passed away last night in the palliative care unit at Alice Springs Hospital. \"The death will be subject to investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner.\" During his trial, prosecutors argued that Murdoch was likely to have disposed of Mr Falconio's body somewhere in the vast, remote expanse of desert between Alice Springs and Broome, covering more than 1,200 miles. Despite repeated searches, the body has never been found.

In May, the White House said it would exempt the UK from plans for a 25% tariff on global steel imports but that is yet to be ratified and the levy has since been doubled on all other countries. Mr Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of a metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, when wider \"Liberation Day\" tariff pauses were expected to expire, he would slap the UK with a 50% rate as well.  However that pause was extended until 1 August, with the US president saying nations would instead get letters informing them of his plans. As Sky News' economics and data editor Ed Conway has reported, the metals deal has floundered on two key issues, including that while the government has taken control of British Steel, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Downing Street is still hoping it can secure 0% tariffs on steel. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson played down the significance of the meeting in Scotland, stressing it was a private trip so it \"will not be a formal bilateral\". Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on countries across the world in a bid to boost domestic production and address trade deficits.

Mr Trump has praised the PM, telling the BBC earlier on Tuesday: \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal.\" There are also plans for Scottish First Minister John Swinney to meet Mr Trump during his trip. It will be followed by the official state visit between 17-19 September, when Mr Trump will be hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle and accompanied by his wife Melania. It will be Mr Trump's second state visit to the UK, having previously been hosted during his first term in 2019."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Almost 7,000 Afghan nationals are being relocated to the UK following a massive data breach by the British military that successive governments tried to keep secret with a superinjunction. The blunder exposed the personal information of close to 20,000 individuals, endangering them and their families - with as many as 100,000 people impacted in total. The UK only informed everyone on Tuesday - three-and-a-half years after their data was compromised. Politics latest: Minister sorry after 'extraordinary secrecy' concealed data leak The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the relocation costs alone directly linked to the data breach will be around £850m. An internal government document from February this year said the cost could rise to £7bn, but an MoD spokesperson said that this was an outdated figure. However, the total cost to the taxpayer of existing schemes to assist Afghans who are deemed eligible for British support, as well as the additional cost from the breach, will come to at least £6bn. In addition, litigation against the UK arising from the mistake could add additional cost, as well as whatever the government has already spent on the superinjunction. Details about the blunder can finally be made public after a judge lifted the injunction that had been sought by the government.  Barings Law, a law firm that is representing around 1,000 of the victims, accused the government of trying to hide the truth from the public following a lengthy legal battle. Defence Secretary John Healey offered a \"sincere apology\" for the data breach in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He said he had felt \"deeply concerned about the lack of transparency\" around the data breach, adding: \"No government wishes to withhold information from the British public, from parliamentarians or the press in this manner.\" The previous Conservative government set up a secret scheme in 2023 - which can only now be revealed - to relocate Afghan nationals impacted by the data breach but who were not eligible for an existing programme to relocate and assist individuals who had worked for the British government in Afghanistan. Some 6,900 Afghans - comprising 1,500 people named on the list as well as their dependents - are being relocated to the UK as part of this programme. This comes on top of the many thousands more who are being moved until the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP). A lot of these individuals are also caught up in the data breach. The Times, which has been battling the injunction, said a total of 18,500 people have so far been relocated to the UK, including those directly impacted plus their dependents. Read more:'My family is finished': Afghan man in UK military data breach says he feels betrayedAnalysis: Retreat from Afghanistan began as a farce, then it was a scandal, now it's a cover-up 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Some 5,400 more Afghans who have already received invitation letters will be flown to the UK in the coming weeks, bringing the total number of Afghans affected by the breach being brought to the UK to 23,900. The rest of the affected Afghans will be left behind, the newspaper reported. How did the data breach happen? The disaster is thought to have been triggered by the careless handling of an email that contained a list of the names and other details of 18,714 Afghan nationals. They had been trying to apply to a British government scheme to support those who helped or worked with UK forces in Afghanistan that were fighting the Taliban between 2001 and 2021. The collapse of the western-backed Afghan government that year saw the Taliban return to power. The new government regards anyone who worked with British or other foreign forces during the previous two decades as a traitor. A source said a small number of people named on the list are known to have subsequently been killed, though it is not clear if this was a direct result of the data breach. It is also not clear whether the Taliban has the list - only that the MoD lost control of the information. Adnan Malik, head of data protection at Barings Law, said: \"This is an incredibly serious data breach, which the Ministry of Defence has repeatedly tried to hide from the British public. \"It involved the loss of personal and identifying information about Afghan nationals who have helped British forces to defeat terrorism and support security and stability in the region. \"A total of around 20,000 individuals have been affected, putting them and their loved ones at serious risk of violence from opponents and armed groups.\" The law firm is working with around 1,000 of those impacted \"to pursue potential legal action\". Read more:British couple held in AfghanistanICC prosecutor calls for arrest of Taliban duo It is thought that only a minority of the names on the list - about 10 to 15% - would have been eligible for help under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP). The breach occurred in February 2022, when Boris Johnson was prime minister, but was only discovered by the British military in August 2023. A superinjunction - preventing the reporting of the mistake - was imposed in September of that year. It meant the extraordinary - and costly - plan to transport thousands of Afghans to the UK took place in secret until now. Sir Keir Starmer's government inherited the scandal. In UK law, a superinjunction prevents the publication of certain information. However, unlike a regular injunction, it also prevents the media from reporting on the existence of the injunction itself. Superinjunctions can only be granted by the high court, with applicants required to meet stringent legal tests of necessity, proportionality and the risk of serious harm. They are most commonly used in cases involving breaches of privacy, confidential business information, or where there is a risk of significant reputational damage. Why was superinjunction lifted? An internal review into the affair was launched at the start of this year by Paul Rimmer, a retired civil servant. It played down the risk to those whose data is included in the breached dataset should it fall into the hands of the Taliban. The review said it was \"unlikely to substantially change an individual's existing exposure given the volume of data already available\". It also concluded that \"it appears unlikely that merely being on the dataset would be grounds for targeting\" and it is \"therefore also unlikely that family members... will be targeted simply because the 'principal' appears... in the dataset\". This is why a High Court judge ruled that the superinjunction could be lifted. Mr Malik, however, said that he believes there is still a risk to those named in the breach. He added: \"Our claimants continue to live with the fear of reprisal against them and their families, when they should have been met with gratitude and discretion for their service. \"We would expect substantial financial payments for each claimant in any future legal action. While this will not fully undo the harm they have been exposed to, it will enable them to move forward and rebuild their lives.\" Latest MoD data breach While the MoD's data breach is by far the largest involving Afghan nationals, it is not the first. Earlier this month, the MoD said Afghans impacted by a separate mistake could claim up to £4,000 in compensation four years after the incident happened. Human error resulted in the personal information of 265 Afghans who had worked alongside British troops being shared with hundreds of others who were on the same email distribution list in September 2021. In December 2023, the UK Information Commissioner fined the MoD £350,000 and said the \"egregious\" breach could have been life-threatening."

The farce was when the then foreign secretary Dominic Raab remained on his holiday sunbed in Crete rather than return to work during the height of the evacuation crisis. Politics latest: Minister sorry after 'extraordinary secrecy' concealed data leak It was a scandal because around 200 people were killed in the chaos, with distressing pictures of terrified Afghans clinging to the wings of moving aeroplanes at Kabul airport. And now we learn that in a massive cover-up, the Tory government of Rishi Sunak took out a superinjunction to gag the media from reporting a data breach that put 20,000 Afghans in danger. Over the years, superinjunctions granted by UK courts have been condemned for enabling celebrities and sports stars to cover-up extra-marital affairs, drug-taking and other secrets. The superinjunction granted to the government in 2023 to conceal a secret scheme to relocate Afghan nationals was obviously entirely different and no doubt sought for honourable motives. \n                  'My family is finished': Afghan man in UK military data breach says he feels betrayed\n                 \n                  Why was the Afghan data leak kept secret for 600 days? \n                 \n                  Almost 7,000 Afghans being relocated to UK in secret scheme after MoD data breach\n                 But it was a cover-up nonetheless and not so honourable because it hid a data blunder exposing names and contact details of 18,000 people who had applied for asylum in the UK under a resettlement scheme. The scheme had been set up by the government in 2021 to provide asylum for people who had worked with the UK armed forces and could be at risk of Taliban reprisals for working with western forces. In the Commons, the current defence secretary, John Healey, said it was \"deeply uncomfortable\" to be prevented from reporting the data breach blunder to MPs until now. Read More:'My family is finished': Afghan man in UK military data breach says he feels betrayedAlmost 7,000 Afghans being relocated to UK in secret scheme after MoD data breach  The ministers involved in seeking the gagging order were the former defence secretary Ben Wallace and the then armed forces minister James Heappey, he said. But while most MPs welcomed Mr Healey's apology, it's probably fair to say that if it hadn't been for tenacious campaigning by media organisations the superinjunction might not have been lifted by the High Court. One Tory MP, Mark Pritchard, accused the defence secretary of \"wriggling\" and said: \"The fact is that he is justifying this superinjunction and not telling parliament, the press, the public and, unbelievably, the Afghans who were potentially in harm's way.\" And, among a number of individual cases highlighted by MPs, Liberal Democrat Calum Miller told MPs that \"in the chaos of withdrawal\" a constituent who left Afghanistan was promised by British officials that his pregnant wife could follow him. \"Two years later, we have still not kept that promise,\" said Mr Miller. \"My constituent's wife and child continue to move around in Afghanistan to evade the Taliban and my constituent is so desperate that he is talking about returning to Afghanistan - despite the risk to him - to be reunited with them.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈  Reform UK's Zia Yusuf hit out at the Tory government's asylum policy, writing on X: \"24k Afghans secretly granted asylum, costing British taxpayers up to £7bn. \"The government covered it up.

Immigration minister: Robert Jenrick.\" Later, Mr Healey was asked on LBC's News Agents podcast if the official responsible for the data breach is still employed by the government. \"They are no longer doing the same job on the Afghan brief,\" he replied. Hmm. That suggests the person hasn't been fired, which will alarm those MPs who remain extremely concerned about this whole fiasco. Asked whether he would have taken out the superinjunction if he had been defence secretary in 2023, he replied: \"Very, very unlikely.\" But when he was asked if he could rule out the use of superinjunctions by the Ministry of Defence in the future, Mr Healey said: \"Well, you can never say never.\" So while Mr Healey will obviously be determined to avoid a farce in future, it appears that the threat of another Ministry of Defence cover-up in future hasn't gone away."

        "Content": "A British pensioner has been arrested in Spain after allegedly attempting to smuggle more than 60kg of cannabis resin on to a ferry. The man was detained after police discovered the drug in a UK-registered vehicle at Ceuta, Spain's North African enclave, on Sunday evening. The Civil Guard said the car was bound for the port of Algeciras, with the 62.3kg of cannabis \"hidden\" in a concealed compartment built into the roof of the vehicle. The packages were branded with names including \"dream gelato\" and \"cereal milk\". The force said officers carried out a thorough search of the car after being alerted by a sniffer dog. The Civil Guard said the arrested driver was a UK native and resident, and was born in 1956, making him 68 or 69.

        "Content": "The man who murdered British backpacker Peter Falconio more than 20 years ago has died - without revealing the location of his victim's remains.  Bradley John Murdoch murdered the 28-year-old and assaulted his girlfriend Joanne Lees at gunpoint on a remote stretch of road near Barrow Creek in Australia's Northern Territory on 14 July 2001. Mr Falconio and Ms Lees, both from Yorkshire, had stopped their camper van after Murdoch pulled up beside them, claiming to have seen sparks coming from their vehicle. He shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the van, before forcing Ms Lees into his vehicle and binding her wrists with cable ties. She managed to escape, hiding in the outback for hours before flagging down a passing truck. Murdoch was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for at least 28 years. The 67-year-old was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was moved to palliative care from Alice Springs Correctional Centre last month. A Northern Territory Department of Corrections spokesperson said: \"I can confirm that Bradley Murdoch passed away last night in the palliative care unit at Alice Springs Hospital. \"The death will be subject to investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner.\" During his trial, prosecutors argued that Murdoch was likely to have disposed of Mr Falconio's body somewhere in the vast, remote expanse of desert between Alice Springs and Broome, covering more than 1,200 miles. Despite repeated searches, the body has never been found.

Last month police announced a new 500,000 Australian dollar (£240,000) reward for information leading to the discovery of Mr Falconio's remains."

On Saturday, the Barcelona and Spain winger hosted a massive party attended by teammates, celebrities, musicians, YouTubers and influencers. According to local reports and social media footage, a number of people with dwarfism attended the party to entertain the guests. Spain's Association of People with Achondroplasia and other Skeletal Dysplasias (ADEE) said the incident violates disability rights law in the country, adding it will take legal action. ADEE president Carolina Puente said: \"It's unacceptable that in the 21st century, people with dwarfism are still used for entertainment at private parties, particularly when public figures are involved. \"The dignity and rights of our community cannot be a source of amusement under any circumstance.\" Jesus Martin Blanco, director general for the rights of persons with disabilities in Spain's Ministry of Social Rights, has also called for an investigation. He told Spanish news agency EFE, via Cadena Ser, he was concerned that \"a guy who has so many followers, an influencer for young people, is throwing this kind of party that can have a knock-on effect on young people\". \"The law is for everyone, for the humble and for the powerful,\" he added.

The US president told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday that he will meet with Sir Keir Starmer \"probably in Aberdeen\". Politics latest: Reeves committed to 'non-negotiable' fiscal rules Mr Trump is expected to travel to Scotland in the coming weeks to visit his golf courses ahead of an official state visit in September. \"We're going to be meeting with the British prime minister, very respectful, and we are going to have a meeting with him, probably in Aberdeen, and we're going to do a lot of different things. \"We're going to also refine the trade deal that we've made. \"So we'll be meeting mostly [...] at probably one of my properties, or maybe not, depending on what happens, but we'll be in Aberdeen, in Scotland, meeting with the prime minister.\" The UK and US signed a trade deal earlier this year that reduced car and aerospace tariffs, but questions have remained about a promise from Washington to slash steel tariffs. In May, the White House said it would exempt the UK from plans for a 25% tariff on global steel imports but that is yet to be ratified and the levy has since been doubled on all other countries. Mr Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of a metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, when wider \"Liberation Day\" tariff pauses were expected to expire, he would slap the UK with a 50% rate as well.  However that pause was extended until 1 August, with the US president saying nations would instead get letters informing them of his plans. As Sky News' economics and data editor Ed Conway has reported, the metals deal has floundered on two key issues, including that while the government has taken control of British Steel, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Downing Street is still hoping it can secure 0% tariffs on steel. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson played down the significance of the meeting in Scotland, stressing it was a private trip so it \"will not be a formal bilateral\". Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on countries across the world in a bid to boost domestic production and address trade deficits.

Mr Trump has praised the PM, telling the BBC earlier on Tuesday: \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal.\" There are also plans for Scottish First Minister John Swinney to meet Mr Trump during his trip. It will be followed by the official state visit between 17-19 September, when Mr Trump will be hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle and accompanied by his wife Melania. It will be Mr Trump's second state visit to the UK, having previously been hosted during his first term in 2019."

Naibel Benavides was stargazing at the time of the collision, which sent her flying 22m (75ft) through the air in Florida. Her boyfriend was seriously injured in the 2019 incident, while her body was discovered in a wooded area. George McGee, the Tesla's driver, is not a plaintiff - and reached a separate settlement with the victims' families. Lawyers argue that the car's driver assistance feature should have warned the driver and braked before the collision. It is alleged the Model S sedan blew through red lights and a stop sign at nearly 70mph.

According to Sky's US partner network NBC News, Elon Musk was not in court as jury selection took place on Monday. Three potential jurors said they would struggle to be fair and impartial to Tesla because of the company's \"ethics and ownership\". After the jury was selected, a lawyer representing the victims said: \"Evidence will show for years before and after this crime, Tesla ignored warnings.\" They added: \"This is a case about shared responsibility. Tesla will take no responsibility for the failures of their Autopilot system. Evidence will show that every actor needs a stage and Tesla set the stage for the preventable actions that bring us here.\" The jury was also told that evidence will be introduced where Musk publicly declared that Tesla vehicles were \"safer than a human\"."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The chancellor has confirmed she is considering \"changes\" to ISAs - and said there has been too much focus on the \"risk\" of consumers investing. In her second annual Mansion House speech to the financial sector, Rachel Reeves said she recognised \"differing views\" over the popular tax-free savings accounts, in which savers can currently put up to £20,000 a year. She was reportedly considering reducing the annual limit for cash ISAs to as low as £4,000 a year, in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead. However, the chancellor has shelved any immediate planned changes after a fierce backlash from building societies and consumer groups. In her speech to key industry figures on last night, Ms Reeves said: \"I will continue to consider further changes to ISAs, engaging widely over the coming months and recognising that despite the differing views on the right approach, we are united in wanting better outcomes for both savers and for the UK economy.\" She added: \"For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks, without giving proper weight to the benefits.\" Read analysis from our economics editor Ed Conway  Ms Reeves's speech, the first major one since the welfare bill climbdown two weeks ago, appeared to encourage regulators to focus less on risks and more on the benefits of investing in things like the stock market and government bonds (loans issued by states to raise funds with an interest rate paid in return). She welcomed action by the financial regulator to review risk warning rules and the campaign to promote retail investment, which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is launching next year. \"Our tangled system of financial advice and guidance has meant that people cannot get the right support to make decisions for themselves\", Ms Reeves told the event in London.

These speeches are traditionally the chancellor's big annual opportunity to announce reforms to the financial sector, and to the way the government taxes and regulates the money system. Speculation was rife in the run-up to this one that Rachel Reeves would impose new constraints on the amount that people can put into tax-free ISA savings. Some wondered, too, whether the chancellor would impose new taxes on the banking system, softening the blow slightly by loosening the capital requirements and certification rules that make it harder to recruit top bankers. In the event, neither happened. The chancellor did not announce any changes to the ISA scheme, though she added that she \"will continue to consider further changes to ISAs\". She didn't announce an increase of the bank levy, as some suspected, though she did loosen some of the regulations facing bankers. \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves considering 'changes' to ISAs - and says there's too much focus on 'risk' in investing\n                 \n                  Is there £15bn of wiggle room in Rachel Reeves's fiscal rules?\n                 \n                  Can Rachel make things cheaper?\n                 Read more:Should you get Lifetime ISA? Two key issues to considerIs there £15bn of wiggle room in Reeves's fiscal rules? There was a host of other plans announced, collected into a package Ms Reeves has dubbed the \"Leeds Reforms\" (after the city which contains her constituency - also home to many financial firms). The chancellor said these amounted to \"the most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\". But given the previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, made very similar noises three years ago when he announced his own \"Edinburgh Reforms\", and given many in the financial sector judge that very little has changed, you have reason to be a little sceptical. Impactful reforms  None of which is to say you won't be affected by any of the reforms announced on Tuesday night. If you are planning to buy a home, one change just announced (actually by the Bank of England, not the Treasury) should serve to make more high loan-to-value mortgages available for buyers - in particular, mortgages at more than 4.5 times a buyer's income. However, perhaps the most significant of all the elements of the chancellor's speech wasn't the \"Leeds Reforms\" or the fact that there weren't changes to the ISA regime or the bank levy - it was the fiscal elephant in the room. Because only a couple of weeks ago, everything changed. The government performed a drastic u-turn on its welfare reforms, leaving a gaping hole in the public finances, that (all else equal) will have to be filled with either higher taxes, less spending or more borrowing. Shortly afterwards, the chancellor was pictured in tears in the House of Commons. Markets responded dramatically. This was the chancellor's first speech since that moment. So the real question on Tuesday night was whether she would refer either to the black hole or to the tears. Well, there was a glancing reference to the latter. Referring to a recent visit to a school, where she was asked what job she most wanted in the world, the chancellor said: \"Given the events of the last few weeks, I suspect many of you would sympathise if I had said: 'anything but chancellor.' \"But I didn't. \"I am proud to stand here tonight and address you for a second time at Mansion House as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" Speaking of the fiscal rules hemming her in, she also said: \"This government and I remain committed to our non-negotiable rules.\" All of which raises the question: how will the government meet those rules? The most likely answer is: higher taxes. The real question is: which taxes, and when do we learn about them? The Mansion House speech provided no further answers."

The US president told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday that he will meet with Sir Keir Starmer \"probably in Aberdeen\". Politics latest: Reeves committed to 'non-negotiable' fiscal rules Mr Trump is expected to travel to Scotland in the coming weeks to visit his golf courses ahead of an official state visit in September. \"We're going to be meeting with the British prime minister, very respectful, and we are going to have a meeting with him, probably in Aberdeen, and we're going to do a lot of different things. \"We're going to also refine the trade deal that we've made. \"So we'll be meeting mostly [...] at probably one of my properties, or maybe not, depending on what happens, but we'll be in Aberdeen, in Scotland, meeting with the prime minister.\" The UK and US signed a trade deal earlier this year that reduced car and aerospace tariffs, but questions have remained about a promise from Washington to slash steel tariffs. In May, the White House said it would exempt the UK from plans for a 25% tariff on global steel imports but that is yet to be ratified and the levy has since been doubled on all other countries. Mr Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of a metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, when wider \"Liberation Day\" tariff pauses were expected to expire, he would slap the UK with a 50% rate as well.  However that pause was extended until 1 August, with the US president saying nations would instead get letters informing them of his plans. As Sky News' economics and data editor Ed Conway has reported, the metals deal has floundered on two key issues, including that while the government has taken control of British Steel, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Downing Street is still hoping it can secure 0% tariffs on steel. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson played down the significance of the meeting in Scotland, stressing it was a private trip so it \"will not be a formal bilateral\". Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on countries across the world in a bid to boost domestic production and address trade deficits.

The UK was the first to hash out a deal on exemptions after a successful charm offensive by Sir Keir. Mr Trump has praised the PM, telling the BBC earlier on Tuesday: \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal.\" There are also plans for Scottish First Minister John Swinney to meet Mr Trump during his trip. It will be followed by the official state visit between 17-19 September, when Mr Trump will be hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle and accompanied by his wife Melania. It will be Mr Trump's second state visit to the UK, having previously been hosted during his first term in 2019."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The taxpayer is to help drive the switch to non-polluting vehicles through a new grant of up to £3,750, but some of the cheapest electric cars are to be excluded. The Department for Transport (DfT) said a £650m fund was being made available for the Electric Car Grant, which is due to get into gear from Wednesday. Users of the scheme - the first of its kind since the last Conservative government scrapped grants for new electric vehicles three years ago - will be able to secure discounts based on the \"sustainability\" of the car. Money latest: easyJet bereavement policy faces refund question It will apply only to vehicles with a list price of £37,000 or below - with only the greenest models eligible for the highest grant. Buyers of so-called 'Band two' vehicles can receive up to £1,500. The qualification criteria includes a recognition of a vehicle's carbon footprint from manufacture to showroom so UK-produced EVs, costing less than £37,000, would be expected to qualify for the top grant. \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves considering 'changes' to ISAs - and says there's too much focus on 'risk' in investing\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \n                  Trump to 'refine trade deal' with UK during Scotland trip\n                 It is understood that Chinese-produced EVs - often the cheapest in the market - would not. DfT said 33 new electric car models were currently available for less than £30,000. The government has been encouraged to act as sales of new electric vehicles are struggling to keep pace with what is needed to meet emissions targets. Challenges include the high prices for electric cars when compared to conventionally powered models. At the same time, consumer and business budgets have been squeezed since the 2022 cost of living crisis - and households and businesses are continuing to feel the pinch to this day. Another key concern is the state of the public charging network.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: \"This EV grant will not only allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money - it'll help our automotive sector seize one of the biggest opportunities of the 21st century. \"And with over 82,000 public charge points now available across the UK, we've built the infrastructure families need to make the switch with confidence.\" The Government has pledged to ban the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030 but has allowed non-plug in hybrid sales to continue until 2025. It is hoped the grants will enable the industry to meet and even exceed the current zero emission vehicle mandate. Under the rules, at least 28% of new cars sold by each manufacturer in the UK this year must be zero emission. The figure stood at 21.6% during the first half of the year. Read more from Sky News:Premier League club Brentford to sell stake at £400m valuationPost Office transformation effort gets £118m funding boost The car industry has long complained that it has had to foot a multi-billion pound bill to woo buyers for electric cars through \"unsustainable\" discounting. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the grants sent a \"clear signal to consumers that now is the time to switch\". He went on: \"Rapid deployment and availability of this grant over the next few years will help provide the momentum that is essential to take the EV market from just one in four today, to four in five by the end of the decade.\" But the Conservatives questioned whether taxpayers should be footing the bill. Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility made clear the transition to EVs comes at a cost, and this scheme only adds to it. \"Make no mistake: more tax rises are coming in the autumn.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n Crisis-hit Thames Water has reported a £1.65bn annual loss, rising debts, and warned that it will take \"at least a decade\" to turn around its fortunes if it swerves the threat of nationalisation. The UK's largest water provider, which is still scrambling to secure a restructuring of its debts and injection of new funds to avert a possible collapse, suffered a series of hits to its bottom line in the year to the end of March. Within its loss for the period, compared with a £157m profit over the previous 12 months, Thames recorded a £1.27bn provision against a loan from its parent company. There were also hits from £198m in restructuring plan fees and £151m of restructuring costs. Included too was a £122m fine from the industry regulator related to poor wastewater performance and dividend payouts. It admitted that sewage spills were up by a third on the 2023/24 financial year - a fact it blamed on higher than average rainfall. Net debt rose from £15.3bn to £16.8bn.  The company is trying to win approval for a rescue plan funded by its senior creditors after the investment giant lined up to rescue Thames Water pulled out of a proposed deal. KKR had been given preferred bidder status in March before its exit from the process was revealed in June. Thames said in its results there was a \"material uncertainty\" as to whether it could deliver the recapitalisation, leaving it at risk of a special administration process.  Commenting on the company's performance, chief executive Chris Weston said: \"We recognise that our current gearing is too high and, to address this, we are progressing with our senior creditors' plan to recapitalise the business which will see us return to a more stable financial foundation. \"This will come with a requirement to re-set the regulatory landscape and acknowledge it will take at least a decade to turn Thames around.\" The last remark amounts to a warning shot that Thames needs to be shielded from the prospect of further fines for poor performance and handed an improved five-year bill settlement. It had appealed against Ofwat's determination for the period covering 2025-30 which allowed for a 35% hike to bills to help fund vital infrastructure improvements. That appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority is currently on hold. Mr Weston, along with other senior directors, gave evidence to a committee of MPs shortly after the publication of its annual report. They were recalled to the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs committee following a bruising session held in May. Chairman Sir Adrian Montague apologised to the MPs after Thames was accused of a lack of transparency and \"game-playing\" in several key areas. Committee chair Alistair Carmichael said the company risked being found in contempt of Parliament unless Thames handed over board meeting documents requested by the committee related to the bidding process. The company, which serves almost 16 million customers across southeast England, is currently grappling its drought readiness, having announced on Monday that households across four counties were facing usage restrictions. A leak has also meant parts of southeast and southwest London had low or no water pressure on Tuesday due to a broken pipe. Mr Weston told the MPs Thames was \"taking huge steps to improve our position around pollutions\" but to \"transform this company is going to take between five and 10 years, maybe a bit more\"."

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n Are Rachel Reeves's fiscal rules quite as iron clad as she insists? How tough is her armour really? And is there actually scope for some change, some loosening to avoid big tax hikes in the autumn? We've had a bit of clarity early this morning - and that's a question we discuss on the Politics at Sam and Anne's podcast today. Politics Live: Reeves to reform financial regulations And tens of billions of pounds of borrowing depends on the answer - which still feels intriguingly opaque. You might think you know what the fiscal rules are. And you might think you know they're not negotiable. For instance, the main fiscal rule says that from 2029-30, the government's day-to-day spending needs to be in surplus - i.e. rely on taxation alone, not borrowing. And Rachel Reeves has been clear - that's not going to change, and there's no disputing this. But when the government announced its fiscal rules in October, it actually published a 19-page document - a \"charter\" - alongside this. And this contains all sorts of notes and caveats. And it's slightly unclear which are subject to the \"iron clad\" promise - and which aren't. There's one part of that document coming into focus - with sources telling me that it could get changed. And it's this - a little-known buffer built into the rules. It's outlined in paragraph 3.6 on page four of the Charter for Budget Responsibility. This says that from spring 2027, if the OBR forecasts that she still actually has a deficit of up to 0.5% of GDP in three years, she will still be judged to be within the rules. In other words, if in spring 2027 she's judged to have missed her fiscal rules by perhaps as much as £15bn, that's fine. Now there's a caveat - this exemption only applies, providing at the following budget the chancellor reduces that deficit back to zero. But still, it's potentially helpful wiggle room. This help - this buffer - for Reeves doesn't apply today, or for the next couple of years - it only kicks in from the spring of 2027. But I'm being told by a source that some of this might change and the ability to use this wiggle room could be brought forward to this year. Could she give herself a get out of jail card? The chancellor could gamble that few people would notice this technical change, and it might avoid politically catastrophic tax hikes - but only if the markets accept it will mean higher borrowing than planned. But the question is - has Rachel Reeves ruled this out by saying her fiscal rules are iron clad or not? Or to put it another way... is the whole of the 19-page Charter for Budget Responsibility \"iron clad\" and untouchable, or just the rules themselves?  And what counts as \"rules\" and are therefore untouchable, and what could fall outside and could still be changed? I've been pressing the Treasury for a statement. And this morning, they issued one. A spokesman said: \"The fiscal rules as set out in the Charter for Budget Responsibility are iron clad, and non-negotiable, as are the definition of the rules set out in the document itself.\" So that sounds clear - but what is a definition of the rule? Does it include this 0.5% of GDP buffer zone? Read more:Reeves hints at tax rises in autumnTough decisions ahead for chancellor The Treasury does concede that not everything in the charter is untouchable - including the role and remit of the OBR, and the requirements for it to publish a specific list of fiscal metrics. But does that include that key bit? Which bits can Reeves still tinker with? I'm still unsure that change has been ruled out."

Sky News has learnt that Avant Homes, which has been owned by Elliott since 2021, has reached an agreement with a syndicate of lenders to provide additional financial headroom to the company. Details of the refinancing were unclear on Tuesday, although a source close to Elliott insisted that it had not committed any new capital to Avant as part of it. Avant sold more than 1,750 homes in the year to 30 June 2023, the last for which results are available, and recorded revenue of almost £500m. However, in recent months there has been growing industry speculation about the company's financial health as cladding-related exposures hit housebuilders across the industry. In recent weeks, investment bankers have been canvassing interest from rival housebuilders about a takeover of Avant, although sources close to Elliott and Avant denied that any such process was being conducted on their behalf.

Sky News has learnt that Computershare has expressed an interest in acquiring PrimaryBid, which was put up for sale earlier this year. PrimaryBid, which counts London Stock Exchange Group and the SoftBank Vision Fund among its investors, has drawn interest from a large number of parties, including investment banks and market infrastructure providers, according to insiders. Money: Thousands of customers due a refund - as network apologises The company was founded with a simple vision to help ordinary investors gatecrash the closed City ranks of corporate fundraisings and flotations by aggregating demand from retail shareholders into a single, enlarged order. That mission to democratise access to public markets won support from politicians and market participants. It made significant progress towards this goal during the pandemic, notably securing a slice of a £2bn share sale announced by Compass Group, the FTSE 100 contract caterer. \n                  Chancellor Rachel Reeves considering 'changes' to ISAs - and says there's too much focus on 'risk' in investing\n                 \n                  Most important part of chancellor's annual Mansion House speech was what wasn't said\n                 \n                  Trump to 'refine trade deal' with UK during Scotland trip\n                 Since then, it has worked on hundreds of deals and helped raise roughly $2bn in equity for listed companies. However, it has been hit by a severe slowdown in equity capital markets activity, prompting it to launch a strategic review and hire US-based market infrastructure specialist Rosenblatt Securities to evaluate its strategic options. PrimaryBid has been facing the weakest IPO market in years, which it has been attempting to mitigate by striking partnerships with the likes of US fintech group SoFi, as well as European groups. It has now reshaped its UK operations and stepped back from regulated activities, having for several months explored a deal with LSEG, one of its largest shareholders, to license its retail capital-raising technology. For some time, the company was chaired by Sir Donald Brydon, the veteran businessman who also used to chair the stock exchange's parent company. Earlier this year, LSEG wrote down the value of its 7.2% stake in PrimaryBid by 87%, implying that the business now had a valuation of just £56m. Computershare's interest in a deal is said to be exploratory, with many other prospective bidders at a similar stage. A Computershare spokesman said: \"We do not comment on market speculation.\" PrimaryBid declined to comment."

In her speech to key industry figures on last night, Ms Reeves said: \"I will continue to consider further changes to ISAs, engaging widely over the coming months and recognising that despite the differing views on the right approach, we are united in wanting better outcomes for both savers and for the UK economy.\" She added: \"For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks, without giving proper weight to the benefits.\" Read analysis from our economics editor Ed Conway  Ms Reeves's speech, the first major one since the welfare bill climbdown two weeks ago, appeared to encourage regulators to focus less on risks and more on the benefits of investing in things like the stock market and government bonds (loans issued by states to raise funds with an interest rate paid in return). She welcomed action by the financial regulator to review risk warning rules and the campaign to promote retail investment, which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is launching next year. \"Our tangled system of financial advice and guidance has meant that people cannot get the right support to make decisions for themselves\", Ms Reeves told the event in London.

Yesterday, she said she would announce a package of City changes - including a new competitive framework for a part of the insurance industry and a regulatory regime for asset management. In response to her address, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Rachel Reeves should have used her speech this evening to rule out massive tax rises on businesses and working people.

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n The retreat from Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover in 2021 began as a farce, then it was a scandal and now it's a shoddy cover-up. The farce was when the then foreign secretary Dominic Raab remained on his holiday sunbed in Crete rather than return to work during the height of the evacuation crisis. Politics latest: Minister sorry after 'extraordinary secrecy' concealed data leak It was a scandal because around 200 people were killed in the chaos, with distressing pictures of terrified Afghans clinging to the wings of moving aeroplanes at Kabul airport. And now we learn that in a massive cover-up, the Tory government of Rishi Sunak took out a superinjunction to gag the media from reporting a data breach that put 20,000 Afghans in danger. Over the years, superinjunctions granted by UK courts have been condemned for enabling celebrities and sports stars to cover-up extra-marital affairs, drug-taking and other secrets. The superinjunction granted to the government in 2023 to conceal a secret scheme to relocate Afghan nationals was obviously entirely different and no doubt sought for honourable motives. \n                  'My family is finished': Afghan man in UK military data breach says he feels betrayed\n                 \n                  Why was the Afghan data leak kept secret for 600 days? \n                 \n                  Almost 7,000 Afghans being relocated to UK in secret scheme after MoD data breach\n                 But it was a cover-up nonetheless and not so honourable because it hid a data blunder exposing names and contact details of 18,000 people who had applied for asylum in the UK under a resettlement scheme. The scheme had been set up by the government in 2021 to provide asylum for people who had worked with the UK armed forces and could be at risk of Taliban reprisals for working with western forces. In the Commons, the current defence secretary, John Healey, said it was \"deeply uncomfortable\" to be prevented from reporting the data breach blunder to MPs until now. Read More:'My family is finished': Afghan man in UK military data breach says he feels betrayedAlmost 7,000 Afghans being relocated to UK in secret scheme after MoD data breach  The ministers involved in seeking the gagging order were the former defence secretary Ben Wallace and the then armed forces minister James Heappey, he said. But while most MPs welcomed Mr Healey's apology, it's probably fair to say that if it hadn't been for tenacious campaigning by media organisations the superinjunction might not have been lifted by the High Court. One Tory MP, Mark Pritchard, accused the defence secretary of \"wriggling\" and said: \"The fact is that he is justifying this superinjunction and not telling parliament, the press, the public and, unbelievably, the Afghans who were potentially in harm's way.\" And, among a number of individual cases highlighted by MPs, Liberal Democrat Calum Miller told MPs that \"in the chaos of withdrawal\" a constituent who left Afghanistan was promised by British officials that his pregnant wife could follow him. \"Two years later, we have still not kept that promise,\" said Mr Miller. \"My constituent's wife and child continue to move around in Afghanistan to evade the Taliban and my constituent is so desperate that he is talking about returning to Afghanistan - despite the risk to him - to be reunited with them.\" 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈  Reform UK's Zia Yusuf hit out at the Tory government's asylum policy, writing on X: \"24k Afghans secretly granted asylum, costing British taxpayers up to £7bn. \"The government covered it up. Who was in government? Home secretary: Suella Braverman. Immigration minister: Robert Jenrick.\" Later, Mr Healey was asked on LBC's News Agents podcast if the official responsible for the data breach is still employed by the government. \"They are no longer doing the same job on the Afghan brief,\" he replied. Hmm. That suggests the person hasn't been fired, which will alarm those MPs who remain extremely concerned about this whole fiasco. Asked whether he would have taken out the superinjunction if he had been defence secretary in 2023, he replied: \"Very, very unlikely.\" But when he was asked if he could rule out the use of superinjunctions by the Ministry of Defence in the future, Mr Healey said: \"Well, you can never say never.\" So while Mr Healey will obviously be determined to avoid a farce in future, it appears that the threat of another Ministry of Defence cover-up in future hasn't gone away."

In May, the White House said it would exempt the UK from plans for a 25% tariff on global steel imports but that is yet to be ratified and the levy has since been doubled on all other countries. Mr Trump had insisted that unless Britain could finalise the details of a metals trade deal with the US by 9 July, when wider \"Liberation Day\" tariff pauses were expected to expire, he would slap the UK with a 50% rate as well.  However that pause was extended until 1 August, with the US president saying nations would instead get letters informing them of his plans. As Sky News' economics and data editor Ed Conway has reported, the metals deal has floundered on two key issues, including that while the government has taken control of British Steel, the company itself still legally has Chinese owners. Downing Street is still hoping it can secure 0% tariffs on steel. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson played down the significance of the meeting in Scotland, stressing it was a private trip so it \"will not be a formal bilateral\". Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on countries across the world in a bid to boost domestic production and address trade deficits.

Mr Trump has praised the PM, telling the BBC earlier on Tuesday: \"I really like the prime minister a lot, even though he's a liberal.\" There are also plans for Scottish First Minister John Swinney to meet Mr Trump during his trip. It will be followed by the official state visit between 17-19 September, when Mr Trump will be hosted by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle and accompanied by his wife Melania. It will be Mr Trump's second state visit to the UK, having previously been hosted during his first term in 2019."

        "Content": "\n          Deputy political editor\n              @SamCoatesSky\n Are Rachel Reeves's fiscal rules quite as iron clad as she insists? How tough is her armour really? And is there actually scope for some change, some loosening to avoid big tax hikes in the autumn? We've had a bit of clarity early this morning - and that's a question we discuss on the Politics at Sam and Anne's podcast today. Politics Live: Reeves to reform financial regulations And tens of billions of pounds of borrowing depends on the answer - which still feels intriguingly opaque. You might think you know what the fiscal rules are. And you might think you know they're not negotiable. For instance, the main fiscal rule says that from 2029-30, the government's day-to-day spending needs to be in surplus - i.e. rely on taxation alone, not borrowing. And Rachel Reeves has been clear - that's not going to change, and there's no disputing this. But when the government announced its fiscal rules in October, it actually published a 19-page document - a \"charter\" - alongside this. And this contains all sorts of notes and caveats. And it's slightly unclear which are subject to the \"iron clad\" promise - and which aren't. There's one part of that document coming into focus - with sources telling me that it could get changed. And it's this - a little-known buffer built into the rules. It's outlined in paragraph 3.6 on page four of the Charter for Budget Responsibility. This says that from spring 2027, if the OBR forecasts that she still actually has a deficit of up to 0.5% of GDP in three years, she will still be judged to be within the rules. In other words, if in spring 2027 she's judged to have missed her fiscal rules by perhaps as much as £15bn, that's fine. Now there's a caveat - this exemption only applies, providing at the following budget the chancellor reduces that deficit back to zero. But still, it's potentially helpful wiggle room. This help - this buffer - for Reeves doesn't apply today, or for the next couple of years - it only kicks in from the spring of 2027. But I'm being told by a source that some of this might change and the ability to use this wiggle room could be brought forward to this year. Could she give herself a get out of jail card? The chancellor could gamble that few people would notice this technical change, and it might avoid politically catastrophic tax hikes - but only if the markets accept it will mean higher borrowing than planned. But the question is - has Rachel Reeves ruled this out by saying her fiscal rules are iron clad or not? Or to put it another way... is the whole of the 19-page Charter for Budget Responsibility \"iron clad\" and untouchable, or just the rules themselves?  And what counts as \"rules\" and are therefore untouchable, and what could fall outside and could still be changed? I've been pressing the Treasury for a statement. And this morning, they issued one. A spokesman said: \"The fiscal rules as set out in the Charter for Budget Responsibility are iron clad, and non-negotiable, as are the definition of the rules set out in the document itself.\" So that sounds clear - but what is a definition of the rule? Does it include this 0.5% of GDP buffer zone? Read more:Reeves hints at tax rises in autumnTough decisions ahead for chancellor The Treasury does concede that not everything in the charter is untouchable - including the role and remit of the OBR, and the requirements for it to publish a specific list of fiscal metrics. But does that include that key bit? Which bits can Reeves still tinker with? I'm still unsure that change has been ruled out."

The two regions join the North West of England and Yorkshire, which have had drought status for several weeks. The decision by the government's National Drought Group makes it more likely that people in the areas will be affected by hosepipe bans. Check the latest weather forecast here Currently, eight million people have restrictions on water use, or will do so in the next week. Experts from the government, water companies and the Met Office judged that reservoir and river levels in the Midlands were well below normal, with no substantial rain in the forecast. Nationally, reservoirs are on average just 76% full, below the level of the severe drought in 2022. \n                  More than 40% of Europe slides into drought, including pockets of Greece, southern Italy and Spain\n                 \n                  Drought declared in North West England\n                 \n                  Southern Water considering shipping supplies from Norway to UK due to drought fears\n                 But Howden reservoir in Derbyshire is just 39% full, with three heatwaves so far this summer rapidly draining supplies.  After the meeting by the government group, water minister Emma Hardy MP said: \"We need to stop talking about these being extreme weather events and start to accept that because of climate change, things like this are going to be more normal. \"So as for whether more companies will introduce temporary use bans, that really genuinely depends on what happens with the weather over the next few months.\" Read more: Extreme weather 'becoming the norm' - as minister warns UK's way of life 'under threat' The Environment Agency has drawn up a reasonable worst-case scenario in which England receives 20% less rain than normal and the weather remains warm, but not hot - far from improbable. In that case, the drought will grow to include all regions down to Wessex, Hampshire and across to Cambridgeshire by the autumn. The rest of the country would be in a pre-drought status - officially called \"prolonged dry weather\" - apart from Devon and Cornwall, which have had more rain over recent months.  But a water expert has told Sky News that poor planning by the government and water companies is also to blame for regions being affected by drought and hosepipe bans. Professor Richard Ashley, of the University of Sheffield, said a failure to build new reservoirs, link up water grids across regions and fix leaks has undermined water security in the face of dry weather. \"We do have a largely Victorian-based supply system,\" he said. \"A lot of our infrastructure is in desperate need of upgrading, and replacement of water mains is of the order of once every hundred years in this country, and that frankly is shocking. \"This is outdated thinking and outdated infrastructure to cope with problems of the now and the future.\" Read more from Sky News:Men who cut down iconic tree are locked upTerror arrests after van driven into defence factory's fence The last reservoir built in the UK was in 1992.

Her boyfriend was seriously injured in the 2019 incident, while her body was discovered in a wooded area.

The former Match Of The Day presenter, who left the BBC in May, earned £1.35m in 2024/25, according to the corporation's annual report. Presenter Zoe Ball was the second-highest paid, earning £517,000 for her work on the Radio 2 breakfast show, which she left in December last year. Her replacement as breakfast show host Scott Mills was just outside the top 10 as the eleventh highest earner - with a salary of between £355,000 and £359,000. Ball has since returned to a new Saturday afternoon show on Radio 2, which she began hosting in May. Lineker's former Match Of The Day colleague Alan Shearer was the third-highest earner, taking home between £440,000 and £444,999. Exact salaries for Lineker and Ball are listed in the BBC's annual report, but the pay of the rest of the on-air talent is listed in bands. BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James was fourth on the list, while presenters Fiona Bruce and Nick Robinson were the joint fifth-highest earners. The list does not include people who are paid through independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios.

        "Content": "Former Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan has said he \"fell through the gaps\" with his prostate cancer diagnosis, calling it a \"massive wake-up call\". He revealed last month he has stage-four cancer, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body. However, he said he was responding positively to treatment. Speaking at an event for Prostate Cancer UK, Murnaghan urged men to get tested - and to insist on one if they're in a high-risk group. \"For years I thought 'that will do me'. I'm getting tested basically once a year or every couple of years,\" he said. \"It never occurred to me that they weren't testing for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and I never went to my GP because I was getting other tests privately through the production company. \"So that's how I fell through the gaps and that's how I had a massive wake-up call and want to share the message.\" A PSA test is a blood test that can indicate if there's a potential problem with the prostate but there's currently no national screening programme. \n                  We are entering 'golden age' of cancer treatment - and also facing a less gilded era too\n                 \n                  Many cancers no longer 'a death sentence' as treatment on 'cusp of golden era', NHS England medical director says\n                 \n                  'Milestone' technique could help cancer patients keep hair during chemotherapy\n                 The NHS says men over 50 can ask their GP for one, and Murnaghan, who's 67, said some people below that age should also push for one. \"You can get to the stage I have with no symptoms,\" he said. \"Get the test, insist on the test. You can insist on the test if you are in a high-risk group and under 50.

        "Headline": "After a series of recent controversies, BBC director-general Tim Davie admits it has been a \"tough period\".",
        "Content": "By Bethany Minelle, arts and entertainment reporter, and Megan Baynes, social affairs reporter   The head of the BBC says MasterChef can survive as it is \"much bigger than individuals\" - but the corporation must \"make sure we're in the right place in terms of the culture of the show\". Director-general Tim Davie said he \"absolutely\" thinks the popular cooking contest has a future, with the production's current deal with the corporation set to run out in 2028, and praised it as \"a great programme that's loved by audiences\". His comments came just hours before MasterChef presenter John Torode was sacked after an allegation he used an \"extremely offensive racist term\". His co-host Gregg Wallace was also sacked last week after claims of inappropriate behaviour. Speaking as the BBC unveiled its annual report, and following a series of recent controversies, Mr Davie said the corporation's leadership team will not \"tolerate behaviour that is not in line with our values\", and confirmed \"senior individuals and people involved in these cases are being held to account\". On Monday, it was revealed an independent review into \"inappropriate behaviour\" by Wallace had upheld more than half of the allegations against him. In response, Wallace said he was \"deeply sorry\" and never set out to \"harm or humiliate\". A few hours after the Wallace report was published, Torode said an allegation he used \"racial language\" was upheld in the report but insisted he had \"no recollection\" of the alleged incident and \"did not believe that it happened\". Mr Davie said the BBC's leadership team would not \"tolerate behaviour that is not in line with our values,\" while BBC chair Samir Shah acknowledged there were still pockets within the corporation where \"powerful individuals\" can still \"make life for their colleagues unbearable\". They said several BBC staff members had been dismissed in the last three months following an independent review into workplace culture. The review found the corporation did not have a toxic culture but there was a minority of people who behaved unacceptably and whose behaviour was not addressed. Wallace is not included in that count as he was not directly contracted by the corporation, but was employed by independent production company Banijay. The BBC has yet to decide if the unseen MasterChef series - filmed with both Wallace and Torode last year - will be aired or not. 'We will make mistakes' News of the findings in the Gregg Wallace report came on the same day it was revealed the BBC was deemed to have breached its editorial guidelines over a Gaza documentary that was narrated by the child of a Hamas official. Media watchdog Ofcom subsequently launched its own investigation into Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, which was removed from BBC iPlayer in February. While the 2024-25 annual report showed a small rise in trust overall for the corporation, Mr Davie said it had been a year which saw the reputation of the BBC damaged by \"serious failings\" in the making of the documentary. He said it was important that the BBC \"took full responsibility for those failings and apologised for them\" and called the documentary \"the most challenging editorial issue\" he has dealt with.  Mr Davie said the BBC was \"taking action to ensure proper accountability and we're taking immediate steps to stop a failing like this being repeated\". Despite a series of controversies in recent months - including livestreaming the controversial Bob Vylan set at Glastonbury, when the band led chants of \"death to the IDF\" - Mr Davie insisted he can \"lead\" the BBC in the right direction. When asked if he would resign, he replied: \"I simply think I'm in a place where I can work to improve dramatically the BBC and lead it in the right way. \"We will make mistakes, but I think as a leadership and myself, I've been very clear, and I think we have been decisive.\" After what he called a \"tough period,\" he said the job of director-general was not one to take on \"if you want a quiet life or a stress-free existence\". Mr Shah backed Mr Davie, saying he had shown \"very strong leadership throughout all this period and he has my full support\". The report showed that Mr Davie, who has been in the role since 2020, has had a 3.8% pay rise, with his salary going up from £527,000 last year to £547,000. BBC's top-earning stars revealed The BBC annual report also revealed its on-screen top earners, which saw former Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker top the chart for the eighth year running. The former Match Of The Day presenter, who left the BBC in May, earned £1.35m in 2024/25, according to the corporation's annual report. Last year's BBC annual review was overshadowed by controversy over flagship show Strictly Come Dancing, while the year before saw disgraced newsreader Huw Edwards named the corporation's highest-paid news anchor, despite having been suspended for nine months. The report showed the BBC TV licence fee generated an income of £3.8bn, while BBC Commercial delivered record sales of £2.2bn, and the BBC's main commercial arm, BBC Studios, delivered earnings of £200m. But the BBC said this was still not enough to plug the licence fee gap, which they say generates 30% less income than it did in 2010. Ahead of the Charter Review, the BBC will publish findings from their biggest ever audience questionnaire, with findings due to be published later this year."

On Saturday, the Barcelona and Spain winger hosted a massive party attended by teammates, celebrities, musicians, YouTubers and influencers. According to local reports and social media footage, a number of people with dwarfism attended the party to entertain the guests. Spain's Association of People with Achondroplasia and other Skeletal Dysplasias (ADEE) said the incident violates disability rights law in the country, adding it will take legal action. ADEE president Carolina Puente said: \"It's unacceptable that in the 21st century, people with dwarfism are still used for entertainment at private parties, particularly when public figures are involved. \"The dignity and rights of our community cannot be a source of amusement under any circumstance.\" Jesus Martin Blanco, director general for the rights of persons with disabilities in Spain's Ministry of Social Rights, has also called for an investigation. He told Spanish news agency EFE, via Cadena Ser, he was concerned that \"a guy who has so many followers, an influencer for young people, is throwing this kind of party that can have a knock-on effect on young people\". \"The law is for everyone, for the humble and for the powerful,\" he added.

Nobody is forcing us to.\" Sky News has contacted Gestifute - Yamal's representatives - and Barcelona FC for comment. Yamal's representatives were also contacted with a request for comment by Reuters and did not immediately respond."
