        "Content": "Barack Obama has paid a warm tribute to Jesse Jackson's  \"lifetime of service\" - after Donald Trump took a swipe at him in his own eulogy. Mr Obama has credited the civil rights leader, who died on Tuesday aged 84, with laying the foundation for his own successful presidential run, and said that he and his wife, Michelle, \"stand on his shoulders\". The pair were long time friends and associates, with Reverend Jackson endorsing Mr Obama for both of his presidential campaigns. In a statement shared to social media, Mr Obama said: \"Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant, the Rev Jesse Jackson. \"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. \"From organising boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect. \"Reverend Jackson also created opportunities for generations of African Americans and inspired countless more, including us. \n                  The Epstein Files - where's Donald Trump?\n                 \n                  Is the Board of Peace a Trump-led sham?\n                 \n                  Tehran on the brink as Trump calls for Iranians to take to the streets\n                 \"Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager. \"And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land. \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. \"We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family, and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" US presidents of all political stripes have paid tribute to Rev Jackson, who himself ran for the Democratic presidential nomination on two occasions. \"Reverend Jackson never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows,\" wrote Bill and Hilary Clinton in a joint statement. They added that their \"dear friend\" had \"championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian and lower-income white Americans\". In 2000, Mr Clinton awarded Rev Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour. Joe Biden also described Jackson as a \"man of God and of the people\". He went on to thank the civil rights leader for his \"lifetime of dedicated service and inspirational leadership\". Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump posted a tribute to his Truth Social platform. He described Jackson as a \"a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts'\". Mr Trump continued: \"Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\" He also took a swipe at Mr Obama, claiming that Rev Jackson had \"much to do\" his election, but was not acknowledged or given credit. Mr Trump added that Rev Jackson \"could not stand\" Mr Obama. Born in Greenville, North Carolina, the son of a single, teenage mother, Rev Jackson grew up in a deeply segregated southern community. He went on to become one of the leading figures in the civil rights movement, and was even pictured with Reverend Martin Luther King the day before he was killed. Rev King's daughter, Bernice, shared an image of the pair to social media alongside the caption: \"Both now ancestors\". Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said: \"He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world. He shaped public policy and changed laws. \"He kept the dream alive, and taught young children from broken homes, like me, that we don't have broken spirits.\" Tributes also came in from politicians and leading figures on this side of the pond. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy described Jackson as a \"pillar of the civil rights movement\". He also shared a story about how Jackson had called him after the 2011 riots to offer support. Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott shared a picture of the pair after she was first elected in 1987. The Mother of the House said: \"He was very smart, warm and hugely charismatic.\" Sky News' Trevor Phillips also shared a touching tribute, in which he said Jackson's \"sheer audacity made change beyond just civil rights\"."

A spokesperson for the NPCC said: \"A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\" Earlier this month, Thames Valley Police confirmed it was assessing claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential reports from his role as the UK's trade envoy with Jeffrey Epstein. The claims being examined by Thames Valley Police are separate from the assessment of flights by Essex Police. Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links, but has not directly responded to the latest allegations. Being named in the files does not suggest wrongdoing."

        "Content": "Real Madrid's Champions League game against Benfica was stopped for several minutes after a racist ‌slur was allegedly directed at Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior by an opposition player. The match in Lisbon, Portugal, was halted five minutes into the second half, shortly after ​Vinicius gave the away side a 1-0 lead in the first leg of the knockout playoffs. Cameras picked up the 25-year-old telling French referee Francois Letexier he had been targeted. The match was stopped for 11 minutes and Vinicius went to the sidelines at the Estadio da Luz. Both coaches, Benfica's Jose Mourinho and Madrid's Alvaro Arbeloa, talked to him at one point. It appears Benfica players were not happy with the forward because he celebrated his goal by dancing in front of the corner flag, and some went to confront him. Vinicius had been shown a yellow card after the celebration. After the complaint, Letexier responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and stopping the match. Real's players threatened ⁠to leave the pitch ​as tensions rose, but the referee ​eventually allowed the match to resume. Vinicius: Racists are cowards Vinicius has repeatedly suffered ​racism in Spain during games. In a message on Instagram after the match, he said: \"Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\" \"Racists are, above all, cowards,\" he added. \"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. \"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish.\" He described the protocol enforced by the referee as serving \"no purpose\", and said he didn't understand why he was booked for his celebration. \"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary,\" he said. Player 'could be banned' if found guilty The teams are due to go to Madrid to play the second leg, with the Spanish side 1-0 up, but Sky News' sports correspondent Rob Harris said there could be sanctions. \"There can be a ban for the player, if he's found guilty of the racial abuse of Vinicius,\" he explained. \"Vinicius himself had warned about facing racism in the past, particularly in Spain... and had said that he would be prepared to walk off... if he faced abuse. \"Football often talks about sending out a message, and imposing those bans, to hopefully try to stamp out the scourge of racism. But how often are we still talking about this in football?\" 'It's disgusting,' says England star After the game, teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold, a former Liverpool and England player, told Amazon Prime: \"What's happened tonight is a disgrace to football. It's overshadowed the performance, especially after such an amazing goal. \"Vini has been subjected to this a few times throughout his career, there's no place for it in football or society. It's disgusting.\""

        "Content": "The victims in the shooting at an ice rink in Rhode Island are the attacker's ex-wife and son, police have said. The shooting happened at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, Rhode Island, at around 2.30pm local time on Monday, where a youth hockey game was due to take place. Robert Dorgan, 56, killed two people - ex-wife Rhonda and adult son Aidan - and critically injured three others, according to police. Those injured have been identified as Ms Dorgan's parents and a family friend, Pawtucket Police chief Tina Goncalves said. Dorgan, who was also known as Roberta Esposito, then died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Ms Goncalves added. The police chief said Dorgan's attack was cut short by an unnamed \"Good Samaritan\" among the spectators, who intervened and brought the shooting \"to a swift end\". Players and spectators raced for cover after popping sounds were heard at the venue, according to unverified footage published on social media, which also showed a man throwing himself at Dorgan to stop the shooting. Ms Goncalves said at least three bystanders were able to contain Dorgan, who reached for a second gun and shot themselves. Authorities believe the attack stemmed from a \"family dispute\", but there was \"no indication\" that there would be violence at the ice rink on Monday, Ms Goncalves said, adding that Dorgan had been to many hockey games before without incident. Tearful families and high school hockey players still in their kits could be seen hugging outside the arena after the shooting, while police cordoned off the ice rink. One of the shooting victims was found dead inside the arena, while the other died in hospital, where the three others who suffered gunshot injuries remain in critical condition. The attack comes almost two months after a gunman killed three people after opening fire at Brown University, in nearby Providence, before turning his weapon on himself.

        "Content": "British dual nationals who don't have a British passport could be stopped from entering the UK under new rules coming into force later this month. From 25 February, visitors to the UK who don't have a British passport will either need a visa, Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), or certificate of entitlement to enter the country. Travellers face being blocked from boarding their flight, ferry or train if they don't have one of these. British and Irish citizens have the right to live in the UK, although they must prove this right when entering at the border. Dual nationals used to be able to travel on a foreign passport without a certificate of entitlement, which links their right to reside in the UK to their foreign passport - although risked being delayed by Border Force staff confirming their citizenship. What should dual nationals do? From 25 February, dual nationals will need to present either a British passport or certificate of entitlement to enter the UK. \n                  Radar 'technical issue' halts flights to Birmingham Airport\n                 \n                  Severe delays on trains to and from Heathrow Airport after fire\n                 \n                  Airbus fleets return to service after A320 software fixed faster than expected\n                 At £94.50, applying for a British passport is much cheaper than a certificate of entitlement - which costs £589. The Home Office says it has advised dual nationals to make sure they have the right documents to enter the UK since October 2024, and has been advertising about the ETA changes since 2023. \"Without [a British passport or certificate of entitlement], carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding,\" a spokesperson said. It's not possible to get an ETA or visa to enter the UK as a British citizen, meaning dual nationals will need either a passport or certificate of entitlement. Those who already have a physical certificate of entitlement will automatically receive a new digital version. But they will need to create a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account to link it to their foreign passport. Irish citizens can continue to use their Irish passport to enter the UK. Why are the changes happening? ETAs are part of what the government says will be a \"more streamlined, digital immigration system\" that it hopes will mean faster entry into the UK, reducing queues at the border. It also says the system will be more secure, and stop people who shouldn't be entering the UK from doing so. An ETA costs £16 and allows for multiple journeys and stays in the UK for up to six months, although only last for two years. The government plans to increase the cost to £20 at some point in the future. It's similar to changes being made in the European Union, where non-EU citizens now need a European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) authorisation to enter."

The airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.\" Mr Brown also said that information in the Epstein files suggested \"a number of British girls were on 90 Epstein flights organised from UK airports on what was called his [Epstein's] 'Lolita Express'\". \n                  Trump hits back at Hillary Clinton over Epstein files 'cover-up' claim\n                 \n                  Will ICE on the streets make visiting the World Cup unsafe? \n                 \n                  Trump administration accused of 'purposefully muddying waters' with list of hundreds of names in Epstein files\n                 The former politician demanded a full inquiry and wrote: \"I have asked the Met urgently to re-examine their decision-making in their investigation and the subsequent reviews.\" He claimed the files showed in \"graphic detail\" how Epstein was flying \"in girls from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia\" to Stansted, where \"women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\", adding they \"would not need British visas\".

A spokesperson for the NPCC said: \"A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\" Earlier this month, Thames Valley Police confirmed it was assessing claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential reports from his role as the UK's trade envoy with Jeffrey Epstein. The claims being examined by Thames Valley Police are separate from the assessment of flights by Essex Police. Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links, but has not directly responded to the latest allegations. Being named in the files does not suggest wrongdoing."

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has warned \"public health isn't a culture war\" and urged parents to check their children are up to date with vaccinations after a measles outbreak. The prime minister said it was \"concerning to see more children getting measles\" as Enfield, north London, recorded 34 confirmed cases between 1 January and 9 February - more than one third of the 96 cases across England so far this year. According to a local GP surgery, one in five of the children infected in the recent outbreak needed hospital treatment \"and all of them had not been fully immunised\". At least seven schools in Enfield and Haringey have confirmed infections, with the GP surgery warning \"it is spreading\". On Tuesday, Sir Keir posted on X: \"Vaccines are safe, effective and can be life saving. \"We're urging all parents to check their children are up to date with their recommended vaccinations.\" He said the UK \"expects its leaders to stand firmly behind science to protect our children, not to give oxygen to conspiracy theories\". \n                  What are the symptoms of measles - and what should you do if you think your child is infected?\n                 \n                  'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak in London leaves dozens of children infected\n                 \n                  UK loses measles elimination status, warns WHO\n                 \"Public health isn't a culture war. It's about keeping our communities safe,\" he added. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can spread very easily among people - both children and adults - who are not fully vaccinated. The virus causes cold-like symptoms, a rash and spots in the mouth. While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or even death. The UKHSA has warned modelling of a large-scale measles outbreak in London could lead to between 40,000 to 160,000 infections. The modelling released in a report titled \"Risk assessment for measles resurgence in the UK\" estimated that hospitalisation rates would range from 20% to 40% depending on age. Read more: What are the symptoms of measles - and what to do if your child is infected Britain lost its measles elimination status in 2024, with falling immunisation rates stoking fears of a widespread outbreak of the virus. Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield's director of public health, told The Sunday Times that London had \"one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates\" in the country, making the capital especially vulnerable to an outbreak. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has been available in the UK since 1988, with the first dose usually given to babies aged one, and a second dose at three years and four months. If either dose has been missed, you can still ask your GP for the vaccine. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, MMR vaccination rates fell to about 80% nationally after a 1998 study by British doctor Andrew Wakefield linked the vaccine to autism. The study has been discredited after he was found to have manipulated data and he was struck off the medical register - but not before the study led to lower vaccination rates globally. Since the COVID pandemic, more parents have been asking questions about vaccinations, leading to them searching the internet for answers, where there is a lot of disinformation."

From 25 February, visitors to the UK who don't have a British passport will either need a visa, Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), or certificate of entitlement to enter the country. Travellers face being blocked from boarding their flight, ferry or train if they don't have one of these. British and Irish citizens have the right to live in the UK, although they must prove this right when entering at the border. Dual nationals used to be able to travel on a foreign passport without a certificate of entitlement, which links their right to reside in the UK to their foreign passport - although risked being delayed by Border Force staff confirming their citizenship. What should dual nationals do? From 25 February, dual nationals will need to present either a British passport or certificate of entitlement to enter the UK. \n                  Radar 'technical issue' halts flights to Birmingham Airport\n                 \n                  Severe delays on trains to and from Heathrow Airport after fire\n                 \n                  Airbus fleets return to service after A320 software fixed faster than expected\n                 At £94.50, applying for a British passport is much cheaper than a certificate of entitlement - which costs £589. The Home Office says it has advised dual nationals to make sure they have the right documents to enter the UK since October 2024, and has been advertising about the ETA changes since 2023. \"Without [a British passport or certificate of entitlement], carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding,\" a spokesperson said. It's not possible to get an ETA or visa to enter the UK as a British citizen, meaning dual nationals will need either a passport or certificate of entitlement. Those who already have a physical certificate of entitlement will automatically receive a new digital version. But they will need to create a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account to link it to their foreign passport. Irish citizens can continue to use their Irish passport to enter the UK. Why are the changes happening? ETAs are part of what the government says will be a \"more streamlined, digital immigration system\" that it hopes will mean faster entry into the UK, reducing queues at the border. It also says the system will be more secure, and stop people who shouldn't be entering the UK from doing so. An ETA costs £16 and allows for multiple journeys and stays in the UK for up to six months, although only last for two years. The government plans to increase the cost to £20 at some point in the future. It's similar to changes being made in the European Union, where non-EU citizens now need a European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) authorisation to enter."

The match in Lisbon, Portugal, was halted five minutes into the second half, shortly after ​Vinicius gave the away side a 1-0 lead in the first leg of the knockout playoffs. Cameras picked up the 25-year-old telling French referee Francois Letexier he had been targeted. The match was stopped for 11 minutes and Vinicius went to the sidelines at the Estadio da Luz. Both coaches, Benfica's Jose Mourinho and Madrid's Alvaro Arbeloa, talked to him at one point. It appears Benfica players were not happy with the forward because he celebrated his goal by dancing in front of the corner flag, and some went to confront him. Vinicius had been shown a yellow card after the celebration. After the complaint, Letexier responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and stopping the match. Real's players threatened ⁠to leave the pitch ​as tensions rose, but the referee ​eventually allowed the match to resume. Vinicius: Racists are cowards Vinicius has repeatedly suffered ​racism in Spain during games. In a message on Instagram after the match, he said: \"Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\" \"Racists are, above all, cowards,\" he added. \"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. \"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish.\" He described the protocol enforced by the referee as serving \"no purpose\", and said he didn't understand why he was booked for his celebration. \"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary,\" he said. Player 'could be banned' if found guilty The teams are due to go to Madrid to play the second leg, with the Spanish side 1-0 up, but Sky News' sports correspondent Rob Harris said there could be sanctions. \"There can be a ban for the player, if he's found guilty of the racial abuse of Vinicius,\" he explained. \"Vinicius himself had warned about facing racism in the past, particularly in Spain... and had said that he would be prepared to walk off... if he faced abuse. \"Football often talks about sending out a message, and imposing those bans, to hopefully try to stamp out the scourge of racism. But how often are we still talking about this in football?\" 'It's disgusting,' says England star After the game, teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold, a former Liverpool and England player, told Amazon Prime: \"What's happened tonight is a disgrace to football. It's overshadowed the performance, especially after such an amazing goal. \"Vini has been subjected to this a few times throughout his career, there's no place for it in football or society.

        "Headline": "Fresh negotiations are convened in Geneva, Switzerland, between the United States and Iran to resolve their long-running dispute.",
        "Content": "Iran and the United States have reached an understanding on \"guiding principles\" after fresh talks on Tehran's nuclear capabilities in Geneva, Iran's foreign minister has said. Abbas Araghchi said that while an agreement may not be reached soon, the \"path has started\". Oman's foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, said the talks had been \"constructive\" and \"good progress\" had been made \"towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues\". He added: \"Much work is yet to be done, and the parties left with clear next steps before the next meeting.\" Previous negotiations were held in Oman earlier this month, while these latest ones were mediated by Oman. Just after Tuesday's talks got under way, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah ​Ali Khamenei, struck a confrontational tone, however, saying the US could not topple his government. US President Donald Trump has said that regime change in Iran \"would be the best thing that could happen\". But Khamenei, 86, commented: \"The US president says their army is the world's strongest, but the strongest army in the world can sometimes be slapped so hard it cannot get up,\" he said in comments published by Iranian media. Earlier, the US president warned Iran of \"consequences\" if the new phase of discussions does not produce an agreement. Washington has sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East and is preparing for a possible military campaign if the negotiations are inconclusive, officials have told the Reuters news agency. Iran itself began a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz - a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf ‌Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute. Iranian state TV said the route would be closed for several hours because of \"safety and maritime concerns\" as it conducted live fire drills. Iran launched missiles into the Strait of Hormuz, state TV added. It is the first time Iran has closed parts of the strait since the US began threatening military action. Speaking on Air Force One, the US president suggested the Iranians may be motivated to reach an agreement with Washington. \"I'll be involved ​in those talks, indirectly, and they'll be ‌very important,\" he said. \"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal. \"We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. \"And we had to send the ​B-2s,\" he added, referring to last year's US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Mr Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner were in Switzerland on Tuesday for the second round of talks. Earlier Mr Araghchi, who is leading the negotiations for Tehran, said on X: \"I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. \"What is not on the table: submission before threats.\" The Trump administration is seeking a deal to limit Iran's nuclear programme and ensure it does not develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it is not pursuing weapons and has so far resisted demands that it halt uranium enrichment or hand over its supply of uranium. On Monday, US secretary of state Marco Rubio told a news conference in Budapest that it was hard to ⁠do a deal with Iran, but the US was willing to try. Mr Trump told reporters the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was being sent to the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying guided-missile destroyers were deployed last month. Iran has warned the US that any attack will be treated as \"an all-out war against us\".

        "Content": "Russia is set to have athletes competing under their own flag at the Paralympic Games for the first time since 2014. In a statement, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said Russia's National Paralympic Committee had been awarded six slots in the upcoming Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games. Wildcards have been granted so the country will have one woman and one man competing in para alpine skiing, one woman and one man in para cross-country skiing, and two men in the snowboarding event in Italy. The latest move by the IPC comes after Russia was twice banned from the games, first in 2016 over a state-sponsored doping scheme, and then in 2022 due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The last time Russian athletes were able to compete under their own flag was in 2014, when the country hosted both the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Sochi. While Russian athletes have featured at the Paralympics since, they have competed under a neutral banner. The IPC voted to lift the ban on Russia in September but some sports maintained their own suspensions. \n                  Why did the Russians take nine hours to make a three hour journey?\n                 \n                  Real Madrid game against Benfica halted over alleged racial slur\n                 \n                  Ukraine war latest: Russia sums up Geneva talks in one word\n                 Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the recent move was \"completely the wrong decision\" - and she urged the IPC to reconsider. She posted on social media: \"Resuming the right of athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under their own flags while the brutal invasion of Ukraine continues sends a terrible message. \"The International Paralympic Committee should reconsider this decision urgently.\" Last year, IPC president Andrew Parsons told Sky's sports correspondent Rob Harris that Russian participation in the games was \"not linked to participation in wars\". \"Russia and Belarus, they used Paralympic sport to promote what they called the \"special operation\" at the time,\" he said in an interview. \"And this is what led to the first suspension, the suspension in 2023. Between 2023 and now... there is less evidence of that being used again for the promotion of the war.\" The UK and 32 mainly European countries signed a joint statement expressing \"serious concern\" after IPC members voted to lift the partial suspensions of Russia and Belarus in September. It comes after Ukrainian sports minister Matvii Bidnyi told Sky News that the Paralympics should not have lifted its ban on Russia. He disputed the IPC president's claim that sport is no longer being used to promote the war, adding: \"It's unjust, and we think it's not appropriate to give the opportunity to terrorist states.\""

        "Content": "By Celine Alkhaldi, Middle East producer  A Syrian government official told Sky News al Hol camp in northeastern Syria is now largely emptied, acknowledging that escapes continued after the state took control of the site. Al Hol has for years housed tens of thousands of women and children linked to suspected ISIS fighters, as well as Syrians and Iraqis displaced by the war. The camp, previously run by Kurdish-led authorities, was taken over by the Syrian government last month as Damascus expanded its control in the area. \"Families escaped while we were present because the camp is large and the smuggling routes are very varied,\" said Fadi al Qassem, the Syrian foreign ministry's representative for al Hol camp administration. He said the camp was already largely emptied of residents by the time Syrian forces arrived, with guards gone and gates open, and that authorities then struggled to prevent further departures. Mr al Qassem said the government inherited unreliable population records and long-standing smuggling networks, making it difficult to establish who was present when the Syrian army took over the site. He said officials found evidence of forged documentation, with families using multiple registration cards that belonged to people who had already left illegally. \n                  US strikes dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria in retaliation for deadly ambush\n                 \n                  US military completes transfer of thousands of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq\n                 \n                  US moves 150 Islamic State prisoners out of Syria with thousands more to follow\n                 He added that authorities were trying to trace those who left outside official channels, using records from international partners, including the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Syria says camp no longer viable The agency said on Sunday it had observed a significant decrease in the number of residents at al Hol in recent weeks. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR representative based in Syria, said local authorities had informed the agency of plans to relocate remaining families and had asked for its support to assist people in the new camps, which the agency said it was ready to provide.

He added that most of those being moved are women and children and that rehabilitation and social integration programmes are planned. He said officials concluded al Hol was no longer viable and would not be restored, citing extensive damage and the high cost of rehabilitation. The first convoy left earlier this week in coordination with Syria's emergency ministry and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, with 10 buses and 35 trucks deployed, and further transfers planned. 'It's the language of extremists' Former Kurdish staff members who worked at al Hol said the rapid emptying of the camp had raised serious security concerns. Jihan Hanan, who ran al Hol camp for four years until its takeover by Damascus last month, said the lack of any clear tracking of those who have left the camp was particularly worrying. \"When I saw videos showing large parts of al Hol empty, I was alarmed,\" she said. Her last official figures, from 19 January, put the camp's population at around 23,000 people. She added that a video circulating online showed a former resident threatening her by name from inside what appears to be her burned and vandalised former office, vowing to track her down and warning others who had worked at the camp. \"This has created real fear for me and my children,\" Ms Hanan said. \"This is the language they used against us all the time. It's the language of extremists.\" Many former residents blamed camp staff for their detention, she added, and more than 1,000 civilian and humanitarian workers who had run al Hol over the years now feared reprisals."

Mr Obama has credited the civil rights leader, who died on Tuesday aged 84, with laying the foundation for his own successful presidential run, and said that he and his wife, Michelle, \"stand on his shoulders\". The pair were long time friends and associates, with Reverend Jackson endorsing Mr Obama for both of his presidential campaigns. In a statement shared to social media, Mr Obama said: \"Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant, the Rev Jesse Jackson. \"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history. \"From organising boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect. \"Reverend Jackson also created opportunities for generations of African Americans and inspired countless more, including us. \n                  The Epstein Files - where's Donald Trump?\n                 \n                  Is the Board of Peace a Trump-led sham?\n                 \n                  Tehran on the brink as Trump calls for Iranians to take to the streets\n                 \"Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager. \"And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land. \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. \"We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family, and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" US presidents of all political stripes have paid tribute to Rev Jackson, who himself ran for the Democratic presidential nomination on two occasions. \"Reverend Jackson never stopped working for a better America with brighter tomorrows,\" wrote Bill and Hilary Clinton in a joint statement. They added that their \"dear friend\" had \"championed the concerns of Black, Latino, Asian and lower-income white Americans\". In 2000, Mr Clinton awarded Rev Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour. Joe Biden also described Jackson as a \"man of God and of the people\". He went on to thank the civil rights leader for his \"lifetime of dedicated service and inspirational leadership\". Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump posted a tribute to his Truth Social platform. He described Jackson as a \"a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts'\". Mr Trump continued: \"Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\" He also took a swipe at Mr Obama, claiming that Rev Jackson had \"much to do\" his election, but was not acknowledged or given credit. Mr Trump added that Rev Jackson \"could not stand\" Mr Obama. Born in Greenville, North Carolina, the son of a single, teenage mother, Rev Jackson grew up in a deeply segregated southern community. He went on to become one of the leading figures in the civil rights movement, and was even pictured with Reverend Martin Luther King the day before he was killed. Rev King's daughter, Bernice, shared an image of the pair to social media alongside the caption: \"Both now ancestors\". Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said: \"He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world. He shaped public policy and changed laws. \"He kept the dream alive, and taught young children from broken homes, like me, that we don't have broken spirits.\" Tributes also came in from politicians and leading figures on this side of the pond. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy described Jackson as a \"pillar of the civil rights movement\". He also shared a story about how Jackson had called him after the 2011 riots to offer support. Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott shared a picture of the pair after she was first elected in 1987. The Mother of the House said: \"He was very smart, warm and hugely charismatic.\" Sky News' Trevor Phillips also shared a touching tribute, in which he said Jackson's \"sheer audacity made change beyond just civil rights\"."

Jackson was an impassioned orator, offering a voice for the voiceless. Raised in the segregated South, he rose to prominence in the civil rights era and became a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr. He used that 1988 speech to call on Americans, left and right, black and white, to find common ground. \"The only time that we win is when we come together,\" he told the audience. \"Wherever you are tonight, you can make it. Hold your head high, stick your chest out. You can make it. It gets dark sometimes, but the morning comes. Don't you surrender. Suffering breeds character, character breeds faith. In the end, faith will not disappoint.\" Jackson never did become president but blazed the trail for a new era, for a night 20 years after his speech when Barack Obama realised that dream. His activism and political career was not without controversy, and he weathered several storms throughout his years in the spotlight. However, he remained America's pre-eminent civil rights figure for decades. Born Jesse Louis Burns in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1941, Jackson's mother was a 16-year-old high school student and his father a 33-year-old married man who lived next door. His mother later married another man who adopted him. He grew up in the Jim Crow era, the often brutally enforced set of racist laws to subjugate black Americans in the South, and was segregated from white neighbours. He earned a football scholarship at the University of Illinois, but transferred to a historically black college because he said he experienced discrimination. Civil rights activism began when he was a student, and he was once arrested after seeking to enter a \"whites-only\" public library. Jackson was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1968 and his activism was noticed by Martin Luther King Jr. He became his protege. He was there at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on the day King was assassinated, and claimed to have worn a shirt said to be soaked with the murdered civil rights leader's blood the following day. He set up his own civil rights organisation in Chicago, Operation PUSH, in the early 1970s, and in 1984 founded the National Rainbow Coalition, advocating also for women and gay rights. PUSH and the National Rainbow Coalition merged in 1996 and are now the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 'Our time has come' Jackson ran for president for the first time in 1984. Some Democrats did not agree with his campaign, saying said his ideas were too left-leaning and could be detrimental to the party. He dismissed criticism, saying the party's mission should be to feed the hungry and house the homeless. \"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised,\" he said in his 1984 Democratic Convention speech. The mantra then: \"Our time has come.\" During both his presidential runs, Jackson attracted black voters and many ​white liberals but fell short of becoming the first black major party White House nominee. He later served as Democratic president Bill Clinton's special envoy to Africa in the 1990s, and was instrumental in securing the release of a number of Americans and others held overseas in places such as Syria, Cuba, Iraq and Serbia. Jackson also pushed for cultural change, joining calls by NAACP members and other movement leaders in the late 1980s to identify black people in the United States as African Americans. In 2000, he received the highest US civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Clinton. Despite health challenges in his final years he continued protesting against racial injustice into the era of Black Lives Matter, condemning the police killing of George Floyd. \"This season of ugliness brought about by the lynching of George Floyd has brought the best and worst out of us,\" he told Sky News at the time. \"The worst is lynching but the best is fighting back.\" In 2024, he appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and at a city council meeting to show support for a resolution backing a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Read more:Jesse Jackson: A life in picturesMartin Luther King's daughter leads tributes Jackson's career was also marked by some controversies. In 1984 he faced allegations of using a slur in reference to Jewish people, comments he initially denied. However, he later offered an apology while speaking at a synagogue, according to a New York Times article. Jackson married his wife, Jacqueline Brown, in 1962, and they had five children. In 1999, he also had a daughter with a woman who worked at his civil rights groups; he later said he understood what it meant to be born out of wedlock and committed to supporting her emotionally and financially. In 2008, he made headlines when he complained that Obama was \"talking down to black people\" in comments captured by a microphone. However, when he joined the jubilant crowd in Chicago to greet the new president on election night, he had tears streaming down his face. \"I wish for a moment that Dr King... could've just been there for 30 seconds to see the fruits of their labour,\" he told the Associated Press news agency in a later interview. \"I became overwhelmed. It was the joy and the journey.\" In 2017, he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after experiencing symptoms for three years. Doctors later confirmed a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy, a life-threatening neurological disorder, and he was admitted to hospital in November. Following his death, tributes have been paid to a trailblazer who spoke up for minorities, for the poor and underrepresented. \"I was able to run for the presidency twice and redefine what was possible; it raised the lid for women and other people of colour,\" he told the Associated Press. \"Part of my job was to sow seeds of the possibilities.\""

Seamus Culleton, from Kilkenny, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on 9 September last year while driving home from work in Massachusetts. He told agents he had a work permit, but was arrested and taken to an ICE facility at El Paso in Texas. The company representing him, BOS Legal, said Mr Culleton's deportation had been delayed by a petition for review of the administrative final removal order and an ex parte motion filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday. BOS added that the temporary order would be \"staying Culleton's removal for the next 10 business days\". The court has ordered the government to file its response, which is \"due in the coming days\", the company said. BOS Legal noted that Mr Culleton has been in the US for almost two decades, and is married to a US citizen. It said he has \"no criminal entries\" since arriving in the US, presents \"no public safety concerns\", and has \"strong familial and community ties\" there. Mr Culleton has described the detention centre in El Paso as \"horrible\" and \"filthy\", with little sanitation and limited food. He has claimed that he is in fear of his life from the security firm in charge, and that there is competition for food. He likened the facilities to a \"modern-day concentration camp\". Mr Culleton said there were 72 people in a tent the size of a 16ft by 35ft room with no ceiling, two rows of bunk beds on either side, and a long table down the middle. Illnesses are rife among detainees, he said, with barely any outside time, fresh air or sunlight. Mr Culleton's wife, Tiffany Smyth, told Sky News her husband's situation is \"hard to believe\", and said that she had \"a million questions\" when he phoned to say he was being held. \"If it can happen to me… it can kind of happen to anyone,\" Mr Culleton told Sky News. BOS Legal said it remains focused on security his release from custody, and \"obtaining the immigration relief necessary for him to be reunited with his wife and to remain in the United States with his family\".

Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, Rhode Island, at around 2.30pm local time on Monday, where a youth hockey game was due to take place. Robert Dorgan, 56, killed two people - ex-wife Rhonda and adult son Aidan - and critically injured three others, according to police. Those injured have been identified as Ms Dorgan's parents and a family friend, Pawtucket Police chief Tina Goncalves said. Dorgan, who was also known as Roberta Esposito, then died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Ms Goncalves added. The police chief said Dorgan's attack was cut short by an unnamed \"Good Samaritan\" among the spectators, who intervened and brought the shooting \"to a swift end\". Players and spectators raced for cover after popping sounds were heard at the venue, according to unverified footage published on social media, which also showed a man throwing himself at Dorgan to stop the shooting. Ms Goncalves said at least three bystanders were able to contain Dorgan, who reached for a second gun and shot themselves. Authorities believe the attack stemmed from a \"family dispute\", but there was \"no indication\" that there would be violence at the ice rink on Monday, Ms Goncalves said, adding that Dorgan had been to many hockey games before without incident. Tearful families and high school hockey players still in their kits could be seen hugging outside the arena after the shooting, while police cordoned off the ice rink. One of the shooting victims was found dead inside the arena, while the other died in hospital, where the three others who suffered gunshot injuries remain in critical condition.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n Jesse Jackson was never just a politician. He was a presence. News of his passing travelled not through headlines, but through memories. The echo of a rally, the rhythm of sermons, the impassioned plea for racial equality. Latest - tributes to civil rights leader, Jesse Jackson He first stepped into the national consciousness in the long shadow of Martin Luther King Jr. Young, cool, sharp, ambitious, and standing on the edge of history as it happened. King's assassination in 1968 did more than fracture a movement; it created a leadership vacuum. \n                  Obama responds to racist video shared by Trump depicting him and his wife as apes\n                 \n                  Congress turns on the King\n                 \n                  Trump sharing racist image of Obamas shows something has changed\n                 Jackson did not replace him - no one could - but he refused to let the movement fade. In the years that followed, he transformed protest into organisation. Operation PUSH was much more than a slogan. It was an attempt to translate street-level outrage into negotiating power. He understood the leverage required to change what had shaped his childhood. Journey from stand-out student Born in Greenville, North Carolina, the son of a single, teenage mother, he grew up in a deeply segregated southern community. But he was a stand-out student, the class president and a quarterback in the high school football team. Jesse Jackson's life in pictures That won him a scholarship to the University of Illinois, from where he later transferred to North Carolina State University. It was there, in a historically black college, that he became involved in the civil rights movement. Jackson rose to prominence as an aide to Martin Luther King Jnr and witnessed his assassination at close quarters. He inherited the mantle to some extent, becoming a visible advocate for racial equality. His National Rainbow Coalition became a voice for the voiceless - black Americans, women, the LGB community, Native Americans and Hispanics. Shifting tectonic plates of US politics He had much more than political aspirations. He had the courage to stand for president. Listening to his electrifying campaign speeches in 1984 and 1988, you could sense the tectonic plates of American political identity shifting. Those campaigns were less about electoral maths and more about psychological geography - redrawing the boundaries of belonging. It unquestionably paved the way to the eventual election of Barack Obama as president and Kamala Harris as vice president. His relationship with Mr Obama was complicated, Jackson once accusing him of \"talking down\" to black audiences during his campaign. It revealed a philosophical divide: Jackson's politics were rooted in prophetic confrontation, while Mr Obama was more focused on coalition building. In later years, illness narrowed his physical world, but his symbolic presence remained. A living archive A living archive of the struggle - one of the last towering figures whose political instincts were forged in the marches and jail cells of the 1960s. The architecture of segregation has largely fallen, but the patterns it produced remain stubbornly intact. But right to the end, Jesse Jackson refused to be quiet, and that is his legacy. In a polarised nation often tempted by amnesia, he insisted on memory. The refusal to forget watching white children take the bus to school while he had to walk."

The jobless rate ticked up to 5.2% in December, the highest since the three months up to January 2021, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. The figure had stood at 4.1% when Labour took office in 2024, promising economic growth. More out-of-work people are now actively looking for a job, while the number of unemployed people per job vacancy is at a new post-pandemic high, the ONS said.

Why is unemployment increasing? The new figures comes as more than a third of employers say they are cutting hiring due to new workers' rights, according to a survey from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). The Employment Rights Act, which became law in December, guarantees workers entitlements including parental leave and sick pay from the first day of a job. It has also become more expensive to employ staff due to the rise in employers' national insurance contributions in April. Higher minimum wages for younger workers contributed to the growth in unemployment among that cohort Catherine Mann, a senior Bank of England economist and interest rate setter, said at the weekend. Gulf in private and public sector wage growth There has also been a slowing down in the rate of pay increases and the gap between the private and public sector wage rises has remained. Average annual earnings rose 7.2% for the public sector and 3.4% for the private sector. This higher public sector figure is due to some pay rises being issued earlier in 2025 than in 2024. Overall, pay rose 4.2% in the three months to December, a fall from the 4.4%, seen a month earlier. What it means for interest rates Slower wage growth may be welcome news for the interest-rate setters at the Bank of England as high wage rises can cause overall prices to rise and make it harder to bring down inflation. Interest rates have been kept relatively high, at 3.75%, as the Bank attempts to have inflation fall to 2%. Traders now think there's a 81% chance of a rate cut in March. A further cut is now seen as likely in September which would bring the borrowing cost to 3.25%."

        "Content": "Six firms linked to Sarah Ferguson are being wound down following revelations from the latest release of the Epstein files, Companies House documents show.  The former Duchess of York and ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is the sole director of the companies, none of which appear to have been very active or have much public profile. The companies are: S Phoenix Events, Fergie's Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd. It is unclear exactly what their activities were. Late last year, documents show Ms Ferguson submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson. Listings for all six companies on Companies House state there is an \"application to strike the company off the register\", meaning the company will stop trading and will cease to exist. It comes after the announcement earlier this month that Ms Ferguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, will close \"for the foreseeable future\" following the emergence of new details about her relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ms Ferguson is mentioned several times in the latest tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice. Being named in the files does not suggest wrongdoing. One of the files suggests there were plans for Epstein to own a majority stake in her women's empowerment brand, Mothers Army, after his child sex offence conviction in 2008. Other correspondence indicate Ms Ferguson and her daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, flew to Miami to visit Epstein less than a week after he was released from prison in July 2009, with the email exchange implying he paid for the plane tickets. Read more from Sky News:List of hundreds of names in Epstein files releasedWhat do the Epstein files say about Sarah Ferguson? In an email on 3 August 2009, Ms Ferguson thanked Epstein for being \"the brother I have always wished for\" and told him she had \"never been more touched by a friend's kindness than your compliment to me in front of my girls\". In another, she called him \"my dear spectacular and special friend\", before adding \"you are a legend, and I am so proud of you\". A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment. In 2011, Ms Ferguson said: \"I would never have anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again. I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children. It was a gigantic error of judgment.\""

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has warned \"public health isn't a culture war\" and urged parents to check their children are up to date with vaccinations after a measles outbreak. The prime minister said it was \"concerning to see more children getting measles\" as Enfield, north London, recorded 34 confirmed cases between 1 January and 9 February - more than one third of the 96 cases across England so far this year. According to a local GP surgery, one in five of the children infected in the recent outbreak needed hospital treatment \"and all of them had not been fully immunised\". At least seven schools in Enfield and Haringey have confirmed infections, with the GP surgery warning \"it is spreading\". On Tuesday, Sir Keir posted on X: \"Vaccines are safe, effective and can be life saving. \"We're urging all parents to check their children are up to date with their recommended vaccinations.\" He said the UK \"expects its leaders to stand firmly behind science to protect our children, not to give oxygen to conspiracy theories\". \n                  What are the symptoms of measles - and what should you do if you think your child is infected?\n                 \n                  'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak in London leaves dozens of children infected\n                 \n                  UK loses measles elimination status, warns WHO\n                 \"Public health isn't a culture war. It's about keeping our communities safe,\" he added. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can spread very easily among people - both children and adults - who are not fully vaccinated. The virus causes cold-like symptoms, a rash and spots in the mouth. While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or even death. The UKHSA has warned modelling of a large-scale measles outbreak in London could lead to between 40,000 to 160,000 infections. The modelling released in a report titled \"Risk assessment for measles resurgence in the UK\" estimated that hospitalisation rates would range from 20% to 40% depending on age. Read more: What are the symptoms of measles - and what to do if your child is infected Britain lost its measles elimination status in 2024, with falling immunisation rates stoking fears of a widespread outbreak of the virus. Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield's director of public health, told The Sunday Times that London had \"one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates\" in the country, making the capital especially vulnerable to an outbreak. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has been available in the UK since 1988, with the first dose usually given to babies aged one, and a second dose at three years and four months. If either dose has been missed, you can still ask your GP for the vaccine. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, MMR vaccination rates fell to about 80% nationally after a 1998 study by British doctor Andrew Wakefield linked the vaccine to autism. The study has been discredited after he was found to have manipulated data and he was struck off the medical register - but not before the study led to lower vaccination rates globally. Since the COVID pandemic, more parents have been asking questions about vaccinations, leading to them searching the internet for answers, where there is a lot of disinformation."

Labour announced in December that it was planning to push the ballots from May 2026 until 2027 - affecting more than 4.5 million people - to overhaul English council structures. However, on Monday, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was no longer proceeding with the plan following legal advice, sought after a challenge brought by Reform UK against the government. Politics latest: Which councils are affected? Elections will now take place on 7 May, with a £63m fund available to help local councils across those areas reorganise their structures, with \"practical support\" also on offer. Mr Farage said the government had \"caved\" and suggested Local Government Secretary Steve Reed's job should be at risk. \"It's a victory for Reform. But more importantly, it's a victory for democracy in this country,\" Mr Farage declared. The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal fees - something Sky News understands to be a six-figure sum. 'Months of planning time' lost Among those which had been due to miss out were city councils in Lincoln, Exeter, Norwich, Peterborough and Preston, alongside several districts such as Cannock Chase, Harlow, Welwyn Hatfield and West Lancashire. Polling day had also been postponed for county council voters in East Sussex, West Sussex, Norfolk, and Suffolk. Labour's U-turn, the party's 15th since coming to power in July 2024, has angered several election administrators. Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said officials and workers responsible for organising elections have \"lost months of essential planning time\". \"These teams now face an uphill struggle to catch up to where they should be,\" she said. \"They have paused planning to avoid unnecessary cost, but this means they are now playing catch-up.\" Read more from Sky News:Why Starmer has plenty to lose after U-turnBoy has UK-first surgery to make him taller Conservative councillor Richard Wright, chair of the District Councils' Network - which represents 169 English councils - said: \"Council officers, councillors and local electorates will be bewildered by the unrelenting changes to the electoral timetable. \"The councils affected face an unnecessary race against time to ensure elections proceed smoothly and fairly, with polling stations booked and electoral staff available.\" 'Impossible to plan effectively' Meanwhile, Matthew Hicks, leader of Tory-run Suffolk County Council said that local councils were experiencing \"whiplash as major government decisions shift repeatedly and without warning\". He added: \"This uncertainty makes it almost impossible to plan effectively, deliver stability for residents, or provide clarity for our staff and partners. \"There is now a significant question mark over the government's wider agenda for devolution and local government reorganisation.\" The leader of Labour-run Thurrock Council Lynn Worrall said it was \"disappointing that this decision has been reversed so late in the day\"."

        "Content": "Reform UK has announced its new top team as Nigel Farage seeks to prove his party is not a \"one-man band\". As Reform is not the official opposition - and only has eight MPs - the four new roles are not part of a formal shadow cabinet. Those with portfolios will be the party's spokespeople on specific issues. Politics latest: Farage 'quite proud' of forcing local elections U-turn However, Mr Farage insisted his party was \"the voice of opposition\" to the Labour government as he unveiled his first frontbench appointments. Two of the four given spokesperson roles are recent Conservative defectors - and the most experienced politicians, having both been senior ministers. Robert Jenrick - economy Mr Jenrick, a former communities secretary under Boris Johnson, was named Reform's economic spokesman barely a month after joining the party from the Tories. He said he would be \"a voice for the millions of people who are being failed by this Labour government\" and pledged Reform would put together \"the most comprehensive plan of any political party... to fix Britain's broken economy\" and cut the welfare bill. Having switched from the Conservatives in January after being unceremoniously ousted by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch when his defection speech was found on a photocopier by staff, Mr Jenrick was one of Reform's biggest signings. The former housing secretary, immigration minister and shadow justice secretary has previously denied being offered a role within Mr Farage's top team before defecting. Richard Tice - business, trade and energy Mr Tice will head up Reform's business, trade and energy policies, and proposed a new \"super department\" aimed at increasing growth to 4% of GDP. He said the UK needs cheap energy to be a rich nation, which involves using its oil, offshore and onshore gas. Mr Tice said the party would focus on using oil and gas to help boost the economy and would abandon net-zero targets. The multi-millionaire businessman-turned-MP led Reform for three years until Mr Farage decided, ahead of the 2024 election, he was going to be leader instead. A net-zero sceptic, Mr Tice has been the party's deputy leader since then and was elected as Boston and Skegness's MP in 2024, having served as an MEP for the East of England prior to that. Zia Yusuf - home affairs and justice Mr Yusuf, who is not an MP, will take the lead on home policies, including immigration. The multi-millionaire businessman, whose medic parents came to the UK from Sri Lanka in the 1980s, said the sheer scale of immigration over the last three decades \"has broken Britain\". He said if Reform won the next election the party would \"stop the boats\", deport illegal immigrants, leave the ECHR, take on \"radical Islam\" and forcibly deport foreign criminals. Mr Yusuf, the party's former chair, has served as head of policy and was previously head of Reform's department of government efficiency. The multi-millionaire was Reform's largest donor in the run-up to the 2024 general election and has become a prominent spokesman, especially on immigration. Suella Braverman - education, skills and equality Reform's latest Conservative recruit, and as a former home secretary - the party's most experienced MP - Ms Braverman will head up its education policies. A former chair of Britain's \"strictest school\", Michaela Community School, she said Reform would replicate the school's success across the UK, \"restore freedom to our schools and restore authority to our teachers\", while delivering a \"patriotic, balanced curriculum\". She promised to ban \"social and gender transitioning\" in all schools and to ensure fewer people go to university with 50% of young people going into the trades instead. Ms Braverman said Reform would get rid of the equalities department and build a country \"defined by meritocracy not tokenism, personal responsibility not victimhood, excellence not mediocrity, and unity not division\". The remaining Reform MPs who have not been given a job: Lee Anderson - chief whip, ex-Tory and the first sitting MP to defect to Reform Sarah Pochin - Reform's first female MP after winning the Runcorn and Helsby by-election in May 2025 Danny Kruger - former Conservative shadow minister who defected in September 2025 Andrew Rosindell - the longest-serving MP (he has been Romford's MP since 2001), who defected from the Tories in January"

He is known by fans for building and playing unique electronic instruments - such as an organ made from Furbies and Game Boys, flame-throwing keyboards and a Star Wars droid orchestra. \"I hope Eurovision is ready to get synthesised!\" Battle said as his entry was revealed. \"I find it completely bonkers to be jumping on this wonderful and wild journey. \"I have always been a massive Eurovision fan, and I love the magical joy it brings to millions of people every year, so getting to join that legacy and fly the flag for the UK is an absolute honour that I am taking very seriously.\" This year's ceremony is due to take place in Vienna, Austria, in May and details of the UK song will be revealed in the coming weeks, the BBC - which broadcasts Eurovision in the UK - said. \"I've been working a long-time creating, writing, and producing my own visions from scratch, and documenting my process,\" Battle added. \"I will be bringing every ounce of my creativity to my performances, and I can't wait for everyone to hear and see what we've created.\" Kalpna Patel-Knight, head of entertainment at the BBC, said Look Mum No Computer embodies \"everything the UK wants to celebrate on the Eurovision stage - creativity, ambition, and a distinctly British wit\". Which broadcasters have pulled out? The BBC's announcement comes amid controversy surrounding this year's ceremony. Last year, Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia all announced their withdrawal from Eurovision 2026 over Israel's participation in the competition. It came after a vote on whether members were happy with tougher new rules introduced in November - following claims of Israeli government \"interference\" in last year's contest. The majority agreed the changes were enough and Israel's place was confirmed. Israeli national broadcaster KAN described attempts to remove them as a \"cultural boycott\". In response to the decision to allow Israel to compete, the country's president Isaac Herzog wrote on X: \"Israel deserves to be represented on every stage around the world, a cause to which I am fully and actively committed.\" This year's ceremony marks Eurovision's 70th anniversary and organisers had planned the first ever official song contest live tour, featuring acts from the past seven decades of the event, to follow the show. However, it was announced last week that this had been cancelled due to \"unforeseen challenges\". Contest director Martin Green said it had been a \"difficult decision\" but assured the tour would be relaunched \"when we can ensure the world-class experience that our fans expect\"."
