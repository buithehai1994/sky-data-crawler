        "Content": "New mobile phone footage shows the moments around Renee Nicole Good's death in Minneapolis, filmed by the ICE agent who shot her. The video, which has been reshared by the US vice president JD Vance on X, shows Ms Good and her wife appearing to be in confrontation with the ICE officer. He walks around the car after Ms Good tells him \"that's fine dude, I'm not mad at you\". Ms Good's wife then taunts the officer, asking him twice if he wants to \"come at us?\" She then says: \"I say you go get yourself some lunch big boy.\" Another ICE agent then strides towards Ms Good, who is behind the wheel, saying \"Get out of the f***ing car\". Ms Good first reverses her car, before going forwards and close to the officer. It is unclear if the car hits the officer or narrowly misses him. \n                  Wife of woman shot dead by ICE officer says 'we had whistles, they had guns' as she pays tribute\n                 \n                  Fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis: What we know \n                 \n                  Minneapolis on edge after fatal shooting - as ICE's techniques provoke anger and protests \n                 US correspondent This video is only 47 seconds long, a close-up perspective, but it has unlocked even more questions about how and why Renee Nicole Good died. It is tragic in the sense that it shows the face and demeanour of a 37-year-old woman in the moments before she dies, filmed by the person who shot her. But I don’t think the footage provides any certainty about those crucial final few seconds, during which Good puts her car into drive, turns her wheel, accelerates and is then shot at three times by the officer.  What is clear is that there is dialogue between the pair in the run-up. Good seems to be relatively calm, when she says \"that's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you.\"  Another woman, who appears to be Good's wife, seems to take a mocking tone with the officer when she says \"go get lunch, big boy.\" The audio from the phone camera is distorted at the key moment. There is a sound that could indicate a collision between the car and the officer but, again, that is not certain.  He definitely remains on his feet and at the end, appears to say \"f***ing bitch.\"  The reaction to this video shows how entrenched views are on both sides of the political aisle. The vice president says it proves the officer's \"life was endangered.\" Democrats continue to maintain she was \"murdered.\" In this country there is no time to wait for a full investigation in the rush to reach a conclusion and it could be very dangerous.  At this point, the agent exclaims in shock and shoots multiple times. As Ms Good's car careers down the road before crashing into parked cars, the agent appears to mutter \"f***ing bitch\". Sky News has chosen not to air the swear words in the video. Speaking shortly after the incident, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed the deceased was shot when she sought to \"weaponise\" her vehicle and allegedly attempted to run over an officer. In a news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called those claims \"bullshit\". ICE is the federal US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency responsible for homeland security investigations and removal operations against people the US decides are in the country illegally. Its operations have ramped up significantly as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Sky News has previously witnessed people being taken off the streets by officers and bundled into vehicles, including in Washington DC. Donald Trump accused Ms Good of \"viciously\" running over an officer, sparking outrage among some in the US. While the city council in Minneapolis stated that Ms Good was \"out caring for her neighbours this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government\". Speaking on Friday, Mr Trump said: \"We will always be protecting ICE.\" Read more from Sky News:Serious threat facing Iran's leadersSwiss bar owners detained after fire£200m for UK forces in Ukraine The shooting happened on the second day of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, which border each other. On Friday, a vigil was held at the Minnesota State Capitol in St Paul, which borders Minneapolis, for Ms Good. The DHS previously said it had launched what it called the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency in Minnesota, with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Schools in Minneapolis were closed on Thursday and Friday as a result of the shooting."

        "Content": "Iran's supreme leader has warned of a crackdown on protesters, with a prosecutor in Tehran saying some could face the death penalty. It comes as Donald Trump said \"we will get involved\" if the government \"starts killing people\". Demonstrations in the capital, sparked by a struggling economy, have spread to other cities, increasing pressure on the country's leadership. Iran was largely cut off from the outside world on Friday after authorities imposed a nationwide internet blackout, with state media blaming the protests on \"terrorist agents\" from the US and Israel. The death toll from the violence around the latest demonstrations has reached at least 62, with more than 2,300 other people detained, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. As it happened: Tehran makes death penalty threat In the wake of spreading demonstrations, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of President Trump. He said in a brief address that \"vandals and rioters\" were \"ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy\", and that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as \"mercenaries for foreigners\". 'We will not show leniency', warns prosecutor According to the semi-official news agency Tasnim, prosecutor Ali Salehi later said that some protesters in Iran could face the death penalty for their actions. He added that acts of vandalism targeting public property carried out as part of anti-regime demonstrations will be considered \"moharebeh\", translated as \"waging war against God\". \"We will not show leniency toward armed terrorists,\" Mr Salehi said. \"Their sentence is moharebeh.\" The punishment for moharebeh includes execution. Tasnim also reported that several police officers were shot dead by \"armed protesters\". Read more:Leaders facing most serious threat since 1979 revolutionWhy are people protesting in Iran? Trump: 'Iran's in big trouble' During a White House briefing about Venezuelan oil on Friday evening, Mr Trump, 79, praised the protests and said: \"Iran's in big trouble. \"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.\" The US president, who bombed Iran last summer, also said that \"if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved\". \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" he added, \"and that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts\". On Thursday, Mr Trump went as far as to suggest the 86-year-old supreme leader may be looking to leave Iran. \"He's looking to go someplace,\" the US leader told Fox News. \"It's getting very bad.\" A joint statement on Friday from the leaders of the UK, France, and Germany also said the countries \"strongly condemn\" the killing of protesters in Iran and are \"deeply concerned\" about reports of violence by Iranian security forces. The UN's human rights agency added that it is \"disturbed\" by reports of violence in Iran, \"including reported deaths and destruction of property\". Internet blackout as protests spread Demonstrations first began in Tehran last month - triggered by a sharp slide in the value of the rial currency - but have since expanded to all 31 of the country's provinces. They represent the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The internet blackout - also affecting international phone calls - started late on Thursday and extended into Friday, according to internet monitoring group NetBlocks. Call by exiled crown prince Large protests on Thursday night followed a call by the country's exiled crown prince for a mass demonstration. Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country's Islamic Revolution in 1979, had said in a statement: \"Great nation of Iran, the eyes of the world are upon you. \"Take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands.\" Read more from Sky News:Federal agents shoot and injure two people in OregonLandfill collapse sends avalanche of rubbish into village He added after Thursday's protests: \"Iranians demanded their freedom tonight. In response, the regime in Iran has cut all lines of communication.\" Reza Pahlavi has become a central figure amid the protests in Iran, actively calling on people to take to the streets and enjoying significant symbolic support among demonstrators. The eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, he was officially named Crown Prince in 1967 during his father's reign. In 1978, aged 17, he left Iran for US Air Force pilot training - just months before the 1979 Iranian Revolution overthrew the monarch and established the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khamenei. Now 65 and living in Washington DC, Pahlavi has suddenly found himself at the heart of one of Iran's most intense waves of unrest in years. He has repeatedly called for mass protests inside Iran and positions himself as a unifying figure for the opposition - though he has stated he does not seek permanent power. Click here to read more about Reza Pahlavi... The US president said earlier on Friday he would not meet Mr Pahlavi and was \"not sure that it would be appropriate\" to back him."

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is also expected to end the government's legal duty to automatically support destitute asylum seekers. A Home Office source told The i Paper it would allow the minister to remove accommodation and weekly allowances from some migrants. It is understood Ms Mahmood will target asylum seekers who can support themselves financially but choose not to, those who have a right to work, those who break the law or are working illegally and those who refuse an order to leave the country. The government hopes the move will help to speed up asylum hotel closures this year, with Ms Mahmood looking at further shutdowns by April.

But a member of staff at the hotel refused to check the pair in, even though their bookings were paid for, because they were homeless, in an incident caught on camera. \"It made me feel so small, because we're homeless.

The mental effect of the cold is \"daunting\" he says. \"There have been times when I woke up in this cold and cried\" He describes how the cold slowly penetrates and affects homeless people and their health. \"Your toes get cold, your fingers are cold, bad chest, you know, you become ill. \"And especially if you're lying on the floor with no cardboard, the cold comes through your body... you end up with a really bad chest\".

        "Content": "Evictions of migrants living in asylum hotels are set to start in the spring, Sky News understands. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is also expected to end the government's legal duty to automatically support destitute asylum seekers. A Home Office source told The i Paper it would allow the minister to remove accommodation and weekly allowances from some migrants. It is understood Ms Mahmood will target asylum seekers who can support themselves financially but choose not to, those who have a right to work, those who break the law or are working illegally and those who refuse an order to leave the country. The government hopes the move will help to speed up asylum hotel closures this year, with Ms Mahmood looking at further shutdowns by April. Home Office figures from November showed 36,273 people were staying in temporary accommodation in September, while waiting for a decision on their asylum claims. That marked an increase of 13% compared with June. \n                  Migrant crossing figures for 2025 'politically toxic' for PM\n                 \n                  People are disappearing 'daily' from asylum hotels, says whistleblower\n                 \n                  PM issues warning to European leaders ahead of ECHR talks\n                 The issue became national news last year in the wake of demonstrations in Epping, Essex, where a series of protests were held over the summer over the sex offender and Ethiopian national, Hadush Kebatu. The government has pledged to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers entirely by 2029, and insists it has halved the number of hotels in use since it came to power, from 400 down to around 200. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC on Sunday: \"I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you'll see evidence of that.\" Read more:Who says what on asylum hotels: Numbers, protesters and governmentPeople disappearing 'daily' from asylum hotels, says whistleblower Other measures are set to be introduced, including beginning removals to Syria - now seen as safer by ministers following the revolution that led to the fall of the Assad regime in 2024. Alternative housing for asylum seekers is expected to involve former military barracks, multiple-occupation houses, known as HMOs, and a council housing pilot. The government is also due to expand its 'one-in, one-out' returns deal with France and strike a new one with Germany."

        "Content": "A man has told Sky News how small he was made to feel when a hotel refused to let him in on a freezing cold night because he was homeless.   Callum Donaghey, 30, was one of two homeless men who a charity had booked into a Manchester Holiday Inn so they could escape sub zero temperatures. But a member of staff at the hotel refused to check the pair in, even though their bookings were paid for, because they were homeless, in an incident caught on camera. \"It made me feel so small, because we're homeless. [It] made me feel a bit categorised. Gutted,\" Mr Donaghey tells Sky News. In the video, the staff member says: \"It's not a personal thing\". \"We know people. I've been doing the door for a long while. It's the company's policy. It's not mine personally, it's the company's.\" Hearing that was like a \"kick in the stomach really\", Mr Donaghey says. \n                  Prince William and Prince George help prepare Christmas lunch for the homeless\n                 \n                  Plan to tackle rough sleeping unveiled - but charities say it doesn't go far enough\n                 \n                  Prince William marks 20 years as patron of Centrepoint, a homelessness charity Princess Diana championed\n                 \"From there, I thought to myself -bloody hell - same again. I was used to it, really. Getting knocked back and knocked back... I was upset about it, thinking I'm going to be out there tonight in -6C.\" Temperatures fell to -6C overnight on Monday, when the homeless charity, Two Brews, booked two rooms for the men at the Holiday Inn on Oxford Road. \"I'm panicking now, majorly panicking, thinking I'm going to be freezing tonight,\" that's how it feels to be homeless when temperatures plummet, Mr Donaghey adds in the Sky News interview. The mental effect of the cold is \"daunting\" he says. \"There have been times when I woke up in this cold and cried\" He describes how the cold slowly penetrates and affects homeless people and their health. \"Your toes get cold, your fingers are cold, bad chest, you know, you become ill. \"And especially if you're lying on the floor with no cardboard, the cold comes through your body... you end up with a really bad chest\".

A spokesperson for Holiday Inn said: \"After speaking with team members, we recognise that this incident is not in keeping with our policy of welcoming all and should have been handled differently. \"We sincerely apologise to the guests affected and are taking steps internally to strengthen our training.\""

The money, announced by Defence Secretary John Healey during a visit to Ukraine on Friday, will deliver new vehicles, communications and counter-drone protection to ensure troops are ready if required. The government said this will equip UK forces to secure Ukraine's future and reinforce long-term security guarantees, as part of a Multinational Force for Ukraine (MNFU). It follows the declaration of intent signed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris this week, which confirmed UK and French troops will deploy to Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement.

Meanwhile, Russia fired a hypersonic missile overnight at a target in Ukraine near the border with NATO-member Poland. The Oreshnik hit Ukraine's western Lviv region, although officials there did not mention any casualties.

It comes as Donald Trump said \"we will get involved\" if the government \"starts killing people\". Demonstrations in the capital, sparked by a struggling economy, have spread to other cities, increasing pressure on the country's leadership. Iran was largely cut off from the outside world on Friday after authorities imposed a nationwide internet blackout, with state media blaming the protests on \"terrorist agents\" from the US and Israel. The death toll from the violence around the latest demonstrations has reached at least 62, with more than 2,300 other people detained, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. As it happened: Tehran makes death penalty threat In the wake of spreading demonstrations, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of President Trump. He said in a brief address that \"vandals and rioters\" were \"ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy\", and that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as \"mercenaries for foreigners\". 'We will not show leniency', warns prosecutor According to the semi-official news agency Tasnim, prosecutor Ali Salehi later said that some protesters in Iran could face the death penalty for their actions. He added that acts of vandalism targeting public property carried out as part of anti-regime demonstrations will be considered \"moharebeh\", translated as \"waging war against God\". \"We will not show leniency toward armed terrorists,\" Mr Salehi said. \"Their sentence is moharebeh.\" The punishment for moharebeh includes execution.

The UN's human rights agency added that it is \"disturbed\" by reports of violence in Iran, \"including reported deaths and destruction of property\". Internet blackout as protests spread Demonstrations first began in Tehran last month - triggered by a sharp slide in the value of the rial currency - but have since expanded to all 31 of the country's provinces. They represent the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The internet blackout - also affecting international phone calls - started late on Thursday and extended into Friday, according to internet monitoring group NetBlocks. Call by exiled crown prince Large protests on Thursday night followed a call by the country's exiled crown prince for a mass demonstration. Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country's Islamic Revolution in 1979, had said in a statement: \"Great nation of Iran, the eyes of the world are upon you. \"Take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands.\" Read more from Sky News:Federal agents shoot and injure two people in OregonLandfill collapse sends avalanche of rubbish into village He added after Thursday's protests: \"Iranians demanded their freedom tonight. In response, the regime in Iran has cut all lines of communication.\" Reza Pahlavi has become a central figure amid the protests in Iran, actively calling on people to take to the streets and enjoying significant symbolic support among demonstrators. The eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, he was officially named Crown Prince in 1967 during his father's reign. In 1978, aged 17, he left Iran for US Air Force pilot training - just months before the 1979 Iranian Revolution overthrew the monarch and established the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khamenei. Now 65 and living in Washington DC, Pahlavi has suddenly found himself at the heart of one of Iran's most intense waves of unrest in years. He has repeatedly called for mass protests inside Iran and positions himself as a unifying figure for the opposition - though he has stated he does not seek permanent power. Click here to read more about Reza Pahlavi... The US president said earlier on Friday he would not meet Mr Pahlavi and was \"not sure that it would be appropriate\" to back him."

Symbols of the state have been defaced or set on fire, and it feels now that many are no longer afraid of the regime. What started two weeks ago were demonstrations by shopkeepers over the state of the economy - with inflation in Iran soaring and the currency collapsing, the price of rice and bread have skyrocketed. But they aren't the only factors fuelling this revolt. Iranians are frustrated with the ruling class.

For most Iranians, their only source now is Iranian state media, which is feeding people a narrative of a small number of anti-revolutionaries working for hostile states. Iran's supreme leader appeared on TV earlier today to point the finger at foreign \"mercenaries\" working for US President Donald Trump. They are the desperate words of a leader - now in his 86th year - who is defiant, yes, but surely deeply nervous about his grip on power. But the ruling class will not give up willingly. They are likely to fight to remain where they are. Read more: What happened on Iran's 'Bloody Saturday'? Members of the regime are calling for a decisive crackdown.

Valais region chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said it had been requested that Mr Moretti was held in pre-trial detention over a \"risk of flight\". She added that prosecutors had decided that his wife Jessica Moretti, also a co-owner of Le Constellation bar, should be kept under house arrest. The couple are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm, and involuntarily causing a fire following the blaze in Crans-Montana. The fire at Le Constellation bar in the early hours of New Year's Day also injured a total of 116 people. Most of the victims were teenagers. Mr and Mrs Moretti did not answer questions from reporters ahead of their hearing at the prosecutor's office on Friday morning.

        "Content": "Russia struck a target in the Ukrainian city of Lviv overnight with its powerful Oreshnik hypersonic missile, just 40 miles from the border with NATO-member Poland. It is only the second time Russia has used the weapon in Ukraine and the first time since 2024. Ukraine's military has reported the missile reaching speeds of more than 8,000mph. Moscow claimed the use of the weapon was in retaliation for the alleged targeting of one of Putin's residences by Ukraine, a claim that has been dismissed by US President Donald Trump, and Ukraine. Kyiv's European allies described the use of the hypersonic missile as an attempt to intimidate them from supporting Ukraine. The attack came after a week of setbacks for Russia: including the capture of Venezuela's deposed leader, and Putin ally Nicolas Maduro and US forces boarding a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic. Britain and France also announced plans this week to deploy troops in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Moscow responded saying it would view foreign soldiers in Ukraine as legitimate combat targets.

A senior Ukrainian official said that the missile, which can carry nuclear as well as conventional warheads, struck a state enterprise and was likely to have been carrying a \"dummy\" warhead - as in 2024 when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war. The Oreshnik hypersonic missile was one of 36 missiles and 242 drones that Russia launched against infrastructure in the western Lviv region, Kyiv and the surrounding area on Thursday night. Authorities said more than 20 people were injured in the capital and electricity was knocked out to more than half a million homes amid heavy snow and temperatures of around -10°C.

Zelenskyy wrote on social media after talks: \"We know which partners have the relevant missiles and equipment, and I am sincerely grateful to the United Kingdom for its readiness to help.\" He added: \"Moscow is trying to use cold weather as a tool of terror, which is why work on additional air defence capabilities for Ukraine is now an urgent priority.\""

Overnight, US Marines and navy sailors boarded the Olina tanker in the Caribbean Sea, near Trinidad, before the US Coast Guard took control of the vessel, the US Southern Command said in a statement. \"There is no safe haven for criminals,\" it added as it announced the capture of the ship. The tanker seizures have come in the days since Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro was deposed, as the US seeks to tightens its control of the South American country's oil output. On Friday, US President Donald Trump was meeting with oil executives - whom he described as \"BIG OIL\" - at the White House. The US firms are a key part of his plan to take \"billions and billions dollars of oil from Venezuela\". The Olina marks the fifth tanker in total that has been seized by US forces since last month. US government records show that the Olina was sanctioned for moving Russian oil under a previous name, Minerva M, and flagged in Panama. While records show the Olina is now flying the flag of Timor-Leste, it is listed in the international shipping registry as having a false flag, meaning the registration it is claiming is not valid.

It is the fifth seizure of a vessel alleged to be carrying sanctioned oil since December, and the third this week, following the boarding of the Sophia, also in the Caribbean, and the Marinera, a Russia-flagged vessel apprehended in the North Atlantic with RAF support. By choking off supplies transported by the so-called shadow fleet the US is tightening its grip on the oil reserves that Trump unapologetically believes can help him deliver his political and economic goals; controlling the US's South American \"backyard\", enriching US companies, and sending a powerful message to its adversaries, specifically China.

Family members of those imprisoned gathered at prisons and detention centres after the news was announced, but according to a national human rights group only nine people had been released by around 6pm UK time.

It is unclear if the car hits the officer or narrowly misses him. \n                  Wife of woman shot dead by ICE officer says 'we had whistles, they had guns' as she pays tribute\n                 \n                  Fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis: What we know \n                 \n                  Minneapolis on edge after fatal shooting - as ICE's techniques provoke anger and protests \n                 US correspondent This video is only 47 seconds long, a close-up perspective, but it has unlocked even more questions about how and why Renee Nicole Good died. It is tragic in the sense that it shows the face and demeanour of a 37-year-old woman in the moments before she dies, filmed by the person who shot her. But I don’t think the footage provides any certainty about those crucial final few seconds, during which Good puts her car into drive, turns her wheel, accelerates and is then shot at three times by the officer.  What is clear is that there is dialogue between the pair in the run-up. Good seems to be relatively calm, when she says \"that's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you.\"  Another woman, who appears to be Good's wife, seems to take a mocking tone with the officer when she says \"go get lunch, big boy.\" The audio from the phone camera is distorted at the key moment. There is a sound that could indicate a collision between the car and the officer but, again, that is not certain.  He definitely remains on his feet and at the end, appears to say \"f***ing bitch.\"  The reaction to this video shows how entrenched views are on both sides of the political aisle. The vice president says it proves the officer's \"life was endangered.\" Democrats continue to maintain she was \"murdered.\" In this country there is no time to wait for a full investigation in the rush to reach a conclusion and it could be very dangerous.  At this point, the agent exclaims in shock and shoots multiple times. As Ms Good's car careers down the road before crashing into parked cars, the agent appears to mutter \"f***ing bitch\". Sky News has chosen not to air the swear words in the video. Speaking shortly after the incident, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed the deceased was shot when she sought to \"weaponise\" her vehicle and allegedly attempted to run over an officer. In a news conference, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called those claims \"bullshit\". ICE is the federal US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency responsible for homeland security investigations and removal operations against people the US decides are in the country illegally. Its operations have ramped up significantly as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Sky News has previously witnessed people being taken off the streets by officers and bundled into vehicles, including in Washington DC. Donald Trump accused Ms Good of \"viciously\" running over an officer, sparking outrage among some in the US. While the city council in Minneapolis stated that Ms Good was \"out caring for her neighbours this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government\". Speaking on Friday, Mr Trump said: \"We will always be protecting ICE.\" Read more from Sky News:Serious threat facing Iran's leadersSwiss bar owners detained after fire£200m for UK forces in Ukraine The shooting happened on the second day of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, which border each other. On Friday, a vigil was held at the Minnesota State Capitol in St Paul, which borders Minneapolis, for Ms Good. The DHS previously said it had launched what it called the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency in Minnesota, with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Schools in Minneapolis were closed on Thursday and Friday as a result of the shooting."

        "Content": "The US military says its forces have seized a third oil tanker in the space of a week. Overnight, US Marines and navy sailors boarded the Olina tanker in the Caribbean Sea, near Trinidad, before the US Coast Guard took control of the vessel, the US Southern Command said in a statement. \"There is no safe haven for criminals,\" it added as it announced the capture of the ship. The tanker seizures have come in the days since Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro was deposed, as the US seeks to tightens its control of the South American country's oil output. On Friday, US President Donald Trump was meeting with oil executives - whom he described as \"BIG OIL\" - at the White House. The US firms are a key part of his plan to take \"billions and billions dollars of oil from Venezuela\". The Olina marks the fifth tanker in total that has been seized by US forces since last month. US government records show that the Olina was sanctioned for moving Russian oil under a previous name, Minerva M, and flagged in Panama. While records show the Olina is now flying the flag of Timor-Leste, it is listed in the international shipping registry as having a false flag, meaning the registration it is claiming is not valid. Back in July, the ship's owner and manager was changed on its registration to a Hong Kong company.

It is the fifth seizure of a vessel alleged to be carrying sanctioned oil since December, and the third this week, following the boarding of the Sophia, also in the Caribbean, and the Marinera, a Russia-flagged vessel apprehended in the North Atlantic with RAF support. By choking off supplies transported by the so-called shadow fleet the US is tightening its grip on the oil reserves that Trump unapologetically believes can help him deliver his political and economic goals; controlling the US's South American \"backyard\", enriching US companies, and sending a powerful message to its adversaries, specifically China.

Venezuela releases political prisoners In Venezuela, the remaining government is trying to grapple with the country's transition away from its former leader and dictator. Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has been sworn in as his successor. And the government began releasing political prisoners, both foreign and domestic, on Friday. Family members of those imprisoned gathered at prisons and detention centres after the news was announced, but according to a national human rights group only nine people had been released by around 6pm UK time. Steps taken toward restoring diplomatic relations Both Washington and Caracas have made moves to rebuild diplomatic relations. The US State Department sent a team to the country as Venezuela's government said it was starting a \"exploratory diplomatic process\" with the US government, \"with a view of re-establishing the diplomatic missions in both countries\"."

Major immigration crackdown The Department of Homeland Security has called the crackdown in Minneapolis and St Paul the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever, with more than 2,000 officers taking part and over 1,500 arrests made. Several bystanders filmed videos of the fatal shooting. The recordings showed an ICE officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot began to move forward and a different ICE officer stood in front of it pulled his weapon and immediately fired at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moved towards him. It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer, and there was no indication of whether the woman had interactions with agents earlier. The Minnesota agency that looks into officer-involved shootings said it has been told the FBI and US Justice Department would not work with it on the investigation into Ms Good's killing. Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the state has no jurisdiction. Without access, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it had ‍withdrawn from the investigation. Minnesota governor Tim Walz demanded the state be allowed to take part, saying it would be \"very difficult for Minnesotans\" to accept a probe excluding the state could be fair."

The smell of burning sage, said to banish negative energy, is thick in the air. Throughout the day, people of all ages and ethnicities have come to pay their respects - some crying, some hugging, and many chanting her name. Tensions had already been brewing in Minneapolis over Donald Trump's migrant crackdown. At the start of the week, the Department of Homeland Security launched a massive immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, sending 2,000 ICE officers onto the streets, against the wishes of the majority here. The techniques ICE is using to implement the administration's policy has provoked anger. But the death of Renee Nicole Good has focused that fury. A protest took place in the morning outside a federal government building where ICE officers are stationed, with small skirmishes erupting between protesters and officers. There has not been widespread unrest so far, but this remains a city on edge. Analysis of various videos, which show the moment Renee Nicole Good was killed, suggest she may have been trying to drive away from the officers, rather than ram them, as the Trump administration is claiming. Read more:What we know about Renee Nicole Good What does footage of Minneapolis shooting show?Analysis: This could be a moment of reckoning for US Aidan Perzana lives in a house opposite where the shooting happened. He was on the street in front of his house and just yards away from Renee Nicole Good's car when she was killed. He says he is convinced that she was trying to get away from police. \"There was a gap between the two men who had originally been at the car,\" he said. \"It was pretty obvious to me she was aiming for that gap. You know, she was trying to flee, no doubt in my mind.\" \"I heard the gunshots and saw the shooter,\" he added. \"After the gunshots, I looked at him briefly, and then watched the car, which drove straight for maybe 30ft. And I thought, 'oh, maybe, maybe they missed' and then pretty quickly, it drifted into the other car and the telephone pole. \"In the grand scale of things, it is more okay for a civilian to panic and try to escape than it is for a law enforcement agent to panic and kill someone.\" Other video appears to show Renee Nicole Good waving for vehicles to go by her. But the White House continues to claim she is a domestic terrorist and was somehow responsible for her own death. Vice President JD Vance offered qualified sympathy to the victim and falsely claimed there was no debate about the facts of what happened. \"In this case, you have a woman who is trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement operation,\" he said. \"Nobody debates that. You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator. Nobody debates that. I can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognising that it's a tragedy of her own making.\" One of those who came to the scene to pay respects is 29-year-old teacher Muna Jama, who is of Somalian heritage. Senior Trump officials have fixated on Minnesota and its Somali community after accusations of alleged fraud by members of the community. \"We're all just pretty torn up,\" Muna said, \"As a Somali person, I feel like she died, unfortunately, because of us. So I feel a little bit guilty. I just want to know that she didn't go out in vain and we're all thinking and praying for her. \"Everything that's been going on with ICE and everything that they're doing, is cruelty and inhumanity. We just don't stand for that whatsoever as Minnesotans.\" That feeling is echoed across the state by many people, with protests planned in various cities over the weekend."

The event was arranged as a demonstration of the robot's ability to work alongside humans. It had no chance of beating me or even landing a blow. Once I'd recovered from the bout, I was able to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technological achievement I'd just witnessed. Balance is tricky for robots, but the G1 was able to get back up even after a hefty kick. What it lacked was agility. It wasn't able to dodge my blows the way a human might. In part, this was by design - Unitree wants the humans to enjoy the experience, which means letting them win. But at the same time, this reveals a basic technological challenge faced by any humanoid robot manufacturer: making a robot nimble and light on its feet means equipping it to deal with unexpected instability. Humans don't just balance - we rethink the task mid-motion. For the most part, robots are still figuring that out. The question of balance could stand for the field of robotics as a whole. Robot butler still a long way off I came to CES to uncover the truth about robots. The hype around physical AI is almost overwhelming, and not without good reason - the success of self-driving cars shows that machines can be taught to perform as well, if not better, than the human equivalents. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang summed up the mood when I asked him about robots earlier this week. We will have robots with human capabilities \"this year\", he said, \"because I know how fast the technology is moving\". But, as I found, the fantasy of the robot butler rushing around the house to do all the chores is still a long way off, simply because human bodies and behaviours are so hard to reproduce. Laundry-folding robot One of the most impressive technical achievements I saw during my visit to CES was a robot folding laundry. The awareness and dexterity needed to manipulate soft materials have always been beyond robots, until now. However, when I investigated the laundry-folding robot further, I found that it required four days of remote operation just to get it used to the new table and lights of the unfamiliar CES setting. Dyna, the company behind it, rents it to hotels at $3,000 to $5,000 a month - and you can see the appeal because the robot can fold for 16 hours a day. Why not 24? Because it can't take the laundry away. It hasn't learnt how to do that yet. Wherever you turn, you see both how far robots have come and how far they have to go. Over the last few days, I have seen dozens of robot hands, trying to replicate all the different facets of the incredible tool we are gifted at birth. Touch, for instance, is something technologists do their best to replicate by planting tactile sensors on the robot's fingers. Or the way that human fingers have a bit of give to them, which allows them to absorb impact rather than fighting against it. In robots, the ability to yield rather than lock up is called \"back-driveability\", and is one of the cherished goals of the industry. A humanish-feeling handshake South Korean company WiRobotics showed me their new actuator - the robotic term for muscle - which has in-built force recognition designed to create back-driveability. \"It can absorb the impact and even utilise the impact,\" says Dr Yong-Jae Kim, founder and CEO of WiRobotics. His robot achieved a rare feat: a humanish-feeling handshake. That's extremely impressive from a technical point of view, but it should give you an indication of how far away we are from robot Jeeves. Even if robots do achieve perfect back-drivability, that's just the beginning. Human hands aren't always yielding. We constantly switch between softness and rigidity - gripping a phone gently, then bracing to lift a suitcase. That dynamic switching is the real goal. And at this stage, it still feels some way off. Read more from Sky News:Changes to Musk's AI bot 'insulting', No 10 saysThe 40 jobs 'most at risk' from AI - and 40 it can't touch What's changed is that now, thanks to generative AI, there's a path to get there. Every roboticist I spoke to was in agreement: generative AI has revolutionised the industry. \"Robotics has completely changed. We can make robots feel more like people. We can make them do things we've never been able to do before,\" says Aya Durbin, humanoid application product lead at Boston Dynamics. It does seem now as if humanoid robots are going to get here. It might just take a bit longer than many people hope and fear."

        "Content": "By Kaitlin Tosh, Ben van der Merwe and Joely Santa Cruz, Sky News Data and Forensics team  Oil sits at the heart of Donald Trump's Venezuelan gamble. Within a day of the US operation which ousted President Nicolas Maduro, Trump made his top priority clear: reviving the country's oil industry. \"We're going to have our very large US oil companies - the biggest anywhere in the world - go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,\" he said at a news conference on Saturday. He has since said Venezuela will imminently hand over 30 to 50 million barrels of crude to the US government - worth around £2.1bn - and the US has seized two sanctioned tankers. On top of that, he has said expanded American operations in Venezuela could be \"up and running\" in under 18 months. Big promises. But how realistic are they? Current state of affairs In the short term, it is not clear where the 30 to 50 million barrels of oil would come from. America's blockade on Venezuelan oil exports has put a chokehold on the country's oil industry. \n                  Tracking the sanctioned oil tanker's attempt to escape seizure by the US \n                 \n                  How much has sacking managers cost Manchester United?\n                 \n                  Feeling ignored, bad behaviour by staff and long-term trauma: What you told us about your maternity experiences\n                 Data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider, suggests that there are currently about 40 million barrels of Venezuelan oil in storage. Around half of those are sitting on ships that either managed to pass through the blockade or are idling off Venezuela's shores. Sky News has mapped roughly 30 US-sanctioned vessels sitting near Venezuela's coastline. Some ships are able to pass freely through the blockade - and they are American. The US imports 20% of Venezuela's oil, produced by the US oil company Chevron, which was exempted from sanctions by Joe Biden in 2022. Sky News has identified 16 tankers with a history of transporting Venezuelan crude oil to the US for processing. Four of these ships have arrived in Venezuela from the US since 6 January, while two others are still en route. This includes two vessels that set sail after Maduro's ouster on 3 January. Minerva Astra, a tanker sailing under a Greek flag, left Pascagoula in Mississippi eight hours after Maduro's seizure. Satellite imagery from 5 January captured the ship making its way past Cuba. In the longer term, even if the blockade is lifted, experts told Sky News the ambition to have the industry up and running in 18 months is unrealistic. In part because the country's oil infrastructure is in disrepair, decayed by decades of underinvestment and corruption. \"This is not gonna be cheap, this is not going to be fast, and this is not going to be easy,\" says Jorge Leon, vice president of Rystad Energy. In the best-case scenario, assuming quick stability in the government, Rystad estimates it will take five to seven years for production to double to two million barrels per day - one million lower than the highs of the early 2000s. That would cost at least £80bn. \"I think it may be a bit naive to think that we can go back to these days of two million, three million plus because the infrastructure isn't there anymore,\" says Barney Gray, global crude oil editor at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. \"To replace everything would be to take us back to those days would be possibly an unimaginable cost that private US majors are simply not prepared to bear.\" Extraction There are signs of dilapidation in every step of the supply chain. Let's start with rigs, which are used to drill new wells. Data from Baker Hughes Rig Count Report shows there were only two operational rigs in Venezuela in 2025. That number has been in single digits since 2019, when there were 24. Ten years ago, there were 67. Even if the country had greater capacity to extract oil, its ability to process it has been limited too. In part because Venezuelan oil poses challenges before it even comes out of the ground. Oil from the vast reserves in the Orinoco Belt region is a type of \"extra heavy\" crude, which requires pre-processing in order to prepare it for refining. \"The main thing to do is to build very expensive, sophisticated upgrading units,\" says Clay Seigle, senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. There are four upgrading units in the country right now, says Mr Seigle, which are key to making the county's extra heavy crude more handleable and ready for exporting. But only one is operational. The only functioning unit was built and is run by the American oil company Chevron, in a joint venture with the state oil company. \"A big piece of the puzzle is going to be renovating and maybe even building new sophisticated upgraders. That kind of initiative is going to cost tens of billions of dollars and require relatively long timescales,\" says Mr Seigle. Storage Due to the blockade and US sanctions, a lot of oil being produced in Venezuela has been kept in storage. Analytics company Kpler estimates 22 million barrels of oil were sitting in storage containers around the country in December, the majority of which were in the José industrial complex. Venezuela has enough storage units on land to fill about 48 million barrels, but not all of that possible space is functional. Kayrros, a company that uses satellite image analysis to track storage capacity, monitors roughly 98% of all the storage units in Venezuela. It has found that about a third of tanks look unused or unusable. \"On paper, it looks like there's still some spare capacity,\" says Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder at Kayrros. \"In practice, that probably is not the case.\" Analysis of satellite images show the storage units that aren't full are rusty, old and not able to be used. Like at the Puerto Miranda storage facility. The white caps in satellite imagery from 2022 indicate tanks that are working, with their tops rising and falling with the volume of oil. By 2025, far fewer of them are white. They are black - showing dirt - or orange - indicating rust. \"If you don't use a tank and you don't conduct proper maintenance, then it gets rusted pretty quickly. And then if you use a rusted tank, you face issues of leakage, but also contamination of the crude, so that creates all kinds of problems,\" says Mr Halff. Another metric for the decline of the Venezuelan industry is pollution. The thick tar-rich oil found in Venezuela is considered \"dirty\" because it contains high concentrations of carbon. Leaking pipes and infrastructure are also to blame for the especially poor environmental record of Venezuelan oil. Sky News analysis of data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) methane tracker database finds that, with approximately 10kg of methane emissions per barrel of oil produced, Venezuela far exceeds comparable countries for its intensity of methane emissions. This was more than double the 4kg of methane emissions per barrel produced in Algeria, the next biggest polluter in the top 20 major oil-producing nations. The prospects  Tackling the challenges posed by Venezuela's dilapidated infrastructure would require significant capital, and US oil companies will need serious guarantees about the legitimacy and security of contracts before making that kind of investment. With the US blockade still in place, and the political future of the country still uncertain, how willing would international investors be to invest in Venezuela? \"The answer at the moment is not very,\" says Barney Gray from the ICIS. \"Venezuela's government is in flux, corruption is endemic in the country, so automatically we're not ticking some early boxes. \"They've got a long way to go before the economics can be even remotely demonstrated.\" The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

It has about 15 million members. The RAC shareholders' plans to pursue an exit were revealed by Sky News last summer, with a public market listing understood to be their preferred option. The AA is also backed by private equity investors who have appointed bankers to explore an exit. Towerbrook Capital Partners, Warburg Pincus and Stonepeak, which collectively own the AA, have appointed JP Morgan and Rothschild to review the AA's strategic options. \n                  Reviving Venezuela's oil industry may be harder than Trump thinks - and this is why\n                 \n                  Weight-loss jabs have forced us to change up menu, Greggs says | Money blog\n                 \n                  Politics latest: U-turn over business rates hike for pubs expected in coming days\n                 The RAC employs thousands of people and is one of Britain's most recognisable consumer brands.

It is like in the schoolyard, where we feel that we are being bullied.\" Her comments come after Donald Trump again made it clear he would like to acquire the semi-autonomous territory in the North Atlantic Ocean. Politics hub - follow live The US president said this week that \"we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security\". On Wednesday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt added that acquiring the island is \"something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and national security team\". Greenland runs most of its own internal affairs - but the island's foreign, defence and security policy is controlled by Denmark.

Mr Trump's threats to Greenland have been a \"big shock to the Danish way of thinking about allies\", she added. Sir Keir spoke to the Danish PM Mette Frederiksen on Thursday afternoon, where the Labour leader \"reiterated his position on Greenland\". He also spoke to NATO General-Secretary Mark Rutte. \"I actually think the European leaders are doing a lot right now,\" Ms Thorning-Schmidt said. \"What we don't want to do is to be more aggressive or have a harder tone than is absolutely necessary at this stage. \"This can be settled extremely peacefully because there is absolutely no resistance to the Americans taking on a bigger role in Greenland.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @alexrogerssky\n A Labour MP who broke ranks to oppose the government's plans to restrict jury trials has said he is not expecting to lose the party whip - but he does \"not care\" if he does. Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, told Sky News he does not expect to be suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party, despite voting with the Conservatives on an opposition day motion opposing the controversial plans earlier this week. Politics latest: U-turn over business rates hike for pubs expected in coming days Mr Turner, a former criminal barrister who has been vocal in his opposition to the plans, told Sky News: \"I do not expect to lose the party whip - but if I do, I do not care. \"I invite them to take the whip from me if they want - at least I believe in something. If they want to take the whip off someone who believes in something, then good luck to them.\" David Lammy, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, announced last month that defendants who are likely to get a sentence of three years or less will no longer get a jury trial. He also said defendants will no longer be able to choose a jury trial, and that the ability to appeal against a magistrates' court verdict to a crown court will also be limited. Ministers have argued the move is necessary to tackle the backlog of court cases that built up over the COVID pandemic, which now stands at approximately 80,000, and that without action, that figure could reach 100,000 by 2028. But the proposals have attracted significant criticism from MPs and legal experts, who have warned about curtailing rights and a lack of evidence the move will even help bring down the backlog. 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Kirsty Brimelow, the chair of the Bar Council which represents barristers in England and Wales, told Sky News on Friday that her organisation was in complete opposition to the plans for \"pragmatic and principled reasons\" - and argued they had been put forward for \"ideological\" reasons. \"We want to cut the delays and we want the criminal justice system to return to one we are proud of, but getting rid of a deep-rooted constitutional principle, the right to a jury trial, is not the way to do it,\" she said. 'David Lammy has no backbone' Mr Turner echoed her concerns, saying he believed there was \"no question\" the proposals were about \"saving money\". \"This is only about saving money and that is what this was always about,\" he told Sky News. \"David Lammy has no backbone and Keir Starmer should be utterly ashamed of himself for allowing Lammy to fall for this civil servant's trick. \"We always accuse the Tories of knowing the cost of everything and the value of nothing. \"It seems Keir Starmer and David Lammy know the value of nothing when it comes to the right to elect for a jury trial. \"They need to U-turn immediately, just as they U-turn on everything else.\" Elsewhere in the plans, a new \"bench division\" of the crown court system, called \"swift courts\" will be created, where a judge - with no jury - will hear either-way offences that will likely have a sentence of three years or more. Those offences, such as theft, fraud and assault, can currently be heard by a magistrate or in a crown court where they can elect for a jury trial. The most serious cases, such as for rape, murder and manslaughter, will still be heard by a jury. The Tories used their opposition day in the Commons on Wednesday to call for the changes to be rejected, but were defeated by 182 votes to 290. Mr Turner - who never previously voted against the party whip - was the only Labour MP to vote against the government. MPs who vote against the government can usually expect to have the party whip removed, which forces them to sit as an independent MP in the Commons. Last year, the Labour Party removed the whip from seven Labour MPs after they voted against the government to call for the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap - a measure the government has now enacted that will come into force in April. The party whip has since been restored the rebels.

        "Headline": "The Green Party leader says he understands why Reform voters are angry - but believes they are wrong to blame migrants.",
        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @alexrogerssky\n Zack Polanski might not appear the most natural ally of Reform voters. On migration - consistently one of the most important issues for Reform voters - the Green Party leader could not be further away from Nigel Farage. Where the Reform leader believes migration has damaged Britain and advocates for \"mass deportations\", Mr Polanski views it as a positive thing that has benefitted the country. But in spite of that, Mr Polanski thinks he can win over Reform supporters. It seems a tall order, given the country's hardening attitude towards migration and the bursts of public anger that has been seen over the use of asylum hotels - most notably in Epping. But the Green Party leader believes that what is really angering people - the cost of living crisis, wage stagnation, a lack of affordable housing - is not the fault of migration. He is convinced he can flip the script by highlighting the plight of migrants and by directing the public's anger elsewhere - at billionaires, large corporations and the establishment. \n                  Open border immigration 'not pragmatic right now', says Green Party leader\n                 \n                  Scottish Greens 'riding same wave' as Green Party as membership surge continues\n                 \n                  Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana's Your Party gains first Scottish representatives\n                 That is what his trip to Calais was all about. Last week, Sky News joined Mr Polanski in the French town, once home to the \"Jungle\" refugee camp before it was demolished in 2016, to tackle the \"misinformation\" he believes surrounds the small boats crisis. \"I think when people have a reality of it, I think the majority of people are actually compassionate,\" he tells me. \"They just want to make sure that our system is fair and it's transparent.\" Mr Polanski has now surpassed 100 days as Green Party leader - the point at which the party's fortunes began to change. Since his election in September, Mr Polanski, a former member of the Liberal Democrats, has taken the Greens in a different direction. Once known as the party of the environment, the Greens now talk heavily about social and cultural issues that can be divisive - whether that be migration, transgender rights or even the \"eco-populism\" that some in his own party fear may alienate voters in rural seats. His stance on these issues has long been attributed to a strategy of courting disaffected Labour voters. In the polls, the Greens are nearly neck and neck with Labour - at 16% and 18% respectively - while there have been multiple councillor defections in recent months. But when it comes to Reform voters, Mr Polanski believes he can appeal to them by speaking about the other issues that make them angry. \"A Reform voter is very different to a Reform MP, and I have a lot more time for them if they're thinking about voting Reform, because these are the exact people I want to reach out to - to say that your problems are not caused by migration. \"And so what I want to say to those Reform voters is I get your anger, and in many ways your right to be angry. But let's not fuel that anger. Let's make sure that we're challenging power and wealth. And I'm actually your ally in that.\" Battle for British sense of fairness At the heart of the battle over migration is the British sense of fairness. The Reform leader believes it is unfair that British taxpayer money is being used to fund accommodation for asylum seekers. To him, it's the British people who are the real victims - not migrants. For Mr Polanski, what is unfair is that British taxpayer money is indeed being used - but on futile efforts to stop desperate and vulnerable people who should be given a safe haven in Britain to live and work. He says the government has given the French authorities £476m \"on the militarisation of Calais\" to deter migrants from boarding a small boat, and this is what people should be angry about. \"That money should be spent on building homes. Yes, for British people and council homes. But also we don't need to pit our housing crisis in the UK against a crisis of a relatively small amount of people who are desperately in need.\" The most stark sign of the gap between Mr Polanski and the public came when I asked him what he would say to people in Britain who might not feel sympathy for those seeking to come to the UK in a small boat. He replied: \"I think we need to make racism unacceptable again.\" I press him on whether he means that people who do not share his sympathy are racist. \"Well, I think it depends on the context, but we know lots of people have open arms and homes to Ukrainian refugees, as they absolutely should. They're also fleeing a humanitarian war zone. But you can't help but notice that Ukrainian refugees have been accepted. But where is that same kindness and compassion to human beings from Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea?\" For his critics, this is likely to be seen as a moment where the mask slipped. Read more:The 'eco-populist' who wants to be the Farage of the LeftWill Farage racism allegations deter voters? 'They're dissatisfied, distrusting, and disapproving' How can Mr Polanski win over Reform voters when countless polls - and of course Brexit - show that the public want less immigration? Joe Twyman, co founder and director at Deltapoll, casts doubt on whether Mr Polanski can change the minds of Reform voters who feel passionately about immigration. But he says, while there is a cohort of Reform voters that Mr Polanski is never going to win over, the dissolution of traditional left and right means there is some crossover between the Greens and Reform. \"There are Reform voters who are going with Reform, if you like, as a default, because they're dissatisfied, distrusting, and disapproving of other political parties - particularly the larger parties of the government. \"And so those people could be wooed to the Greens if they think that Zack Polanski is a more palatable for them as leader, and the policies are more acceptable to them.\" Against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis, and after decades of public attitudes hardening towards migration, Mr Polanski has set himself a hard task to change people's minds. Mr Polanski's critics will no doubt accuse him of wishful thinking - but in the age of personality politics and social media, perhaps it's not the story that counts but the way it is told."

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n My first fight with a robot started badly. I punched it hard in the chest and felt a jarring sensation running back up my arm. It was like hitting a brick wall. Things got better when I started kicking it. I gave it a good shove with my foot and it went reeling back into the ropes of the ring. At this point, a human might have given up, but robots are indefatigable. It bounced straight back up, ready for further punishment. So I kicked it again. Reader, I am not proud of this, but in my defence, it was the robot or me. I couldn't let humanity down. To clarify, the robot was fine with all this. Well, its owners were anyway - I didn't exchange many words with my opponent, mainly because it couldn't talk. Robot didn't stand a fighting chance Chinese robotics company Unitree invited me to fight one of its G1 units live on stage at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the world's biggest technology fair. The event was arranged as a demonstration of the robot's ability to work alongside humans. It had no chance of beating me or even landing a blow. Once I'd recovered from the bout, I was able to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technological achievement I'd just witnessed. Balance is tricky for robots, but the G1 was able to get back up even after a hefty kick. What it lacked was agility. It wasn't able to dodge my blows the way a human might. In part, this was by design - Unitree wants the humans to enjoy the experience, which means letting them win. But at the same time, this reveals a basic technological challenge faced by any humanoid robot manufacturer: making a robot nimble and light on its feet means equipping it to deal with unexpected instability. Humans don't just balance - we rethink the task mid-motion. For the most part, robots are still figuring that out. The question of balance could stand for the field of robotics as a whole. Robot butler still a long way off I came to CES to uncover the truth about robots. The hype around physical AI is almost overwhelming, and not without good reason - the success of self-driving cars shows that machines can be taught to perform as well, if not better, than the human equivalents. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang summed up the mood when I asked him about robots earlier this week. We will have robots with human capabilities \"this year\", he said, \"because I know how fast the technology is moving\". But, as I found, the fantasy of the robot butler rushing around the house to do all the chores is still a long way off, simply because human bodies and behaviours are so hard to reproduce. Laundry-folding robot One of the most impressive technical achievements I saw during my visit to CES was a robot folding laundry. The awareness and dexterity needed to manipulate soft materials have always been beyond robots, until now. However, when I investigated the laundry-folding robot further, I found that it required four days of remote operation just to get it used to the new table and lights of the unfamiliar CES setting. Dyna, the company behind it, rents it to hotels at $3,000 to $5,000 a month - and you can see the appeal because the robot can fold for 16 hours a day. Why not 24? Because it can't take the laundry away. It hasn't learnt how to do that yet. Wherever you turn, you see both how far robots have come and how far they have to go. Over the last few days, I have seen dozens of robot hands, trying to replicate all the different facets of the incredible tool we are gifted at birth. Touch, for instance, is something technologists do their best to replicate by planting tactile sensors on the robot's fingers. Or the way that human fingers have a bit of give to them, which allows them to absorb impact rather than fighting against it. In robots, the ability to yield rather than lock up is called \"back-driveability\", and is one of the cherished goals of the industry. A humanish-feeling handshake South Korean company WiRobotics showed me their new actuator - the robotic term for muscle - which has in-built force recognition designed to create back-driveability. \"It can absorb the impact and even utilise the impact,\" says Dr Yong-Jae Kim, founder and CEO of WiRobotics. His robot achieved a rare feat: a humanish-feeling handshake. That's extremely impressive from a technical point of view, but it should give you an indication of how far away we are from robot Jeeves. Even if robots do achieve perfect back-drivability, that's just the beginning. Human hands aren't always yielding. We constantly switch between softness and rigidity - gripping a phone gently, then bracing to lift a suitcase. That dynamic switching is the real goal. And at this stage, it still feels some way off.
