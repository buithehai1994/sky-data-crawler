        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has been made to look \"weak, naive and gullible\" by blaming Peter Mandelson's \"lies\" for the crisis engulfing his premiership - and it could bring him down, a senior Labour figure has said. The party's former deputy leader Baroness Harman told Sky's Electoral Dysfunction podcast the saga had become \"so serious\" for the prime minister, who will be toppled \"unless he takes action\". Sir Keir is under mounting pressure to shake up his Number 10 operation in light of the scandal. Some Labour MPs believe his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, must go. Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, Baroness Harman said he should be \"thinking about a real reset\" inside his team, and reflecting on why he appointed Lord Mandelson as the UK's US ambassador despite concerns about his record and ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Sir Keir used a speech in Hastings on Thursday to apologise to Epstein's victims for believing the peer's \"lies\" about his relationship with the paedophile financier. But Baroness Harman said: \"He's got to stop blaming Mandelson and saying, 'he lied to me'. Because, actually, he should never have been considering him in the first place. \"To say 'he lied to me' makes it look weak and naive and gullible. So it's just completely the wrong thing.\" \"Peter Mandelson was called the Prince of Darkness,\" she added. \"It's not a secret that he was a bad person. \"I think that it is very, very serious for Keir Starmer because it goes to the values of the government.\" Rigby has said the scandal has left the prime minister \"fighting for his political life\". 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Lord Mandelson had been a senior figure within New Labour under Tony Blair, but was forced to resign from two ministerial posts in scandal. He was hired by Sir Keir in early 2025 as the prime minister sought to develop positive relations with the Trump administration. He was sacked in September after he featured in a number of Epstein-related files and photos released by a US Congressional committee. The latest revelations were revealed among a tranche of three million documents released by the US Department of Justice last week. Documents relating to his appointment to the Washington job will be published by the government after MPs passed a Conservative motion on Wednesday night. But files deemed a risk to national security or international relations must first be reviewed by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, which has said there is \"no timetable\" for how long it might take. Their publication may be further delayed by a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson, over claims he leaked market sensitive information to Epstein. MPs express lack of confidence in PM In the meantime, Sir Keir has suggested top adviser Mr McSweeney is safe in his post - and that any Labour MPs contributing to speculation about his own leadership are only helping the party's opponents. Every minute not spent talking about the cost of living and fighting against the \"toxic division of Reform\" is a minute wasted, the prime minister said on Thursday. But many Labour MPs have privately expressed a lack of confidence in Sir Keir's team, and a handful, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Barry Gardiner, have publicly suggested he should consider his position. Veteran Labour backbencher Graham Stringer told Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig he does not think Sir Keir has \"a very long future\" as PM, calling the climbdown over the Lord Mandelson documents a \"fiasco too far\". \"You always blame the person at the top, the prime minister,\" Mr Stringer said. \"He got his tone wrong. He got the details wrong. And effectively the first amendment that he put down, which he had to change, was effectively - although not in name but in reality - a vote of no confidence in him. \"I don't think he's [Sir Keir] got a very long future. \"The discussion you could ask virtually any Labour MP is, it's when and who, not whether [the PM goes].\" Read more from Sky News:King heckled over Epstein scandalEmails reveal plan for Epstein to own stake in Sarah Ferguson brand The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have called for a vote of confidence in the prime minister. Speaking to Sky's political correspondent Rob Powell, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused the PM of a \"catastrophic error of judgement\" and said either Sir Keir or Mr McSweeney should take responsibility. Asked if that means that one of them should resign, Ms Badenoch replied: \"Yes\". Public in favour of change New data from pollster YouGov suggests the public are in favour of a change, with 50% of Britons believing the PM would be best standing down. Slightly less than a quarter - 24% - want him to remain in post, while 26% said they didn't know what he should do. YouGov's Peter English told Sky News the Lord Mandelson story had \"cut through\" to the public. It follows a YouGov poll earlier this week that found 95% of Brits were aware of the story, and that 44% of those surveyed were following it closely. Mr English said: \"This [the Mandelson story] is dominating the news cycle. People are paying attention. And the Mandelson thing specifically, it is definitely cutting through.\" However, Mr English added that the story is \"probably not going to change too many minds… one-off stories rarely do change minds\". Angela Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting are widely seen as the most likely candidates to replace Sir Keir. However, allies of both insist they have no intention of moving against the PM."

        "Headline": "Donald Trump suggested Sir Keir Starmer's Chagos Islands deal was the \"best he could make\" in an apparent signal of support, after attacking the agreement last month.",
        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was hardly a ringing endorsement of the deal. But it could have been a lot worse. And after the week Sir Keir Starmer has just been through, Donald Trump's grudging support for the controversial Chagos deal will have come as a relief. The good news for the PM was the president signalling he won't now block the deal the Conservatives and Reform UK have claimed is a surrender. The bad news is that the president has warned that if anything goes wrong in future, the US won't hesitate to send in the gunships and take over the islands. So it's a rare piece of moderately good news for the PM amid a relentless onslaught from opponents and Labour MPs over his bungling of the Mandelson-Epstein scandal. The Chagos deal the prime minister had made, the president said on his Truth Social, was \"according to many, the best he could make\". According to many? Who does he mean? Obviously not former ambassador Mandelson. He's now a disgraced non-person and probably just a distant memory in Washington. \"Peter who?\" they'll no doubt be saying in the White House these days. \"We'll never forget old whatshisname.\" Quite the about-turn from Trump… The news from the White House is moderately good for Sir Keir because only a few weeks ago the president called his Chagos deal \"an act of great stupidity\" and \"total weakness\". That savage criticism emboldened Conservative and Reform UK MPs and Tory peers at Westminster to attempt to kill the Chagos legislation, which is currently holed below the waterline in the House of Lords. A few days after the president's \"stupidity\" claim, Kemi Badenoch taunted Sir Keir at PMQs: \"We didn't need President Trump to tell us that. We've been saying that for 12 months.\" Read more:What is the Chagos deal and why is it controversial?Chagos deal suffers humiliating defeat The president began his statement by claiming he'd had \"very productive discussions\" with Sir Keir. We know they had a phone call and discussed Diego Garcia on Tuesday. The prime minister was said to have offered him extra security guarantees and there was another phone call on Thursday before the president's Truth Social post. The Chagos deal proposes the UK transferring sovereignty of the islands whilst leasing back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia, for an initial 99 years. But the president's statement is by no means all good news for the prime minister. There was also a pretty intimidating warning that if anything goes wrong the Americans will flex their mighty military muscles. \"If the lease deal, some time in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,\" he said. This is, after all, a president who wants to seize Greenland for the US and even make Canada the 51st US state. Don't forget, he called Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \"Governor Carney\". The president concluded his Truth Social statement: \"Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense.\" That's a reference to the fact that Diego Garcia is a bird sanctuary for endangered species, including the splendidly named \"red-footed boobies\", as well as rare turtles and coral reefs. Tories vow to fight against deal But back at Westminster, the battle over Chagos is far from over. Dame Priti Patel MP, the shadow foreign secretary, reacted: \"Keir Starmer and Peter Mandelson's shameful Chagos surrender remains an absolutely terrible deal for Britain. \"The Conservative Party's view is unchanged. We have led the fight against this appalling surrender, and we will continue fighting it to the end.\" There's also the possibility - and risk for Sir Keir - that the president may change his mind on Chagos yet again. After all, he backed the deal at first, then changed his mind. So the PM might as well be grateful for now and hope for the best. After all, while the president's latest Chagos statement may not be brilliant news, it's the only bit of decent news Sir Keir has had in a dreadful week."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       In filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, resistance is framed as survival. While there's no direct reference to ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), authority is shown as unpredictable, militarised and with the power to destabilise entire neighbourhoods. Since the film came out at the end of last September, those aspects have come to feel incredibly timely. \"Devastatingly so,\" according to its producer, Sara Murphy, after the killing by federal agents in Minneapolis of protesters Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. \"I don't think we could have anticipated just how close to home it would be,\" Murphy says, \"as a sort of reflection of the situation around race and immigration in the US.\" \"It's hitting an audience in their core,\" Murphy adds. \"I think is reflective of the world that we're living in today, but I think, hopefully, it is also an optimistic take on how we can continue to fight for the things that are important to us and find peace in community. \"I hope the takeaway is one of optimism.\" As well as being nominated for 13 Oscars, Anderson's film is the one to beat at the BAFTAs. It leads the field with 14 nominations, including best director for Thomas Anderson and best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. While the original book the film is based on, Vineland, referenced the Nixon era, Thomas Anderson's film remains ambiguous but certainly feels contemporary. It follows a fractured group of activists as they navigate an America shaped by surveillance and escalating state power, culminating in DiCaprio's character's race to find his missing daughter. 'An unpredictable ride' Speaking after the BAFTA nominations were announced, Murphy explains: \"We've been really overwhelmed, honoured and obviously proud of the film and how it's been received by audiences and critics. \"The script is a loose adaptation of the book, there are the revolutionary aspects....and then I think Paul as an artist has absorbed and observed the world that we're living in...it's become closer to home and to our current realities.\" Murphy says she hopes the film's success encourages more studios to invest in \"risky\" projects like it. \"Original films are not usually done at this level…I think it feels like a big, good-time movie,\" she says. \"I hope that, first and foremost, people are enjoying themselves, it's an unpredictable ride full of incredible performances.\" Read more from Sky News:Sledgehammer-wielding robbers raid family jewellersEven Starmer's allies are unsure about his future Could this be the year Thomas Anderson finally wins an Academy Award for his direction? The filmmaker has been both Oscar and BAFTA-nominated before but never won. While There Will Be Blood (2007), Phantom Thread (2017) and Licorice Pizza (2021) certainly generated a lot of awards buzz, this year he appears to be the frontrunner. As Murphy puts it: \"Paul is an incredible writer and director. I feel like his films are constantly challenging and surprising. I'm excited for him and all the awards the recognition. He deserves it all.\""

Gallacher said she was assaulted by a man as she walked to her car after work in central London - but he has never been found. \"He turned around and kicked me - really kicked me - like he would kick a football,\" she told the UK Tonight with Sarah-Jane Mee. The former Sky Sports presenter said violence against females had almost become acceptable and was treated as \"one of those things\". \"That's why that's why women don't report these crimes because also not enough is being done about it,\" she said. Gallacher said police were \"fantastically supportive\" at the time and she felt \"we're going to get this guy\" - especially as the CCTV was said to be clear - but the attacker appears to have evaded justice. The 50-year-old presenter said she'd been shocked by how few police were around at the time of the assault. \"My biggest sadness or anger was there was not enough of a police presence. And we're in central London and I was looking everywhere, like I almost wanted to shout, 'please help me!'\", said Gallacher. \"I would love a bigger police presence on the streets [to make women feel safe],\" she added. \"And also I would like the police to take it seriously when women go 'I've just been assaulted' - even the most minor of assaults.\" A Met Police spokesperson told Sky News it was \"committed to tackling all forms of violence against women and girls\".\"Officers spoke with the victim in this case on several occasions to share updates as the investigation progressed,\" they added.\"Our last contact with them was at the end of December when they were informed the investigation had been filed, but would be reopened if the suspect was identified.

She told Sarah-Jane Mee she had \"a low level buzzing and it's just always there\" and on some days, depending on what's going on, \"it can be really loud\". \"It can be quite low where it's manageable,\" she said. \"So it really is about navigating day by day - and some days it can drive you a bit mad.\" Read more from Sky News:Boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of teacherStudent stabbed to death in Leicester is named  Gallacher developed the condition after having a benign tumour in her ear - which has left her almost deaf on one side - and now works as an ambassador for the charity Tinnitus UK.

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n Anthropic, one of the biggest and most influential tech companies in the world, is launching a new model: Claude Opus 4.6. Until now, this would mostly be big news for techies, where Anthropic is admired as the maker of Claude Code, the code-writing AI tool which many engineers say is taking over their work entirely. All of a sudden, however, the impact of these tools is being felt more widely, after a seemingly small release from Anthropic shook some sections of the stock market. Earlier this week, Anthropic released a plug-in to their Claude chatbot, which added new tools for legal analysis. This relatively minor update sent shares of several large legal data firms tumbling. Thomson Reuters, which owns legal database Westlaw, fell nearly 16%. Analytics company RELX fell 12%. This may seem strange to outsiders because Anthropic is still relatively unknown outside the world of tech. A poll by US research firm Blue Rose Research at the end of last year found that it was known by less than 5% of the population. But analysts say that market participants, impressed by the advances in coding, are starting to wonder if the same gains can be made in other sectors. \"The market's in seek and destroy mode,\" says James Sym, partner at London-based equity firm Goodhart. \"It's just trying to find the next loser from AI. That's what you've seen in the last couple of days.\" Anthropic's latest release may add to this sense of urgency, because it is directly aimed at knowledge workers. As well as a number of improvements to coding - the ability to handle large codebases, for instance, and longer tasks - the new model is designed to deal with the kind of problems non-coders face in apps such as Excel and PowerPoint, where Claude will now be able to work directly. \"Users can build slides from a corporate template, restructure a storyline, convert bullets into diagrams, or generate a full deck from a description - all without leaving the app,\" the firm says, although users will have to pay for the privilege. It adds that this is \"our most capable model for all enterprise and knowledge work\". Anthropic says its new model outperforms its old model on a number of key benchmarks, pointing to an assessment by Norway's Sovereign Investment, which found that \"across 40 cybersecurity investigations, Claude Opus 4.6 produced the best results 38 of 40 times in blind ranking against Claude 4.5 models\". Read more from Sky News:Man who stabbed nine-year-old in the heart guilty of murderEven Starmer's allies are unsure about his future But the firm is playing down the impact of its knowledge work tools, directing people to statements made by legal software-makers who build specialist tools using Claude Code. \"There is an important difference between a plugin and operating a collaborative, matter-centric, production-grade platform used by hundreds of the world's leading legal teams,\" says Max Junestrand, CEO at Legora, an AI tool for lawyers. The market is not seeing things in such a nuanced way, says Sym of Goodhart, who suggests this could be the \"canary in the coal mine\" for the end of the exuberance around AI. \"If you think about how bubbles in history have evolved over time, they normally follow a bit of a pattern, and what happens is fewer and fewer companies seem to be the winners. That is what's obviously happened at the moment. \"This may well be just part of that normal pattern where you're seeing the market decide, actually, it is only going to be a very narrow set of people who win. And of course, the step after that is the whole bubble bursts. And that is what we could be looking at.\""

Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her home near Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday evening after being dropped off by family. She was reported missing the next day after she did not appear at church, and a ransom note demanding Bitcoin was sent to several media outlets. Latest updates on missing mother Blood belonging to Ms Guthrie - whose daughter Savannah Guthrie is co-anchor of the Today show - was found in the porch area. Her family have released a video pleading with whoever might have her to get in touch and provide proof she is alive. The FBI said on Thursday that no further contact had been made since the ransom note was sent - as it also announced a $50,000 (£37,000) reward. \n                  Savannah Guthrie makes emotional plea to mother's captors: 'We are ready to talk'\n                 \n                  Police investigating disappearance of US TV presenter Savannah Guthrie's mother\n                 \n                  Charlie Kirk's widow forgives his killer\n                 Local sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters the case was being treated as kidnapping but said they hadn't yet identified any suspects. However, he said he believes Ms Guthrie - who needs daily medication - \"is still out there\". There were several cameras at her home including a doorbell cam, and one detected movement at 2.12am, but the sheriff said they hadn't been able to retrieve the footage. Ms Guthrie's pacemaker app also disconnected from her phone at 2.28am, the sheriff added. The ransom note gave a 5pm deadline (midnight UK time) on Thursday for payment to be made, and a second deadline on Monday, said lead FBI agent Heith Janke. Mr Janke urged the perpetrator to change course and let Ms Guthrie go. \"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a much worse scenario for you. Please return Nancy home,\" he urged. 'We need to know she's alive' The huge publicity over the case in the US has also caught Donald Trump's attention. The president said on Truth Social that he had spoken to Savannah Guthrie and directed all federal law enforcement to be available. The Guthrie family's video, recorded with FBI assistance, spoke directly to the kidnapper. It urged: \"We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her.

You are God's precious daughter.\" The amount demanded in the note has not been disclosed and FBI agent Mr Janke said any decision on whether to pay is \"ultimately decided by the family\". He added that agents had also arrested a \"total imposter\" on Thursday morning who had sent a ransom note and was looking to profit from the case."

It's one of two proposals being considered by MPs and peers, and would see work on the building, which mostly dates from the Victorian era, completed in stages. Under the second option presented by the restoration and renewal client board, both houses would leave the Palace of Westminster for between 19 and 24 years while works take place at a cost of up to £15.6bn. The client board, which is made up of members of the commissions of both Houses of Parliament, warned in a statement on Thursday that a decision on starting restoration work \"is needed now\". It said the site's fabric and services \"have deteriorated and require substantial repair or replacement\", adding: \"We are beyond the point where putting off these major works is sustainable.\" MPs and peers have also been asked to agree to initial restoration works at the Houses of Parliament lasting seven years, at a cost of up to £3bn. That work could start in 2026 if approved with a motion from both Houses. The board will then ask them to choose between the final two options by mid-2030. Repairing the inside of the Victoria Tower, building a jetty on the Thames for deliveries by river, and starting underground construction on tunnel shafts are all part of the first phase. If it's decided to move out fully, Commons business will start to be transferred to the so-called Northern Estate - outside the palace but close by - and the Lords to the nearby QEII conference centre from 2032. Current repair costs 'unsustainable' Repairs and maintenance of the Palace of Westminster currently runs at a cost of £1.5m a week, which is \"unsustainable\", according to the proposals. Heating in a large part of the House of Lords is set to fail and there are significant problems with the sewage system. Since 2016, there have been 36 fire incidents, 12 asbestos incidents and 19 stone-masonry incidents.

But this was subsequently revisited amid concerns about the cost."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n In a crowd of hundreds, two voices on the royal visit to Essex would inevitably end up grabbing some of the attention. A man heckling about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in an apparent reference to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, and a reporter asking a question, neither getting any kind of response from the King. The monarch was dodging the questions and the wet weather in Dedham. He's been in this position many times over the years, scandals threatening to overshadow his engagements. His approach - and I've seen it on many occasions - is don't answer and don't give the story further oxygen. A man in the crowd, who was wearing a grey hat and holding a blue umbrella, shouted as the King was near him: \"Charles, Charles, have you pressurised the police to start investigating Andrew?\" Shortly afterwards a news reporter in the crowd - who was beside a cameraman - apparently tried to ask Charles a question about his brother. The shouts are a story but his response, should he give one, would be much bigger. That will frustrate those who believe the monarch should say more, that the institution has questions to answer about Andrew and the Epstein files. From speaking to palace sources, they're clearly keen to make sure the public don't think they're burying their heads in the sand on this. Like all of us they can't help but watch developments closely, especially when they involve one of their own. In some ways, the fact Prince Edward was bounced into answering a question about it, while on an official trip in Dubai, did them a favour. Read more:Epstein survivors criticise handling of filesEpstein files: The key findings so far He could again publicly reiterate the new palace line that the focus should be on remembering the victims, repeating an important part of the palace statement released back in October when the King stripped Andrew of his home and titles. On Thursday, his priority would have been the hundreds of people who were braving the cold and the rain to see him and the Queen, and celebrating the community of Dedham. Largely a crowd who believe that he's done the right things so far and that his brother has left him in a really tricky position, a crowd who also didn't appreciate the King being shouted at. Like the monarch they didn't want Andrew to distract from their big day, but the enormity of the Epstein scandal always meant that was in many ways unpreventable."

        "Content": "A man who stabbed a nine-year-old girl playing outside her mother's embroidery shop has been found guilty of murder. Deividas Skebas, 26, knifed Lilia Valutyte in the heart as she played with a hula hoop in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 28 July 2022. Skebas, a Lithuanian who has schizophrenia and moved back to the UK just weeks before the attack, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Lilia's mother, Lina Savickiene, said she had found her daughter \"covered in blood and with the hoop around her\". She initially thought \"something might have happened\" with the hula hoop and described shouting for help while trying to cover her daughter's wounds as she became pale. An off-duty police officer tried to help save Lilia but their efforts were unsuccessful. Skebas was judged mentally unfit to stand trial in 2023, but that assessment changed in spring 2025 and a criminal trial began at Lincoln Crown Court last week. Jurors were told there was no dispute he had killed Lilia but they had to decide what his state of mind was. Prosecutors said he had known what he was doing in stabbing Lilia - who would have been 13 this week - and tried to avoid being caught. Opening the case, Christopher Donnellan KC told jurors: \"This deliberate murder was clearly a wicked act. He knew his conduct was wrong. He knew he was killing a child.\" CCTV showed Skebas buying a knife two days before, as well as circling the area and launching the fatal attack before fleeing. The Crown Prosecution Service said the video evidence was crucial in showing his judgement was not impaired. The killer also shaved off his beard after the murder, and phone evidence showed him making arrangements to leave the UK, including asking family to lend him money to travel. Read more from Sky News:Russian captain jailed after deadly tanker collisionOne dead, three injured after Dublin bus crash Defence barrister Andrew Campbell-Tiech KC told the court that Skebas, who appeared via videolink from the high security Rampton Hospital, was \"quite obviously deluded\".

He will be sentenced on 25 February. \"During these nine years we lived life fully, we visited many places, we didn't stand still,\" said Lilia's mother in a statement. \"This is not something you recover from,\" she added. \"Sometimes terrifying thoughts overwhelm the mind and during this trial there have been many, many more.\" \"Why her? Why us? The questions remain unanswered,\" she said. Lilia's stepfather, Aurelijus Savickas, described Lilia as a \"beautiful soul\" with a \"strong character\", adding: \"Lilia, you will always live in our hearts, you are forever loved, forever missed.\""

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has been made to look \"weak, naive and gullible\" by blaming Peter Mandelson's \"lies\" for the crisis engulfing his premiership - and it could bring him down, a senior Labour figure has said. The party's former deputy leader Baroness Harman told Sky's Electoral Dysfunction podcast the saga had become \"so serious\" for the prime minister, who will be toppled \"unless he takes action\". Sir Keir is under mounting pressure to shake up his Number 10 operation in light of the scandal. Some Labour MPs believe his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, must go. Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, Baroness Harman said he should be \"thinking about a real reset\" inside his team, and reflecting on why he appointed Lord Mandelson as the UK's US ambassador despite concerns about his record and ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Sir Keir used a speech in Hastings on Thursday to apologise to Epstein's victims for believing the peer's \"lies\" about his relationship with the paedophile financier. But Baroness Harman said: \"He's got to stop blaming Mandelson and saying, 'he lied to me'. Because, actually, he should never have been considering him in the first place. \"To say 'he lied to me' makes it look weak and naive and gullible. So it's just completely the wrong thing.\" \"Peter Mandelson was called the Prince of Darkness,\" she added. \"It's not a secret that he was a bad person. \"I think that it is very, very serious for Keir Starmer because it goes to the values of the government.\" Rigby has said the scandal has left the prime minister \"fighting for his political life\". 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Lord Mandelson had been a senior figure within New Labour under Tony Blair, but was forced to resign from two ministerial posts in scandal. He was hired by Sir Keir in early 2025 as the prime minister sought to develop positive relations with the Trump administration. He was sacked in September after he featured in a number of Epstein-related files and photos released by a US Congressional committee. The latest revelations were revealed among a tranche of three million documents released by the US Department of Justice last week. Documents relating to his appointment to the Washington job will be published by the government after MPs passed a Conservative motion on Wednesday night. But files deemed a risk to national security or international relations must first be reviewed by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, which has said there is \"no timetable\" for how long it might take. Their publication may be further delayed by a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson, over claims he leaked market sensitive information to Epstein. MPs express lack of confidence in PM In the meantime, Sir Keir has suggested top adviser Mr McSweeney is safe in his post - and that any Labour MPs contributing to speculation about his own leadership are only helping the party's opponents. Every minute not spent talking about the cost of living and fighting against the \"toxic division of Reform\" is a minute wasted, the prime minister said on Thursday. But many Labour MPs have privately expressed a lack of confidence in Sir Keir's team, and a handful, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Barry Gardiner, have publicly suggested he should consider his position. Veteran Labour backbencher Graham Stringer told Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig he does not think Sir Keir has \"a very long future\" as PM, calling the climbdown over the Lord Mandelson documents a \"fiasco too far\". \"You always blame the person at the top, the prime minister,\" Mr Stringer said. \"He got his tone wrong. He got the details wrong. And effectively the first amendment that he put down, which he had to change, was effectively - although not in name but in reality - a vote of no confidence in him. \"I don't think he's [Sir Keir] got a very long future. \"The discussion you could ask virtually any Labour MP is, it's when and who, not whether [the PM goes].\" Read more from Sky News:King heckled over Epstein scandalEmails reveal plan for Epstein to own stake in Sarah Ferguson brand The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have called for a vote of confidence in the prime minister. Speaking to Sky's political correspondent Rob Powell, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused the PM of a \"catastrophic error of judgement\" and said either Sir Keir or Mr McSweeney should take responsibility. Asked if that means that one of them should resign, Ms Badenoch replied: \"Yes\". Public in favour of change New data from pollster YouGov suggests the public are in favour of a change, with 50% of Britons believing the PM would be best standing down. Slightly less than a quarter - 24% - want him to remain in post, while 26% said they didn't know what he should do. YouGov's Peter English told Sky News the Lord Mandelson story had \"cut through\" to the public. It follows a YouGov poll earlier this week that found 95% of Brits were aware of the story, and that 44% of those surveyed were following it closely. Mr English said: \"This [the Mandelson story] is dominating the news cycle. People are paying attention. And the Mandelson thing specifically, it is definitely cutting through.\" However, Mr English added that the story is \"probably not going to change too many minds… one-off stories rarely do change minds\". Angela Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting are widely seen as the most likely candidates to replace Sir Keir. However, allies of both insist they have no intention of moving against the PM."

The former Sky Sports presenter said violence against females had almost become acceptable and was treated as \"one of those things\". \"That's why that's why women don't report these crimes because also not enough is being done about it,\" she said. Gallacher said police were \"fantastically supportive\" at the time and she felt \"we're going to get this guy\" - especially as the CCTV was said to be clear - but the attacker appears to have evaded justice. The 50-year-old presenter said she'd been shocked by how few police were around at the time of the assault. \"My biggest sadness or anger was there was not enough of a police presence. And we're in central London and I was looking everywhere, like I almost wanted to shout, 'please help me!'\", said Gallacher. \"I would love a bigger police presence on the streets [to make women feel safe],\" she added. \"And also I would like the police to take it seriously when women go 'I've just been assaulted' - even the most minor of assaults.\" A Met Police spokesperson told Sky News it was \"committed to tackling all forms of violence against women and girls\".\"Officers spoke with the victim in this case on several occasions to share updates as the investigation progressed,\" they added.\"Our last contact with them was at the end of December when they were informed the investigation had been filed, but would be reopened if the suspect was identified.

She told Sarah-Jane Mee she had \"a low level buzzing and it's just always there\" and on some days, depending on what's going on, \"it can be really loud\". \"It can be quite low where it's manageable,\" she said. \"So it really is about navigating day by day - and some days it can drive you a bit mad.\" Read more from Sky News:Boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of teacherStudent stabbed to death in Leicester is named  Gallacher developed the condition after having a benign tumour in her ear - which has left her almost deaf on one side - and now works as an ambassador for the charity Tinnitus UK.

Under the second option presented by the restoration and renewal client board, both houses would leave the Palace of Westminster for between 19 and 24 years while works take place at a cost of up to £15.6bn. The client board, which is made up of members of the commissions of both Houses of Parliament, warned in a statement on Thursday that a decision on starting restoration work \"is needed now\". It said the site's fabric and services \"have deteriorated and require substantial repair or replacement\", adding: \"We are beyond the point where putting off these major works is sustainable.\" MPs and peers have also been asked to agree to initial restoration works at the Houses of Parliament lasting seven years, at a cost of up to £3bn. That work could start in 2026 if approved with a motion from both Houses. The board will then ask them to choose between the final two options by mid-2030. Repairing the inside of the Victoria Tower, building a jetty on the Thames for deliveries by river, and starting underground construction on tunnel shafts are all part of the first phase. If it's decided to move out fully, Commons business will start to be transferred to the so-called Northern Estate - outside the palace but close by - and the Lords to the nearby QEII conference centre from 2032. Current repair costs 'unsustainable' Repairs and maintenance of the Palace of Westminster currently runs at a cost of £1.5m a week, which is \"unsustainable\", according to the proposals. Heating in a large part of the House of Lords is set to fail and there are significant problems with the sewage system. Since 2016, there have been 36 fire incidents, 12 asbestos incidents and 19 stone-masonry incidents.

MPs and peers had agreed a plan in 2018 for both the Commons and Lords to move to temporary facilities near the existing site to allow essential repairs and upgrades to be made. But this was subsequently revisited amid concerns about the cost."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, is not given to emotional outbursts or shooting from the hip. Being measured in your public comments is part of the job description for running a central bank, and Mr Bailey has stuck to it since succeeding Mark Carney in 2020. (To understand the constraints of the job, consider the transformation in the Canadian's public persona since he swapped Threadneedle Street for his country's premiership). Epstein files latest - Andrew's photo claims undermined So it felt significant that Mr Bailey should speak with controlled anger - emotion even - when asked by Sky News for his reaction to the revelation that Peter Mandelson was sharing market-sensitive information with Jeffrey Epstein while business secretary in 2008. \"I mean, I am shocked by what we're hearing. I am shocked by what we now learn about what went on during the financial crisis period.\" That context matters. \n                  Interest rate cuts 'likely' later this year - Bank of England\n                 \n                  Bank of England governor holds key to 'likely' rate cuts ahead\n                 \n                  Bank of England rate cut to 3.75% following fall in inflation\n                 Back in 2008, Mr Bailey was part of the bank's senior management battling, in harness with the Treasury and Downing Street, to prevent the financial system toppling over. There was the genuine prospect of cashpoints running dry and of governments being unable to sustain the borrowing required to bail them out. In the UK, ministers and officials pondered selling off state-owned assets worth £20bn to ease the burden, while in Europe, the EU was working on a €500m (£435m) rescue package. Mr Mandelson allegedly passed details of both to Epstein via email before they were made public, according to Epstein files revelations. Little wonder that Mr Bailey, a man with a front-row seat on the drama, sounded outraged. There was a personal edge to his comments, too. He sounded genuinely emotional when recalling the role of the late Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, working to shore up the economy, and now \"unable to speak for himself\" about the revelation that a close colleague was undermining him. The governor's reaction may also be explained by the fact he is one of the few people in the British institutional establishment with direct experience of challenging Epstein's circle on their links to the paedophile financier. Read more on Sky News:Epstein plan to invest in Fergie brandKing's silence 'will frustrate some'Epstein files: The key findings so far In 2019, as head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), he approved the investigation of Jes Staley, the American chief executive of Barclays, over his ties to Epstein. Following Epstein's arrest, the FCA suspected Mr Staley had not been honest about the extent of their relationship. Mr Staley was forced to resign in 2020, subsequently banned from holding senior executive position in financial services, and lost an appeal last year in which Andrew Bailey gave evidence. \"I don't want to sound pious, but this is for all of us - how is it that we live in a society that in which this happened and the cover-up happened as well?\" he asked. In the sorry story of Epstein's pollution of the British monarchy, politics and the City, he is in a very small club of people whose conduct is entirely vindicated."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n In a crowd of hundreds, two voices on the royal visit to Essex would inevitably end up grabbing some of the attention. A man heckling about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in an apparent reference to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, and a reporter asking a question, neither getting any kind of response from the King. The monarch was dodging the questions and the wet weather in Dedham. He's been in this position many times over the years, scandals threatening to overshadow his engagements. His approach - and I've seen it on many occasions - is don't answer and don't give the story further oxygen. A man in the crowd, who was wearing a grey hat and holding a blue umbrella, shouted as the King was near him: \"Charles, Charles, have you pressurised the police to start investigating Andrew?\" Shortly afterwards a news reporter in the crowd - who was beside a cameraman - apparently tried to ask Charles a question about his brother. The shouts are a story but his response, should he give one, would be much bigger. That will frustrate those who believe the monarch should say more, that the institution has questions to answer about Andrew and the Epstein files. From speaking to palace sources, they're clearly keen to make sure the public don't think they're burying their heads in the sand on this. Like all of us they can't help but watch developments closely, especially when they involve one of their own. In some ways, the fact Prince Edward was bounced into answering a question about it, while on an official trip in Dubai, did them a favour. Read more:Epstein survivors criticise handling of filesEpstein files: The key findings so far He could again publicly reiterate the new palace line that the focus should be on remembering the victims, repeating an important part of the palace statement released back in October when the King stripped Andrew of his home and titles. On Thursday, his priority would have been the hundreds of people who were braving the cold and the rain to see him and the Queen, and celebrating the community of Dedham. Largely a crowd who believe that he's done the right things so far and that his brother has left him in a really tricky position, a crowd who also didn't appreciate the King being shouted at. Like the monarch they didn't want Andrew to distract from their big day, but the enormity of the Epstein scandal always meant that was in many ways unpreventable."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Northern towns could be in line for a funding boost after complaints from MPs that a new system for allocating cash to councils favours London. Ministers have been holding talks with northwest MPs about making tweaks to the fair funding formula - which some MPs claim left them \"absolutely shafted\". Politics Live: Trump says Starmer's Chagos Islands deal is the 'best he could make' The formula is aimed at giving areas with the highest need the most money from central government. Northern towns were initially expected to be the big winners. However ministers have used a measure of deprivation that heavily factors in housing costs, which northwest MPs say weights the formula in favour of London. \"It's completely skew-whiffed the figures …. we've been absolutely shafted\", one northern MP told Sky News. London and the southeast have the highest housing costs in the country and London councils had argued this should be factored into how the money is allocated. \n                  Starmer branded 'weak' over Mandelson saga - as top Labour figure warns it could bring him down\n                 \n                  Mandelson saga will bring PM down unless he takes 'necessary action', Harman warns\n                 \n                  Trump grudgingly supports Starmer's Chagos deal\n                 However, northern MPs argue deprivation in their areas is driven by other significant factors including low incomes and lack of opportunity. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 One MP said while they were sympathetic to London's housing crisis, London \"also has better state schools, transport links, job opportunities and cultural opportunities we just don't have\". Another said this wasn't about the north-south divide but about \"social justice\". They said poverty in their town had increased by \"horrendous\" levels, adding: \"It's there to be seen but it's being ignored. The formula is anything but fair.\" The provisional settlement announced in December means all authorities in the Liverpool City Region (LCR) are getting less than the national average, as well as nearby areas like Blackpool, Wigan and Warrington. These areas were expecting to be among the biggest winners, based on modelling from the summer seen by Sky News. However, the government said in November that it would update its measure of deprivation to better consider housing costs. The government has used the English Indices of Deprivation 2025, which they say offers an \"accurate and robust\" measure of relative deprivation. Analysis by SIGOMA, which represents areas outside London, found the change caused a shift towards the capital with outer London areas seeing the highest increases. Places like Newham and Brent are now getting millions more than expected while Blackpool and Knowsley are getting millions less. Reform UK threat The formula is the first overhaul of government finance in a decade and means money allocated across England will rise from £83.2bn in 2026/27 to £90.3bn in 2028/29, with most areas seeing an increase overall. Northern towns have generally fared better than rural areas and parts of inner London. However, MPs who spoke to Sky News said their areas need visible and significant investment if they are to fend off the challenge from Reform UK. One said while this deal is better than under the Conservatives, it \"barely touches the sides\" if they are to reverse a decade of cuts and stop the electorate \"rolling the dice\" on Nigel Farage's party. The provisional settlement still needs to be finalised, before being put to a vote in the House of Commons. Ministers will want to avoid even a small rebellion given the febrile mood within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) currently. Read More:Starmer's future uncertain after toughest day yetStarmer pledges extra £800m for deprived areas  Steve Reed, the cabinet minister for housing and communities, is said to have held \"constructive talks\" with those lobbying for change. Steve Rotheram, the Metro Mayor for the Liverpool region, is among the senior figures to have raised the issue. One suggestion is the government could increase the Recovery Grant, a £600m pot launched last year to give immediate financial support to councils hit hardest by a decade of funding cuts. The grant - based on the previous measure of deprivation - will continue to be allocated as part of the fair funding settlement and there have been calls for it to increase by £400m per year to offset perceived losses from the fair funding formula. The grant comes with a guarantee that upper-tier authorities in receipt of it will get a year-on-year increase across the multi-settlement period, starting with 5%. This guarantee could also increase. Those involved in the talks have been told to expect good news, multiple sources said, though nothing has been confirmed. A government spokesperson said: \"We are repairing local government after years of decline and will shortly set out our consultation response confirming the final Local Government Finance Settlement for 2026-27.\""

Acting chief superintendent Denzil Clark, from Queensland Police, said: \"Due to the volume of images and videos of children on the alleged offender's devices, the process of identification took time, skill and commitment. \"This is extremely concerning and disturbing offending.

        "Content": "Taiwan shares a \"rock solid\" relationship with the United States, its president has insisted - despite talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping over the self-governed island's future. During a phone call on Wednesday, Mr Xi warned his American counterpart to be \"prudent\" about giving arms to Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed. Last December, the US announced it would ship more than $11.1bn of weapons to the island - its largest package ever. \"The Taiwan-US relationship is rock solid, and all cooperation projects will continue uninterrupted,\" Taiwan President Lai Ching-te told reporters during a visit to textile merchants in western Taiwan. Taiwan is a self-governing island that China claims as its own and is willing to use force to reclaim, prompting fears of a future invasion. Beijing even prohibits all countries with which it has diplomatic relations, including the US, from having formal ties with Taipei.

It said: \"President Xi emphasised that the Taiwan question is the most important issue in China - US relations.

He said: \"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realise how important it is to keep it that way.\" The $11.1bn arms shipment announced in December is not over the line yet, having still not been approved by Congress. There has also been significant pushback to the deal from within China, which conducted military drills around Taiwan in response."

They are the Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel called a \"militia that kills\" by Milan mayor Beppe Sala following the deaths of two Americans last month in Minneapolis.

But just their presence here has been a concern for protesting locals in Milan. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  Add in how tensions have been stoked in recent weeks between Mr Trump and Europe over his threats to capture Greenland, and it all raises the potential for a hostile atmosphere greeting American officials and athletes in the opening ceremony at the San Siro home of AC and Inter Milan on Friday night. So, I asked International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry: would jeering be freedom of expression, or is there a need for spectators to show respect? \"I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone ⁠as an opportunity ‍to be respectful of each other,\" Ms Coventry said, reflecting on seeing athletes from different countries mixing in the official Olympic village in Milan. \"It was a real opportunity to put into perspective how we could be. \"And so I hope that the opening ceremony will do that and will be a reminder for everyone how we could be.\" US Games on the horizon Ms Coventry is yet to meet Mr Trump despite the Los Angeles Olympics being just two years away. But Olympic chiefs are facing pressure from IOC members in Africa to tackle concerns about the impact of Mr Trump's travel bans on delegations. Officials from Ethiopia and Djibouti challenged LA 2028 chiefs during meetings in Milan about the need for equal access for all countries to the games - beyond athletes. Ms Coventry's own Zimbabwe is subject to restrictions for some citizens for entry to the US. Her lack of contact with Mr Trump after a year leading the IOC contrasts with the US leaders' regular meetings with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, although his World Cup is sooner - coming this summer.

Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her home near Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday evening after being dropped off by family. She was reported missing the next day after she did not appear at church, and a ransom note demanding Bitcoin was sent to several media outlets. Latest updates on missing mother Blood belonging to Ms Guthrie - whose daughter Savannah Guthrie is co-anchor of the Today show - was found in the porch area. Her family have released a video pleading with whoever might have her to get in touch and provide proof she is alive.

However, he said he believes Ms Guthrie - who needs daily medication - \"is still out there\". There were several cameras at her home including a doorbell cam, and one detected movement at 2.12am, but the sheriff said they hadn't been able to retrieve the footage. Ms Guthrie's pacemaker app also disconnected from her phone at 2.28am, the sheriff added. The ransom note gave a 5pm deadline (midnight UK time) on Thursday for payment to be made, and a second deadline on Monday, said lead FBI agent Heith Janke. Mr Janke urged the perpetrator to change course and let Ms Guthrie go. \"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a much worse scenario for you. Please return Nancy home,\" he urged. 'We need to know she's alive' The huge publicity over the case in the US has also caught Donald Trump's attention. The president said on Truth Social that he had spoken to Savannah Guthrie and directed all federal law enforcement to be available. The Guthrie family's video, recorded with FBI assistance, spoke directly to the kidnapper. It urged: \"We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her.

He added that agents had also arrested a \"total imposter\" on Thursday morning who had sent a ransom note and was looking to profit from the case."

        "Content": "Mystery surrounds the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US TV host Savannah Guthrie. The 84-year-old went missing from her home in Arizona under suspicious circumstances. She was last seen at her home near Tucson on Saturday evening and was reported missing the following morning. Investigators said they had found signs of forced entry and believe she was taken against her will. In a case that has more questions than answers - here's everything we know so far. What do we know about the disappearance? The NBC News anchor's mother was last seen at around 9.30pm on Saturday, when she was dropped off at home by family after having dinner with them, the sheriff's department said. Ms Guthrie, who lives alone, was then reported missing by her family on Sunday after she did not attend church. Chris Nanos, the Pima County sheriff, said on Monday: \"We don't see this as a search mission so much as it is a crime scene.\" He said Ms Guthrie has limited mobility and requires daily medication. \"This is not dementia related,\" he said. \"She's as sharp as a tack. The family wants everyone to know that this isn't someone who just wandered off.\" He warned whoever took her that she could die without access to medication. He said: \"If she's alive right now, her meds are vital. I can't stress that enough. It's been better than 24 hours, and the family tells us if she doesn't have those meds, it can become fatal.\" What do we know about the investigation? Search and rescue teams were supported by volunteers, Border Patrol, and the homicide team after Ms Guthrie was reported missing, but they were stood down by the end of Monday as the case started to be treated as a criminal investigation. Police have said there were signs of forced entry at the property, and DNA samples have been gathered and submitted for analysis as part of the investigation. \"We've gotten some back, but nothing to indicate any suspects,\" Mr Nanos said. A person familiar with the inquiry told the Associated Press that evidence in the home indicated that she had been kidnapped during the night. Read more:Man who tried to kill Trump on golf course jailed for lifeEpstein files: The key findings so far They said that several of Ms Guthrie's personal items, including her mobile phone, wallet and her car, had been left in her property. Investigators do not believe at this point that the abduction was part of a robbery, home invasion or kidnapping-for-ransom plot, the person said. Police officers have been reviewing information from licence plate cameras and surveillance video from nearby homes while working to analyse data from local phone towers. Several media organisations reported receiving apparent ransom notes earlier this week that they handed over to police. The sheriff's department said it's taking the possible ransom notes and other tips seriously but has yet to comment further. What has Savannah Guthrie said? Savannah Guthrie shared a video on social media in which she addressed her mother's captor alongside her sister Annie and brother Cameron. \"We are ready to talk,\" the anchor said. \"However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. \"We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.\" She added: \"Our mum is our heart and our home. She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, she needs it not to suffer. \"Mummy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter.\" Shortly after the video was posted, Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. \"We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY!\" Savannah Guthrie co-hosts Today, the morning show on NBC News, the US sister network of Sky News. She often brought her mother on as a guest. Speaking on the show in 2022 on Nancy Guthrie's 80th birthday, she said: \"She has met unthinkable challenges in her life with grit, without self-pity, with determination and always, always with unshakeable faith. \"She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       In filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, resistance is framed as survival. While there's no direct reference to ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), authority is shown as unpredictable, militarised and with the power to destabilise entire neighbourhoods. Since the film came out at the end of last September, those aspects have come to feel incredibly timely. \"Devastatingly so,\" according to its producer, Sara Murphy, after the killing by federal agents in Minneapolis of protesters Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. \"I don't think we could have anticipated just how close to home it would be,\" Murphy says, \"as a sort of reflection of the situation around race and immigration in the US.\" \"It's hitting an audience in their core,\" Murphy adds. \"I think is reflective of the world that we're living in today, but I think, hopefully, it is also an optimistic take on how we can continue to fight for the things that are important to us and find peace in community. \"I hope the takeaway is one of optimism.\" As well as being nominated for 13 Oscars, Anderson's film is the one to beat at the BAFTAs. It leads the field with 14 nominations, including best director for Thomas Anderson and best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. While the original book the film is based on, Vineland, referenced the Nixon era, Thomas Anderson's film remains ambiguous but certainly feels contemporary. It follows a fractured group of activists as they navigate an America shaped by surveillance and escalating state power, culminating in DiCaprio's character's race to find his missing daughter. 'An unpredictable ride' Speaking after the BAFTA nominations were announced, Murphy explains: \"We've been really overwhelmed, honoured and obviously proud of the film and how it's been received by audiences and critics. \"The script is a loose adaptation of the book, there are the revolutionary aspects....and then I think Paul as an artist has absorbed and observed the world that we're living in...it's become closer to home and to our current realities.\" Murphy says she hopes the film's success encourages more studios to invest in \"risky\" projects like it. \"Original films are not usually done at this level…I think it feels like a big, good-time movie,\" she says. \"I hope that, first and foremost, people are enjoying themselves, it's an unpredictable ride full of incredible performances.\" Read more from Sky News:Sledgehammer-wielding robbers raid family jewellersEven Starmer's allies are unsure about his future Could this be the year Thomas Anderson finally wins an Academy Award for his direction? The filmmaker has been both Oscar and BAFTA-nominated before but never won.

As Murphy puts it: \"Paul is an incredible writer and director. I feel like his films are constantly challenging and surprising. I'm excited for him and all the awards the recognition. He deserves it all.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The Bank of England has held interest rates at 3.75% but signalled that further cuts are now \"likely\" later in the year as inflation falls back to the Bank's 2% target faster than expected. In a narrow decision, five members of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to maintain rates at the level set in December, with governor Andrew Bailey casting the deciding vote, while four favoured a further 0.25 percentage point cut to 3.5%. The tightness of the vote and an apparent hardening of the Bank's language suggests the next rate cut could come as soon as the next MPC meetings in mid-March or early April. Money latest: What interest rate hold means for your money Before the publication of the MPC decision and minutes, markets had priced in two further rate cuts this year. \"We now think that inflation will fall back to around 2% by the spring,\" said Mr Bailey, \"That's good news. We need to make sure that inflation stays there, so we've held rates unchanged at 3.75% today. All going well, there should be scope for some further reduction in the Bank rate this year.\" More rapidly falling inflation \n                  Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey 'shocked' by Peter Mandelson's alleged leaks to Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Bank of England governor holds key to 'likely' rate cuts ahead\n                 \n                  Bank of England rate cut to 3.75% following fall in inflation\n                 The decision reflects the Bank's latest forecast, which shows inflation falling back to 2% in the second quarter of the year, a more rapid decline than previously thought from the 3.4% recorded in December. The Bank's forecast concluded that cuts to energy bills announced in the budget will shave around 0.5 percentage points off inflation, with a decline in food price rises also contributing. Last November, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced changes to the way energy bills are calculated, saying they will save the average household around £150 a year, as well as freezing rail fares and fuel duty. The Bank also cuts its forecast for already-listless GDP growth from 1.1% to 0.9% this year and an increase in unemployment to 5.3%, potentially creating room for further cuts. For more information about how we use your data and your rights, you can visit our Privacy Centre. Despite this, a majority of members of the MPC decide to hold rates, citing the need to balance the risk of persistent underlying inflation, driven by rising wages, against the danger that increasing unemployment and subdued spending could drag inflation below the 2% target. \"The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening market remain,\" the committee said. Scepticism of government measures  The timing of further cuts will depend on the Bank's assessment of how sustainable the 2% inflation rate is in the medium term, with some members sceptical that the short-term-measures announced by Ms Reeves will offset underlying upward pressure on prices. The decision to hold rates came after Mr Bailey switched sides from the last meeting in December, joining Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine Mann and Huw Pill in favouring the status quo. In December, he voted with the four dovish members of the MPC, Sarah Breedon, Swati Dinghra, deputy-governor Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor, who favoured a cut."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, is not given to emotional outbursts or shooting from the hip. Being measured in your public comments is part of the job description for running a central bank, and Mr Bailey has stuck to it since succeeding Mark Carney in 2020. (To understand the constraints of the job, consider the transformation in the Canadian's public persona since he swapped Threadneedle Street for his country's premiership). Epstein files latest - Andrew's photo claims undermined So it felt significant that Mr Bailey should speak with controlled anger - emotion even - when asked by Sky News for his reaction to the revelation that Peter Mandelson was sharing market-sensitive information with Jeffrey Epstein while business secretary in 2008. \"I mean, I am shocked by what we're hearing. I am shocked by what we now learn about what went on during the financial crisis period.\" That context matters. \n                  Interest rate cuts 'likely' later this year - Bank of England\n                 \n                  Bank of England governor holds key to 'likely' rate cuts ahead\n                 \n                  Bank of England rate cut to 3.75% following fall in inflation\n                 Back in 2008, Mr Bailey was part of the bank's senior management battling, in harness with the Treasury and Downing Street, to prevent the financial system toppling over. There was the genuine prospect of cashpoints running dry and of governments being unable to sustain the borrowing required to bail them out. In the UK, ministers and officials pondered selling off state-owned assets worth £20bn to ease the burden, while in Europe, the EU was working on a €500m (£435m) rescue package. Mr Mandelson allegedly passed details of both to Epstein via email before they were made public, according to Epstein files revelations. Little wonder that Mr Bailey, a man with a front-row seat on the drama, sounded outraged. There was a personal edge to his comments, too. He sounded genuinely emotional when recalling the role of the late Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, working to shore up the economy, and now \"unable to speak for himself\" about the revelation that a close colleague was undermining him. The governor's reaction may also be explained by the fact he is one of the few people in the British institutional establishment with direct experience of challenging Epstein's circle on their links to the paedophile financier. Read more on Sky News:Epstein plan to invest in Fergie brandKing's silence 'will frustrate some'Epstein files: The key findings so far In 2019, as head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), he approved the investigation of Jes Staley, the American chief executive of Barclays, over his ties to Epstein. Following Epstein's arrest, the FCA suspected Mr Staley had not been honest about the extent of their relationship. Mr Staley was forced to resign in 2020, subsequently banned from holding senior executive position in financial services, and lost an appeal last year in which Andrew Bailey gave evidence. \"I don't want to sound pious, but this is for all of us - how is it that we live in a society that in which this happened and the cover-up happened as well?\" he asked. In the sorry story of Epstein's pollution of the British monarchy, politics and the City, he is in a very small club of people whose conduct is entirely vindicated."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics correspondent\n              @pkelso\n The Bank of England's decision to hold interest rates was short on action but strong on signals that a rate cut this spring is now more likely than not. While markets expected the nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave the base rate unchanged at 3.75%, the 5-4 vote in favour of the status quo was closer than anticipated, and the language about what happens next clear. Governor Andrew Bailey was unequivocal that further cuts are now \"likely\". Money latest: What interest rate hold means for your money Since the rate-cutting cycle began in August 2024, the Bank's message has been that borrowing costs would come down \"slowly and carefully\", but now it appears a question of when, not if. While this decision keeps a toe on the brake of monetary policy, it is plainly about to lift. The rapid fall in the Bank's forecast for inflation, from the current 3.4% to 2% by the spring, is a key factor. So too a still-sluggish economy, evident in a fall in the forecast for GDP to 0.9% this year, and an increase in its expectation for unemployment to 5.3%. \n                  Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey 'shocked' by Peter Mandelson's alleged leaks to Jeffrey Epstein\n                 \n                  Interest rate cuts 'likely' later this year - Bank of England\n                 \n                  Bank of England rate cut to 3.75% following fall in inflation\n                 While Rachel Reeves will enjoy the credit attributed to her budget in bringing down inflation, 0.5 percentage points courtesy of cuts to energy bills, rail fares and fuel duty but concerns over more persistent inflation remain. The Bank also remains concerned that weaker labour demand, fuelled in part by Reeves's increases to employer national insurance contributions and the minimum wage, is dragging down demand and household spending. With Mr Bailey casting the decisive vote for the second meeting running, and the two blocks of four MPC members on either side of the decision unchanged, the governor's view of the balance of those risks will be critical."

Sky News has learnt that Mr Healey met Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo's chief executive, on Thursday for talks about an ongoing tender process which could throw into doubt the future of the Yeovil plant.

Sidekick is aimed at consumers whose financial needs have outgrown the services offered by entry-level investing apps but whose wealth is less than that demanded by full-service private banks. The company's new funding round also includes participation from funders including Koro Capital, Seedcamp, MS&AD Ventures, TheVentureCity, PactVC, Blackwood, 1818 Venture Capital and Semantic Ventures.

        "Content": "Sir Keir Starmer has been made to look \"weak, naive and gullible\" by blaming Peter Mandelson's \"lies\" for the crisis engulfing his premiership - and it could bring him down, a senior Labour figure has said. The party's former deputy leader Baroness Harman told Sky's Electoral Dysfunction podcast the saga had become \"so serious\" for the prime minister, who will be toppled \"unless he takes action\". Sir Keir is under mounting pressure to shake up his Number 10 operation in light of the scandal. Some Labour MPs believe his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, must go. Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, Baroness Harman said he should be \"thinking about a real reset\" inside his team, and reflecting on why he appointed Lord Mandelson as the UK's US ambassador despite concerns about his record and ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Sir Keir used a speech in Hastings on Thursday to apologise to Epstein's victims for believing the peer's \"lies\" about his relationship with the paedophile financier. But Baroness Harman said: \"He's got to stop blaming Mandelson and saying, 'he lied to me'. Because, actually, he should never have been considering him in the first place. \"To say 'he lied to me' makes it look weak and naive and gullible. So it's just completely the wrong thing.\" \"Peter Mandelson was called the Prince of Darkness,\" she added. \"It's not a secret that he was a bad person. \"I think that it is very, very serious for Keir Starmer because it goes to the values of the government.\" Rigby has said the scandal has left the prime minister \"fighting for his political life\". 👉Tap here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Lord Mandelson had been a senior figure within New Labour under Tony Blair, but was forced to resign from two ministerial posts in scandal. He was hired by Sir Keir in early 2025 as the prime minister sought to develop positive relations with the Trump administration. He was sacked in September after he featured in a number of Epstein-related files and photos released by a US Congressional committee. The latest revelations were revealed among a tranche of three million documents released by the US Department of Justice last week. Documents relating to his appointment to the Washington job will be published by the government after MPs passed a Conservative motion on Wednesday night. But files deemed a risk to national security or international relations must first be reviewed by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, which has said there is \"no timetable\" for how long it might take. Their publication may be further delayed by a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson, over claims he leaked market sensitive information to Epstein. MPs express lack of confidence in PM In the meantime, Sir Keir has suggested top adviser Mr McSweeney is safe in his post - and that any Labour MPs contributing to speculation about his own leadership are only helping the party's opponents. Every minute not spent talking about the cost of living and fighting against the \"toxic division of Reform\" is a minute wasted, the prime minister said on Thursday. But many Labour MPs have privately expressed a lack of confidence in Sir Keir's team, and a handful, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Barry Gardiner, have publicly suggested he should consider his position. Veteran Labour backbencher Graham Stringer told Sky's chief political correspondent Jon Craig he does not think Sir Keir has \"a very long future\" as PM, calling the climbdown over the Lord Mandelson documents a \"fiasco too far\". \"You always blame the person at the top, the prime minister,\" Mr Stringer said. \"He got his tone wrong. He got the details wrong. And effectively the first amendment that he put down, which he had to change, was effectively - although not in name but in reality - a vote of no confidence in him. \"I don't think he's [Sir Keir] got a very long future. \"The discussion you could ask virtually any Labour MP is, it's when and who, not whether [the PM goes].\" Read more from Sky News:King heckled over Epstein scandalEmails reveal plan for Epstein to own stake in Sarah Ferguson brand The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have called for a vote of confidence in the prime minister. Speaking to Sky's political correspondent Rob Powell, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused the PM of a \"catastrophic error of judgement\" and said either Sir Keir or Mr McSweeney should take responsibility. Asked if that means that one of them should resign, Ms Badenoch replied: \"Yes\". Public in favour of change New data from pollster YouGov suggests the public are in favour of a change, with 50% of Britons believing the PM would be best standing down. Slightly less than a quarter - 24% - want him to remain in post, while 26% said they didn't know what he should do. YouGov's Peter English told Sky News the Lord Mandelson story had \"cut through\" to the public. It follows a YouGov poll earlier this week that found 95% of Brits were aware of the story, and that 44% of those surveyed were following it closely. Mr English said: \"This [the Mandelson story] is dominating the news cycle. People are paying attention. And the Mandelson thing specifically, it is definitely cutting through.\" However, Mr English added that the story is \"probably not going to change too many minds… one-off stories rarely do change minds\". Angela Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, and Health Secretary Wes Streeting are widely seen as the most likely candidates to replace Sir Keir. However, allies of both insist they have no intention of moving against the PM."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was hardly a ringing endorsement of the deal. But it could have been a lot worse. And after the week Sir Keir Starmer has just been through, Donald Trump's grudging support for the controversial Chagos deal will have come as a relief. The good news for the PM was the president signalling he won't now block the deal the Conservatives and Reform UK have claimed is a surrender. The bad news is that the president has warned that if anything goes wrong in future, the US won't hesitate to send in the gunships and take over the islands. So it's a rare piece of moderately good news for the PM amid a relentless onslaught from opponents and Labour MPs over his bungling of the Mandelson-Epstein scandal. The Chagos deal the prime minister had made, the president said on his Truth Social, was \"according to many, the best he could make\". According to many? Who does he mean? Obviously not former ambassador Mandelson. He's now a disgraced non-person and probably just a distant memory in Washington. \"Peter who?\" they'll no doubt be saying in the White House these days. \"We'll never forget old whatshisname.\" Quite the about-turn from Trump… The news from the White House is moderately good for Sir Keir because only a few weeks ago the president called his Chagos deal \"an act of great stupidity\" and \"total weakness\". That savage criticism emboldened Conservative and Reform UK MPs and Tory peers at Westminster to attempt to kill the Chagos legislation, which is currently holed below the waterline in the House of Lords. A few days after the president's \"stupidity\" claim, Kemi Badenoch taunted Sir Keir at PMQs: \"We didn't need President Trump to tell us that. We've been saying that for 12 months.\" Read more:What is the Chagos deal and why is it controversial?Chagos deal suffers humiliating defeat The president began his statement by claiming he'd had \"very productive discussions\" with Sir Keir. We know they had a phone call and discussed Diego Garcia on Tuesday. The prime minister was said to have offered him extra security guarantees and there was another phone call on Thursday before the president's Truth Social post. The Chagos deal proposes the UK transferring sovereignty of the islands whilst leasing back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia, for an initial 99 years. But the president's statement is by no means all good news for the prime minister. There was also a pretty intimidating warning that if anything goes wrong the Americans will flex their mighty military muscles. \"If the lease deal, some time in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,\" he said. This is, after all, a president who wants to seize Greenland for the US and even make Canada the 51st US state. Don't forget, he called Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \"Governor Carney\". The president concluded his Truth Social statement: \"Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense.\" That's a reference to the fact that Diego Garcia is a bird sanctuary for endangered species, including the splendidly named \"red-footed boobies\", as well as rare turtles and coral reefs. Tories vow to fight against deal But back at Westminster, the battle over Chagos is far from over. Dame Priti Patel MP, the shadow foreign secretary, reacted: \"Keir Starmer and Peter Mandelson's shameful Chagos surrender remains an absolutely terrible deal for Britain. \"The Conservative Party's view is unchanged. We have led the fight against this appalling surrender, and we will continue fighting it to the end.\" There's also the possibility - and risk for Sir Keir - that the president may change his mind on Chagos yet again. After all, he backed the deal at first, then changed his mind. So the PM might as well be grateful for now and hope for the best. After all, while the president's latest Chagos statement may not be brilliant news, it's the only bit of decent news Sir Keir has had in a dreadful week."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Northern towns could be in line for a funding boost after complaints from MPs that a new system for allocating cash to councils favours London. Ministers have been holding talks with northwest MPs about making tweaks to the fair funding formula - which some MPs claim left them \"absolutely shafted\". Politics Live: Trump says Starmer's Chagos Islands deal is the 'best he could make' The formula is aimed at giving areas with the highest need the most money from central government. Northern towns were initially expected to be the big winners. However ministers have used a measure of deprivation that heavily factors in housing costs, which northwest MPs say weights the formula in favour of London. \"It's completely skew-whiffed the figures …. we've been absolutely shafted\", one northern MP told Sky News. London and the southeast have the highest housing costs in the country and London councils had argued this should be factored into how the money is allocated. \n                  Starmer branded 'weak' over Mandelson saga - as top Labour figure warns it could bring him down\n                 \n                  Mandelson saga will bring PM down unless he takes 'necessary action', Harman warns\n                 \n                  Trump grudgingly supports Starmer's Chagos deal\n                 However, northern MPs argue deprivation in their areas is driven by other significant factors including low incomes and lack of opportunity. 👉Listen to Politics at Sam and Anne's on your podcast app👈 One MP said while they were sympathetic to London's housing crisis, London \"also has better state schools, transport links, job opportunities and cultural opportunities we just don't have\". Another said this wasn't about the north-south divide but about \"social justice\". They said poverty in their town had increased by \"horrendous\" levels, adding: \"It's there to be seen but it's being ignored. The formula is anything but fair.\" The provisional settlement announced in December means all authorities in the Liverpool City Region (LCR) are getting less than the national average, as well as nearby areas like Blackpool, Wigan and Warrington. These areas were expecting to be among the biggest winners, based on modelling from the summer seen by Sky News. However, the government said in November that it would update its measure of deprivation to better consider housing costs. The government has used the English Indices of Deprivation 2025, which they say offers an \"accurate and robust\" measure of relative deprivation. Analysis by SIGOMA, which represents areas outside London, found the change caused a shift towards the capital with outer London areas seeing the highest increases. Places like Newham and Brent are now getting millions more than expected while Blackpool and Knowsley are getting millions less. Reform UK threat The formula is the first overhaul of government finance in a decade and means money allocated across England will rise from £83.2bn in 2026/27 to £90.3bn in 2028/29, with most areas seeing an increase overall. Northern towns have generally fared better than rural areas and parts of inner London. However, MPs who spoke to Sky News said their areas need visible and significant investment if they are to fend off the challenge from Reform UK. One said while this deal is better than under the Conservatives, it \"barely touches the sides\" if they are to reverse a decade of cuts and stop the electorate \"rolling the dice\" on Nigel Farage's party. The provisional settlement still needs to be finalised, before being put to a vote in the House of Commons. Ministers will want to avoid even a small rebellion given the febrile mood within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) currently. Read More:Starmer's future uncertain after toughest day yetStarmer pledges extra £800m for deprived areas  Steve Reed, the cabinet minister for housing and communities, is said to have held \"constructive talks\" with those lobbying for change. Steve Rotheram, the Metro Mayor for the Liverpool region, is among the senior figures to have raised the issue. One suggestion is the government could increase the Recovery Grant, a £600m pot launched last year to give immediate financial support to councils hit hardest by a decade of funding cuts. The grant - based on the previous measure of deprivation - will continue to be allocated as part of the fair funding settlement and there have been calls for it to increase by £400m per year to offset perceived losses from the fair funding formula. The grant comes with a guarantee that upper-tier authorities in receipt of it will get a year-on-year increase across the multi-settlement period, starting with 5%. This guarantee could also increase. Those involved in the talks have been told to expect good news, multiple sources said, though nothing has been confirmed. A government spokesperson said: \"We are repairing local government after years of decline and will shortly set out our consultation response confirming the final Local Government Finance Settlement for 2026-27.\""

        "Content": "Restoring the crumbling Houses of Parliament could cost more than £39bn and take between 38 and 61 years to complete, parliamentarians have been told. It's one of two proposals being considered by MPs and peers, and would see work on the building, which mostly dates from the Victorian era, completed in stages. Under the second option presented by the restoration and renewal client board, both houses would leave the Palace of Westminster for between 19 and 24 years while works take place at a cost of up to £15.6bn. The client board, which is made up of members of the commissions of both Houses of Parliament, warned in a statement on Thursday that a decision on starting restoration work \"is needed now\". It said the site's fabric and services \"have deteriorated and require substantial repair or replacement\", adding: \"We are beyond the point where putting off these major works is sustainable.\" MPs and peers have also been asked to agree to initial restoration works at the Houses of Parliament lasting seven years, at a cost of up to £3bn. That work could start in 2026 if approved with a motion from both Houses. The board will then ask them to choose between the final two options by mid-2030. Repairing the inside of the Victoria Tower, building a jetty on the Thames for deliveries by river, and starting underground construction on tunnel shafts are all part of the first phase. If it's decided to move out fully, Commons business will start to be transferred to the so-called Northern Estate - outside the palace but close by - and the Lords to the nearby QEII conference centre from 2032. Current repair costs 'unsustainable' Repairs and maintenance of the Palace of Westminster currently runs at a cost of £1.5m a week, which is \"unsustainable\", according to the proposals. Heating in a large part of the House of Lords is set to fail and there are significant problems with the sewage system. Since 2016, there have been 36 fire incidents, 12 asbestos incidents and 19 stone-masonry incidents.

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n Anthropic, one of the biggest and most influential tech companies in the world, is launching a new model: Claude Opus 4.6. Until now, this would mostly be big news for techies, where Anthropic is admired as the maker of Claude Code, the code-writing AI tool which many engineers say is taking over their work entirely. All of a sudden, however, the impact of these tools is being felt more widely, after a seemingly small release from Anthropic shook some sections of the stock market. Earlier this week, Anthropic released a plug-in to their Claude chatbot, which added new tools for legal analysis. This relatively minor update sent shares of several large legal data firms tumbling. Thomson Reuters, which owns legal database Westlaw, fell nearly 16%. Analytics company RELX fell 12%. This may seem strange to outsiders because Anthropic is still relatively unknown outside the world of tech. A poll by US research firm Blue Rose Research at the end of last year found that it was known by less than 5% of the population. But analysts say that market participants, impressed by the advances in coding, are starting to wonder if the same gains can be made in other sectors. \"The market's in seek and destroy mode,\" says James Sym, partner at London-based equity firm Goodhart. \"It's just trying to find the next loser from AI. That's what you've seen in the last couple of days.\" Anthropic's latest release may add to this sense of urgency, because it is directly aimed at knowledge workers. As well as a number of improvements to coding - the ability to handle large codebases, for instance, and longer tasks - the new model is designed to deal with the kind of problems non-coders face in apps such as Excel and PowerPoint, where Claude will now be able to work directly. \"Users can build slides from a corporate template, restructure a storyline, convert bullets into diagrams, or generate a full deck from a description - all without leaving the app,\" the firm says, although users will have to pay for the privilege. It adds that this is \"our most capable model for all enterprise and knowledge work\". Anthropic says its new model outperforms its old model on a number of key benchmarks, pointing to an assessment by Norway's Sovereign Investment, which found that \"across 40 cybersecurity investigations, Claude Opus 4.6 produced the best results 38 of 40 times in blind ranking against Claude 4.5 models\". Read more from Sky News:Man who stabbed nine-year-old in the heart guilty of murderEven Starmer's allies are unsure about his future But the firm is playing down the impact of its knowledge work tools, directing people to statements made by legal software-makers who build specialist tools using Claude Code. \"There is an important difference between a plugin and operating a collaborative, matter-centric, production-grade platform used by hundreds of the world's leading legal teams,\" says Max Junestrand, CEO at Legora, an AI tool for lawyers. The market is not seeing things in such a nuanced way, says Sym of Goodhart, who suggests this could be the \"canary in the coal mine\" for the end of the exuberance around AI. \"If you think about how bubbles in history have evolved over time, they normally follow a bit of a pattern, and what happens is fewer and fewer companies seem to be the winners. That is what's obviously happened at the moment. \"This may well be just part of that normal pattern where you're seeing the market decide, actually, it is only going to be a very narrow set of people who win. And of course, the step after that is the whole bubble bursts. And that is what we could be looking at.\""

        "Content": "Autism rates are 'more or less equal for men and women', according to a study which challenges previous assumptions about its prevalence. While the neurological and developmental ⁠condition is known to be more common in young boys, Swedish researchers found there was a big rise in diagnoses among adolescent girls. And by the age of 20, the male-to-female ratio had evened out at nearly one-to-one, experts at the Karolinska Institutet reported. Researchers said the study, published in ​the BMJ, highlights a need to investigate why girls and women receive diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later than boys and men. Previous work on gender and autism suggested that for every four men or boys diagnosed with autism, there would be one woman or girl. A study in 2017 suggested this figure may be closer to three men to one woman. But in the latest research from Sweden, academics examined diagnosis rates of autism for all people born in the country between 1985 and 2000 - more than 2.7 million people - and tracked them until 2022. \n                  Autistic volunteer told he could no longer work for Waitrose hired by Asda\n                 \n                  Donald Trump's health claims 'really dangerous', autism community warns\n                 \n                  UK health officials push back on US president's claim paracetamol is linked to autism\n                 During this period, some 2.8% of people were diagnosed with ASD. They found that the male-to-female ratio of diagnosis decreased over time to the extent that it \"may no longer be distinguishable by adulthood\". The study did not account for genetics or environmental factors or for other conditions associated with autism, such as attention deficit hyperactivity ‌disorder and intellectual disability, which might have played a role in ⁠patients' diagnoses. Read more from Sky News:Regulator probes baby formula illnessYoung crime victims lose trust in systemAnalysis: Starmer's future uncertain Commenting on the study, Dr Rachel Moseley from Bournemouth University, said the findings provide \"important support ‍for what autism researchers have known for a long time\" about a substantial gap in diagnosing autism in females. She added that studies of children may miss autistic features which are already present in males but not yet visible in females. The high male-to-female ratio has also ​been attributed to better social and communication skills among girls, making autism more difficult to spot. Dr Judith Brown, from the National Autistic Society, said \"women and girls are more likely to 'mask' what is traditionally thought of as signs of autism, making it harder to identify the challenges they face\". She added that the results \"highlight the fact that gender should never be a barrier to receiving an autism diagnosis and access to the right support\"."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n       In filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, resistance is framed as survival. While there's no direct reference to ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), authority is shown as unpredictable, militarised and with the power to destabilise entire neighbourhoods. Since the film came out at the end of last September, those aspects have come to feel incredibly timely. \"Devastatingly so,\" according to its producer, Sara Murphy, after the killing by federal agents in Minneapolis of protesters Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. \"I don't think we could have anticipated just how close to home it would be,\" Murphy says, \"as a sort of reflection of the situation around race and immigration in the US.\" \"It's hitting an audience in their core,\" Murphy adds. \"I think is reflective of the world that we're living in today, but I think, hopefully, it is also an optimistic take on how we can continue to fight for the things that are important to us and find peace in community. \"I hope the takeaway is one of optimism.\" As well as being nominated for 13 Oscars, Anderson's film is the one to beat at the BAFTAs. It leads the field with 14 nominations, including best director for Thomas Anderson and best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. While the original book the film is based on, Vineland, referenced the Nixon era, Thomas Anderson's film remains ambiguous but certainly feels contemporary. It follows a fractured group of activists as they navigate an America shaped by surveillance and escalating state power, culminating in DiCaprio's character's race to find his missing daughter. 'An unpredictable ride' Speaking after the BAFTA nominations were announced, Murphy explains: \"We've been really overwhelmed, honoured and obviously proud of the film and how it's been received by audiences and critics. \"The script is a loose adaptation of the book, there are the revolutionary aspects....and then I think Paul as an artist has absorbed and observed the world that we're living in...it's become closer to home and to our current realities.\" Murphy says she hopes the film's success encourages more studios to invest in \"risky\" projects like it. \"Original films are not usually done at this level…I think it feels like a big, good-time movie,\" she says. \"I hope that, first and foremost, people are enjoying themselves, it's an unpredictable ride full of incredible performances.\" Read more from Sky News:Sledgehammer-wielding robbers raid family jewellersEven Starmer's allies are unsure about his future Could this be the year Thomas Anderson finally wins an Academy Award for his direction? The filmmaker has been both Oscar and BAFTA-nominated before but never won. While There Will Be Blood (2007), Phantom Thread (2017) and Licorice Pizza (2021) certainly generated a lot of awards buzz, this year he appears to be the frontrunner. As Murphy puts it: \"Paul is an incredible writer and director. I feel like his films are constantly challenging and surprising. I'm excited for him and all the awards the recognition. He deserves it all.\""
