        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n  Sir Keir Starmer continues to face the threat of a major rebellion during a key vote on welfare reforms later - despite making last-minute concessions to disgruntled Labour MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has confirmed that all existing claimants of the personal independence payment (PIP), the main disability benefit, will be protected from changes to eligibility. The combined value of the standard Universal Credit allowance and the health top-up will rise \"at least in line with inflation\" every year of this parliament. And an additional £300m for employment support for sick and disabled people in 2026 has been announced, which will rise every year after.  Ms Kendall has also promised that a consultation into PIP - \"co-produced\" with disabled people - will be published next autumn. She said the U-turn on welfare cuts will cost taxpayers about £2.5bn by 2030 - less than half the £4.8bn the government had expected to save with its initial proposals. Modelling by Ms Kendall's own department, released yesterday, suggested the proposals would push 150,000 more people into poverty by 2030, down from the 250,000 estimated under the original plan. \n                  'The government have thrown disabled people under the bus'\n                 \n                  Government accused of 'stark' contradiction over position on Gaza genocide allegations\n                 \n                  Dozens of MPs call on Starmer to 'urgently' establish Ukraine-style visa for Gazans\n                 But after announcing the U-turns, Labour MPs were still publicly saying they could not back the plans as they do not go far enough to allay their concerns.

Read more: What are the concessions to the welfare reform bill?  A total of 86 charities united yesterday to call on MPs to reject the reforms, saying they will harm disabled people and calling it \"a political choice\". The likes of Oxfam, Child Action Poverty Group, Mind and Shelter said the bill has been brought to a vote without consulting disabled people and without any assessment \"of its impact on health and employment outcomes\". When asked to name \"a single\" disability organisation in favour of the reforms, Ms Kendall declined to do so. Several Labour MPs indicated they would still vote against the changes, leaving the government in the dark over how big a rebellion it still may face. Ms Kendall tried to allay their fears, telling MPs: \"I believe we have a fair package, a package that protects existing claimants because they've come to rely on that support.\" Richard Burgon presented a petition to parliament yesterday evening against the cuts, signed by more than 77,000 people. Several Labour MPs questioned why the vote was going ahead before the review into PIP is published - including Rachael Maskell, who said she could not \"countenance sick and disabled people being denied support\" and added: \"It is a matter of conscience.\" Connor Naismith said the concessions \"undoubtedly improve efforts to secure welfare reform which is fair\", but added: \"Unfortunately, I do not believe these concessions yet go far enough.\" Nadia Whittome accused the government of \"ignoring\" disabled people and urged ministers to go \"back to the drawing board\". Ian Byrne told the Commons he will vote against the \"cruel cuts\" to disability benefits because the \"so-called concessions go nowhere near far enough\". The vote will take place this evening, with coverage on Sky News' Politics Hub live blog and on TV."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  Queen Elizabeth II's favourite form of transport, the royal train, has reached the end of the line and is set to be decommissioned. At a briefing revealing the annual financial report for the Royal Family, and confirming details of a huge £91m cash injection for royal funding, it was announced that the King will be bidding the \"fondest of farewells\" to the royal train. James Chalmers, Keeper of the Privy Purse, described the move as an example of the royal household applying \"fiscal discipline\" in its drive to deliver \"value for money\". The annual accounts showed the Sovereign Grant, which supports the official duties of the Royal Family, remained at £86.3m, while royal travel increased by £500,000 to £4.7m and payroll costs were up £2m to £29.9m. Mr Chalmers said: \"The royal train, of course, has been part of national life for many decades, loved and cared for by all those involved. \"But in moving forward, we must not be bound by the past. Just as so many parts of the royal household's work have been modernised and adapted to reflect the world of today, so too, the time has come to bid the fondest of farewells, as we seek to be disciplined and forward in our allocation of funding. \"With His Majesty's support, it has therefore been decided that the process to decommission the royal train will commence next year.\" Read more:Royal accounts reveal details of William's duchySee images of planned Queen Elizabeth II memorial The King and other members of the Royal Family will rely on two new helicopters when the nine-carriage train stops running ahead of a maintenance contract ending in early 2027, according to the annual royal accounts. It was decided the future running costs were too high, but it's hoped the train will make further visits to parts of the UK, before a long-term home is found for the carriages to potentially go on display. The King is said to have fond memories of the train, which features a carriage created for Charles in the mid-1980s, which he still uses now he is King, and the Prince of Wales is aware and supports the decommissioning decision. The current royal train came into service for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee in 1977.  One of two locomotives pulls this train, the 67006 \"Royal Sovereign\" or the 67005 \"Queen's Messenger\". These locomotives use eco-conscious biofuel made from vegetable oil waste. When the King travelled from London to Cwmbran in Wales in 2017 it cost £130.84 per mile. A standard rail ticket would have cost £1.30 per mile. The train is stationed and maintained in a secure compound at the northwest corner of the Wolverton Railway Works. Network Rail owns the royal train, and DB Cargo UK maintains and operates it. The train's carriages include the King's saloon - comprising a sitting room, bedroom, and bathroom - as well as the Royal Family's 12-seater dining car and kitchen. In 1842, Queen Victoria became the first British monarch to travel by train and commissioned a collection of private carriages for the royal train 27 years later. The queen decorated the carriages in 23-carat gold and blue silk. They were in service until the early 1900s but are now on display at the National Railway Museum in York.\n Royal travel has always taken place in secret and not even train staff know which royals are onboard. However, extra precautions were taken to keep royal train travel secret during the world wars.\n During the First World War, King George V travelled the country via the royal train so much, it became his temporary home. Total cost of official royal travel revealed The rundown of royal finances - from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 - covers the months following the King and the Princess of Wales's double cancer diagnosis. Eye-catching figures released include a £400,500 bill to fly the King and Queen and their staff to Australia and Samoa last October. The total cost of official royal travel was £4.7m - a rise of £500,000 from the previous year. A huge uplift in the sovereign grant, which funds the public work of the Royal Family, was also confirmed for the next two years, going up from £86.3m to £132m. It comes as wind farm deals on Crown Estate land helped boost profits to £1.1bn. It means an extra £91.4m of income from 2025-26 and 2026-27, but palace representatives stressed this will go towards finishing refurbishment work at Buckingham Palace and other heritage building projects. Campaign group calls for proper scrutiny of royal finances Graham Smith, from the anti-monarchy group Republic, told Sky News: \"The whole process of reporting the finances of the royal household needs to be taken out of the hands of the royal household. \"It should be dealt with by the Treasury and it should be reported by the government to parliament where it can be properly scrutinised. \"For example, the detail of their travel cost are not broken down and in parliament people can ask serious questions about why they're spending so much money on themselves\". Republic has released its own report where it suggests the full annual cost of the monarchy is well over half a billion pounds when factors such as security and unpaid taxes are taken into consideration."

        "Content": "More than 140 people are killed or seriously injured in tailgating incidents in England each year, according to research. Tailgating is when a driver does not leave the proper space between themselves and the vehicle in front of them if it were to suddenly break. It is a factor in at least one in eight collisions on England's motorways and major A-roads, according to National Highways. The agency has launched a campaign aimed at tackling the dangerous behaviour. It highlighted that while 43% of drivers admit to tailgating, 60% say they are anxious when it is done to them.  The discomfort and anxiety caused by tailgating were also reflected in other common, everyday scenarios - with more than half of respondents saying they felt uncomfortable with people walking behind them on the street or on public transport, or standing directly behind them in a lift. Sheena Hague, director of road safety at National Highways, said keeping a small distance could save lives. \"Tailgating isn't just irritating; it's intimidating and dangerous,\" she said. \"Most people wouldn't dream of standing right behind someone in a queue or walking on their heels down the street, yet this is exactly what we see on our roads.\" Read more from Sky News:Stab victim describes horrible reality of knife crimeRoyal train to be scrapped with family to rely on helicopters  National Highways says motorists should keep a two-second gap between their car and the vehicle in front of them on dry roads, and four seconds in wet weather. Drivers caught tailgating in England face a £100 fine and three penalty points. In the event of a serious collision, they face more serious punishments, such as a driving ban or imprisonment. Shaun Helmen, chief scientist at the Transport Research Laboratory, said rethinking tailgating as an invasion of personal space might help shift \"deeply ingrained driving habits\". \"By tapping into the universal discomfort many of us feel around an invasion of our personal space, we're not just advising drivers what to do,\" he said. \"We're giving them a relatable life experience to help understand the impact of their actions and encouraging a lasting shift towards more mindful and safer driving behaviours.\""

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  A 92-year-old man has been found guilty of raping and murdering a woman born 133 years ago - in what's thought to be the UK's longest cold case to reach trial. Ryland Headley was convicted at Bristol Crown Court of killing 75-year-old mother of two, Louisa Dunne, at her home back in June 1967. Latest DNA technology - as well as matching palm prints taken at the scene more than 57 years ago - led a jury to find Headley guilty on both charges. Detective Inspector Dave Marchant from Avon and Somerset Police said forces across the country are investigating whether Headley could be linked to other unsolved crimes. \"This investigation was a blend of new and old forensic techniques - DNA being the latest and greatest…but we were able to utilise that original investigative material,\" he said. On the morning of 28 June 1967, neighbours noticed that Louisa Dunne, born in 1892, wasn't standing on her doorstep as usual. They found her lying dead inside her home in the Easton area of Bristol - bruised, blood coming from one ear, vomit in her mouth and her underwear around her ankles. The police investigation at the time found traces of semen on intimate swabs and on the skirt she was wearing, but it was around 20 years before DNA testing. A palm print was also found on one of the rear windows inside the house. \"The original investigation was, by all accounts, massive,\" DI Marchant told Sky News. \"Over 19,000 palm print eliminations were taken from men and boys in the Bristol area and beyond. Over 8,000 house-to-house records were completed and several thousand statements were taken,\" he added. But Headley - in his 30s at the time - lived just outside the ring of houses where palm prints were taken. A post-mortem examination found she had \"extensive abrasions\" on her face and that the most likely explanation was that a hand had been pressed against her mouth. Around 20 crates of evidence were stored in Avon and Somerset Police HQ for nearly six decades alongside other cold cases. The case was reviewed in 2024, with new DNA testing on the sperm found on the skirt Ms Dunne had been wearing. Investigating officers were told the results showed a DNA match on the national database that was \"a billion times\" more likely to belong to Headley than anyone else. \"I had to read that email several times to fully digest the content of it and believe what I was reading. Then it was, okay, game on, let's get this investigation going,\" said DI Marchant. Headley was arrested at his home in Ipswich in November 2024 - he did not give evidence during the trial. The jury heard that forensic experts had matched Headley's palm print, taken on arrest, to that of the one found on Ms Dunne's window at the time. The judge allowed the prosecution to raise the fact that Headley had already spent time in jail for committing two other rapes, around a decade after Ms Dunne's murder. Both those cases involved attacks against elderly women in similar circumstances. Prosecutor Anna Vigars KC told the jury these offences demonstrate to all of us that Headley \"has a tendency\" to act in exactly the same way that we say that he did back in 1967. \"In other words, to break into people's homes at night and, in some cases, to target an elderly woman living alone, to have sex with her despite her attempts to fend him off, and to threaten violence,\" she said. Speaking before the verdict, Louisa Dunne's granddaughter recalled the moment police told her of progress in the cold case, nearly six decades on: \"She said, 'this is about your grandmother', and I said, 'have they caught him?' It came out, I never thought I'd say anything like that. Have you caught him? and she said, 'we have a suspect'.\" She described the impact of the attack on her grandmother and that a conviction would bring relief: \"I accepted it. I accepted that some murders just never get solved. And some people just have to live with that emptiness and that sadness. \"I think it's appalling, absolutely appalling. The poor woman - it must have been absolutely terrifying. And the reality of a rape, I don't like thinking about, I don't think anybody does,\" she added. Read more from Sky News:Weight loss jabs linked to potentially fatal side effectReform would win most seats in general election, poll suggests The Crown Prosecution Service told Sky News that it was not aware of a cold case with a longer period between the offence and trial. DI Marchant told Sky News it demonstrates the value of reviewing such cases: \"I think this investigation shows you should never give up. \"You should never look at an investigation and say, 'oh, it's too old, it happened X number of years ago' and have an arbitrary cut off point. At the time we re-instigated it in 2024… there was a chance a suspect could still be alive and as it turned out - he was.\""

Several Labour MPs questioned why the vote was going ahead before the review into PIP is published - including Rachael Maskell, who said she could not \"countenance sick and disabled people being denied support\" and added: \"It is a matter of conscience.\" Connor Naismith said the concessions \"undoubtedly improve efforts to secure welfare reform which is fair\", but added: \"Unfortunately, I do not believe these concessions yet go far enough.\" Nadia Whittome accused the government of \"ignoring\" disabled people and urged ministers to go \"back to the drawing board\". Ian Byrne told the Commons he will vote against the \"cruel cuts\" to disability benefits because the \"so-called concessions go nowhere near far enough\". The vote will take place this evening, with coverage on Sky News' Politics Hub live blog and on TV."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  Queen Elizabeth II's favourite form of transport, the royal train, has reached the end of the line and is set to be decommissioned. At a briefing revealing the annual financial report for the Royal Family, and confirming details of a huge £91m cash injection for royal funding, it was announced that the King will be bidding the \"fondest of farewells\" to the royal train. James Chalmers, Keeper of the Privy Purse, described the move as an example of the royal household applying \"fiscal discipline\" in its drive to deliver \"value for money\". The annual accounts showed the Sovereign Grant, which supports the official duties of the Royal Family, remained at £86.3m, while royal travel increased by £500,000 to £4.7m and payroll costs were up £2m to £29.9m. Mr Chalmers said: \"The royal train, of course, has been part of national life for many decades, loved and cared for by all those involved. \"But in moving forward, we must not be bound by the past. Just as so many parts of the royal household's work have been modernised and adapted to reflect the world of today, so too, the time has come to bid the fondest of farewells, as we seek to be disciplined and forward in our allocation of funding. \"With His Majesty's support, it has therefore been decided that the process to decommission the royal train will commence next year.\" Read more:Royal accounts reveal details of William's duchySee images of planned Queen Elizabeth II memorial The King and other members of the Royal Family will rely on two new helicopters when the nine-carriage train stops running ahead of a maintenance contract ending in early 2027, according to the annual royal accounts. It was decided the future running costs were too high, but it's hoped the train will make further visits to parts of the UK, before a long-term home is found for the carriages to potentially go on display. The King is said to have fond memories of the train, which features a carriage created for Charles in the mid-1980s, which he still uses now he is King, and the Prince of Wales is aware and supports the decommissioning decision. The current royal train came into service for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee in 1977.  One of two locomotives pulls this train, the 67006 \"Royal Sovereign\" or the 67005 \"Queen's Messenger\". These locomotives use eco-conscious biofuel made from vegetable oil waste. When the King travelled from London to Cwmbran in Wales in 2017 it cost £130.84 per mile. A standard rail ticket would have cost £1.30 per mile. The train is stationed and maintained in a secure compound at the northwest corner of the Wolverton Railway Works. Network Rail owns the royal train, and DB Cargo UK maintains and operates it. The train's carriages include the King's saloon - comprising a sitting room, bedroom, and bathroom - as well as the Royal Family's 12-seater dining car and kitchen. In 1842, Queen Victoria became the first British monarch to travel by train and commissioned a collection of private carriages for the royal train 27 years later. The queen decorated the carriages in 23-carat gold and blue silk. They were in service until the early 1900s but are now on display at the National Railway Museum in York.\n Royal travel has always taken place in secret and not even train staff know which royals are onboard. However, extra precautions were taken to keep royal train travel secret during the world wars.\n During the First World War, King George V travelled the country via the royal train so much, it became his temporary home. Total cost of official royal travel revealed The rundown of royal finances - from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 - covers the months following the King and the Princess of Wales's double cancer diagnosis. Eye-catching figures released include a £400,500 bill to fly the King and Queen and their staff to Australia and Samoa last October. The total cost of official royal travel was £4.7m - a rise of £500,000 from the previous year. A huge uplift in the sovereign grant, which funds the public work of the Royal Family, was also confirmed for the next two years, going up from £86.3m to £132m. It comes as wind farm deals on Crown Estate land helped boost profits to £1.1bn. It means an extra £91.4m of income from 2025-26 and 2026-27, but palace representatives stressed this will go towards finishing refurbishment work at Buckingham Palace and other heritage building projects. Campaign group calls for proper scrutiny of royal finances Graham Smith, from the anti-monarchy group Republic, told Sky News: \"The whole process of reporting the finances of the royal household needs to be taken out of the hands of the royal household. \"It should be dealt with by the Treasury and it should be reported by the government to parliament where it can be properly scrutinised. \"For example, the detail of their travel cost are not broken down and in parliament people can ask serious questions about why they're spending so much money on themselves\". Republic has released its own report where it suggests the full annual cost of the monarchy is well over half a billion pounds when factors such as security and unpaid taxes are taken into consideration."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n Prince William's Duchy of Cornwall will allow certain charities to use its buildings rent-free after facing criticism over multimillion-pound deals the landed estate struck with public bodies. William's duchy, which provides him with a private income of nearly £23m a year, has launched a review which means that grassroots groups - such as an orchard used for therapeutic gardening - that are direct tenants will now have their rents waived, while local charities will see up to a 50% reduction in rent. While the amount William receives from the duchy was also revealed at a briefing about the duchy annual \"impact report\", it again failed to say how much tax he pays. His private secretary Ian Patrick only confirming that \"the Prince of Wales pays the highest rate of income tax\".   Talking about the rent change, Will Bax, the duchy's new secretary and keeper of records said: \"It would be remiss not to address the media scrutiny the duchy has experienced this past year. \"We've used these challenges as an opportunity to stop and reflect, both the duke and I are clear that we want the duchy to be world class in our approach to supporting people, communities and nature to flourish and to realise that aim, we must operate and communicate in a modern, socially-minded way.\" He added: \"It's clear we've entered an era of deep change, but we change, not because we disrespect our past, but precisely because we do respect it.\" The change follows an investigation last November into the prince's duchy and the Duchy of Lancaster estate, which provides a private income for the King, by Channel 4's Dispatches and The Sunday Times, which found the estates had secured rental agreements worth millions of pounds with the armed forces, the NHS and state schools. Mr Bax said the duchy was also looking at including schools in the community groups that would be eligible for the rent waiver. The investigation last year revealed the duchy was set to earn around £600,000 over the lifetime of six different leases agreed with local state schools. The policy review will, however, not alter commercial relationships with public bodies such as the ministries of defence and justice.

For example, our Management Act requires that, public sector procurement rules require that.\" William is the 25th Duke of Cornwall, after becoming entitled to the duchy's profits when he became heir to the throne. Accounts released on Monday showed the duchy generated profits of £22.9m, down £700,000 from £23.6m the previous financial year (2023-24). The money is used to fund the charitable, private and official lives of William, the Princess of Wales and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. It was revealed that last year the prince and princess personally donated to a number of charities and voluntary groups including organisations set up by the parents of the girls murdered in Southport last summer and funding a new car for a Norfolk charity that transports blood. Prince William's private secretary also said the royal closely follows the ongoing humanitarian situation in the Middle East and has made donations to organisations working there. Their charity donations are subtracted before tax. The King, as the previous Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall, disclosed the voluntary tax he paid in his annual Clarence House review - £5.892m in 2021-22."

        "Content": "More than 140 people are killed or seriously injured in tailgating incidents in England each year, according to research. Tailgating is when a driver does not leave the proper space between themselves and the vehicle in front of them if it were to suddenly break. It is a factor in at least one in eight collisions on England's motorways and major A-roads, according to National Highways. The agency has launched a campaign aimed at tackling the dangerous behaviour. It highlighted that while 43% of drivers admit to tailgating, 60% say they are anxious when it is done to them.  The discomfort and anxiety caused by tailgating were also reflected in other common, everyday scenarios - with more than half of respondents saying they felt uncomfortable with people walking behind them on the street or on public transport, or standing directly behind them in a lift. Sheena Hague, director of road safety at National Highways, said keeping a small distance could save lives. \"Tailgating isn't just irritating; it's intimidating and dangerous,\" she said. \"Most people wouldn't dream of standing right behind someone in a queue or walking on their heels down the street, yet this is exactly what we see on our roads.\" Read more from Sky News:Stab victim describes horrible reality of knife crimeRoyal train to be scrapped with family to rely on helicopters  National Highways says motorists should keep a two-second gap between their car and the vehicle in front of them on dry roads, and four seconds in wet weather. Drivers caught tailgating in England face a £100 fine and three penalty points. In the event of a serious collision, they face more serious punishments, such as a driving ban or imprisonment. Shaun Helmen, chief scientist at the Transport Research Laboratory, said rethinking tailgating as an invasion of personal space might help shift \"deeply ingrained driving habits\". \"By tapping into the universal discomfort many of us feel around an invasion of our personal space, we're not just advising drivers what to do,\" he said. \"We're giving them a relatable life experience to help understand the impact of their actions and encouraging a lasting shift towards more mindful and safer driving behaviours.\""

        "Content": "\n          West of England and Wales correspondent\n              @danwnews\n  A 92-year-old man has been found guilty of raping and murdering a woman born 133 years ago - in what's thought to be the UK's longest cold case to reach trial. Ryland Headley was convicted at Bristol Crown Court of killing 75-year-old mother of two, Louisa Dunne, at her home back in June 1967. Latest DNA technology - as well as matching palm prints taken at the scene more than 57 years ago - led a jury to find Headley guilty on both charges. Detective Inspector Dave Marchant from Avon and Somerset Police said forces across the country are investigating whether Headley could be linked to other unsolved crimes. \"This investigation was a blend of new and old forensic techniques - DNA being the latest and greatest…but we were able to utilise that original investigative material,\" he said. On the morning of 28 June 1967, neighbours noticed that Louisa Dunne, born in 1892, wasn't standing on her doorstep as usual. They found her lying dead inside her home in the Easton area of Bristol - bruised, blood coming from one ear, vomit in her mouth and her underwear around her ankles. The police investigation at the time found traces of semen on intimate swabs and on the skirt she was wearing, but it was around 20 years before DNA testing. A palm print was also found on one of the rear windows inside the house. \"The original investigation was, by all accounts, massive,\" DI Marchant told Sky News. \"Over 19,000 palm print eliminations were taken from men and boys in the Bristol area and beyond. Over 8,000 house-to-house records were completed and several thousand statements were taken,\" he added. But Headley - in his 30s at the time - lived just outside the ring of houses where palm prints were taken. A post-mortem examination found she had \"extensive abrasions\" on her face and that the most likely explanation was that a hand had been pressed against her mouth. Around 20 crates of evidence were stored in Avon and Somerset Police HQ for nearly six decades alongside other cold cases. The case was reviewed in 2024, with new DNA testing on the sperm found on the skirt Ms Dunne had been wearing. Investigating officers were told the results showed a DNA match on the national database that was \"a billion times\" more likely to belong to Headley than anyone else. \"I had to read that email several times to fully digest the content of it and believe what I was reading. Then it was, okay, game on, let's get this investigation going,\" said DI Marchant. Headley was arrested at his home in Ipswich in November 2024 - he did not give evidence during the trial. The jury heard that forensic experts had matched Headley's palm print, taken on arrest, to that of the one found on Ms Dunne's window at the time. The judge allowed the prosecution to raise the fact that Headley had already spent time in jail for committing two other rapes, around a decade after Ms Dunne's murder. Both those cases involved attacks against elderly women in similar circumstances. Prosecutor Anna Vigars KC told the jury these offences demonstrate to all of us that Headley \"has a tendency\" to act in exactly the same way that we say that he did back in 1967. \"In other words, to break into people's homes at night and, in some cases, to target an elderly woman living alone, to have sex with her despite her attempts to fend him off, and to threaten violence,\" she said. Speaking before the verdict, Louisa Dunne's granddaughter recalled the moment police told her of progress in the cold case, nearly six decades on: \"She said, 'this is about your grandmother', and I said, 'have they caught him?' It came out, I never thought I'd say anything like that. Have you caught him? and she said, 'we have a suspect'.\" She described the impact of the attack on her grandmother and that a conviction would bring relief: \"I accepted it. I accepted that some murders just never get solved. And some people just have to live with that emptiness and that sadness. \"I think it's appalling, absolutely appalling. The poor woman - it must have been absolutely terrifying. And the reality of a rape, I don't like thinking about, I don't think anybody does,\" she added. Read more from Sky News:Weight loss jabs linked to potentially fatal side effectReform would win most seats in general election, poll suggests The Crown Prosecution Service told Sky News that it was not aware of a cold case with a longer period between the offence and trial. DI Marchant told Sky News it demonstrates the value of reviewing such cases: \"I think this investigation shows you should never give up. \"You should never look at an investigation and say, 'oh, it's too old, it happened X number of years ago' and have an arbitrary cut off point. At the time we re-instigated it in 2024… there was a chance a suspect could still be alive and as it turned out - he was.\""

Eyewitnesses described the horror of what happened. \"Forget red lines. We're past that. Nothing left to say. Looked around all I see is blood. Men, martyrs, limbs. \"Unbelievable. People come here to take a break from what they see inside Gaza. They come westward to breathe.\" Among the dead were Frans Al-Salmi, a prominent Palestinian artist, and Ismael Abu Khatab, a well-known photojournalist. Graphic images from the scene show chaos and carnage. Images captured moments after the explosion show journalist Bayan Abu Sultan covered in blood and visibly dazed.

In the last 24 hours, Israel has intensified its bombardment, launching some of the heaviest raids seen in recent weeks. The strikes coincide with new evacuation orders issued for areas in northern Gaza, triggering yet another wave of mass displacement among an already devastated civilian population. Each day in Gaza brings new funerals and new grief. Civilians - exhausted, hungry, and increasingly desperate - have little choice but to endure. Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, there is talk of a potential breakthrough. A proposed 60-day truce, tied to a staged hostage exchange, remains on the table. Yet significant differences remain. Hamas wants a permanent end to the war, while the Israeli government insists on retaining the right to resume military operations once any temporary ceasefire expires. These fundamental disagreements have repeatedly derailed negotiations in the past - and could do so again. For the people trapped in Gaza, the renewed diplomatic efforts feel distant, abstract - as if unfolding on another planet."

        "Content": "Almost 60 people have been killed in new Israeli strikes in Gaza, Hamas-run health authorities have said, as residents reported heavy bombardments. The Israeli military issued evacuation orders on Monday to people in large areas of the north, leading to further displacement. Israeli officials are due in Washington for a new attempt at a ceasefire promoted by the Trump administration. Salah, a 60-year-old father-of-five from Gaza City, said: \"In the news we hear a ceasefire is near, on the ground we see death and we hear explosions,\" Reuters reported him as saying. \"Explosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes.\" Health authorities said 10 people were killed in Zeitoun and at least 13 were killed southwest of Gaza City. Medics said most of those 13 were hit by gunfire, but residents reported an airstrike, too. They also said 20 people, including women, children and a local journalist were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a beachfront cafe in Gaza City. The IDF ordered people to head south, saying it planned to fight Hamas militants operating in northern Gaza, including in the heart of Gaza City. Donald Trump has urged Israel and Hamas to agree a ceasefire - as the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza reached 56,500, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. \"MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!,\" he wrote on social media on Sunday. The US president had raised expectations of a possible agreement this week, but some Palestinians were doubtful of the latest efforts to end the 20-month war that has laid waste to most of Gaza. \"Since the beginning of the war, they have been promising us something like this: release the hostages and we will stop the war,\" said one Palestinian, Abdel Hadi al Hour. \"They did not stop the war.\" An eight-week ceasefire was reached in the final days of Joe Biden's US presidency, but Israel resumed the war in March after trying to get Hamas to accept new terms on next steps. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks in Gaza also continued on Sunday. At least 15 people were killed when an IDF airstrike hit a house sheltering displaced people in the Jabaliya al Nazla area, according to an official in Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. He said women and children made up more than half the dead.

Talks between Israel and Hamas have stalled over whether or not the war should end as part of any ceasefire. Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Mr Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. Omer Dostri, a spokesperson for Mr Netanyahu, said that \"Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war\", without addressing Mr Merdawi's claim.

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  Most of Europe is right now baking in a so-called \"heat dome\" - conditions a bit like a pizza oven, which are scorching Spain, France, Italy, Greece and beyond. Meanwhile, temperatures in the UK peaked at 33.1C at Heathrow on Monday - with hot conditions also expected on Tuesday. So, what's going on with our weather? Follow latest: Amber heat health alert extended to more areas  What is a heat dome? A heat dome forms when an area of high pressure lingers over a region for days or weeks. This pressure traps hot air - like the dome of a pizza oven or a lid on a saucepan - and bakes the air and land beneath. As the ground parches, it absorbs heat - making conditions hotter still. The dome of high pressure also blocks out clouds and cooler air, resulting in clear skies and persistent heat. Find out the latest forecast for your area What effect is the heat dome having on the UK - and how long could it last? The current heat dome is hovering across most of Europe, while the UK sits just on the cusp of it. That means the same high pressure bringing plus 40C (104F) temperatures to southern Europe is also roasting southern and eastern England on Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures had been expected to hit 34C (93.2F) in London and the South East on Monday. They peaked at 33.1C at Heathrow. But, these regions are due to sweat through a \"tropical night\" on Monday evening - when temperatures do not drop below 20C (68F), making it much harder to sleep. Northern and western Britain sit outside the area of high pressure, hence conditions there are cooler and wetter. The heat will be pushed away to the South East on Tuesday night, as a cold front moves through southeastern England. Cooler air has already started to move into the North West, bringing rain, and that will move across all of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland overnight, mostly clearing into northern England later. Tuesday will be hot and humid in the South again, but it will be cooler elsewhere. Wednesday will bring nearer average temperatures, although still higher in the South East. Are heat domes becoming more common? The (scientific) jury is still out, says climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, from the University of St Andrews. \"Some research suggests heat domes will become more common as climate warms, with more frequent heatwaves as a result\" but there is no scientific consensus yet, he says. \"But what is crystal clear is that climate change is loading the dice such that when a heat dome does occur, it brings hotter and more dangerous temperatures,\" he adds.  The 'game-changer' While heat domes are nothing new, their more intense impacts are. Europe is already more than 2C warmer than in pre-industrial times, and the fastest warming continent in the world, making every heatwave and heat dome hotter than they would have been. That's because greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels are trapping more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, raising the average temperatures. Read more:'Tropical nights' soar in European holiday hotspots'Most effective' protection to avoid sunburn (and it isn't suncream)Tips to stay cool in the heat Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science from Imperial College London, says: \"Countless studies have shown that climate change is an absolute game-changer when it comes to heat in Europe, making heatwaves much more frequent, especially the hottest ones - and more intense.\" Prof James Dyke, an expert in climate science from Exeter University, adds: \"The only way to avoid even more extreme heat is to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\" But we must also adapt to the hotter world, experts say, which means making sure people and buildings can keep cool to avoid the dangerous side effects. Baroness Brown, from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), told Sky News in April: \"It still seems to feel like it's tomorrow's problem… and if we don't tackle it today, it becomes tomorrow's disaster.\"  The 'silent killer' and the side effects Scientists call heatwaves the \"silent killer\" because they drive significant excess deaths, particularly in those who are already vulnerable. They are also dangerous for small children - whose small bodies heat up faster - and pregnant women, and risk premature births. The side effects hit not just our health but land and buildings too. Heat fuels the conditions for wildfires, and can cause crops, railways, and power lines to fail. Dr Madeleine Thomson, from the Wellcome Trust, which supports health research, says we need a longer-term approach to coping with longer and hotter heat. \"The strategy of reacting to each crisis is failing, and the science tells us it will get worse,\" she says. \"We need to shift to proactive, rapid and coordinated action to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \"The tools exist. The evidence is clear. What's missing is the urgency. We must act and we must act now.\""

        "Content": "New images have been released of the wreckage of a superyacht which sank off the coast of Italy in a storm - leaving its British billionaire owner and his daughter dead.  Mike Lynch, 59, and daughter Hannah, 18, were among seven people who were killed when the Bayesian sank off Sicily on 19 August 2024. The billionaire's body was recovered on 22 August while Hannah - whose body was the last to be found in the search mission - was pulled from the water the next day.    The recovery of the vessel has now concluded after the 56m (184ft) hull and 72m (236ft) mast, as well as deck furniture and other loose items, had been delivered to Italian authorities in Termini Imerese in Palermo, Sicily. One photograph shows boats towing the large white mast through the water as it was lifted near the surface by balloons. Other images feature crews working on the mast and hull on the quayside, with both appearing to be covered in a brown substance. Marcus Cave, a director of British firm TMC Marine, which carried out the salvage effort, said: \"The delivery of the hull, mast and other potential materials from Bayesian brought this project to its conclusion. \"We thank the salvage and other teams that were involved in this challenging project, together with the Italian authorities for their professional assistance throughout.\" The hull was recovered on 21 June and transported around 12 miles (19km) to Termini Imerese the next day by one of the most powerful floating sea cranes in Europe. On 23 June, it was lifted into heavy steel supports on the quayside, which had tarpaulin underneath to prevent pollution. The cradle was custom-designed to fit the shape of the hull and built in the Netherlands. Read more:Mike Lynch died from drowning, inquest hearsWho was on the superyacht?Diver dies during work to recover yacht The mast had been detached from the hull for the recovery and was on the seabed. It was salvaged using inflatable lifting balloons and delivered to port on 25 June, along with loose items that may have moved away from the vessel in past 10 months. The images have emerged a day after photos showed the inside of the yacht for the first time after the vessel resurfaced. In one picture, a lounge area can be seen, complete with sofas and other furniture, while another shows the hatch down to the lower deck. Remote-controlled submersible equipment was used to locate the debris in the vicinity of the Bayesian site. The vessel was originally expected to be raised last month but salvage efforts were delayed after a diver died during underwater work on 9 May, prompting greater use of remote-controlled equipment. The materials have been delivered to the Italian authorities and salvage personnel and equipment have subsequently left Sicily. About 70 specialist personnel had been mobilised to Porticello from across Europe to work on the recovery operation. Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch, who founded software giant Autonomy in 1996, and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals. Fifteen people, including Mr Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued. Mr Lynch and his daughter are said to have lived in the vicinity of London and the Bloomers lived in Sevenoaks, Kent."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n The government has won a long-running legal challenge about its decision to continue allowing the sale of spare parts for F-35 fighter jets to Israel, while suspending other arms licences over concerns about international humanitarian law in Gaza. But a key part of its case has highlighted mixed messaging about its position on the risk of genocide in Gaza - and intensified calls for ministers to publish their own assessment on the issue. PM braced for pivotal vote - politics latest Lawyers acting for the government told judges \"the evidence available does not support a finding of genocide\" and \"the government assessment was that…there was no serious risk of genocide occurring\". Therefore, they argued, continuing to supply the F-35 components did not put the UK at risk of breaching the Genocide Convention. This assessment has never been published or justified by ministers in parliament, despite numerous questions on the issue. Some MPs argue its very existence contrasts with the position repeatedly expressed by ministers in parliament - that the UK is unable to give a view on allegations of genocide in Gaza, because the question is one for the international courts. For example, just last week Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told PMQs \"it is a long-standing principle that genocide is determined by competent international courts and not by governments\".  'The UK cannot sit on our hands' Green MP Ellie Chowns said: \"The government insists only an international court can judge whether genocide is occurring in Gaza, yet have somehow also concluded there is 'no serious risk of genocide' in Gaza - and despite my urging, refuse to publish the risk assessments which lead to this decision. \"Full transparency on these risk assessments should not be optional; it is essential for holding the government to account and stopping further atrocity. \"While Labour tie themselves in knots contradicting each other, families are starving, hospitals lie in ruins, and children are dying. \"The UK cannot sit on our hands waiting for an international court verdict when our legal duty under the Genocide Convention compels us to prevent genocide from occurring, not merely seek justice after the fact.\" 'Why are these assessments being made?' \"This contradiction at the heart of the government's position is stark,\" said Zarah Sultana MP, an outspoken critic of Labour's approach to the conflict in Gaza, who now sits as an independent after losing the party whip last summer. \"Ministers say it's not for them to determine genocide, that only international courts can do so. Yet internal 'genocide assessments' have clearly been made and used to justify continuing arms exports to Israel. \"If they have no view, why are these assessments being made? And if they do, why refuse to share them with parliament? This Labour government, in opposition, demanded the Tories publish their assessments. Now in office, they've refused to do the same.\" Read more:'All I see is blood''It felt like earthquakes'MPs want Ukraine-style scheme for Gazans  Judges at the High Court ultimately ruled the case was over such a \"sensitive and political issue\" it should be a matter for the government, \"which is democratically accountable to parliament and ultimately to the electorate, not the court\". Dearbhla Minogue, a senior lawyer at the Global Legal Action Network, and a solicitor for Al-Haq, the Palestinian human rights group which brought the case, said: \"This should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the government, but rather a restrained approach to the separation of powers. \"The government's disgraceful assessment that there is no risk of genocide has therefore evaded scrutiny in the courts, and as far as we know it still stands.\" What is the government's position? Government lawyers argued the decision not to ban the export of F-35 parts was due to advice from Defence Secretary John Healey, who said a suspension would impact the whole F-35 programme and have a \"profound impact on international peace and security\". The UK supplies F-35 component parts as a member of an international defence programme which produces and maintains the fighter jets. As a customer of that programme, Israel can order from the pool of spare parts. 'This washing of hands will no longer work' Labour MP Richard Burgon said the ruling puts the government under pressure to clarify its position. \"This court ruling is very clear: only the government and parliament can decide if F-35 fighter jet parts - that can end up in Israel - should be sold,\" he said. \"So the government can no longer pass the buck: it can stop these exports, or it can be complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. \"On many issues they say it's not for the government to decide, but it's one for the international courts. This washing of hands will no longer work.\"  Israel has consistently rejected any allegations of genocide. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded a recent UN report on the issue biased and antisemitic. \"Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Hamas terrorist organisation… the United Nations once again chooses to attack the state of Israel with false accusations,\" he said in a statement.  The UK government has not responded to requests for comment over its contrasting messaging to parliament and the courts over allegations of genocide. But in response to the judgement, a spokesperson said: \"The court has upheld this government's thorough and lawful decision-making on this matter. \"This shows that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. We will continue to keep our defence export licensing under careful and continual review. \"On day one of this Government, the foreign secretary ordered a review into Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL). \"The review concluded that there was a clear risk that UK exports for the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Gaza conflict might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of IHL. \"In contrast to the last government, we took decisive action, stopping exports to the Israeli Defence Forces that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.\""

These firefighters did not have a chance.\" Officers said they were \"taking sniper fire\" near the city of Coeur d'Alene on Sunday afternoon, with crews responding to a fire at Canfield Mountain. Mr Norris said the gunman had used high-powered sporting rifles to fire rapidly at first responders. The ambush continued for several hours. More than 300 officers from city, county, state and federal levels responded. Two helicopters were deployed with snipers onboard. First responders could be heard making urgent calls for help on their radios. \"Everybody's shot up here... send law enforcement now,\" one dispatch said. Later, the sheriff's office said members of a SWAT team \"located a deceased male on Canfield Mountain\", adding that a \"firearm was found nearby\"."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Ministers are exploring ways to hand state support to Britain's remaining oil refineries as they scramble to deal with the fallout from the collapse of the Prax Lindsey site in Lincolnshire which has cast a shadow over hundreds of jobs. Sky News understands that Ed Miliband, the energy security secretary, wants to devise a mechanism for refineries to become eligible for the Energy-Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme - from which they are currently excluded. Energy costs were at the heart of the government's industrial strategy launched last week. Money latest: Is it worth getting a fixed energy deal? Such a move would hand a welcome financial boost to the sector by assisting them with energy costs amid a slew of challenges which culminated in the appointment of compulsory liquidators over the Prax Lindsey refinery on Monday. The site's insolvency - revealed by Sky News - has drawn strong criticism from the government, with energy minister Michael Shanks calling the development \"deeply concerning\". \"There have been longstanding issues with this company and workers have been badly let down,\" he said. \n                  Trump takes aim at Fed chair Jerome Powell again and says he 'should be ashamed'\n                 \n                  Concessions to welfare reforms to be revealed after Labour backbench rebellion forces government retreat\n                 \n                  Money blog: Time running out to submit meter reading before new energy price cap comes into force\n                 \"The secretary of state is today writing to the Insolvency Service to demand an immediate investigation into the conduct of the directors, and the circumstances surrounding this insolvency. \"The government will ensure supplies are maintained, protect our energy security, and do everything we can to support workers and the local community, including engaging with trade unions and industry bodies. \"The company has left the government with very little time to act.\" Prax Group is owned by Sanjeev Kumar Soosaipillai, who also acts as its chairman and chief executive and is the sole director of the refining subsidiary. The crisis at the Lindsey refinery, which is located on a 500-acre site five miles from the Humber Estuary, echoes that at Britain's dwindling number of oil refineries. According to the company, the site has an annual production capacity of 5.4 million tonnes, processing more than 20 different types of crude including petrol, diesel, bitumen, fuel oil and aviation fuels. The refinery, which was bought from France's Total in 2020, is understood to have become a growing drain on cash across the wider Prax Group, with which it has cross-guarantees. About 180 people work at State Oil Ltd, Prax Group's parent entity, while roughly 440 more are employed at the Prax Lindsey Refinery.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has confirmed that all existing claimants of the personal independence payment (PIP), the main disability benefit, will be protected from changes to eligibility. The combined value of the standard Universal Credit allowance and the health top-up will rise \"at least in line with inflation\" every year of this parliament. And an additional £300m for employment support for sick and disabled people in 2026 has been announced, which will rise every year after.  Ms Kendall has also promised that a consultation into PIP - \"co-produced\" with disabled people - will be published next autumn. She said the U-turn on welfare cuts will cost taxpayers about £2.5bn by 2030 - less than half the £4.8bn the government had expected to save with its initial proposals. Modelling by Ms Kendall's own department, released yesterday, suggested the proposals would push 150,000 more people into poverty by 2030, down from the 250,000 estimated under the original plan. \n                  'The government have thrown disabled people under the bus'\n                 \n                  Government accused of 'stark' contradiction over position on Gaza genocide allegations\n                 \n                  Dozens of MPs call on Starmer to 'urgently' establish Ukraine-style visa for Gazans\n                 But after announcing the U-turns, Labour MPs were still publicly saying they could not back the plans as they do not go far enough to allay their concerns. Disabilities minister Stephen Timms would not say he was \"confident\" the proposals would pass the Commons when asked on Sky News' Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge. \"We've got a very strong package, I certainly hope it passes,\" he replied. Read more: What are the concessions to the welfare reform bill?  A total of 86 charities united yesterday to call on MPs to reject the reforms, saying they will harm disabled people and calling it \"a political choice\". The likes of Oxfam, Child Action Poverty Group, Mind and Shelter said the bill has been brought to a vote without consulting disabled people and without any assessment \"of its impact on health and employment outcomes\". When asked to name \"a single\" disability organisation in favour of the reforms, Ms Kendall declined to do so. Several Labour MPs indicated they would still vote against the changes, leaving the government in the dark over how big a rebellion it still may face. Ms Kendall tried to allay their fears, telling MPs: \"I believe we have a fair package, a package that protects existing claimants because they've come to rely on that support.\" Richard Burgon presented a petition to parliament yesterday evening against the cuts, signed by more than 77,000 people. Several Labour MPs questioned why the vote was going ahead before the review into PIP is published - including Rachael Maskell, who said she could not \"countenance sick and disabled people being denied support\" and added: \"It is a matter of conscience.\" Connor Naismith said the concessions \"undoubtedly improve efforts to secure welfare reform which is fair\", but added: \"Unfortunately, I do not believe these concessions yet go far enough.\" Nadia Whittome accused the government of \"ignoring\" disabled people and urged ministers to go \"back to the drawing board\". Ian Byrne told the Commons he will vote against the \"cruel cuts\" to disability benefits because the \"so-called concessions go nowhere near far enough\". The vote will take place this evening, with coverage on Sky News' Politics Hub live blog and on TV."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @amandaakass\n The government has won a long-running legal challenge about its decision to continue allowing the sale of spare parts for F-35 fighter jets to Israel, while suspending other arms licences over concerns about international humanitarian law in Gaza. But a key part of its case has highlighted mixed messaging about its position on the risk of genocide in Gaza - and intensified calls for ministers to publish their own assessment on the issue. PM braced for pivotal vote - politics latest Lawyers acting for the government told judges \"the evidence available does not support a finding of genocide\" and \"the government assessment was that…there was no serious risk of genocide occurring\". Therefore, they argued, continuing to supply the F-35 components did not put the UK at risk of breaching the Genocide Convention. This assessment has never been published or justified by ministers in parliament, despite numerous questions on the issue. Some MPs argue its very existence contrasts with the position repeatedly expressed by ministers in parliament - that the UK is unable to give a view on allegations of genocide in Gaza, because the question is one for the international courts. For example, just last week Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told PMQs \"it is a long-standing principle that genocide is determined by competent international courts and not by governments\".  'The UK cannot sit on our hands' Green MP Ellie Chowns said: \"The government insists only an international court can judge whether genocide is occurring in Gaza, yet have somehow also concluded there is 'no serious risk of genocide' in Gaza - and despite my urging, refuse to publish the risk assessments which lead to this decision. \"Full transparency on these risk assessments should not be optional; it is essential for holding the government to account and stopping further atrocity. \"While Labour tie themselves in knots contradicting each other, families are starving, hospitals lie in ruins, and children are dying. \"The UK cannot sit on our hands waiting for an international court verdict when our legal duty under the Genocide Convention compels us to prevent genocide from occurring, not merely seek justice after the fact.\" 'Why are these assessments being made?' \"This contradiction at the heart of the government's position is stark,\" said Zarah Sultana MP, an outspoken critic of Labour's approach to the conflict in Gaza, who now sits as an independent after losing the party whip last summer. \"Ministers say it's not for them to determine genocide, that only international courts can do so. Yet internal 'genocide assessments' have clearly been made and used to justify continuing arms exports to Israel. \"If they have no view, why are these assessments being made? And if they do, why refuse to share them with parliament? This Labour government, in opposition, demanded the Tories publish their assessments. Now in office, they've refused to do the same.\" Read more:'All I see is blood''It felt like earthquakes'MPs want Ukraine-style scheme for Gazans  Judges at the High Court ultimately ruled the case was over such a \"sensitive and political issue\" it should be a matter for the government, \"which is democratically accountable to parliament and ultimately to the electorate, not the court\". Dearbhla Minogue, a senior lawyer at the Global Legal Action Network, and a solicitor for Al-Haq, the Palestinian human rights group which brought the case, said: \"This should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the government, but rather a restrained approach to the separation of powers. \"The government's disgraceful assessment that there is no risk of genocide has therefore evaded scrutiny in the courts, and as far as we know it still stands.\" What is the government's position? Government lawyers argued the decision not to ban the export of F-35 parts was due to advice from Defence Secretary John Healey, who said a suspension would impact the whole F-35 programme and have a \"profound impact on international peace and security\". The UK supplies F-35 component parts as a member of an international defence programme which produces and maintains the fighter jets. As a customer of that programme, Israel can order from the pool of spare parts. 'This washing of hands will no longer work' Labour MP Richard Burgon said the ruling puts the government under pressure to clarify its position. \"This court ruling is very clear: only the government and parliament can decide if F-35 fighter jet parts - that can end up in Israel - should be sold,\" he said. \"So the government can no longer pass the buck: it can stop these exports, or it can be complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. \"On many issues they say it's not for the government to decide, but it's one for the international courts. This washing of hands will no longer work.\"  Israel has consistently rejected any allegations of genocide. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded a recent UN report on the issue biased and antisemitic. \"Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Hamas terrorist organisation… the United Nations once again chooses to attack the state of Israel with false accusations,\" he said in a statement.  The UK government has not responded to requests for comment over its contrasting messaging to parliament and the courts over allegations of genocide. But in response to the judgement, a spokesperson said: \"The court has upheld this government's thorough and lawful decision-making on this matter. \"This shows that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. We will continue to keep our defence export licensing under careful and continual review. \"On day one of this Government, the foreign secretary ordered a review into Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL). \"The review concluded that there was a clear risk that UK exports for the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Gaza conflict might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of IHL. \"In contrast to the last government, we took decisive action, stopping exports to the Israeli Defence Forces that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @alixculbertson\n Dozens of MPs have called on Sir Keir Starmer to \"urgently\" establish a Ukraine-style visa to allow Gazans with family in the UK to come to Britain. In a letter seen exclusively by Sky News, the 67 MPs and Lords from across the political spectrum, have asked the prime minister and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to create a \"Gaza Family Scheme\" to \"reunite [Palestinians] with their loved ones in the UK until it is safe to return\". \"Just as the UK opened its doors to those fleeing persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong, we believe that the same generosity should be extended to Palestinian families,\" the letter says. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the UK opened up the Ukraine Family Scheme allowing Ukrainian nationals to join family members in the UK and live, work and study in the UK for up to three years. Applications closed in February 2024. Two years before, the UK opened the British National (Overseas) visa to allow Hong Kongers fleeing after a strict national security law was imposed by China to live in the UK for five years then apply for British citizenship. The letter, sent to the PM on Sunday evening, has been signed by 35 Labour MPs and House of Lords members, including Marsha de Cordova, Clive Lewis, Stella Creasy, Richard Burgon, Kim Johnson, Afzal Khan, Rachael Maskell, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Andy Slaughter and Alex Sobel. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell are among a handful of former Labour MPs suspended from the party last year to sign the letter, as are all four Green MPs, Lib Dem MPs Tim Farron and Layla Moran, several Northern Ireland MPs and SNP MPs Graham Leadbitter and Brendan O'Hara. \n                  Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Donald Trump next week amid calls for Gaza ceasefire\n                 \n                  'All I see is blood': Horror as Gaza cafe popular with students hit by airstrike\n                 \n                  Almost 60 people killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, Hamas-run health authorities say - as Trump calls for ceasefire deal\n                 The Bishop of Chelmsford, Dr Guli Francis-Dehquani, has also signed the letter. Only one Conservative, former special adviser to William Hague, Baroness Helic, signed it. In the letter, the politicians express their \"grave concern at the immense suffering inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza\". They accuse Israel of \"shattering the temporary ceasefire agreement\", weaponising starvation, and intensifying its \"campaign of bombardment and military assaults, and targeting of people accessing humanitarian aid\". Read more:At least 72 killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza, health staff sayBritish-Israeli soldier killed while fighting in Gaza - reports Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who helped organise the letter with the Gaza Families Reunited campaign, told Sky News: \"The Ukrainian Family Visa Scheme was the right response to a brutal war. \"Establishing a Gaza Family Visa Scheme would be an extension of those same principles, showing that this government is steadfast in its commitment to helping families experiencing the worst horrors of war. \"It is time for the government to act now to help British Palestinians get their loved ones to safety, enabling them to rebuild their lives.\" The MPs also say in the letter that since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage, at least 53,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and \"the real death toll is likely to be exponentially higher\". They say a Gaza Family Scheme would allow Palestinians in Gaza to reunite with their families - \"people they may never see again unless urgent action is taken\". The MPs say many Gazans who have attempted to come to the UK have \"struggled to navigate the immigration system\", especially as they are required to provide biometrics to apply for a visa but that is \"impossible due to the destruction of the visa application centre in Gaza and blockade of the Rafah crossing\". They say there are a lack of safe zones or ways out of Gaza and some have constituents with family members who have fled Gaza to Egypt but \"are stuck in limbo, with no access to schools or healthcare to begin the process of rebuilding their lives\".  The letter adds that it would be a \"vital step\" towards addressing the UK government's \"historical, present, and ongoing responsibility towards Palestinians in Gaza\" and the UK has a \"duty to take all necessary steps to hold Israel to account for its crimes\". Ghassan Ghaben, spokesperson for Gaza Families Reunited, said \"family unity is an undeniable human right\" and said Labour in opposition urged the Conservative government to do more to help British Palestinians get their relatives to safety. \"We are still waiting for the new government to do the right thing,\" he said. \"We, as Palestinians in the UK, simply want the opportunity to bring our loved ones from Gaza to safety, until it is safe to return. \"The UK welcomed those fleeing war and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong with open arms. All we are asking for is the same treatment to be extended to our family members who have experienced unimaginable trauma as a result of Israel's genocide in Gaza.\" He added there is \"only a small number of Palestinians in the UK\", and an even smaller number with family members in Gaza. A government spokesperson said: \"The death and destruction in Gaza is intolerable. \"Since day one, we have been clear that we need to see an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages cruelly detained by Hamas, better protection of civilians, significantly more aid consistently entering Gaza, and a path to long-term peace and stability. \"There are a range of routes available for Palestinians who wish to join family members in the UK.\""

        "Content": " An extra 150,000 people will still be pushed into poverty despite the government making significant concessions on its plans to cut welfare, according to its own analysis. The government document, published today, reflects its decision to water down some of the more severe changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and the health top-up for universal credit. Politics latest: Palestine Action appealing against proscription It states that an estimated 150,000 people will now be pushed into poverty after housing costs if the new welfare cuts come into effect - down from 250,000 under the government's original plans. Under the original reforms, the eligibility criteria for PIP would have been tightened for both new and existing claimants. Ministers also intended to freeze the health top-up of Universal Credit at £97 a week during this parliament. However, in the face of a large rebellion by Labour MPs, the government changed the proposals for PIP to apply to new claimants only from November 2026. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall also announced on Monday the combined value of Universal Credit will be in line with inflation, which she said will ensure no existing claimants will be pushed into poverty as a result. There will also be an additional £300m for employment support for sick and disabled people this year and £600m next year, to increase total spending to £2.8bn this year. A consultation into PIP will take place and will be \"co-produced\" with disabled people to be published in autumn 2026, Ms Kendall said.  All current recipients of the health element of Universal Credit will also now have their incomes protected in real terms, as will any new applicants who meet the \"severe conditions criteria\". Ms Kendall said changes to the government's welfare reforms will cost \"around £2.5 billion in 2029/30\". The government will hope that the changes will be enough to persuade Labour MPs to vote for the new package of reforms when they are put to a vote on Tuesday. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch confirmed her MPs will vote against the reforms on Tuesday. The new assessment also states the impact on the number of pensioners and children in poverty is \"expected to be negligible\" after the original analysis said 50,000 children would be in relative poverty by the end of the decade. The new modelling does not take account of extra money the government is putting in to support people with disabilities and long-term health conditions into work. Before the government announced its changes, 127 Labour MPs signalled publicly that they would be willing to vote down the welfare bill in its entirety by signing an amendment that would have stopped its progress through parliament. It has been reported that the number of Labour rebels now stands at around 50 following the concessions.  Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, indicated she would still vote against the bill despite the concessions. In a post on X, she said: \"Even with the concessions, the government's own analysis forecasts that 150,000 people could still be pushed into poverty by disability benefit cuts by the end of the decade. \"As Labour MPs, we didn't enter politics to make struggling constituents poorer. We must stop this bill.\" Read more:What are the concessions to the welfare bill - and will MPs back it?PM and ministers now admit welfare reforms went too far Downing Street said the updated modelling on the impact of the government's welfare cuts \"doesn't reflect the full picture\". A spokesperson said there was still \"uncertainty\" around the projections because they don't take into account other government action, including NHS investment and employment support. \"All our support directly helps people moving to work and becoming financially independent,\" they added."

        "Content": "By Mickey Carroll, science and tech reporter, and Megan Harwood-Baynes, health reporter  Heatwaves and hot days may often be described as \"good weather\", but heat can have a dangerous effect on the human body.  From heat exhaustion to heat stroke, dehydration to water toxicity, it can be a minefield trying to stay cool - so the tech world is coming up with its own solutions to overheating. Getting sweaty - and measuring it Our bodies strive to keep the same core temperature, usually around 37C, but this can vary from person to person. When it is warm outside, our blood vessels open up to try and lose heat to our surroundings. The hypothalamus in the brain also tells sweat glands to start working, and as sweat evaporates from our skin, it carries away heat and lowers our body temperature. Read the latest on the heatwave here \n                  'My lungs felt like they were filled with blood': Stab victim reveals reality of knife crime\n                 \n                  PM faces threat of major rebellion during key vote today\n                 \n                  Criminal investigation launched into Glastonbury performances of Kneecap and Bob Vylan\n                 Measuring that sweat through wearable tech like patches can offer important clues to knowing when our bodies are overheating. Epicore, a US biotech company, has now developed a patch that measures how much sweat you are producing and the amount of different chemicals, like electrolytes, it contains. Sweat can \"indicate the health status of the body at the molecular level\" and, because it is so easy to access, it is \"ideal for continuous monitoring\", according to a 2023 study in Nature. If the sweat patch, which also measures the body's core temperature and movement, senses you are approaching dangerous levels of overheating, it sends alerts to your phone. They are often used interchangeably by members of the public, but heat exhaustion and heatstroke are two distinct conditions, although both start in the same way. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include tiredness, dizziness, headaches, vomiting, excessive sweating, muscle cramps, and a high body temperature, among others. Heat exhaustion does not usually need emergency medical help if you can cool down within 30 minutes. But when it turns to heatstroke, it becomes dangerous. If someone is still unwell after 30 minutes of resting in a cool place, being cooled and drinking fluids, they may have heatstroke.  A very high temperature, hot skin that is not sweating, a fast heartbeat and seizures are all signs it is time to call 999. Chloe Brimicombe, from the Royal Meteorological Society, told Sky News the most effective way to cool down is full-body immersion in lukewarm water. “Ice water can cause the opposite body response of old shock,” she said. “Lukewarm showers are also effective.” Staying hydrated - but not too hydrated While it may seem the obvious response, drinking too much water during a heatwave can be harmful. \"If you drink in excess, you wash important minerals out of your body,\" Dr Brimicombe said. When you drink too much, your kidneys can't get rid of the excess and the sodium content of your blood becomes diluted - this is called hyponatremia, and it can be life-threatening. For some people though, just getting enough water is difficult. People with dementia \"may forget to drink enough fluids and wear suitable clothing\" during the heatwave, according to Angelo Makri, senior knowledge officer for wellbeing at the Alzheimer's Society. There are a number of smart cups and bottles being released onto the market that monitor how much water you are drinking throughout the day. There has not been much academic research into how effective smart bottles are but one study commissioned by the National Kidney Foundation did find that in people with kidney stones, those using the tech were likely to drink more - and forgot to drink less often. A cooling, personal breeze The UK's buildings are not well-designed when it comes to heat, according to Professor Prashant Kumar from the University of Surrey. Poor ventilation means it can be hard to circulate air throughout our buildings, and the lack of greenery in our towns and cities can make the heat feel more unbearable. But while there are long-term solutions like better city planning or retrofitted buildings, it may be more efficient to simply cool the air around you, instead of trying to cool the whole room. In Japan, inventor Ichigaya Hiroshi has been trying to keep workers cool by using their clothes since the 1990s. Rather than cooling down whole rooms or buildings, he told Japan's government PR office that he wanted to \"cool the air around each person\" as it would take much less energy. He experimented with jackets laced with water pipes but found they leaked on people, and moved on to stitching miniature fans into the backs of workers' clothing. Now, air-conditioned clothes are all the rage in the country, according to Vogue, and even hit the high-fashion catwalks of Paris Fashion Week last October. Read more:This is what happens to your skin when it burnsHow sunscreen actually worksThe best use for your freezer in the heatwave But if a ballooning, air-filled jacket won't cut it at your office, more discreet options have also been invented. Fans that hang around your neck and blast cool air onto your face are a common sight on public transport in the UK during the summer, and Sony has now taken it a step further. The Japanese tech giant has developed the Reon cooling system; a metal plate that sits between your shoulder blades and cools your core. It is marketed towards office workers who can wear the system underneath shirts and blouses, although it is still visible at the top of the collar. A small clip-tag sits on the outside of the shirt to measure the air temperature, and the device automatically adjusts how hot or cold it is, depending on your environment. All this tech may help keep you cool but, as Professor Kumar pointed out, at the moment, the UK is only hot for a few weeks a year (although global warming indicates that may increase).  Research released last week showed the UK had bought 7.1 million mini-fans in the last year, but at the same time binned, or didn't use, 3.4 million of them. So as temperatures rise, it remains unclear whether the development of smart tech means it has now reached the point where it is likely to become a widespread tool in the ongoing battle to keep cool - or if a lukewarm shower will continue to suffice for most of us."

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n  Most of Europe is right now baking in a so-called \"heat dome\" - conditions a bit like a pizza oven, which are scorching Spain, France, Italy, Greece and beyond. Meanwhile, temperatures in the UK peaked at 33.1C at Heathrow on Monday - with hot conditions also expected on Tuesday. So, what's going on with our weather? Follow latest: Amber heat health alert extended to more areas  What is a heat dome? A heat dome forms when an area of high pressure lingers over a region for days or weeks. This pressure traps hot air - like the dome of a pizza oven or a lid on a saucepan - and bakes the air and land beneath. As the ground parches, it absorbs heat - making conditions hotter still. The dome of high pressure also blocks out clouds and cooler air, resulting in clear skies and persistent heat. Find out the latest forecast for your area What effect is the heat dome having on the UK - and how long could it last? The current heat dome is hovering across most of Europe, while the UK sits just on the cusp of it. That means the same high pressure bringing plus 40C (104F) temperatures to southern Europe is also roasting southern and eastern England on Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures had been expected to hit 34C (93.2F) in London and the South East on Monday. They peaked at 33.1C at Heathrow. But, these regions are due to sweat through a \"tropical night\" on Monday evening - when temperatures do not drop below 20C (68F), making it much harder to sleep. Northern and western Britain sit outside the area of high pressure, hence conditions there are cooler and wetter. The heat will be pushed away to the South East on Tuesday night, as a cold front moves through southeastern England. Cooler air has already started to move into the North West, bringing rain, and that will move across all of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland overnight, mostly clearing into northern England later. Tuesday will be hot and humid in the South again, but it will be cooler elsewhere. Wednesday will bring nearer average temperatures, although still higher in the South East. Are heat domes becoming more common? The (scientific) jury is still out, says climate scientist Dr Michael Byrne, from the University of St Andrews. \"Some research suggests heat domes will become more common as climate warms, with more frequent heatwaves as a result\" but there is no scientific consensus yet, he says. \"But what is crystal clear is that climate change is loading the dice such that when a heat dome does occur, it brings hotter and more dangerous temperatures,\" he adds.  The 'game-changer' While heat domes are nothing new, their more intense impacts are. Europe is already more than 2C warmer than in pre-industrial times, and the fastest warming continent in the world, making every heatwave and heat dome hotter than they would have been. That's because greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels are trapping more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, raising the average temperatures. Read more:'Tropical nights' soar in European holiday hotspots'Most effective' protection to avoid sunburn (and it isn't suncream)Tips to stay cool in the heat Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science from Imperial College London, says: \"Countless studies have shown that climate change is an absolute game-changer when it comes to heat in Europe, making heatwaves much more frequent, especially the hottest ones - and more intense.\" Prof James Dyke, an expert in climate science from Exeter University, adds: \"The only way to avoid even more extreme heat is to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.\" But we must also adapt to the hotter world, experts say, which means making sure people and buildings can keep cool to avoid the dangerous side effects. Baroness Brown, from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), told Sky News in April: \"It still seems to feel like it's tomorrow's problem… and if we don't tackle it today, it becomes tomorrow's disaster.\"  The 'silent killer' and the side effects Scientists call heatwaves the \"silent killer\" because they drive significant excess deaths, particularly in those who are already vulnerable. They are also dangerous for small children - whose small bodies heat up faster - and pregnant women, and risk premature births. The side effects hit not just our health but land and buildings too. Heat fuels the conditions for wildfires, and can cause crops, railways, and power lines to fail. Dr Madeleine Thomson, from the Wellcome Trust, which supports health research, says we need a longer-term approach to coping with longer and hotter heat. \"The strategy of reacting to each crisis is failing, and the science tells us it will get worse,\" she says. \"We need to shift to proactive, rapid and coordinated action to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \"The tools exist. The evidence is clear. What's missing is the urgency. We must act and we must act now.\""

PCOS is the most common hormonal condition in women of reproductive age and yet, despite being a leading cause of infertility, very little is known about what causes it or how to treat it. It can cause irregular or missed periods, excessive hair growth, weight gain and put women at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems and endometrial cancer. Aixia Liu at Zhejiang University in China and her colleagues monitored 220 women across 44 cities in China, half of whom had PCOS. All were under the age of 35 and provided samples of blood, stool and inner lining of their uterus. Both those with PCOS and those without experienced similar pregnancy rates, yet the group with PCOS were twice as likely to experience complications, including miscarriage, preterm birth and gestational diabetes. The research also found those with PCOS had around half the amount of a gut bacteria called Parabacteroides Merdae. P Merdae helps convert a nutrient present in the gut called isoleucine into a healthy substance called short-chain fatty acids, which are good for reproductive health. Those with PCOS, had too much isoleucine in their blood and uterus because they had less of the gut bacteria to change into the helpful short-chain fatty acids. \n                  From Brazil to Westminster: How health pilot is proving a force for good for patients and the NHS\n                 \n                  Supermarkets being told to cut shoppers' calories in obesity crackdown is not 'nanny statism', says Streeting\n                 \n                  Sunburn isn't just red skin - here's what's happening underneath the burn\n                 Read more:'I'm 31 and single with endometriosis, am I leaving it too late?' When scientists gave extra isoleucine to cells from the uterus, they also found it caused them to age and stop working properly. This research suggested a lack of the P Merdae gut bacteria meant it was harder to get pregnant, because the excess isoleucine was damaging reproductive cells.  But while this may suggest changing the gut microbiome could improve fertility outcomes, some doctors are sceptical. Andrea Dunaif, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told the New Scientist her research suggested fertility often improved for women with PCOS in their 30s, rather than causing early ageing of the cells as this new research would suggest. Yet, the findings may still lead to improved treatments for those with the condition. \"The microbiome is something [where] you could intervene with different probiotics to alter the [bacteria],\" she said. \"So that is nice to have a potential target to treat because we don't really have any specific treatments for PCOS.\""

The chants have been labelled antisemitic by the BBC and the organisation has since apologised for airing the performance. But shadow home secretary Chris Philp has called for the broadcaster to be prosecuted, saying it \"should not be transmitting hateful material designed to incite violence and conflict\". Avon and Somerset Police has now launched a criminal investigation into the Glastonbury performances of Bob Vylan and Kneecap. What should the BBC have done - and will the corporation face prosecution? Host Sarah-Jane Mee speaks to Channel Four's former head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, to understand what the BBC should have done differently. She also speaks to legal expert Joshua Rozenberg about whether Bob Vylan's performance constitutes a hate crime and if the BBC may be prosecuted for broadcasting it. \n                  US-UK trade, AI and a shake up of rules on investment advice\n                 \n                  Is Trump's America chaos?

        "Content": "An inquest has found drag queen The Vivienne did not intend to take their life when they died after taking ketamine. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish concluded The Vivienne, whose real name is James Lee Williams, died by \"misadventure\" after suffering cardio respiratory arrest. Williams, who won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019, was found dead at the age of 32 in the bath at their home in Cheshire on 5 January this year. In March, the star's family revealed the performer had died \"from the effects of ketamine use causing a cardiac arrest\", saying they wanted to raise awareness about the dangers of the drug. Cheshire Coroner's Court heard five drug snap bags were found, including in a bedroom draw and a bin in the bathroom, in their home in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester. Police attended and confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances. The inquest heard friends and family had no worries about Williams's mental health and the performer was looking forward to future roles on TV and in the theatre, although did \"occasionally\" take ketamine. The star's family told the hearing the performer should not be remembered for their use of the Class B drug and that drugs did not define the person they were. Williams's father Lee Williams described them as \"an outgoing character who was full of life\" and \"just wanted to make people laugh\". \"He achieved his goals. He had future goals he wanted to achieve. Along the way he always wanted to try to help his community, which he did and try to help other drag queens,\" he said. \"He was always available. He never turned anybody down. He never turned his back on anybody. He never said no. \"He loved the stage, that's where he saw the rest of his career being, on the stage, in the theatre. That's what he loved to do.\" Williams's funeral in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, North Wales, was attended by RuPaul's Drag Race UK contestants Tia Kofi and Baga Chipz, along with Steps singer Ian \"H\" Watkins, TV personality Kim Woodburn and Coronation Street actress Claire Sweeney. During their time on the show, under their drag name, Williams admitted having been a drug addict for four years. \"It was party, drugs, but I couldn't leave the drugs at the party, it was constant for me,\" they said. They added that their addiction was a \"habit that caught on a bit too quick and a bit too hard\". The TV personality, who grew up in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, before moving to Liverpool, came third in the 2023 edition of Dancing On Ice. The star performed as the Wicked Witch of the West in a UK and Ireland tour of The Wizard Of Oz musical and reprised the role in the West End at the Gillian Lynne Theatre last year. They were due back on stage in March as the Childcatcher in a tour of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, a role they first played last year. The government is seeking expert advice after illegal use of ketamine surged to record levels. In the year ending March 2023, an estimated 299,000 people aged 16 to 59 had reported use of the substance, which is controlled as class B, according to the Home Office."
