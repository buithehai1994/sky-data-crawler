        "Content": " The FBI is investigating a targeted \"act of terrorism\" after a man used a makeshift flamethrower and petrol bombs on a pro-Israel event in Colorado. It happened as a group of people in Boulder were holding a walk to remember the Israelis still held hostage in Gaza. A 45-year-old man was arrested and the FBI said he shouted \"Free Palestine\" as the attack on Pearl Street unfolded. Six people aged 67 to 88 were injured - with some airlifted to hospital. A large part of downtown Boulder was cordoned off as sniffer dogs and the bomb squad searched for potential devices. However, police currently believe no one else was involved Police chief Steve Redfearn said the attack happened around 1.26pm on Sunday and that initial reports were that \"people were being set on fire\". He said injuries ranged from \"very serious\" to \"more minor\". \"When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns,\" Mr Redfearn told the media. Senior law enforcement officials told NBC News, Sky's US partner, that at least one person was in a critical condition. Mr Redfearn said a suspect - who the FBI named as 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman - had been taken into custody without incident. The FBI's Denver chief, Mark Michalek, said it was \"clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism\". The White House described the suspect as an \"illegal alien\" who had received a work permit under the Biden administration despite overstaying a tourist visa. Boulder's police chief said the attack happened as a \"group of pro-Israel people\" were peacefully demonstrating. Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student, described seeing four women on the ground with burns on their legs. She said one appeared badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag. \"Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'\" Ms Coffman said. A statement from Boulder's Jewish community said \"an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza\". Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser said the group who were attacked gathered weekly on Pearl Street to call for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Boulder is a university city of about 105,000 people on the northwest edge of Denver, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC two weeks ago.

There has been an increase in antisemitic hate crime, as well as moves by some supporters of Israel to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. President Trump's administration has detained protesters without charge and pulled funding from elite universities that have permitted such demonstrations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, was one of the first to comment on the attack. He posted on X: \"Less than two weeks after the horrific antisemitic attack at the Capitol Jewish Museum in DC - and after two relentless years of surging antisemitic attacks across the country - the Jewish community is once again shattered by pain and heartbreak.\""

        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Azad Safarov, Ukraine producer   Ukraine's president says his country's attack on 40 bomber aircraft at multiple bases across Russia \"will undoubtedly be in history books\". Drones were smuggled into Russia and launched remotely off the back of trucks, security sources said. It is one of the most audacious Ukrainian special operations since the start of Vladimir Putin's war more than three years ago - and is a huge breach of Russia's national defences. In a further humiliation for the Kremlin, Ukraine's president revealed that the \"office\" where the secret Ukrainian mission was conducted inside Russia was located next to a facility run by the Russian security services, the FSB. \"In total, 117 drones were used in the operation,\" Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message posted on social media. \"And the corresponding number of drone operators were working. Thirty four percent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. \"Our people were operating in different Russian regions - in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe - those who helped us.\" \n                  Putin humiliated by 'Russia's Pearl Harbor' - as Kyiv goes for broke\n                 \n                  Two dead and hundreds arrested across France after PSG's Champions League win\n                 \n                  Hamburg hospital fire kills three as people call for help from windows\n                 He added that Ukraine was defending itself and its operation \"will undoubtedly be in history books\". The targeting of the bomber force will degrade the Russian military's ability to launch missile strikes against Ukraine. Videos shared with Sky News by Ukraine's SBU Security Service purport to show a line of Russian strategic bombers with smoke billowing out of them. \"Enemy strategic bombers are massively burning in Russia - this is the result of a special SBU operation,\" a security source said. The operation - codenamed \"spider's web\" - sounds more like a plot from a science fiction movie than reality, but it shows how new technology has transformed the battlefield. It also reveals the vulnerability of large bases and expensive pieces of military equipment. A security source said Ukrainian operatives smuggled first-person view (FPV) drones into Russia. They then brought in a load of wooden, flat-pack, garden office-style containers. These huts were constructed, with the drones hidden inside them, before being put on to the back of trucks and driven to locations from where the attacks were launched. At the right moment, hatches on the roofs of the huts were opened remotely, and the drones were piloted onto their targets, according to the source.

Sources said the individuals who took part in this special operation have been back in Ukraine for a long time. They claimed that anyone detained in Russia by the Russian authorities would be just for show. Offering details of the actual attack, a second source said four bases were targeted. It was not possible independently to confirm the claim. \"Right now, the Security Service of Ukraine is conducting a large-scale special operation to destroy enemy bombers in the rear of Russia,\" the source said. \"The SBU drones are targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night. So far, more than 40 planes have been hit, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3.\" The Tu-95 and Tu-22 are both heavy bombers that can fire cruise missiles. At least one of the videos shared with Sky News is purportedly of the Belaya airfield, more than 2,500 miles from the Ukrainian border. Sources claimed to have inflicted more than $2bn (£1.4bn) worth of damage on the Russian air force. \"We are waiting for the details. And we hope that the number of hit aircraft will increase!\" one source said. The latest toll was 41 aircraft, according to Ukrainian sources. The other Russian airbases targeted by Ukraine were: Diagilevo, Olenya and Ivanovo airfields."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  An audacious Ukrainian drone attack against multiple airbases across Russia is a humiliating security breach for Vladimir Putin that will doubtless trigger a furious response. Pro-Kremlin bloggers have described the drone assault - which Ukrainian security sources said hit more than 40 Russian warplanes - as \"Russia's Pearl Harbor\" in reference to the Japanese attack against the US in 1941 that prompted Washington to enter the Second World War. Ukraine war latest: Russia accuses Kyiv of 'terrorist attack' The Ukrainian operation - which used small drones smuggled into Russia, hidden in mobile sheds and launched off the back of trucks - also demonstrated how technology and imagination have transformed the battlefield, enabling Ukraine to seriously hurt its far more powerful opponent. Moscow will have to retaliate, with speculation already appearing online about whether President Putin will again threaten the use of nuclear weapons. \"We hope that the response will be the same as the US response to the attack on their Pearl Harbor or even harsher,\" military blogger Roman Alekhin wrote on his Telegram channel.

Flat-pack, garden-office style sheds were also secretly transported into the country. The oblong sheds were then built and drones were hidden inside, before the containers were put on the back of trucks and driven to within range of their respective targets. At a chosen time, doors on the roofs of the huts were opened remotely and the drones were flown out. Each was armed with a bomb that was flown into the airfields, with videos released by the security service that purportedly showed them blasting into Russian aircraft. Among the targets were Tu-95 and Tu-22 bomber aircraft that can launch cruise missiles, according to the Ukrainian side. An A-50 airborne early warning aircraft was also allegedly hit. This is a valuable platform that is used to command and control operations. The use of such simple technology to destroy multi-million-pound aircraft will be watched with concern by governments around the world. Suddenly, every single military base, airfield and warship will appear that little bit more vulnerable if any truck nearby could be loaded with killer drones.

It is not clear if that will still happen. US President Donald Trump has been pushing for the two sides to make peace but Russia has only escalated its war. Ukraine clearly felt it had nothing to lose but to also go on the attack."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n  Organised criminal gangs are increasingly using rented houses and flats to operate illegal cannabis farms – and police say it is putting the lives of innocent neighbours at risk. The gangs often use crude methods to bypass electricity meters to avoid paying for the high levels of energy the farms require, creating an increased fire risk. Rival gangs also carry out raids on each other's farms - a practice known as 'taxing' - carrying out \"significant violence\" to anyone who gets in their way, police say. Greater Manchester Police detected 402 cannabis farms between May 2024 and April 2025, and Sky News was given access to an operation by its officers at a semi-detached house in a quiet suburban street in Wythenshawe. Inside, officers found one room full of cannabis plants and another 'drying room' with the drug packaged up and ready to be distributed. The street value was estimated in the tens of thousands of pounds. Outside, officers found evidence that the electricity meter had been bypassed. 'Abstracting' is the offence of dishonestly using, wasting or diverting electricity. One person inside the property was arrested. \"The electricity gets bypassed in order to avoid big electric bills,\" Inspector Bree Lanyon said. \n                  The ins and outs of UK cannabis law - and calls to decriminalise it\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  Who are the gangs behind the cannabis home delivery service?\n                 \"Because a substantial amount of electric is required to run the lights, the ventilation, the heat, everything else that's required in the cannabis farm, the abstract is done in a haphazard way and it can cause fires within the properties.\" She continued: \"We've seen a lot of fires recently in premises that have been set up as cannabis farms, because of the way the electricity is set up. It's not safe and the neighbouring residence could be at risk if that property is burning down.\" The risks posed by cannabis farms were highlighted by the death of seven-year-old Archie York in 2024. He was killed when chemicals being used in a cannabis factory caused an explosion in the family's block of flats. The drug dealer responsible was jailed for 14 years. Police say gangs employ low-level operatives, known as gardeners, to manage and protect farms, who will often plead guilty to drug offences and accept the punishment to keep police off the trail of those controlling the operation. The use of rented properties - sometimes through rogue landlords - also makes detection more difficult. Read more:The ins and outs of UK cannabis lawWhat are cannabis stickers? \"The vast majority are organised crime gangs,\" said Detective Inspector Paul Crompton, from GMP's serious and organised crime group. \"It infuriates me when we take action against these farms and people say 'It's only cannabis'. \"What we see with cannabis farms is that rival organised crime groups will actively target those and break in and take the products by force. You've got a risk of potentially people being kidnapped or killed without us knowing anything about them. \"Make no bones about it, there's massive amounts of money to make and they would rather just go and take that cannabis and sell it for themselves. They'll do significant, violence against anybody that gets in the way, whether that's the gardener, the police or residents who might get in the way.\" Police say landlords need to be aware of the risks and even the chief executive of the British Landlords Association has fallen victim. One of Sajjar Ahmad's properties was badly damaged by those using it for an illegal cannabis farm. \"I can only explain it as horrific,\" he said. \"Our members, when they've experienced the problem with the cannabis farm, they are shocked. They didn't know it could happen. They are not aware of the telltale signs. \"They have the same regrets as what I experienced - you need to carry out regular inspections and, if somebody is offering you a larger rent, then you should question that.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Sir Keir Starmer will pledge to buy more attack submarines and put the military on a war footing as part of a major defence review - but without making any new spending promises. The lack of extra cash meant the prime minister was coming under fire for empty rhetoric even before the blueprint for the future of the armed forces is released on Monday. Defence Secretary John Healey was forced to clarify that while he has \"no doubt\" the government will lift the defence budget to 3% of national income by 2034, he does not actually have a solid commitment from the Treasury, and this remains only an \"ambition\".  Sky News understands that the recommendations in the Strategic Defence Review, which is expected to spell out the importance of rebuilding national defence and resilience, require investment to rise by at least that amount. Defence insiders say in reality, given the scale of what they see as the threat posed by hostile states such as Russia, funding should come even faster and be higher. Donald Trump wants Washington's NATO allies to spend 5% of GDP on their armed forces, while Mark Rutte, the head of the alliance, is pushing for 3.5% by 2032. \"The real story is that Healey didn't get the money,\" one source said. \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer hails new British 'StormShroud' drones coming into operation\n                 \n                  Growing calls for UK to withdraw from treaty banning landmines\n                 A second source said there is a danger of the UK losing its leadership role in NATO if it fails to support any potential new 3.5% GDP spending target. Unusually, the government released responses from Sir Keir and the defence secretary to the review hours before the country would be given a chance to scrutinise its content. New Sky News podcast launches on 10 June - The Wargame simulates an attack by Russia to test UK defences The document, which is understood to be around 130 to 150 pages, differs from previous reviews as it has been led by external experts rather than being carried out internally. In a statement, the government said it would commit to \"a landmark shift in our deterrence and defence, moving to warfighting readiness to deter threats and strengthen security in the Euro Atlantic area\". The prime minister will also announce the UK's plans to buy \"up to\" 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines in a partnership with Australia and the US known as AUKUS. However, the only thing new about this is a bit more clarity on the size of the fleet. The previous government had already committed to starting to replace the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines by the late 2030s with AUKUS boats. \"Sort of what we already know… repackaged into an announcement,\" a defence industry source said. And the incumbent fleet is not even fully operational yet - almost 30 years after the first order was made. Britain's nuclear deterrent - carried by a different type of submarine - will also be an important focus of the review. The prime minister, for the first time, put a price tag on the cost to develop nuclear warheads for the Trident missiles that will be carried by a new fleet of nuclear-armed submarines, which are also being built. Read more on Sky News:Ukraine 'had nothing to lose'UK weapons factories 'built soon''Give prison officers lethal weapons' He said the UK is spending £15bn over this parliament on the effort. This investment, coupled with the expansion in submarine building, will support 30,000 highly-skilled jobs across the country, according to a Ministry of Defence statement. \"From the supply lines to the front lines, this government is foursquare behind the men and women upholding our nation's freedom and security,\" the prime minister is expected to say. \"National security is the foundation of my Plan for Change, and this plan will ensure Britain is secure at home and strong abroad. \"This Strategic Defence Review will ensure the UK rises to the challenge and our Armed Forces have the equipment they need that keeps us safe at home while driving greater opportunity for our engineers, shipbuilders and technicians of the future.\" James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, criticised ministers for failing to give a firm date to lift defence spending to 3% of national income. \"All of Labour's Strategic Defence Review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said. It was a sentiment echoed by the Liberal Democrats. \"Unless Labour commits to holding cross-party talks on how to reach 3% much more rapidly than the mid-2030s, this announcement risks becoming a damp squib,\" said Helen Maguire, the party's spokesperson on defence."

        "Content": " At least 31 people have been killed near an aid distribution centre in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry. Earlier, a nearby hospital run by the Red Cross reported that at least 21 people had been killed. The hospital, which has been receiving bodies and the wounded, also said another 175 people had been injured. Witnesses said the deaths came after Israeli forces opened fire at a roundabout near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation hub, a new aid organisation backed by Israel and the US. However, Palestinian and Hamas-linked media have attributed the deaths it has reported on to an Israeli airstrike. It is not yet clear if eyewitnesses and Hamas-affiliated media are giving different accounts of the same incident. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said \"false reports have been spread\" in recent hours. The statement said: \"[these include] serious allegations against the IDF regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip. \"Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.\" The IDF says it is working with the American Civil Organisation (GHF) and other international aid organisations to get aid to civilians. Witnesses tell of shooting The area where the reported shooting took place is controlled by Israeli forces. Ibrahim Abu Saoud, an eyewitness, said Israeli forces opened fire at people moving toward the aid distribution centre. \"There were many martyrs, including women,\" the 40-year-old man said. \"We were about 300 metres away from the military.\" Abu Saoud said he saw many people with gunshot wounds, including a young man who he said had died at the scene. \"We weren't able to help him,\" he said. Mohammed Abu Teaima, 33, said he saw Israeli forces open fire and kill his cousin and another woman as they were heading to the hub. He said his cousin was shot in his chest and died at the scene. Many others were wounded, including his brother-in-law, he said. \"They opened heavy fire directly toward us,\" he said as he was waiting outside the Red Cross field hospital for word on his wounded relative. Minister doesn't confirm reported attack In an interview on Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Israel's deputy minister of foreign affairs Sharren Haskel suggested reports of the attack could be \"Hamas propaganda\". Asked about the alleged attack near the aid hub, she said: \"The IDF said it's actually reviewing this issue right now... They didn't have any information to give me before [this interview]. \"But I have to say that during the last week, we have heard so much propaganda coming from Hamas about the humanitarian distribution point that I wouldn't be surprised if that's another case like that.\" She added: \"We've just heard about this case from your media, that was literally two minutes before I came online to your show.\" Controversial new aid system The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) operates as part of a controversial aid system which Israel and the US says is aimed at preventing Hamas from siphoning off assistance. Israel has not provided any evidence of systematic diversion, and the UN denies it has occurred. The foundation's distribution of aid has been marred by chaos, and multiple witnesses have said Israeli troops fired on crowds near the delivery sites. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory. Before Sunday, at least six people had been killed and more than 50 wounded, according to local health officials. Aid distribution is a 'death trap' Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, said the Rafah incident shows aid distribution in Gaza \"has become a death trap\". In a post on X on Sunday, Mr Lazzarini pointed to \"mass casualties, including scores of injured and killed among starving civilians due to gunshots this morning\", quoting international medics on the ground. Under the Israeli-American plan, an aid distribution point had been placed \"far south in Rafah\", forcing \"thousands of hungry and desperate people to walk for tens of miles to an area that's all but pulverized due to heavy bombardment by the Israeli Army\". It was \"humiliating\", he said, as he called for the delivery and distribution of aid to be \"at scale and safe\", something that in Gaza \"can be done only through the United Nations, including UNRWA\". The agency was banned by Israel from operating in Occupied East Jerusalem and Israel in January over alleged links to Hamas in Gaza, which the organisation denies. Israel must \"lift the siege and allow the UN safe + unhindered access\" to deliver and distribute aid, he said, adding it was \"the only way to avert mass starvation, including among one million children,\" Mr Lazzarini said.

Following Sunday's allegations, the foundation said: \"All aid was distributed today without incident. No injuries or fatalities as noted in our daily update sent out earlier. \"We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.\" In an earlier statement, the organisation said it distributed 16 truckloads of aid on Sunday. It dismissed what it referred to as \"false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos\". Meanwhile, the UN's aid system has struggled to bring in aid after Israel slightly eased its total blockade of the territory last month. Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians. Experts have warned that the Palestinian territory is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory, displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid."

        "Content": "Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki, who draws inspiration from Donald Trump, is set to narrowly win Poland's presidential election, according to a late exit poll. An Ipsos poll said Mr Nawrocki has secured 50.7% of votes while his opponent, the Liberal pro-EU candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, has 49.3%. The late exit poll was released just hours after a previous one called the result the other way round. The first - also by Ipsos - said Mr Nawrocki was on track to receive 49.7% of the votes, with his rival on 50.3%. Both polls have margins of error of two percentage points. The electoral commission has said it hopes the final results will be announced on Monday morning or in the afternoon. After the first poll, both men declared victory.

He continued: \"This is truly a special moment in Poland's history. I am convinced that it will allow us to move forward and focus on the future. I will be your president.\" But Mr Nawrocki, 42, said he believed the vote would turn in his favour. \"We will win and save Poland,\" he said. \"We must win tonight.\" He had positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, aligning himself with US conservatives, including Mr Trump, and showing scepticism towards the EU. Europe correspondent The Polish election is not short of interest.  The turnout may well be the highest ever for a presidential election and it's been followed keenly around the world.  The political views of the candidates are - and apologies for the terrible pun - poles apart.  One is desperate for closer ties with Europe, greater reforms domestically and keen to extend the hand of friendship to Ukraine. The other is determined to rein in the Polish prime minister's programme of change, grow closer ties with America and stop Ukraine joining the EU. And there is very little between them.  Two exit polls predicted a result too close to call. It's also a good demonstration of how big democratic decisions can come down to slight margins. In a country with more than 28 million voters, this election could be decided by a difference of fewer than 100,000. A final result won't come until Monday - possible into the afternoon.  Normally, by that point, we know who's going to win and one candidate has already claimed victory.  So far, we don't know the outcome, and both candidates have claimed victory. This one will be tight. The vote has been closely watched in neighbouring Ukraine as well as in Russia, the European Union and the United States - and the final outcome will decide whether Poland pivots towards more liberal norms or takes a more nationalist path.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Sir Keir Starmer will pledge to buy more attack submarines and put the military on a war footing as part of a major defence review - but without making any new spending promises. The lack of extra cash meant the prime minister was coming under fire for empty rhetoric even before the blueprint for the future of the armed forces is released on Monday. Defence Secretary John Healey was forced to clarify that while he has \"no doubt\" the government will lift the defence budget to 3% of national income by 2034, he does not actually have a solid commitment from the Treasury, and this remains only an \"ambition\".  Sky News understands that the recommendations in the Strategic Defence Review, which is expected to spell out the importance of rebuilding national defence and resilience, require investment to rise by at least that amount. Defence insiders say in reality, given the scale of what they see as the threat posed by hostile states such as Russia, funding should come even faster and be higher. Donald Trump wants Washington's NATO allies to spend 5% of GDP on their armed forces, while Mark Rutte, the head of the alliance, is pushing for 3.5% by 2032. \"The real story is that Healey didn't get the money,\" one source said. \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer hails new British 'StormShroud' drones coming into operation\n                 \n                  Growing calls for UK to withdraw from treaty banning landmines\n                 A second source said there is a danger of the UK losing its leadership role in NATO if it fails to support any potential new 3.5% GDP spending target. Unusually, the government released responses from Sir Keir and the defence secretary to the review hours before the country would be given a chance to scrutinise its content. New Sky News podcast launches on 10 June - The Wargame simulates an attack by Russia to test UK defences The document, which is understood to be around 130 to 150 pages, differs from previous reviews as it has been led by external experts rather than being carried out internally. In a statement, the government said it would commit to \"a landmark shift in our deterrence and defence, moving to warfighting readiness to deter threats and strengthen security in the Euro Atlantic area\". The prime minister will also announce the UK's plans to buy \"up to\" 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines in a partnership with Australia and the US known as AUKUS. However, the only thing new about this is a bit more clarity on the size of the fleet. The previous government had already committed to starting to replace the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines by the late 2030s with AUKUS boats. \"Sort of what we already know… repackaged into an announcement,\" a defence industry source said. And the incumbent fleet is not even fully operational yet - almost 30 years after the first order was made. Britain's nuclear deterrent - carried by a different type of submarine - will also be an important focus of the review. The prime minister, for the first time, put a price tag on the cost to develop nuclear warheads for the Trident missiles that will be carried by a new fleet of nuclear-armed submarines, which are also being built.

This investment, coupled with the expansion in submarine building, will support 30,000 highly-skilled jobs across the country, according to a Ministry of Defence statement. \"From the supply lines to the front lines, this government is foursquare behind the men and women upholding our nation's freedom and security,\" the prime minister is expected to say. \"National security is the foundation of my Plan for Change, and this plan will ensure Britain is secure at home and strong abroad. \"This Strategic Defence Review will ensure the UK rises to the challenge and our Armed Forces have the equipment they need that keeps us safe at home while driving greater opportunity for our engineers, shipbuilders and technicians of the future.\" James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, criticised ministers for failing to give a firm date to lift defence spending to 3% of national income. \"All of Labour's Strategic Defence Review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said. It was a sentiment echoed by the Liberal Democrats. \"Unless Labour commits to holding cross-party talks on how to reach 3% much more rapidly than the mid-2030s, this announcement risks becoming a damp squib,\" said Helen Maguire, the party's spokesperson on defence."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n  Organised criminal gangs are increasingly using rented houses and flats to operate illegal cannabis farms – and police say it is putting the lives of innocent neighbours at risk. The gangs often use crude methods to bypass electricity meters to avoid paying for the high levels of energy the farms require, creating an increased fire risk. Rival gangs also carry out raids on each other's farms - a practice known as 'taxing' - carrying out \"significant violence\" to anyone who gets in their way, police say. Greater Manchester Police detected 402 cannabis farms between May 2024 and April 2025, and Sky News was given access to an operation by its officers at a semi-detached house in a quiet suburban street in Wythenshawe. Inside, officers found one room full of cannabis plants and another 'drying room' with the drug packaged up and ready to be distributed. The street value was estimated in the tens of thousands of pounds. Outside, officers found evidence that the electricity meter had been bypassed. 'Abstracting' is the offence of dishonestly using, wasting or diverting electricity. One person inside the property was arrested. \"The electricity gets bypassed in order to avoid big electric bills,\" Inspector Bree Lanyon said. \n                  The ins and outs of UK cannabis law - and calls to decriminalise it\n                 \n                  Sadiq Khan says some cannabis possession should be decriminalised\n                 \n                  Who are the gangs behind the cannabis home delivery service?\n                 \"Because a substantial amount of electric is required to run the lights, the ventilation, the heat, everything else that's required in the cannabis farm, the abstract is done in a haphazard way and it can cause fires within the properties.\" She continued: \"We've seen a lot of fires recently in premises that have been set up as cannabis farms, because of the way the electricity is set up. It's not safe and the neighbouring residence could be at risk if that property is burning down.\" The risks posed by cannabis farms were highlighted by the death of seven-year-old Archie York in 2024. He was killed when chemicals being used in a cannabis factory caused an explosion in the family's block of flats. The drug dealer responsible was jailed for 14 years. Police say gangs employ low-level operatives, known as gardeners, to manage and protect farms, who will often plead guilty to drug offences and accept the punishment to keep police off the trail of those controlling the operation. The use of rented properties - sometimes through rogue landlords - also makes detection more difficult. Read more:The ins and outs of UK cannabis lawWhat are cannabis stickers? \"The vast majority are organised crime gangs,\" said Detective Inspector Paul Crompton, from GMP's serious and organised crime group. \"It infuriates me when we take action against these farms and people say 'It's only cannabis'. \"What we see with cannabis farms is that rival organised crime groups will actively target those and break in and take the products by force. You've got a risk of potentially people being kidnapped or killed without us knowing anything about them. \"Make no bones about it, there's massive amounts of money to make and they would rather just go and take that cannabis and sell it for themselves. They'll do significant, violence against anybody that gets in the way, whether that's the gardener, the police or residents who might get in the way.\" Police say landlords need to be aware of the risks and even the chief executive of the British Landlords Association has fallen victim. One of Sajjar Ahmad's properties was badly damaged by those using it for an illegal cannabis farm. \"I can only explain it as horrific,\" he said. \"Our members, when they've experienced the problem with the cannabis farm, they are shocked. They didn't know it could happen. They are not aware of the telltale signs. \"They have the same regrets as what I experienced - you need to carry out regular inspections and, if somebody is offering you a larger rent, then you should question that.\""

John Healey told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the previous Conservative government left the UK's asylum system \"in chaos\" and the country with \"record levels of immigration\", which his government is having to deal with. Politics latest: Defence secretary shares 'message' to Putin On Saturday, 1,194 migrants arrived in the UK on 18 small boats, government figures showed - the highest number of arrivals in a day so far this year (the previous record was 825 on a day in May). It brings the provisional total for 2025 so far to 14,811 - the highest ever recorded for the first five months in a year and the highest total for the first six months of the year, which was previously 13,489 on 30 June last year. 2025's total so far is 42% higher than the same point last year (10,448), and 95% up from the same point in 2023 (7,610). The highest daily total since data began in 2018 remains at 1,305 on 3 September 2022. On Saturday, French police watched on while people, including children, boarded small boats in the shallows of a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk. Authorities were then pictured escorting the boats as they sailed off towards the UK. Mr Healey said: \"Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday. \"Truth is, Britain's lost control of its borders over the last five years, and the last government last year left an asylum system in chaos and record levels of immigration.\" He said it is a \"really big problem\" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters. \"We saw the smugglers launching elsewhere and coming around like a taxi to pick them up,\" Mr Healey added. He said the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene. \"They're not doing it, but for the first time for years, for the first time, we've got the level of cooperation needed,\" Mr Healey said. \"We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.\" Read more: New weapons factories to be built 'very soon'Prison officers should have lethal weapons, Tories say Political correspondent The problem for Sir Keir Starmer – as it was for Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson - is that smashing the gangs and stopping the boats is not nearly as straightforward as the snappy slogans suggest.\n Labour came into power promising to rip up the previous government's deterrent-based approach and immediately scrapped the controversial Rwanda policy - which cost £700m and only saw four volunteers ever deported.\n Instead the PM's approach has focused on putting resources into law enforcement, giving them greater powers to tackle the smugglers - and crucially, trying to take a more collaborative approach with France.\n In February, this seemed to have borne fruit, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announcing the French authorities had agreed to change the law to allow police to intercept migrant boats after they have entered the water.\n The people smugglers' tactics are designed to take advantage of these rules – with boats operating like sea taxis rather than launching from beaches where the gendarmes would have the authority to take action.\n But clearly there's mounting frustration that this change has not yet happened.\n It's unusual to hear Labour hitting out at the French authorities, but John Healey's description of yesterday's scenes as \"shocking\" - and the police's inability to intervene as a \"really big problem\" - was far from diplomatic.\n But as the number of migrant arrivals continue to rise - and the images of packed boats continue to dominate our screens – disillusioned voters will write this off as another broken promise from their political leaders.  On Saturday, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused Labour of having \"completely lost control of our borders\". The Home Office released figures on Thursday that revealed France is intercepting fewer Channel migrants than ever before, despite signing a £480m deal with the UK to stop the crossings. This year, French police have prevented just over 38% (8,347) of asylum seekers from reaching the UK in small boats, with 13,167 having made the journey successfully. They stopped an estimated 45% last year and 47% in 2023."

There's an obvious tension between this leisurely timescale and the sabre-rattling urgency of the government's messaging.\n Writing in the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister promised to \"restore Britain's war fighting readiness\", warning \"we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces\".\n Mr Healey told Sir Trevor Phillips the idea is to send a message to Vladimir Putin that \"we take our defence seriously\".\n But he also couldn't give an exact date when the six new munitions factories would be up and running.\n The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are both calling for 3% to be reached within this parliament. But in a landscape of planned spending cuts – and with so many competing demands for money – finding any extra cash any time soon looks highly unlikely.\n Senior Conservative Robert Jenrick told Trevor Phillips he welcomed \"any extra investment in defence\" and the fact Labour had reaffirmed the UK's commitment to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence. However, he said: \"We want to see the UK reach 3% within this parliament, we think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.\" He called Mr Healey \"a good man\" who is \"doing what needs to be done in the national interest\". But he added: \"I am sceptical as to whether Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is going to make good on these promises. \"Since the general election, all I can see are broken promises from Rachel Reeves.\""

        "Content": "A new drug could stop some breast cancer tumours from using hormones to grow, a trial has found. Results from the Serena-6 trial, carried out with the Institute of Cancer Research in London, suggest that using camizestrant could help patients stay well longer and delay the need for chemotherapy. According to Cancer Research UK, the drug works by blocking oestrogen from getting into the breast cancer cell, which researchers hope can then stop or slow the growth of cancer. Breast cancer patients given the drug in the trial reduced their chances of the disease progressing by 52% compared to standard therapies. Professor Kristian Helin, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said the results \"represent more than a clinical milestone, they represent a transformational shift in how we approach precision medicine\". Co-principal investigator Professor Nick Turner also called the development of the drug \"a pivotal moment in breast cancer care\".  The study, funded by AstraZeneca, looked at patients with hormone-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer - about 70% of cases. More than 3,000 patients from 23 countries took part in phase three of the trial, which saw doctors use blood tests to detect changes in the cancer's DNA to see which treatments were ineffective. For those taking camizestrant, their cancer stabilised for around 16 months on average, compared with about nine months for other treatments. However, 1% of patients taking the new drug stopped taking it because of side effects.

The trial was also the first worldwide study to show that using blood tests to find early signs of cancer resistance to treatment helps patients. Dr Catherine Elliott, director of research at Cancer Research UK, praised the breakthrough as a \"clear example of how blood tests are starting to transform cancer treatment\". \"By tracking tiny traces of tumour DNA in the blood, researchers were able to spot early signs of treatment resistance and switch therapies before cancer had a chance to grow,\" she added. \"It shows how circulating tumour DNA, or ctDNA, could help doctors make smarter, more timely treatment decisions. \"This approach could become an important part of how we personalise care for people with advanced breast cancer.\""

George Karnovski says he pulled what he said was an \"11-year-old\" boy out of the river after he got into difficulty near the Royal Terrace Pier in Gravesend in Kent. He said once he had the child on a buoy, he was \"just screaming\" as he struggled in the water. Kent Police and the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) recovered the body of the missing girl at around 11.40am on Saturday. Witnesses suggest she was the boy's younger sister. Formal identification by the girl's next of kin has taken place, and the death is not being treated as suspicious, police said. Emergency services were called on Friday afternoon after concerns were raised for the two children who had entered the river at nearby Royal Pier Road. Mr Karnvoski said: \"At the same time as pulling him out, I was looking around, like, where is she, where is she? \"I'm shouting, saying 'there's one more, there's one more'. I'm looking around, [but] for love nor money, I cannot see the little girl.\" Mr Karnovski, 37, who is a member of the RAF, had been visiting his family who live in the town. He said they had been out on a walk when they heard that children were in trouble in the water, which he said had \"a strong current\". His brother Jack, who lives in the area, said he had seen his wife \"scream, and point at the river. I assumed it was my children. I went running and shouted to my brother\". The pair discovered there was only one life ring, and so only George, who said he had previously had lifeguard training, could enter the water for safety reasons. Jack said that when George jumped in, he \"said he never felt the bottom. We had to run down the jetty because the tide was running up\". \"The jetty is quite long. By the time you ran down it, it was deep water,\" he added. George said the conditions in the water at the time were \"tough\", even for an experienced adult swimmer. By the time he entered the water, he says the children were about 40 to 50 metres (131 to 164 feet) away, and it took him about two minutes to get to them. \"I started swimming. I went quite hard to begin with, but then started running out of steam,\" he said. Read more on Sky News:Two dead in violence after finalBritain 'has lost control of borders'Two Britons shot dead in Spain Jack, who was on the pier directing George in his efforts to rescue the children, said the children were travelling quickly with the strength of the water. \"In terms of the current, they'd fallen off the jetty. They were about 50 metres away, going towards London. By the time my brother had caught up with them, I'd say he was 150 to 200 metres (492 to 656 feet) away. So that gives you an idea. In a couple of minutes, they'd gone 100m (328 feet) or more down the Thames,\" he said. The brothers said other organisations helped the rescue efforts, including the RNLI and the London Port Authority (LPA). The LPA said in a statement they \"are continuing to support police with their inquiries into exactly what happened, and where and how the children entered the water. It is so sad and the thoughts of the whole of the LPA are with their loved ones\"."

        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Azad Safarov, Ukraine producer   Ukraine's president says his country's attack on 40 bomber aircraft at multiple bases across Russia \"will undoubtedly be in history books\". Drones were smuggled into Russia and launched remotely off the back of trucks, security sources said. It is one of the most audacious Ukrainian special operations since the start of Vladimir Putin's war more than three years ago - and is a huge breach of Russia's national defences. In a further humiliation for the Kremlin, Ukraine's president revealed that the \"office\" where the secret Ukrainian mission was conducted inside Russia was located next to a facility run by the Russian security services, the FSB. \"In total, 117 drones were used in the operation,\" Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message posted on social media. \"And the corresponding number of drone operators were working. Thirty four percent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. \"Our people were operating in different Russian regions - in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe - those who helped us.\" \n                  Putin humiliated by 'Russia's Pearl Harbor' - as Kyiv goes for broke\n                 \n                  Two dead and hundreds arrested across France after PSG's Champions League win\n                 \n                  Hamburg hospital fire kills three as people call for help from windows\n                 He added that Ukraine was defending itself and its operation \"will undoubtedly be in history books\". The targeting of the bomber force will degrade the Russian military's ability to launch missile strikes against Ukraine. Videos shared with Sky News by Ukraine's SBU Security Service purport to show a line of Russian strategic bombers with smoke billowing out of them. \"Enemy strategic bombers are massively burning in Russia - this is the result of a special SBU operation,\" a security source said. The operation - codenamed \"spider's web\" - sounds more like a plot from a science fiction movie than reality, but it shows how new technology has transformed the battlefield. It also reveals the vulnerability of large bases and expensive pieces of military equipment. A security source said Ukrainian operatives smuggled first-person view (FPV) drones into Russia. They then brought in a load of wooden, flat-pack, garden office-style containers. These huts were constructed, with the drones hidden inside them, before being put on to the back of trucks and driven to locations from where the attacks were launched. At the right moment, hatches on the roofs of the huts were opened remotely, and the drones were piloted onto their targets, according to the source.

Sources said the individuals who took part in this special operation have been back in Ukraine for a long time. They claimed that anyone detained in Russia by the Russian authorities would be just for show. Offering details of the actual attack, a second source said four bases were targeted. It was not possible independently to confirm the claim. \"Right now, the Security Service of Ukraine is conducting a large-scale special operation to destroy enemy bombers in the rear of Russia,\" the source said. \"The SBU drones are targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night. So far, more than 40 planes have been hit, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3.\" The Tu-95 and Tu-22 are both heavy bombers that can fire cruise missiles. At least one of the videos shared with Sky News is purportedly of the Belaya airfield, more than 2,500 miles from the Ukrainian border. Sources claimed to have inflicted more than $2bn (£1.4bn) worth of damage on the Russian air force. \"We are waiting for the details. And we hope that the number of hit aircraft will increase!\" one source said. The latest toll was 41 aircraft, according to Ukrainian sources. The other Russian airbases targeted by Ukraine were: Diagilevo, Olenya and Ivanovo airfields."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  An audacious Ukrainian drone attack against multiple airbases across Russia is a humiliating security breach for Vladimir Putin that will doubtless trigger a furious response. Pro-Kremlin bloggers have described the drone assault - which Ukrainian security sources said hit more than 40 Russian warplanes - as \"Russia's Pearl Harbor\" in reference to the Japanese attack against the US in 1941 that prompted Washington to enter the Second World War. Ukraine war latest: Russia accuses Kyiv of 'terrorist attack' The Ukrainian operation - which used small drones smuggled into Russia, hidden in mobile sheds and launched off the back of trucks - also demonstrated how technology and imagination have transformed the battlefield, enabling Ukraine to seriously hurt its far more powerful opponent. Moscow will have to retaliate, with speculation already appearing online about whether President Putin will again threaten the use of nuclear weapons. \"We hope that the response will be the same as the US response to the attack on their Pearl Harbor or even harsher,\" military blogger Roman Alekhin wrote on his Telegram channel. Codenamed 'Spider's Web', the mission on Sunday was the culmination of one and a half years of planning, according to a security source. \n                  Strategic Defence Review: UK gears up to combat Russian threat, but questions remain about funding for new spending\n                 \n                  Russia 'investigates bridge collapses as terrorist attacks' as seven people killed\n                 \n                  Girl, 9, killed in Russian missile attack - as Moscow continues advance on Ukrainian territory\n                 In that time, Ukraine's secret service smuggled first-person view (FPV) drones into Russia, sources with knowledge of the operation said. Flat-pack, garden-office style sheds were also secretly transported into the country. The oblong sheds were then built and drones were hidden inside, before the containers were put on the back of trucks and driven to within range of their respective targets. At a chosen time, doors on the roofs of the huts were opened remotely and the drones were flown out. Each was armed with a bomb that was flown into the airfields, with videos released by the security service that purportedly showed them blasting into Russian aircraft. Among the targets were Tu-95 and Tu-22 bomber aircraft that can launch cruise missiles, according to the Ukrainian side. An A-50 airborne early warning aircraft was also allegedly hit. This is a valuable platform that is used to command and control operations. The use of such simple technology to destroy multi-million-pound aircraft will be watched with concern by governments around the world. Suddenly, every single military base, airfield and warship will appear that little bit more vulnerable if any truck nearby could be loaded with killer drones.

Previous attacks by Ukraine inside Russia have triggered retaliatory strikes and increasingly threatening rhetoric from the Kremlin. But this latest operation is one of the biggest and most significant, and comes on the eve of a new round of peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv that are meant to take place in Turkey. It is not clear if that will still happen. US President Donald Trump has been pushing for the two sides to make peace but Russia has only escalated its war. Ukraine clearly felt it had nothing to lose but to also go on the attack."

        "Content": " At least 31 people have been killed near an aid distribution centre in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry. Earlier, a nearby hospital run by the Red Cross reported that at least 21 people had been killed. The hospital, which has been receiving bodies and the wounded, also said another 175 people had been injured. Witnesses said the deaths came after Israeli forces opened fire at a roundabout near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation hub, a new aid organisation backed by Israel and the US. However, Palestinian and Hamas-linked media have attributed the deaths it has reported on to an Israeli airstrike. It is not yet clear if eyewitnesses and Hamas-affiliated media are giving different accounts of the same incident. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said \"false reports have been spread\" in recent hours. The statement said: \"[these include] serious allegations against the IDF regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip. \"Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.\" The IDF says it is working with the American Civil Organisation (GHF) and other international aid organisations to get aid to civilians. Witnesses tell of shooting The area where the reported shooting took place is controlled by Israeli forces. Ibrahim Abu Saoud, an eyewitness, said Israeli forces opened fire at people moving toward the aid distribution centre. \"There were many martyrs, including women,\" the 40-year-old man said. \"We were about 300 metres away from the military.\" Abu Saoud said he saw many people with gunshot wounds, including a young man who he said had died at the scene. \"We weren't able to help him,\" he said. Mohammed Abu Teaima, 33, said he saw Israeli forces open fire and kill his cousin and another woman as they were heading to the hub. He said his cousin was shot in his chest and died at the scene. Many others were wounded, including his brother-in-law, he said. \"They opened heavy fire directly toward us,\" he said as he was waiting outside the Red Cross field hospital for word on his wounded relative. Minister doesn't confirm reported attack In an interview on Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Israel's deputy minister of foreign affairs Sharren Haskel suggested reports of the attack could be \"Hamas propaganda\". Asked about the alleged attack near the aid hub, she said: \"The IDF said it's actually reviewing this issue right now... They didn't have any information to give me before [this interview]. \"But I have to say that during the last week, we have heard so much propaganda coming from Hamas about the humanitarian distribution point that I wouldn't be surprised if that's another case like that.\" She added: \"We've just heard about this case from your media, that was literally two minutes before I came online to your show.\" Controversial new aid system The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) operates as part of a controversial aid system which Israel and the US says is aimed at preventing Hamas from siphoning off assistance. Israel has not provided any evidence of systematic diversion, and the UN denies it has occurred. The foundation's distribution of aid has been marred by chaos, and multiple witnesses have said Israeli troops fired on crowds near the delivery sites. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory. Before Sunday, at least six people had been killed and more than 50 wounded, according to local health officials. Aid distribution is a 'death trap' Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, said the Rafah incident shows aid distribution in Gaza \"has become a death trap\". In a post on X on Sunday, Mr Lazzarini pointed to \"mass casualties, including scores of injured and killed among starving civilians due to gunshots this morning\", quoting international medics on the ground. Under the Israeli-American plan, an aid distribution point had been placed \"far south in Rafah\", forcing \"thousands of hungry and desperate people to walk for tens of miles to an area that's all but pulverized due to heavy bombardment by the Israeli Army\". It was \"humiliating\", he said, as he called for the delivery and distribution of aid to be \"at scale and safe\", something that in Gaza \"can be done only through the United Nations, including UNRWA\". The agency was banned by Israel from operating in Occupied East Jerusalem and Israel in January over alleged links to Hamas in Gaza, which the organisation denies. Israel must \"lift the siege and allow the UN safe + unhindered access\" to deliver and distribute aid, he said, adding it was \"the only way to avert mass starvation, including among one million children,\" Mr Lazzarini said. Read more:Israel confirms Hamas chief killedLast hospital in northern Gaza out of serviceCalls for UK to offer Gaza children life-saving treatment  GHF says aid distributed 'without incident' The foundation says the private security contractors guarding its sites did not fire on the crowds, while the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions. Following Sunday's allegations, the foundation said: \"All aid was distributed today without incident. No injuries or fatalities as noted in our daily update sent out earlier. \"We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.\" In an earlier statement, the organisation said it distributed 16 truckloads of aid on Sunday. It dismissed what it referred to as \"false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos\". Meanwhile, the UN's aid system has struggled to bring in aid after Israel slightly eased its total blockade of the territory last month. Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians. Experts have warned that the Palestinian territory is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.  The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory, displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid."

An Ipsos poll said Mr Nawrocki has secured 50.7% of votes while his opponent, the Liberal pro-EU candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, has 49.3%. The late exit poll was released just hours after a previous one called the result the other way round. The first - also by Ipsos - said Mr Nawrocki was on track to receive 49.7% of the votes, with his rival on 50.3%. Both polls have margins of error of two percentage points.

He continued: \"This is truly a special moment in Poland's history. I am convinced that it will allow us to move forward and focus on the future. I will be your president.\" But Mr Nawrocki, 42, said he believed the vote would turn in his favour. \"We will win and save Poland,\" he said. \"We must win tonight.\" He had positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, aligning himself with US conservatives, including Mr Trump, and showing scepticism towards the EU. Europe correspondent The Polish election is not short of interest.  The turnout may well be the highest ever for a presidential election and it's been followed keenly around the world.  The political views of the candidates are - and apologies for the terrible pun - poles apart.  One is desperate for closer ties with Europe, greater reforms domestically and keen to extend the hand of friendship to Ukraine. The other is determined to rein in the Polish prime minister's programme of change, grow closer ties with America and stop Ukraine joining the EU. And there is very little between them.  Two exit polls predicted a result too close to call. It's also a good demonstration of how big democratic decisions can come down to slight margins. In a country with more than 28 million voters, this election could be decided by a difference of fewer than 100,000. A final result won't come until Monday - possible into the afternoon.  Normally, by that point, we know who's going to win and one candidate has already claimed victory.  So far, we don't know the outcome, and both candidates have claimed victory. This one will be tight. The vote has been closely watched in neighbouring Ukraine as well as in Russia, the European Union and the United States - and the final outcome will decide whether Poland pivots towards more liberal norms or takes a more nationalist path.

        "Content": " The FBI is investigating a targeted \"act of terrorism\" after a man used a makeshift flamethrower and petrol bombs on a pro-Israel event in Colorado. It happened as a group of people in Boulder were holding a walk to remember the Israelis still held hostage in Gaza. A 45-year-old man was arrested and the FBI said he shouted \"Free Palestine\" as the attack on Pearl Street unfolded. Six people aged 67 to 88 were injured - with some airlifted to hospital. A large part of downtown Boulder was cordoned off as sniffer dogs and the bomb squad searched for potential devices. However, police currently believe no one else was involved Police chief Steve Redfearn said the attack happened around 1.26pm on Sunday and that initial reports were that \"people were being set on fire\". He said injuries ranged from \"very serious\" to \"more minor\". \"When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns,\" Mr Redfearn told the media. Senior law enforcement officials told NBC News, Sky's US partner, that at least one person was in a critical condition. Mr Redfearn said a suspect - who the FBI named as 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman - had been taken into custody without incident. The FBI's Denver chief, Mark Michalek, said it was \"clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism\". The White House described the suspect as an \"illegal alien\" who had received a work permit under the Biden administration despite overstaying a tourist visa. Boulder's police chief said the attack happened as a \"group of pro-Israel people\" were peacefully demonstrating. Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student, described seeing four women on the ground with burns on their legs. She said one appeared badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag. \"Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'\" Ms Coffman said. A statement from Boulder's Jewish community said \"an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza\". Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser said the group who were attacked gathered weekly on Pearl Street to call for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Boulder is a university city of about 105,000 people on the northwest edge of Denver, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC two weeks ago.

        "Content": " A 16-year-old transgender athlete who is the focus of a US sports row has won two golds and a silver at the California high school track and field championship. AB Hernandez was born a boy but has transitioned and now competes against girls. And the teenager's inclusion in the girls category in the high jump, long jump and triple jump became a national conversation. Critics, including parents, conservative activists and President Trump, had called for Hernandez to be barred from competing. Who is AB Hernandez? In the city of Clovis on Saturday, she took part under a new rule change brought in by the state's interscholastic federation, under which an extra student was allowed to compete and win a medal in the events where Hernandez qualified. And it meant there were two winners when she finished first. Hernandez shared first place in the high jump with Jillene Wetteland and Lelani Laruelle. All three cleared a height of 5ft 7in (1.7m), but Hernandez had no failed attempts, while the other two had each logged one failure. Hernandez also had a first-place finish in the triple jump, sharing the top spot with Kira Gant Hatcher, who trailed her by more than half a metre. Also, Hernandez came second in the long jump with Brooke White. Plane protest During Hernandez's qualifying events on Friday, a plane flew over the stadium trailing a banner, which read: \"No boys in girls' sports.\" It was organised and paid for by two women's advocacy groups. A small protest also took place on the road outside. \"Save girls' sports,\" one poster read. \"XX does not equal XY,\" read another. Transgender inclusion is a thorny issue but a vote winner for Donald Trump, who campaigned last year with a promise to \"kick out men from women's sport\". He signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender women from female sports. And Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw federal funding from California over Hernandez's participation in this weekend's athletics event. 'Pilot entry process' The California Interscholastic Federation had earlier said it was launching a \"pilot entry process\" to allow more girls to participate in the championship. It only applied to the three events in which Hernandez competed.

If a transgender athlete wins a medal, their ranking would not displace a \"biological female\" student from also medalling, the federation confirmed, and it will be reflected in the records. The federation said the rule opens the field to more \"biological female\" athletes. The organisation did not specify how it defines \"biological female\" or how it would verify whether a competitor meets that definition."

        "Content": " Britain has \"lost control\" of its borders over the last five years, the defence secretary told Sky News after the highest number of migrants this year crossed the Channel. John Healey told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the previous Conservative government left the UK's asylum system \"in chaos\" and the country with \"record levels of immigration\", which his government is having to deal with. Politics latest: Defence secretary shares 'message' to Putin On Saturday, 1,194 migrants arrived in the UK on 18 small boats, government figures showed - the highest number of arrivals in a day so far this year (the previous record was 825 on a day in May). It brings the provisional total for 2025 so far to 14,811 - the highest ever recorded for the first five months in a year and the highest total for the first six months of the year, which was previously 13,489 on 30 June last year. 2025's total so far is 42% higher than the same point last year (10,448), and 95% up from the same point in 2023 (7,610). The highest daily total since data began in 2018 remains at 1,305 on 3 September 2022. On Saturday, French police watched on while people, including children, boarded small boats in the shallows of a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk. Authorities were then pictured escorting the boats as they sailed off towards the UK. Mr Healey said: \"Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday. \"Truth is, Britain's lost control of its borders over the last five years, and the last government last year left an asylum system in chaos and record levels of immigration.\" He said it is a \"really big problem\" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters. \"We saw the smugglers launching elsewhere and coming around like a taxi to pick them up,\" Mr Healey added. He said the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene. \"They're not doing it, but for the first time for years, for the first time, we've got the level of cooperation needed,\" Mr Healey said. \"We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.\" Read more: New weapons factories to be built 'very soon'Prison officers should have lethal weapons, Tories say Political correspondent The problem for Sir Keir Starmer – as it was for Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson - is that smashing the gangs and stopping the boats is not nearly as straightforward as the snappy slogans suggest.\n Labour came into power promising to rip up the previous government's deterrent-based approach and immediately scrapped the controversial Rwanda policy - which cost £700m and only saw four volunteers ever deported.\n Instead the PM's approach has focused on putting resources into law enforcement, giving them greater powers to tackle the smugglers - and crucially, trying to take a more collaborative approach with France.\n In February, this seemed to have borne fruit, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announcing the French authorities had agreed to change the law to allow police to intercept migrant boats after they have entered the water.\n The people smugglers' tactics are designed to take advantage of these rules – with boats operating like sea taxis rather than launching from beaches where the gendarmes would have the authority to take action.\n But clearly there's mounting frustration that this change has not yet happened.\n It's unusual to hear Labour hitting out at the French authorities, but John Healey's description of yesterday's scenes as \"shocking\" - and the police's inability to intervene as a \"really big problem\" - was far from diplomatic.\n But as the number of migrant arrivals continue to rise - and the images of packed boats continue to dominate our screens – disillusioned voters will write this off as another broken promise from their political leaders.  On Saturday, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused Labour of having \"completely lost control of our borders\". The Home Office released figures on Thursday that revealed France is intercepting fewer Channel migrants than ever before, despite signing a £480m deal with the UK to stop the crossings. This year, French police have prevented just over 38% (8,347) of asylum seekers from reaching the UK in small boats, with 13,167 having made the journey successfully. They stopped an estimated 45% last year and 47% in 2023."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n Sir Keir Starmer will pledge to buy more attack submarines and put the military on a war footing as part of a major defence review - but without making any new spending promises. The lack of extra cash meant the prime minister was coming under fire for empty rhetoric even before the blueprint for the future of the armed forces is released on Monday. Defence Secretary John Healey was forced to clarify that while he has \"no doubt\" the government will lift the defence budget to 3% of national income by 2034, he does not actually have a solid commitment from the Treasury, and this remains only an \"ambition\".  Sky News understands that the recommendations in the Strategic Defence Review, which is expected to spell out the importance of rebuilding national defence and resilience, require investment to rise by at least that amount. Defence insiders say in reality, given the scale of what they see as the threat posed by hostile states such as Russia, funding should come even faster and be higher. Donald Trump wants Washington's NATO allies to spend 5% of GDP on their armed forces, while Mark Rutte, the head of the alliance, is pushing for 3.5% by 2032. \"The real story is that Healey didn't get the money,\" one source said. \n                  Russian-linked hackers posing as journalists targeted Ministry of Defence, government says\n                 \n                  Sir Keir Starmer hails new British 'StormShroud' drones coming into operation\n                 \n                  Growing calls for UK to withdraw from treaty banning landmines\n                 A second source said there is a danger of the UK losing its leadership role in NATO if it fails to support any potential new 3.5% GDP spending target. Unusually, the government released responses from Sir Keir and the defence secretary to the review hours before the country would be given a chance to scrutinise its content. New Sky News podcast launches on 10 June - The Wargame simulates an attack by Russia to test UK defences The document, which is understood to be around 130 to 150 pages, differs from previous reviews as it has been led by external experts rather than being carried out internally. In a statement, the government said it would commit to \"a landmark shift in our deterrence and defence, moving to warfighting readiness to deter threats and strengthen security in the Euro Atlantic area\". The prime minister will also announce the UK's plans to buy \"up to\" 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines in a partnership with Australia and the US known as AUKUS. However, the only thing new about this is a bit more clarity on the size of the fleet. The previous government had already committed to starting to replace the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines by the late 2030s with AUKUS boats. \"Sort of what we already know… repackaged into an announcement,\" a defence industry source said. And the incumbent fleet is not even fully operational yet - almost 30 years after the first order was made. Britain's nuclear deterrent - carried by a different type of submarine - will also be an important focus of the review. The prime minister, for the first time, put a price tag on the cost to develop nuclear warheads for the Trident missiles that will be carried by a new fleet of nuclear-armed submarines, which are also being built. Read more on Sky News:Ukraine 'had nothing to lose'UK weapons factories 'built soon''Give prison officers lethal weapons' He said the UK is spending £15bn over this parliament on the effort. This investment, coupled with the expansion in submarine building, will support 30,000 highly-skilled jobs across the country, according to a Ministry of Defence statement. \"From the supply lines to the front lines, this government is foursquare behind the men and women upholding our nation's freedom and security,\" the prime minister is expected to say. \"National security is the foundation of my Plan for Change, and this plan will ensure Britain is secure at home and strong abroad. \"This Strategic Defence Review will ensure the UK rises to the challenge and our Armed Forces have the equipment they need that keeps us safe at home while driving greater opportunity for our engineers, shipbuilders and technicians of the future.\" James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, criticised ministers for failing to give a firm date to lift defence spending to 3% of national income. \"All of Labour's Strategic Defence Review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said. It was a sentiment echoed by the Liberal Democrats. \"Unless Labour commits to holding cross-party talks on how to reach 3% much more rapidly than the mid-2030s, this announcement risks becoming a damp squib,\" said Helen Maguire, the party's spokesperson on defence."

Politics latest: Healey questioned by Trevor Phillips No details on timings or where the factories would be were provided ahead of the publication of the government's strategic defence review, which the £6bn investment will be part of, on Monday.

There's an obvious tension between this leisurely timescale and the sabre-rattling urgency of the government's messaging.\n Writing in the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister promised to \"restore Britain's war fighting readiness\", warning \"we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces\".\n Mr Healey told Sir Trevor Phillips the idea is to send a message to Vladimir Putin that \"we take our defence seriously\".\n But he also couldn't give an exact date when the six new munitions factories would be up and running.\n The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are both calling for 3% to be reached within this parliament. But in a landscape of planned spending cuts – and with so many competing demands for money – finding any extra cash any time soon looks highly unlikely.\n Senior Conservative Robert Jenrick told Trevor Phillips he welcomed \"any extra investment in defence\" and the fact Labour had reaffirmed the UK's commitment to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence. However, he said: \"We want to see the UK reach 3% within this parliament, we think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.\" He called Mr Healey \"a good man\" who is \"doing what needs to be done in the national interest\". But he added: \"I am sceptical as to whether Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is going to make good on these promises. \"Since the general election, all I can see are broken promises from Rachel Reeves.\""

        "Content": "A new drug could stop some breast cancer tumours from using hormones to grow, a trial has found. Results from the Serena-6 trial, carried out with the Institute of Cancer Research in London, suggest that using camizestrant could help patients stay well longer and delay the need for chemotherapy. According to Cancer Research UK, the drug works by blocking oestrogen from getting into the breast cancer cell, which researchers hope can then stop or slow the growth of cancer. Breast cancer patients given the drug in the trial reduced their chances of the disease progressing by 52% compared to standard therapies. Professor Kristian Helin, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said the results \"represent more than a clinical milestone, they represent a transformational shift in how we approach precision medicine\". Co-principal investigator Professor Nick Turner also called the development of the drug \"a pivotal moment in breast cancer care\".  The study, funded by AstraZeneca, looked at patients with hormone-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer - about 70% of cases. More than 3,000 patients from 23 countries took part in phase three of the trial, which saw doctors use blood tests to detect changes in the cancer's DNA to see which treatments were ineffective. For those taking camizestrant, their cancer stabilised for around 16 months on average, compared with about nine months for other treatments. However, 1% of patients taking the new drug stopped taking it because of side effects.

The trial was also the first worldwide study to show that using blood tests to find early signs of cancer resistance to treatment helps patients. Dr Catherine Elliott, director of research at Cancer Research UK, praised the breakthrough as a \"clear example of how blood tests are starting to transform cancer treatment\". \"By tracking tiny traces of tumour DNA in the blood, researchers were able to spot early signs of treatment resistance and switch therapies before cancer had a chance to grow,\" she added. \"It shows how circulating tumour DNA, or ctDNA, could help doctors make smarter, more timely treatment decisions. \"This approach could become an important part of how we personalise care for people with advanced breast cancer.\""
