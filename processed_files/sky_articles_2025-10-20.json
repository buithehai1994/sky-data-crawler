        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  What started as a WhatsApp group for dozens of grieving families has ended up gathering enough momentum to reach Westminster. Warning: This article contains content you may find distressing. The parents and relatives of loved ones who have taken their own life following domestic abuse are angry, at a loss, but up for a fight. Sharon Holland is among those furious at how difficult it is to hold a potential perpetrator accountable for their loved ones' deaths. Her daughter, Chloe, died by suicide in 2023 after being in a controlling relationship. Chloe, 23, suffered months of torment at the hands of her former partner. At the time of his conviction, police said Chloe was a victim of a \"horrific campaign of coercive and controlling behaviour\". Two years on, Ms Holland has shared experiences and developed bonds with families who have been through the same trauma. But charges and convictions for those potentially responsible are rare. That's despite figures from the Domestic Homicide Project, funded by the Home Office and led by the National Police Chiefs' Council, showing more domestic abuse victims take their own lives in England and Wales than are killed by their partner. There were 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths in England and Wales between 2020 and 2024, of which 354 were suspected suicides compared to 332 homicides. Families at 'breaking point' Ms Holland's group are now calling for \"justice for all victims of domestic abuse-related suicides\" by bringing their campaign to Westminster today. Asked if this is a movement born out of families being at breaking point, Ms Holland said: \"Absolutely. \"All of us mums or sisters all feel the same, that we don't want this happening to someone else. It's being dragged out for years and during that time the mums are becoming more and more ill, their health is going downhill, they're stressed out all the time, on alert, and they just can't get anywhere with it. \"There's so many warnings with the police or with the NHS with various agencies that this could not end well for their daughters, and unfortunately it takes the person to die, and then we find out what the failings are.\" Families who believe there has been foul play, or know the abuse their loved ones suffered at the hands of an intimate partner contributed to them taking their own lives, say it's difficult to be taken seriously. \"The majority of them have been fighting for five years,\" Ms Holland said. \"They've been waiting for the police to get back to them or waiting for the CPS to charge. \"One lady has just waited five years, only to finally hear back from the CPS only to find out they're not going to charge. \"So that poor woman's health has gone downhill, fighting for her daughter, who she suspects was a staged suicide and got nowhere.\" 'Heartbreaking' for families Families are often fending for themselves, according to Pragna Patel, co-founder of Project Resist, a charity that supports people affected by domestic abuse and violence. She said families \"are having to navigate the system entirely on their own as they try to find out the circumstances in which their loved ones took their lives and to find out how and why this happened\". \"It's really heartbreaking to see these families knocking at the doors of the police, knocking at the door of coroners, saying: 'We know these deaths are suspicious, we know there is a history of coercive and controlling behaviour and domestic abuse behind these deaths, and we want you to investigate.' \"On the whole, families are met with a culture of indifference, apathy and ignorance. They're just not getting the attention they need.\" 'We must do more,' says minister Ms Holland and a host of other families will gather in parliament later to meet safeguarding minister Jess Phillips. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Phillips told Sky News: \"Every death linked to domestic abuse is a tragedy. We must do more to prevent them, and I will be meeting Project Resist to discuss how we can hold perpetrators to account more effectively. \"We are funding the Domestic Homicide Project to capture information on domestic abuse related deaths, including suicides, from all 43 police forces in England and Wales to improve our understanding of this issue. \"But more needs to be done. Our upcoming Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy will set out our plans to strengthen our response to all domestic abuse related deaths.\" Sky News understands there are a number of active cases being pursued by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Part of prosecutors' assessment of a case includes developing an understanding of the relationship history between the victim and a potential suspect and trying to understand the victim's state of mind before their death. But they are relying on evidence and witness statements that need to be taken in a timely manner. They say they are raising awareness through tailored training about the links between domestic abuse and suicide, so officers are better equipped to exercise \"professional curiosity\". Ahead of the campaign's launch, a spokesperson for the CPS said: \"Domestic abuse is a heinous crime and our prosecutors are actively advised to consider murder and manslaughter charges in suicide cases where there is a known context of domestic abuse or other controlling or coercive behaviour. \"We have previously charged a number of defendants for causing the death of a partner they abused, including in proceedings which are currently active. \"We are also working with police and other stakeholders to ensure these kinds of offences are well-understood - so that we can bring perpetrators to justice for the full extent of their crimes.\" 'You cannot move forward' Families so far have had to rely on the inquest to scrutinise the circumstances of their loved one's death. Chloe died two years ago and hers is yet to happen. Ms Holland: \"The way all this drags out, you cannot sit down, move forward and just grieve. You're constantly on high alert, fighting everyone, and just hoping that it'll be over soon.\" A delay for answers and further delay for grief. Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK. In the US, call the Samaritans branch in your area or 1 (800) 273-TALK"

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        A prominent expert in recovering stolen works of art has told Sky News it was \"a matter of time\" before the Louvre was targeted - and UK museums could be next. Christopher Marinello says gangs have been emboldened to strike because \"law enforcement has been driven into the ground\". And while headlines have focused on thieves making off with priceless jewellery from an iconic French institution, he warns this problem isn't confined to Paris. He said: \"There are gangs operating all over Europe and not enough is being done to stop them … this was only a matter of time, they've been hitting small museums. \"If they can hit the Louvre successfully, they can hit anything. Do you know how many museums there are in the UK?\" At the start of October, at the St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales, it took just four minutes for audacious thieves to swipe irreplaceable Bronze Age jewellery. He says gangs are targeting gold \"just to melt it down\" and diamonds for their value - \"with no regard for the integrity of the artworks and the cultural heritage that they are destroying\". A spokesperson for the museum has said: \"We sympathise deeply with our friends at the Louvre … it emphasises the increased risk to organisations like ours … this highlights the dilemma we face between having items on display for people to enjoy and learn from - or keeping them locked away.\"  Mr Marinello, who investigates art crimes that the police aren't pursuing, says institutions and stately homes urgently need to wake up to what's happening. \"They need to start building vaults for these objects because otherwise they're going to be taken and melted down and used to buy Lamborghinis or drugs,\" he warned. \"If the smaller museums can't afford it, perhaps they're going to have to consolidate collections to museums that can handle it.\" Read more:Staff 'repeatedly warned about security shortcomings''Race against time' to recover 'priceless' jewels 'You can't trust anyone' Mr Marinello went on to warn that gangs are becoming \"more brazen\" - with the Louvre targeted despite the security measures it had in place. \"The system is not working … the penalties are not strong enough … police are frustrated, prosecutors say the same thing because there's nowhere to put these people.\" The art recovery expert says he's concerned how funding cutbacks are making our museums more vulnerable to those who recognise that the obvious rewards outweigh the risks. \"These museums are designed to preserve and protect our cultural heritage, and they need to be properly funded to do that job,\" he added. \"They need to be able to stay one step ahead of the criminals.\" \"This is not the 1950s any more, you can't trust anyone. These items are so valuable, and gold is at an all-time high. \"[Thieves] don't care if an item belonged to Napoleon III, it means nothing to them. All they care about is quick cash.\""

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       Face masks, hand sanitisers and windows wide open in the height of winter. Teachers were not allowed to move around the classroom, there were bubbles for different year groups and testing kits distributed to all children and families… and the list goes on and on. These were just some of the challenges school teachers faced on a daily basis as the pandemic took hold. The valiant efforts made by school teachers and school leaders to maintain bubbles in schools simply did not matter. As soon as children were outside, they all got the bus or the train home together - allowing the virus to spread. It comes as then prime minister Boris Johnson will today give evidence to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry - specifically on the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, as part of Module 8 of the independent public hearings. Teachers constantly playing catch-up But the chaos caused by quickly changing rules and a lack of planning didn't help the situation. That summer saw A-level results calculated using an algorithm, which downgraded 40% of teacher assessments. On 13 August 2020, then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson defended the grading system. Just days later, on 17 August, he U-turned and allowed pupils to receive their teacher-assessed grades. Meanwhile, the government had two big school holidays, summer 2020 and Christmas, in which they could have installed air purifiers and implemented the sanitising of school buildings ahead of new terms beginning. Instead, we had \"Eat Out to Help Out\". On 3 January 2021, Mr Johnson said that \"schools were safe\" - as he warned of tightening restrictions in the wake of rising coronavirus cases. Just a day later, Mr Johnson announced schools would close from 5 January. Over nine million children went to school for a single day after the Christmas holidays - sharing their respective germs with their classmates. Then they went home to share them with their own families, parents and vulnerable grandparents. Teachers felt frustrated they were constantly playing catch-up, as instructions from the government changed sporadically and were often unclear, under-resourced and under-funded. Struggles of learning online Online learning was another monumental challenge for teachers. Despite being established for schools and families, many children didn't have the necessary digital access; they were sharing devices with siblings and parents who were now also having to work from home. While online learning posed its own challenges, cameras on/off, microphones on/off, children not able to join, unreliable internet connection, among other difficulties. Online lessons were particularly challenging. I recall reading A Christmas Carol to a class that were virtually unresponsive bar one or two pupils who, I think, felt sorry for me. Most, if not all, of the children's cameras were off, and many children were not interacting online. When we were back in school, I caught COVID. It was inevitable after being exposed to hundreds of children on any given day. More on this story:'Many mistakes' over school closuresEverything you need to know about inquiry Most challenging time during my entire teaching career Teachers were expected to teach online and then also make calls home to parents and children to help with any pastoral issues. And that's before trying to navigate the challenges of children whose parents had lost their jobs and were struggling to make ends meet. It was tough, having to home-school my own two children and teach online, as well as call home to ensure that the mental health and well-being of students was also addressed. I would speak to parents that were beside themselves, and didn't know how to get their children out of bed or undertake their online learning. I lost friends and family to COVID, many colleagues also found the impact on their mental health overwhelming. Teaching during COVID was by far the most challenging time during my entire teaching career, spanning over 20 years."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  If you ever fly to Washington DC, look out of the window as you land at Dulles Airport - and you might snatch a glimpse of the single biggest story in economics right now. There below you, you will see scattered around the fields and woods of the local area a set of vast warehouses that might to the untrained eye look like supermarkets or distribution centres. But no: these are in fact data centres - the biggest concentration of data centres anywhere in the world. For this area surrounding Dulles Airport has more of these buildings, housing computer servers that do the calculations to train and run artificial intelligence (AI), than anywhere else. And since AI accounts for the vast majority of economic growth in the US so far this year, that makes this place an enormous deal. Down at ground level you can see the hallmarks as you drive around what is known as \"data centre alley\". There are enormous power lines everywhere - a reminder that running these plants is an incredibly energy-intensive task. This tiny area alone, Loudoun County, consumes roughly 4.9 gigawatts of power - more than the entire consumption of Denmark. That number has already tripled in the past six years, and is due to be catapulted ever higher in the coming years. Inside 'data centre alley' We know as much because we have gained rare access into the heart of \"data centre alley\", into two sites run by Digital Realty, one of the biggest datacentre companies in the world. It runs servers that power nearly all the major AI and cloud services in the world. If you send a request to one of those models or search engines there's a good chance you've unknowingly used their machines yourself. Their Digital Dulles site, under construction right now, is due to consume up to a gigawatt in power all told, with six substations to help provide that power. Indeed, it consumes about the same amount of power as a large nuclear power plant. Walking through the site, a series of large warehouses, some already equipped with rows and rows of backup generators, there to ensure the silicon chips whirring away inside never lose power, is a striking experience - a reminder of the physical underpinnings of the AI age. For all that this technology feels weightless, it has enormous physical demands. It entails the construction of these massive concrete buildings, each of which needs enormous amounts of power and water to keep the servers cool. Read more from Ed Conway:Blow to UK's bid to become minerals superpowerThere's more to your AirPods than meets the eye We were given access inside one of the company's existing server centres - behind multiple security cordons into rooms only accessible with fingerprint identification. And there we saw the infrastructure necessary to keep those AI chips running. We saw an Nvidia DGX H100 running away, in a server rack capable of sucking in more power than a small village. We saw the cooling pipes running in and out of the building, as well as the ones which feed coolant into the GPUs (graphic processing units) themselves. Such things underline that to the extent that AI has brainpower, it is provided not out of thin air, but via very physical amenities and infrastructure. And the availability of that infrastructure is one of the main limiting factors for this economic boom in the coming years. According to economist Jason Furman, once you subtract AI and related technologies, the US economy barely grew at all in the first half of this year. So much is riding on this. But there are some who question whether the US is going to be able to construct power plants quickly enough to fuel this boom.  For years, American power consumption remained more or less flat. That has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. Now, AI companies have made grand promises about future computing power, but that depends on being able to plug those chips into the grid. Last week the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned AI could indeed be a financial bubble. He said: \"There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. It was the internet then… it is AI now. We're seeing surging valuations, booming investment and strong consumption on the back of solid capital gains. The risk is that with stronger investment and consumption, a tighter monetary policy will be needed to contain price pressures. This is what happened in the late 1990s.\" 'The terrifying thing is…' For those inside the AI world, this also feels like uncharted territory. Helen Toner, executive director of Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and formerly on the OpenAI board, said: \"The terrifying thing is: no one knows how much further AI is going to go, and no one really knows how much economic growth is going to come out of it. \"The trends have certainly been that the AI systems we are developing get more and more sophisticated over time, and I don't see signs of that stopping. I think they'll keep getting more advanced. But the question of how much productivity growth will that create? How will that compare to the absolutely gobsmacking investments that are being made today?\" Whether it's a new industrial revolution or a bubble - or both - there's no denying AI is a massive economic story with massive implications. For energy. For materials. For jobs. We just don't know how massive yet."

        "Content": "Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will not be able to buy tickets to their away match against Aston Villa next month, the Israeli club have said. The decision comes regardless of whether a supporter ban imposed by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) is overturned. In a statement, Maccabi said: \"The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context.\" Supporters of the Israeli side had been told last week they would not be allowed to go to November's game because of Birmingham SAG's concerns over fan safety.  After an outcry, the UK government said on Friday it was exploring what \"additional resources and support are required\" to allow \"all fans\" to attend. But now the Tel Aviv side won't sell their supporters any tickets. A government spokesperson said they were \"deeply saddened\" that the club had turned down their allocated tickets, but respected their right to do so. They added: \"The government has been working around the clock to defend a basic principle - that football fans should be able to enjoy a game without fear of intimidation or violence. \"It is completely unacceptable that this game has been weaponised to stoke violence and fear by those who seek to divide us.\" \"We will never tolerate antisemitism or extremism on our streets. We will continue to work closely with the police to ensure that this game goes ahead safely, and that Jewish communities across this country get the safety and security they deserve.\" Explainer: Why are Maccabi Tel Aviv fans banned from Aston Villa match? Maccabi Tel Aviv said on Monday evening the club believed \"football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart\" and that they had \"been working tirelessly to stamp out racism within the more extreme elements of our fan base\". However, they added: \"Unfortunately those issues are not restricted to Israeli football, and they are problems the sport has been grappling worldwide including in the UK.\" On Sunday night,  \"violent riots\" led to Maccabi's match against local rival Hapoel in Tel Aviv being cancelled. Nine people were arrested at the Maccabi Bloomfield Stadium, a venue shared by both clubs. Hapoel were the home team for the game. But Maccabi's statement said it was not due to their fans. The club's statement said: \"It is clear, that various entrenched groups seek to malign the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan base, most of whom have no truck with racism or hooliganism of any kind, and are exploiting isolated incidents for their own social and political ends. \"The latest example is by people who have rushed to attribute to our fans the decision of the Tel Aviv police to cancel our derby match yesterday. It was not.\"  Uproar The original decision to stop Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham caused uproar. The SAG - made up of local stakeholders, including representatives from the council, police and event organisers - said its decision was due to a high risk of violence based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\". Read more from Sky News:Maccabi ban could be reversedAnalysis: Ban raises serious questions The announcement, supported by West Midlands Police, was based partly on the violent clashes that occurred around the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam. But, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"the wrong decision\", and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said it was a \"national disgrace\". West Midlands Police said it had classified the Aston Villa v Maccabi Tel Aviv fixture as high risk based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\". Maccabi argued their fans regularly travelled all over Europe \"without incident\" and added that to \"suggest that the reason our fans cannot be allowed to travel is due to their behaviour, is an attempt to distort reality and to excuse the real underlying reasons for the decision to ban our fans\"."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK is ready to spend \"well over\" £100m on a possible deployment of British forces to Ukraine if Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, the defence secretary has said. John Healey also said Vladimir Putin views Britain as his \"number one enemy\" because of the country's support for Ukraine. The defence secretary's plan includes the preparation of military personnel to join a multinational force that would be sent to help secure Ukraine's borders if the US president brokers a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. He signalled British troops could be ready to deploy as soon as that happened and he said this could include soldiers on the ground. Some of the anticipated money to prepare for any mission is already being spent. The defence secretary also warned of a \"new era of threat\" and said the risk of wider conflict in Europe has not been as great since the end of the Second World War. Mr Healey used a lecture at Mansion House in London to talk about efforts led by the UK and France to build a \"coalition of the willing\" of more than 30 nations to form what he called a \"Multinational Force Ukraine\" over the past six months. This force would help to secure Ukraine's skies and seas and train its troops if Russia agrees to halt its full-scale war. \"So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,\" the defence secretary said. \"For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine.\" Asked how much money, he said it would be \"well over\" £100m. Mr Healey trumpeted the UK's support for Ukraine, including a record £4.5bn in assistance this year, and taking over from the United States in co-chairing a wider group of nations that have been sending weapons and money to Kyiv. \"This is why President [Volodymyr]  Zelenskyy calls the UK his closest ally,\" he said. \"This is why Putin ranks Britain as his number one enemy.\" But he warned that as Russia's aggression grew in Ukraine and beyond its borders, \"Britain and our NATO allies stand more unified, and stronger\". Read more:'Ukraine can't win war,' says TrumpUK military to be given powers to shoot down threatening dronesPutin has 'sent signal to Trump that he's ready for Ukraine deal' Giving a stark verdict of the security landscape, Mr Healey said: \"This is - undeniably - a new era of threat. The world is more unstable, more uncertain, more dangerous. Not since the end of the Second World War has Europe's security been at such risk of state-on-state conflict.\" He said this required what he described as \"a new era for defence\". He said: \"This is now an age for hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.\" The defence secretary said plans for the new era would include increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 - though critics have accused the UK and other European allies of playing smoke and mirrors with the target, questioning how much will really be spent on weapons and troops. \"As I look ahead to the rest of this decade, our task, in this new age of hard power is to secure peace in our continent and to forge stronger deterrence and resilience, a New Deal for European security,\" said Mr Healey. Turning to the Middle East, he also announced the UK was sending a two-star military officer to work as the deputy to the US commander, charged with monitoring the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."

        "Content": " Nicholas Rossi, an American man who faked his death and fled to Scotland to escape rape charges, has been jailed for at least five years. The sentence handed down to the 38-year-old is the first of two he faces after being convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in 2008. Utah has \"indeterminate sentencing\" - meaning jail terms handed down are in a range of years rather than a fixed number, with release dates set by the state's parole board. During August's three-day trial, Rossi's accuser and her parents took the stand - with the victim telling the court that he left a \"trail of fear, pain, and destruction\" behind him. \"This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,\" she said. Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, alleged Rossi \"uses rape to control women\" and posed a risk to community safety. Rossi - whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian - maintained his innocence during the sentencing hearing. In a soft, raspy voice, he said: \"I am not guilty of this. These women are lying.\" He was first identified in 2018 after a decade-old DNA rape kit was examined. How Rossi was caught But in February 2020 - months after he was charged in one of the cases - an online obituary claimed he had died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rossi was arrested in Scotland the following year while being treated for COVID, after hospital staff recognised his distinctive tattoos - including the crest of a university he never attended. A protracted court battle meant he wasn't extradited until January 2024, with Rossi claiming he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators identified at least a dozen aliases that he had used to evade capture over the years.

They began dating and were engaged within a couple of weeks - and according to her testimony, Rossi had asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him money, and take on debt for their rings. She told the court that Rossi raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home - and went to police years later after discovering that another woman in Utah had come forward with accusations. Rossi is due to be sentenced for the second conviction in November."

        "Content": " Six months after Virginia Giuffre's death, her posthumous memoir will be published on Tuesday - detailing alleged sexual encounters with Prince Andrew. In Nobody's Girl, Ms Giuffre writes about three alleged sexual encounters with the prince - who gave up his titles last week after mounting pressure over his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, and his links to an alleged Chinese spy. Andrew has always vigorously denied all the accusations against him. Ms Giuffre also recounts harrowing details of being manipulated by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, told her co-writer Amy Wallace weeks before her death that it was her \"heartfelt wish\" for the book to be published even in the event of her death. Here are the key claims Ms Giuffre makes in the memoir. Warning: This article contains details some may find distressing 'I believed I might die a sex slave' At the beginning of the memoir, Ms Giuffre writes about her battle to escape the control of Epstein and Maxwell. \"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied. \"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\" Epstein took his own life in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was jailed for recruiting young girls for Epstein. Giuffre and Andrew's alleged first meeting Ms Giuffre wrote that on the day she allegedly met Andrew in 2001, Maxwell told her \"just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince\". She added that when she met Andrew, he correctly guessed she was 17 and told her: \"My daughters are just a little younger than you.\" Ms Giuffre wrote in her memoir about visiting a nightclub with Andrew: \"He was sort of a bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely.\" That claim was strongly denied by Andrew, who said in a 2019 Newsnight interview that he suffered from a condition which meant he was unable to sweat. When they returned to the house, Ms Giuffre said she ran Andrew a bath before they had sex, saying \"he seemed in a rush to have intercourse\". \"Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.\" Ms Giuffre added: \"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun'.\" She described the prince as \"friendly enough, but still entitled\" adding: \"As if he believed having sex with me was his birthright\". She wrote Epstein paid her $15,000 for \"servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy'\". In the Newsnight interview, Andrew said he had \"no recollection whatsoever\" of meeting Ms Giuffre. He said the alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen because he had spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party. Read more: Everything we know about Andrew losing titles 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Two other alleged sexual encounters The memoir also describes two other alleged sexual encounters with the prince, including in New York a month later and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands when she was around 18. The extract describes the latter as an \"orgy\" with Epstein and \"approximately eight other young girls\" who \"appeared to be under the age of 18\" who \"didn't really speak English\". 'My mum would never forgive me... if I didn't pose for a picture' Ms Giuffre was keen to take a photograph of the first time she allegedly met Andrew. That image, showing him with his arm around Giuffre, has become infamous. Andrew later claimed the picture had been doctored. Ms Giuffre said she remembered running for her \"Kodak FunSaver\" camera - adding that \"my mum would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture\". Central Park photo spurred Giuffre to go public Recalling the moment in 2011 when she decided to go public with claims about Prince Andrew, Ms Giuffre wrote it was prompted by the photograph of Epstein and Andrew walking in Central Park, two years after Epstein was jailed for procuring underage girls in Florida. \"It seemed that being a sex offender has not eroded Epstein's social cachet one bit,\" Ms Giuffre wrote. \"The two-one punch of the photo in Central Park and the details of that A-list part knocked me off the fence I'd been straddling. I told Churcher I'd go on the record.\" Journalist Sharon Churcher had been in contact with Ms Giuffre since 2011, the memoir claims. Her first article, based on the pair's interviews, was published in the Mail On Sunday in February of that year. The article did not mention Andrew by name, but claimed Ms Giuffre had been trafficked to \"royalty\" by Epstein. Prince Andrew's 'team' tried to hire 'internet trolls' In February 2022 it was announced that Andrew paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a civil sexual assault case, despite claiming never to have met her. Writing about the settlement, Ms Giuffre claims a \"team\" working for the prince had gone as far as trying to hire \"internet trolls to hassle\" her. \"After casting doubt on my credibility for so long - Prince Andrew's team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me - the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.\" She adds: \"We would never get a confession, of course. That's what settlements are designed to avoid. But we were trying for the next best thing: a general acknowledgment of what I'd been through.\" Read more:Andrew allegations should be examined in 'fullest ways' Giuffre wanted to use 'Crown's money to do some good' The memoir does not divulge how much Ms Giuffre was paid in the settlement, but refers to reports \"that his mother, the Queen of England, had footed the bill\". \"I look forward to disseminating some of the Crown's money to do some good,\" she wrote. She adds: \"Now that my settlement from Prince Andrew has come through, I have begun the slow process of turning my fledgling foundation, Soar, into a professionally run organisation. \"My goal is for Soar to combat human trafficking by supporting organisations that focus on prosecution, protection, and prevention.\" Ms Giuffre said she wanted to make it easier for members of the public to detect trafficking and to support victims' recovery, by issuing grants. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the book and say they do not act for Prince Andrew as a non-working royal."

Asked about the conflict by a journalist during a visit to the White House by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, the Mr Trump responded bluntly: \"I don't think they will,\" before adding: \"They could still win it, I never said they would win it... War is a very strange thing, a lot of bad things happen.\" It is a marked change from his comments a few weeks ago at a UN gathering in New York where he said Ukraine could retake \"all of its territory\". And it comes after the Financial Times claimed the behind-the-scenes of Mr Trump and President Zelenskyy's meeting in Washington on Friday had descended into a \"shouting match\". According to the paper, the US president repeatedly told his Ukrainian counterpart to accept Vladimir Putin's terms for ending the war - warning him that the Russian leader would \"destroy\" Ukraine if it did not agree. Mr Zelenskyy later attempted to pour water over the suggestions, saying their meeting was \"positive\" and that Ukraine was preparing a contract to buy 25 Patriot air defence systems as a result of their talks. However, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles he had wanted for Ukraine.

Also on Monday, French president Emmanuel Macron announced there will be a meeting of the coalition of the willing in London on Friday which Mr Zelenskyy will attend.

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n  A security worker at the Louvre has told Sky News that \"obsolete\" equipment and a \"drastic cut in staff\" meant they had \"reached the limit\" of what they could do to protect the world-famous museum. Elise Muller, who patrols rooms inside the former palace, said she is \"enraged\" by Sunday's jewellery heist and that security shortcomings have long been highlighted. She said: \"We have raised the alarm through our union, and our colleagues have all repeatedly warned about the difficulties we face every day at work; equipment being in poor condition, sometimes even completely obsolete, coupled with a very drastic cut in staff. \"We inevitably reached the limit of what we could do to secure the building and its collections.\"  A day after the brazen daylight robbery, the doors of Louvre remained closed. Disappointed visitors were turned away as police continued to hunt the gang that robbed one of the world's most famous museums. \"You can't imagine it. You see it in the movies. It was very well thought out, and this is something that happened in minutes,\" Luis from Mexico told me. \"I'm really disappointed, it was a once-in-a-lifetime to come see it and now I'm not going to get to see it because the robbery is a once-in-a-lifetime too,\" added Cathy from Florida. Read more:All we know about 'theft of the decade''Race against time' as police try to recover 'priceless' jewels It was around 9.30am on Sunday when thieves used a motorised ladder to access the first floor of the Louvre. They then smashed through the window and entered the Apollo gallery which houses the jewels belonging to Napoleon and French regents. Inside, they grabbed treasures including necklaces, earrings, and a tiara and then fled on scooters after dropping a crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. The prosecutor told French media the audacious heist is likely the work of an organised criminal group possibly stealing for a collector. But it's a crime that's outraged many in France who wonder, how could this happen? In a radio interview, justice minister Gerald Darmanin said France had failed - questioning why the museum's windows weren't secure and how the thieves could break in on a busy road. Police are now desperately trying to track down the culprits before the treasures are lost. Alexandre Giquello auctions precious antiques. He said the robbers will need to shift the jewels quickly, and because they're so famous they won't be able to sell them as whole pieces on the black market. He said: \"If you want to take something like this you have to destroy it - chop up the stones, melt the gold and that's the disaster of this.\" We contacted the Louvre about the concerns Ms Muller raised but a spokesperson said they would not be making a comment. In a statement on Sunday, the Culture Ministry highlighted that a new master security plan is being implemented as part of the \"New Renaissance project\" announced by President Emmanuel Macron in January. It includes upgraded security measures with next generation cameras, perimeter detection systems, and a new security control centre. But that all takes time, and catching the thieves who broke into the Louvre is now about more than just solving a crime, it's about saving national treasures and France's reputation."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @ashnahurynag\n  What started as a WhatsApp group for dozens of grieving families has ended up gathering enough momentum to reach Westminster. Warning: This article contains content you may find distressing. The parents and relatives of loved ones who have taken their own life following domestic abuse are angry, at a loss, but up for a fight. Sharon Holland is among those furious at how difficult it is to hold a potential perpetrator accountable for their loved ones' deaths. Her daughter, Chloe, died by suicide in 2023 after being in a controlling relationship. Chloe, 23, suffered months of torment at the hands of her former partner. At the time of his conviction, police said Chloe was a victim of a \"horrific campaign of coercive and controlling behaviour\". Two years on, Ms Holland has shared experiences and developed bonds with families who have been through the same trauma. But charges and convictions for those potentially responsible are rare. That's despite figures from the Domestic Homicide Project, funded by the Home Office and led by the National Police Chiefs' Council, showing more domestic abuse victims take their own lives in England and Wales than are killed by their partner. There were 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths in England and Wales between 2020 and 2024, of which 354 were suspected suicides compared to 332 homicides. Families at 'breaking point' Ms Holland's group are now calling for \"justice for all victims of domestic abuse-related suicides\" by bringing their campaign to Westminster today. Asked if this is a movement born out of families being at breaking point, Ms Holland said: \"Absolutely. \"All of us mums or sisters all feel the same, that we don't want this happening to someone else. It's being dragged out for years and during that time the mums are becoming more and more ill, their health is going downhill, they're stressed out all the time, on alert, and they just can't get anywhere with it. \"There's so many warnings with the police or with the NHS with various agencies that this could not end well for their daughters, and unfortunately it takes the person to die, and then we find out what the failings are.\" Families who believe there has been foul play, or know the abuse their loved ones suffered at the hands of an intimate partner contributed to them taking their own lives, say it's difficult to be taken seriously. \"The majority of them have been fighting for five years,\" Ms Holland said. \"They've been waiting for the police to get back to them or waiting for the CPS to charge. \"One lady has just waited five years, only to finally hear back from the CPS only to find out they're not going to charge. \"So that poor woman's health has gone downhill, fighting for her daughter, who she suspects was a staged suicide and got nowhere.\" 'Heartbreaking' for families Families are often fending for themselves, according to Pragna Patel, co-founder of Project Resist, a charity that supports people affected by domestic abuse and violence. She said families \"are having to navigate the system entirely on their own as they try to find out the circumstances in which their loved ones took their lives and to find out how and why this happened\". \"It's really heartbreaking to see these families knocking at the doors of the police, knocking at the door of coroners, saying: 'We know these deaths are suspicious, we know there is a history of coercive and controlling behaviour and domestic abuse behind these deaths, and we want you to investigate.' \"On the whole, families are met with a culture of indifference, apathy and ignorance. They're just not getting the attention they need.\" 'We must do more,' says minister Ms Holland and a host of other families will gather in parliament later to meet safeguarding minister Jess Phillips. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Phillips told Sky News: \"Every death linked to domestic abuse is a tragedy. We must do more to prevent them, and I will be meeting Project Resist to discuss how we can hold perpetrators to account more effectively. \"We are funding the Domestic Homicide Project to capture information on domestic abuse related deaths, including suicides, from all 43 police forces in England and Wales to improve our understanding of this issue. \"But more needs to be done. Our upcoming Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy will set out our plans to strengthen our response to all domestic abuse related deaths.\" Sky News understands there are a number of active cases being pursued by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Part of prosecutors' assessment of a case includes developing an understanding of the relationship history between the victim and a potential suspect and trying to understand the victim's state of mind before their death. But they are relying on evidence and witness statements that need to be taken in a timely manner. They say they are raising awareness through tailored training about the links between domestic abuse and suicide, so officers are better equipped to exercise \"professional curiosity\". Ahead of the campaign's launch, a spokesperson for the CPS said: \"Domestic abuse is a heinous crime and our prosecutors are actively advised to consider murder and manslaughter charges in suicide cases where there is a known context of domestic abuse or other controlling or coercive behaviour. \"We have previously charged a number of defendants for causing the death of a partner they abused, including in proceedings which are currently active. \"We are also working with police and other stakeholders to ensure these kinds of offences are well-understood - so that we can bring perpetrators to justice for the full extent of their crimes.\" 'You cannot move forward' Families so far have had to rely on the inquest to scrutinise the circumstances of their loved one's death. Chloe died two years ago and hers is yet to happen. Ms Holland: \"The way all this drags out, you cannot sit down, move forward and just grieve. You're constantly on high alert, fighting everyone, and just hoping that it'll be over soon.\" A delay for answers and further delay for grief.

Christopher Marinello says gangs have been emboldened to strike because \"law enforcement has been driven into the ground\". And while headlines have focused on thieves making off with priceless jewellery from an iconic French institution, he warns this problem isn't confined to Paris. He said: \"There are gangs operating all over Europe and not enough is being done to stop them … this was only a matter of time, they've been hitting small museums. \"If they can hit the Louvre successfully, they can hit anything. Do you know how many museums there are in the UK?\" At the start of October, at the St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales, it took just four minutes for audacious thieves to swipe irreplaceable Bronze Age jewellery. He says gangs are targeting gold \"just to melt it down\" and diamonds for their value - \"with no regard for the integrity of the artworks and the cultural heritage that they are destroying\". A spokesperson for the museum has said: \"We sympathise deeply with our friends at the Louvre … it emphasises the increased risk to organisations like ours … this highlights the dilemma we face between having items on display for people to enjoy and learn from - or keeping them locked away.\"  Mr Marinello, who investigates art crimes that the police aren't pursuing, says institutions and stately homes urgently need to wake up to what's happening. \"They need to start building vaults for these objects because otherwise they're going to be taken and melted down and used to buy Lamborghinis or drugs,\" he warned. \"If the smaller museums can't afford it, perhaps they're going to have to consolidate collections to museums that can handle it.\" Read more:Staff 'repeatedly warned about security shortcomings''Race against time' to recover 'priceless' jewels 'You can't trust anyone' Mr Marinello went on to warn that gangs are becoming \"more brazen\" - with the Louvre targeted despite the security measures it had in place. \"The system is not working … the penalties are not strong enough … police are frustrated, prosecutors say the same thing because there's nowhere to put these people.\" The art recovery expert says he's concerned how funding cutbacks are making our museums more vulnerable to those who recognise that the obvious rewards outweigh the risks. \"These museums are designed to preserve and protect our cultural heritage, and they need to be properly funded to do that job,\" he added. \"They need to be able to stay one step ahead of the criminals.\" \"This is not the 1950s any more, you can't trust anyone. These items are so valuable, and gold is at an all-time high. \"[Thieves] don't care if an item belonged to Napoleon III, it means nothing to them. All they care about is quick cash.\""

Teachers were not allowed to move around the classroom, there were bubbles for different year groups and testing kits distributed to all children and families… and the list goes on and on. These were just some of the challenges school teachers faced on a daily basis as the pandemic took hold. The valiant efforts made by school teachers and school leaders to maintain bubbles in schools simply did not matter. As soon as children were outside, they all got the bus or the train home together - allowing the virus to spread. It comes as then prime minister Boris Johnson will today give evidence to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry - specifically on the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, as part of Module 8 of the independent public hearings.

On 13 August 2020, then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson defended the grading system. Just days later, on 17 August, he U-turned and allowed pupils to receive their teacher-assessed grades. Meanwhile, the government had two big school holidays, summer 2020 and Christmas, in which they could have installed air purifiers and implemented the sanitising of school buildings ahead of new terms beginning. Instead, we had \"Eat Out to Help Out\". On 3 January 2021, Mr Johnson said that \"schools were safe\" - as he warned of tightening restrictions in the wake of rising coronavirus cases. Just a day later, Mr Johnson announced schools would close from 5 January. Over nine million children went to school for a single day after the Christmas holidays - sharing their respective germs with their classmates. Then they went home to share them with their own families, parents and vulnerable grandparents. Teachers felt frustrated they were constantly playing catch-up, as instructions from the government changed sporadically and were often unclear, under-resourced and under-funded. Struggles of learning online Online learning was another monumental challenge for teachers. Despite being established for schools and families, many children didn't have the necessary digital access; they were sharing devices with siblings and parents who were now also having to work from home. While online learning posed its own challenges, cameras on/off, microphones on/off, children not able to join, unreliable internet connection, among other difficulties. Online lessons were particularly challenging. I recall reading A Christmas Carol to a class that were virtually unresponsive bar one or two pupils who, I think, felt sorry for me. Most, if not all, of the children's cameras were off, and many children were not interacting online. When we were back in school, I caught COVID. It was inevitable after being exposed to hundreds of children on any given day. More on this story:'Many mistakes' over school closuresEverything you need to know about inquiry Most challenging time during my entire teaching career Teachers were expected to teach online and then also make calls home to parents and children to help with any pastoral issues. And that's before trying to navigate the challenges of children whose parents had lost their jobs and were struggling to make ends meet. It was tough, having to home-school my own two children and teach online, as well as call home to ensure that the mental health and well-being of students was also addressed. I would speak to parents that were beside themselves, and didn't know how to get their children out of bed or undertake their online learning. I lost friends and family to COVID, many colleagues also found the impact on their mental health overwhelming. Teaching during COVID was by far the most challenging time during my entire teaching career, spanning over 20 years."

        "Content": "Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will not be able to buy tickets to their away match against Aston Villa next month, the Israeli club have said. The decision comes regardless of whether a supporter ban imposed by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) is overturned. In a statement, Maccabi said: \"The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context.\" Supporters of the Israeli side had been told last week they would not be allowed to go to November's game because of Birmingham SAG's concerns over fan safety.  After an outcry, the UK government said on Friday it was exploring what \"additional resources and support are required\" to allow \"all fans\" to attend. But now the Tel Aviv side won't sell their supporters any tickets. A government spokesperson said they were \"deeply saddened\" that the club had turned down their allocated tickets, but respected their right to do so. They added: \"The government has been working around the clock to defend a basic principle - that football fans should be able to enjoy a game without fear of intimidation or violence. \"It is completely unacceptable that this game has been weaponised to stoke violence and fear by those who seek to divide us.\" \"We will never tolerate antisemitism or extremism on our streets. We will continue to work closely with the police to ensure that this game goes ahead safely, and that Jewish communities across this country get the safety and security they deserve.\" Explainer: Why are Maccabi Tel Aviv fans banned from Aston Villa match? Maccabi Tel Aviv said on Monday evening the club believed \"football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart\" and that they had \"been working tirelessly to stamp out racism within the more extreme elements of our fan base\". However, they added: \"Unfortunately those issues are not restricted to Israeli football, and they are problems the sport has been grappling worldwide including in the UK.\" On Sunday night,  \"violent riots\" led to Maccabi's match against local rival Hapoel in Tel Aviv being cancelled. Nine people were arrested at the Maccabi Bloomfield Stadium, a venue shared by both clubs. Hapoel were the home team for the game. But Maccabi's statement said it was not due to their fans. The club's statement said: \"It is clear, that various entrenched groups seek to malign the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan base, most of whom have no truck with racism or hooliganism of any kind, and are exploiting isolated incidents for their own social and political ends. \"The latest example is by people who have rushed to attribute to our fans the decision of the Tel Aviv police to cancel our derby match yesterday. It was not.\"  Uproar The original decision to stop Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham caused uproar. The SAG - made up of local stakeholders, including representatives from the council, police and event organisers - said its decision was due to a high risk of violence based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\". Read more from Sky News:Maccabi ban could be reversedAnalysis: Ban raises serious questions The announcement, supported by West Midlands Police, was based partly on the violent clashes that occurred around the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam. But, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"the wrong decision\", and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said it was a \"national disgrace\". West Midlands Police said it had classified the Aston Villa v Maccabi Tel Aviv fixture as high risk based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents\". Maccabi argued their fans regularly travelled all over Europe \"without incident\" and added that to \"suggest that the reason our fans cannot be allowed to travel is due to their behaviour, is an attempt to distort reality and to excuse the real underlying reasons for the decision to ban our fans\"."

        "Content": " Metropolitan Police is to stop investigating \"non-crime hate incidents\" to \"reduce ambiguity\" after prosecutors dropped a case against Graham Linehan. Linehan, 57, will face no further action after being arrested over his social media posts about transgender people. The Father Ted and IT Crowd creator said his lawyers had been told the case wouldn't proceed. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed the move. Linehan, 57, was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence when he landed at Heathrow from his home in the US on 1 September. The incident drew criticism of the police and government from some politicians and free-speech campaigners. Met Police said today it would stop investigating \"non-crime hate incidents\" to \"reduce ambiguity\" and \"provide clearer direction for officers\". Posting on X, Linehan announced : \"After a successful hearing to get my bail conditions lifted (one which the police officer in charge of the case didn't even bother to attend) the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped the case. \n                  Graham Linehan says satire is 'dying' and that he wouldn't be able to make Father Ted today\n                 \n                  Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan's trial begins after allegation he harassed transgender activist\n                 \n                  Graham Linehan and cancel culture: Is comedy becoming bland?\n                 \"With the aid of the Free Speech Union, I still aim to hold the police accountable for what is only the latest attempt to silence and suppress gender critical voices on behalf of dangerous and disturbed men.\" The union said it had hired a \"top flight team of lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest, among other things\". \"The police need to be taught a lesson that they cannot allow themselves to be continually manipulated by woke activists,\" it added. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson confirmed it had reviewed the case file and decided \"no further action\" would be taken. In one of his posts, Linehan wrote: \"If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.\" Another was a photo of a trans-rights protest, with the comment \"a photo you can smell\", and a follow-up post saying: \"I hate them. Misogynists and homophobes. F*** em\". A Met Police statement after the case was dropped acknowledged \"concern\" around Linehan's arrest. It added: \"The commissioner has been clear he doesn't believe officers should be policing toxic culture war debates, with current laws and rules on inciting violence online leaving them in an impossible position. \"As a result, the Met will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents. \"We believe this will provide clearer direction for officers, reduce ambiguity and enable them to focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations.\" A non-crime hate incident (NCHI) involves an act perceived to be motivated - wholly or partly - by hostility or prejudice towards someone over a particular characteristic, such as their race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or transgender identity. They can often take the form of abusive or insulting social media activity which doesn't meet the threshold for a crime. For example, there is no physical threat to someone, or an incitement to harm them. For something to be a hate crime, it has to be an actual offence - such as an assault, vandalism, harassment, or threats - motivated by prejudice against someone with one of the characteristics listed above. The Home Office advises a \"common sense\" and proportionate approach to police recording an NCHI. It says \"even where the speech is potentially offensive, a person has the right to express personally held views in a lawful manner\" - including through controversial humour and satire. An NCHI should only be recorded against someone if it will mitigate a real risk of significant harm in the future, or of a criminal offence being committed. Linehan said on his blog that he was arrested by five armed officers and had to go to A&E after his blood pressure reached \"stroke territory\" during his interrogation. Police said the officers' guns were never drawn and were only present as Linehan was detained by the aviation unit, which routinely carries firearms.

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK is ready to spend \"well over\" £100m on a possible deployment of British forces to Ukraine if Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, the defence secretary has said. John Healey also said Vladimir Putin views Britain as his \"number one enemy\" because of the country's support for Ukraine. The defence secretary's plan includes the preparation of military personnel to join a multinational force that would be sent to help secure Ukraine's borders if the US president brokers a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. He signalled British troops could be ready to deploy as soon as that happened and he said this could include soldiers on the ground. Some of the anticipated money to prepare for any mission is already being spent. The defence secretary also warned of a \"new era of threat\" and said the risk of wider conflict in Europe has not been as great since the end of the Second World War. Mr Healey used a lecture at Mansion House in London to talk about efforts led by the UK and France to build a \"coalition of the willing\" of more than 30 nations to form what he called a \"Multinational Force Ukraine\" over the past six months. This force would help to secure Ukraine's skies and seas and train its troops if Russia agrees to halt its full-scale war. \"So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,\" the defence secretary said. \"For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine.\" Asked how much money, he said it would be \"well over\" £100m. Mr Healey trumpeted the UK's support for Ukraine, including a record £4.5bn in assistance this year, and taking over from the United States in co-chairing a wider group of nations that have been sending weapons and money to Kyiv. \"This is why President [Volodymyr]  Zelenskyy calls the UK his closest ally,\" he said. \"This is why Putin ranks Britain as his number one enemy.\" But he warned that as Russia's aggression grew in Ukraine and beyond its borders, \"Britain and our NATO allies stand more unified, and stronger\". Read more:'Ukraine can't win war,' says TrumpUK military to be given powers to shoot down threatening dronesPutin has 'sent signal to Trump that he's ready for Ukraine deal' Giving a stark verdict of the security landscape, Mr Healey said: \"This is - undeniably - a new era of threat. The world is more unstable, more uncertain, more dangerous. Not since the end of the Second World War has Europe's security been at such risk of state-on-state conflict.\" He said this required what he described as \"a new era for defence\". He said: \"This is now an age for hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.\" The defence secretary said plans for the new era would include increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 - though critics have accused the UK and other European allies of playing smoke and mirrors with the target, questioning how much will really be spent on weapons and troops. \"As I look ahead to the rest of this decade, our task, in this new age of hard power is to secure peace in our continent and to forge stronger deterrence and resilience, a New Deal for European security,\" said Mr Healey. Turning to the Middle East, he also announced the UK was sending a two-star military officer to work as the deputy to the US commander, charged with monitoring the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."

        "Headline": "After more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online by early evening - but Amazon Web Services did not say when the issue would be fully resolved. ",
        "Content": "Dozens of websites, banks and apps have been affected by a major internet outage.  The problem, which started on Monday morning, is related to an issue at Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of 5pm (UK time), there were more than 9,300 reports of the Amazon Web Services outage, according to Downdetector, which monitors issues and outages in real-time. After more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online by early evening, but AWS said it was still working on recovering connectivity. Just before midday, AWS said it had fixed the underlying problem, but said it had a backlog the system would need to deal with. Here's what we know so far. What has been affected? Multiple banks, the UK's Government Gateway services - which is accessed through the Gov.uk website and includes things like HMRC, universal credit and pensions - mobile phone networks and video-chatting platform Zoom are among the websites that reported technical issues. A UK government spokesperson said: \"We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\" A Lloyds Bank spokesperson also apologised for issues affecting customers, adding: \"We are seeing services coming back online and continue to work to see that happens as quickly as possible.\" All Amazon products - including Prime Video, Alexa and Amazon Music - have also been affected, as well as the main Amazon website. According to Downdetector, around 50 outlets have been, or still are, affected. Here's a full list: • Amazon• Amazon Alexa• Amazon Music• Amazon Prime Video• Amazon Web Services• Ancestry• Asana• Atlassian• Bank Of Scotland• Blink Security• BT• Canva• Clash Of Clans• Clash Royale• Coinbase• Dead By Daylight• Duolingo• EE• Epic Games Store• Eventbrite• Flickr• Fortnite• Government Gateway services (including HMRC)• Halifax• Hargreaves Lansdown• Hay Day• Hinge• HMRC• IMDB• Jira Software• Just Eat• Life360• Lloyds Bank• Microsoft 365• My Fitness Pal• Ocado• Peloton• Perplexity AI• Playstation Network• Pokemon Go• Rainbow Six• Reddit• Ring• Roblox• Rocket League• Signal• Sky Mobile• Slack• Smartsheet• Snapchat• Strava• Square• Tidal• WhatsApp• Wordle• Xero• Zoom What has AWS said? AWS confirmed it was suffering from \"increased error rates and latencies\" for multiple services. The company said its engineers were \"immediately engaged\" as soon as they spotted the issue. It said the error was caused by a problem with companies connecting to data services at AWS's data centres in northern Virginia. Science and technology reporter Amazon Web Services was named as the cause of the problem by the chief executive of AI company Perplexity.  Aravind Srinivas posted on X saying: \"Perplexity is down right now. The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it.\" AWS describes itself as \"the world's most comprehensive\" cloud service.  It offers companies a virtual backbone, giving them access to servers, databases and storage without having to build their own infrastructure.  Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS, so when something goes wrong, it can have a huge impact. AWS hasn't put out any information on the outage. Sky News has contacted the company for comment.  There are still some problems with a server service called EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Steps to resolve these issues resulted in some early signs of recovery across a few data centres, AWS said in an update on its status page. It said it is taking similar steps at the remaining locations and expects the problems to subside - but did not give a timeline as to how long that could take. It recommended anyone still seeing problems with DynamoDB to \"flush their DNS caches\", which will refresh the connection. Read more:'Significant signs of recovery' hours after internet outage What to do if you are affected Sky News' science and technology reporter Mickey Carroll says those affected by the outage are partly at the mercy of AWS to get their services back up and running. If you are still experiencing delays, Hayley Andrews Smith, an automations specialist working at Myriad, advised people on LinkedIn to check their business's automated processes as \"anything hosted on AWS might be affected\". She also suggested pausing critical workflows until the systems are back up. Carroll says people should also keep their guard up for scammers. Has something like this happened before? In July last year, American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike accidentally brought parts of the world to a standstill when a faulty software update caused a global IT outage. It took just 78 minutes for the company to identify the problem and start rolling out a fix, but the impact disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices. In the UK, the outage also left GPs unable to access systems that manage appointments or allow them to view patient records or even send prescriptions to pharmacies. Flights were cancelled or delayed and passengers were left stranded as airline systems were knocked offline or staff were forced to handwrite boarding passes and luggage tags. The company has now been sued by its own shareholders as well as Delta Airlines after it cancelled thousands of flights."

        "Content": "By Rhiannon Mills, royal correspondent, and Jordan Milne, specialist producer  The Royal Family believe the allegations against Prince Andrew \"should be examined in the proper and fullest ways\", according to a Buckingham Palace source. After Prince Andrew announced on Friday that he was relinquishing the use of his titles and honours, a palace source has told Sky News that it was felt that action was needed because of \"what lies at the heart of this, the broader allegations and the issues highlighted\". They added that despite Prince Andrew denying all the claims against him, the \"new allegations that have been brought up\" are of \"very serious and grave concern\" and \"should be examined in the proper and fullest ways\". It comes after reports emerged over the weekend that claimed Prince Andrew asked a royal close protection officer to \"dig up dirt\" on Virginia Giuffre in 2011, the woman who accused the prince of sexual abuse. Her posthumous autobiography has been released this week despite her death by suicide in April. As a result of these new allegations, the Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively looking into the claims\". Speaking to police sources, Sky News has been told it is possible the protection officer who was allegedly asked by Andrew to find information may still work within the police force, especially as those within royal protection tend to stay within the team for some time. Sky News also understands the officer would have been expected to escalate this request from Andrew to his superiors, so other senior individuals may have known about it. It was also pointed out that while Andrew's alleged attempts to smear Virginia Giuffre would have been morally wrong, he also would have been asking his police officer to put his career on the line. Any attempt to use police databases to find information on an innocent individual not connected to a crime would have been a sackable offence and unlawful.  The decision for Prince Andrew to stop using his royal titles came as a shock on Friday evening. But royal sources say the decision for Andrew to release the personal statement, and take responsibility for it, was deemed to be the \"swiftest\" way to bring about \"the deserved and necessary outcome\". It was believed that the constant stream of stories about Prince Andrew, Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre were proving too much of a distraction from the wider work of the Royal Family, and the commitment of the likes of the Queen and the Duchess of Edinburgh to support survivors of sexual violence.  It is likely Prince William and the Queen will have been instrumental in making sure the institution was seen to act. The palace source said \"they are not ones for self-pity\" and \"this is not the Royal Family looking inward\", adding it is \"upsetting not in terms of themselves but it is distracting from some significant visits this week and communities that need support and to be celebrated\". However, there are now calls for more action to formally strip Prince Andrew of his honours and titles.

Royal Knights of the Order of the Garter have a banner flag and a small enamelled brass plate on display within the Quire at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle - it is understood the decision on whether Andrew's should be removed is still to be confirmed.

        "Content": "The government will allow thousands of rapists, child sex offenders and other violent criminals to be released early from prison, the Conservatives claimed as a row over sentencing law reforms erupted. Ahead of MPs debating the Sentencing Bill, introduced to tackle the growing prison population, on Tuesday, the Tories accused Labour of favouring criminals over victims and said the government's approach is a \"betrayal of victims\". But Labour accused the Conservative Party of \"rank hypocrisy\" over prison overcrowding and the previous government's early release policies. The bill will restrict the use of short sentences and instead strengthen community punishments. It will also include an \"earned progression scheme\", which allows convicts who demonstrate good behaviour to be freed earlier, with enhanced supervision in the community followed by an unsupervised period on licence. There will be a minimum release point of 33% for standard determinate sentences and a 50% minimum for more serious standard determinate sentences - as well as more tagging to monitor offenders in the community.  The Tories claim the bill as it is would mean 85% (6,500) of the most serious jailed offenders could qualify for early release because they are serving standard sentences, while more than 83% of child sex offenders and 62% of convicted rapists would serve reduced sentences. \n                  Government looks utterly weak on Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban - and Tories have smelt blood\n                 \n                  Thatcher at 100: Lavish celebrations to mark the Iron Lady's life, leadership and legacy\n                 \n                  Is it too late for Kemi Badenoch?\n                 They have tabled an amendment to the bill to ensure a carve out for the most serious crimes, so those who commit assault by penetration, rape, grievous bodily harm, stalking and sexual offences against children cannot be released early. Under Labour plans to abolish custodial sentences below 12 months, the Tories calculated up to 43,000 offenders could avoid jail altogether.

Keir Starmer is putting criminals before communities and letting predators out early. \"Under Labour's plans, thousands of the most serious and sickening offences imaginable would no longer be treated as such. What an insult to thousands of victims across the country. \"Anyone who vote for these plans will have to explain exactly why these crimes do not count among the most serious offences. \"The Conservatives will fight this moral rot every step of the way.\" But sentencing minister Jake Richards accused the Tories of \"rank hypocrisy\" as he said the previous government took prisons to \"breaking point\". He said Labour are \"cleaning up the mess\" left by the Tories and accused them of \"feigned outrage\". \"The Conservatives' rank hypocrisy is shameful. They built this crisis, then feigned outrage when the consequences arrived,\" he added. \"They took our prisons to breaking point, released thousands of serious offenders early and pushed Britain to the brink of a situation where police could no longer make arrests and courts could no longer prosecute. \"That would have been a total collapse of law and order. \"Now they attack us for cleaning up the mess they made. They are behaving like arsonists complaining the fire service couldn't stop the flame. \"This Labour government believes in prison and in punishment that cuts crime. \"We're delivering the biggest prison expansion since the Victorians, reforming sentencing to keep the public safe and building a justice system worthy of the name.\""

        "Content": "Southport attacker Axel Rudakubana was judged by a mental health service to pose no risk to others just six days before he murdered three girls at a dance class, a public inquiry has been told. Rudakubana, then 17, was discharged from Alder Hey Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) on 23 July 2024. On 29 July, he killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and attempted to murder 10 others at the Taylor Swift-themed event. Rudakubana was later jailed for a minimum of 52 years. Showing a risk assessment form to Liverpool Town Hall on Monday, Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the Southport Inquiry, said: \"We'll see, soberingly, how close to the attack we now are.\" The form, filled in by CAMHS case manager Kathryn Morris on 23 July last year, noted that Rudakubana could be verbally abusive to his father, Alphonse Rudakubana, and had thrown his phone during a video call. Another document from the same date, called a Child Young Person (CYP) current view, recorded: \"Poses risk to others: None.\" \n                  Senior police officer fears there could be more Southport-style attacks\n                 \n                  Southport stabbings: Parents of killer struggled to deal with his violent outbursts as he grew older, inquiry told\n                 \n                  Parents of Southport killer were 'in denial' after previous school hockey stick attack, inquiry hears\n                 Mr Moss asked CAMHS clinical lead Dr Vicky Killen: \"How far short of acceptable was this assessment of risk, six days before the attack?\" She replied: \"Yes, it is unacceptable. There was risk on the record and it should have been recorded in this form.\" Mr Moss asked: \"How far short of acceptable? Very far?\" Dr Killen responded: \"Very far.\" Consultant psychiatrist Dr Lakshmi Ramasubramanian told the inquiry Rudakubana had attempted to control the narrative of her first appointment with him, which took place over the phone in July 2021. She said: \"He articulated symptoms of anxiety as if he had rehearsed it from a book. It was very apparent that he was trying to convince me and persuade me that he needed medication.\" She added: \"He was certainly demanding, argumentative and tried to dictate, I would almost use the word manipulate.\" More from the inquiry:Top officer fears there could be more Southport-style attacksKiller's parents 'struggled to deal with his violent outbursts' Dr Ramasubramanian said she stopped treating Rudakubana after claiming his father had been \"intimidating\" and \"disrespectful\" at an appointment. She said: \"This is the very first time in my entire career as a doctor where I have had to request a change of psychiatrist because of how I was made to feel by a parent. \"It is quite unprecedented in my opinion, and I vividly remember the level of distress I went through at the end of the appointment.\" The inquiry also heard from consultant psychiatrist Dr Anthony Molyneux, who said that when he took over treatment in July 2022 he understood Rudakubana posed a \"minimal\" risk to others. Dr Molyneux said he was aware Rudakubana had previously taken a knife into school. But, despite some details being on his patient record, he did not know about other incidents, including Rudakubana attacking a pupil with a hockey stick in school and viewing online content related to terrorism. Dr Molyneux said it would have been \"impossible\" to review Rudakubana's complete patient record and said instead he would have read an assessment letter and expected the family to have told him about it. He said: \"There would appear to be repeated occurrences of the family appearing to, shall we say, stage manage the presentation of information provided to professionals.\" Asked if his assessment of Rudakubana's risk would have been \"deeply flawed\" without knowledge of the previous incidents, he replied: \"Let's just say it would have a significant blind spot.\" Dr Molyneux accepted that a standard operating procedure document for Sefton CAMHS said clinicians should review the whole electronic patient record at each appointment to ensure they were aware of risk factors. The doctor said Rudakubana presented in appointments as an \"unremarkable, sullen, untalkative, gawky teenage boy\" and appeared to have a \"shopping list\" of exactly what medication he wanted. The inquiry will continue on Tuesday."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK is ready to spend \"well over\" £100m on a possible deployment of British forces to Ukraine if Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, the defence secretary has said. John Healey also said Vladimir Putin views Britain as his \"number one enemy\" because of the country's support for Ukraine. The defence secretary's plan includes the preparation of military personnel to join a multinational force that would be sent to help secure Ukraine's borders if the US president brokers a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. He signalled British troops could be ready to deploy as soon as that happened and he said this could include soldiers on the ground. Some of the anticipated money to prepare for any mission is already being spent. The defence secretary also warned of a \"new era of threat\" and said the risk of wider conflict in Europe has not been as great since the end of the Second World War. Mr Healey used a lecture at Mansion House in London to talk about efforts led by the UK and France to build a \"coalition of the willing\" of more than 30 nations to form what he called a \"Multinational Force Ukraine\" over the past six months. This force would help to secure Ukraine's skies and seas and train its troops if Russia agrees to halt its full-scale war. \"So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,\" the defence secretary said. \"For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine.\" Asked how much money, he said it would be \"well over\" £100m. Mr Healey trumpeted the UK's support for Ukraine, including a record £4.5bn in assistance this year, and taking over from the United States in co-chairing a wider group of nations that have been sending weapons and money to Kyiv. \"This is why President [Volodymyr]  Zelenskyy calls the UK his closest ally,\" he said. \"This is why Putin ranks Britain as his number one enemy.\" But he warned that as Russia's aggression grew in Ukraine and beyond its borders, \"Britain and our NATO allies stand more unified, and stronger\". Read more:'Ukraine can't win war,' says TrumpUK military to be given powers to shoot down threatening dronesPutin has 'sent signal to Trump that he's ready for Ukraine deal' Giving a stark verdict of the security landscape, Mr Healey said: \"This is - undeniably - a new era of threat. The world is more unstable, more uncertain, more dangerous. Not since the end of the Second World War has Europe's security been at such risk of state-on-state conflict.\" He said this required what he described as \"a new era for defence\". He said: \"This is now an age for hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.\" The defence secretary said plans for the new era would include increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 - though critics have accused the UK and other European allies of playing smoke and mirrors with the target, questioning how much will really be spent on weapons and troops. \"As I look ahead to the rest of this decade, our task, in this new age of hard power is to secure peace in our continent and to forge stronger deterrence and resilience, a New Deal for European security,\" said Mr Healey. Turning to the Middle East, he also announced the UK was sending a two-star military officer to work as the deputy to the US commander, charged with monitoring the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."

        "Content": " A number of \"priceless\" objects were stolen from the Louvre in Paris, in what has been called the \"theft of the decade\". In broad daylight, thieves broke into the world-famous museum and accessed a gallery containing the French Crown Jewels. A manhunt for those responsible is currently ongoing, with police facing a \"race against time\" to retrieve the jewels before they are dismantled. Here's all you need to know. How the heist unfolded The heist took place at roughly 9.30am (8.30am UK time), half an hour after the Louvre had opened its doors to the public. The thieves used a crane that was mounted on the back of a small truck to smash an upstairs window and enter the Galerie d'Apollon. This is an enormous room on the upper floor of the Petite Galerie, which houses the French Crown Jewels as well as the royal collection of hardstone vessels, paintings, tapestries and medallions, the museum's website says. The thieves smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes. No-one was hurt in the incident. Guards were alerted to the scene by alarms that went off when the cases were smashed, but the thieves had already left. It is not clear if the gang brought any or all of the equipment they used with them, as construction work is taking place along the River Seine side of the building where the break-in occurred. The entire theft took between six and seven minutes. What was stolen? A total of nine objects were targeted in the heist, and eight were actually stolen. The thieves dropped the ninth one, the crown of Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugenie, during their escape. Officials have described the stolen items as having \"inestimable\" historical value. The following pieces remain missing: What will happen to the jewellery? Art detective Arthur Brand described the heist as \"the theft of the decade\" - adding that in order to recover the \"priceless\" items, police will need to find the culprits within the week. \"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" Mr Brand told Sky News. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\" He continued: \"They [the police] have a week. If they catch the thieves, the stuff might still be there. If it takes longer, the loot is probably gone and dismantled. It's a race against time.\" Tobias Kormind, managing director of Mayfair-based 77 Diamonds, agreed, saying it is \"unlikely\" the jewels will ever be seen again. \"Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance,\" he said. Authorities have said forensic teams are currently reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront of the museum, inspecting the crane used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened. Who was behind the heist? According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two others who had a scooter each. French authorities have not confirmed these details; however, one yellow vest has been recovered from the scene. Culture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that footage of the theft showed the masked robbers entering \"calmly\" and smashing display cases containing the jewels. No one was injured in the incident. She described the thieves as seemingly being \"experienced\" with a well-prepared plan. Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told BFM TV that the robbers were unarmed but threatened guards with angle grinders. The group also tried and failed to set fire to the crane they used to enter the Louvre. A key question that remains is whether the robbers had inside assistance, authorities said. French interior minister Laurent Nunez said the specialised police unit, which has a high success rate in cracking high-profile robberies, is leading the investigation. Ms Beccuau added that investigators were keeping all leads open, but authorities were \"looking at the hypothesis of organised crime\". She said the thieves could have been working for a buyer, or seeking to get access to jewels that can be useful tolaunder criminal proceeds. Questions over security Big questions are now being asked about the security in place at the Louvre, and how effective it is. Earlier this year, officials at the Louvre requested urgent help from the French government to restore and renovate the museum's ageing exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art. French justice minister Gerard Darmanin said on Monday that the heist gave a very negative image of France as it implied a failure of security services. \"There are many museums in Paris, many museums in France, with priceless values ​​in these museums,\" Mr Darmanin said in an interview with French radio station France Inter. \"What is certain is that we failed,\" he said, adding the police will eventually arrest the authors.\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a post on X that everything was being done to recover the stolen jewellery and bring the perpetrators to justice. While culture minister Rachida Dati said the issue of museum security was not new. \"For 40 years, there was little focus on securing these major museums, and two years ago, the president of the Louvrerequested a security audit from the police prefect. Why? Because museums must adapt to new forms of crime,\" she said."

        "Content": " Nicholas Rossi, an American man who faked his death and fled to Scotland to escape rape charges, has been jailed for at least five years. The sentence handed down to the 38-year-old is the first of two he faces after being convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in 2008. Utah has \"indeterminate sentencing\" - meaning jail terms handed down are in a range of years rather than a fixed number, with release dates set by the state's parole board. During August's three-day trial, Rossi's accuser and her parents took the stand - with the victim telling the court that he left a \"trail of fear, pain, and destruction\" behind him. \"This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,\" she said. Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, alleged Rossi \"uses rape to control women\" and posed a risk to community safety. Rossi - whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian - maintained his innocence during the sentencing hearing. In a soft, raspy voice, he said: \"I am not guilty of this. These women are lying.\" He was first identified in 2018 after a decade-old DNA rape kit was examined. How Rossi was caught But in February 2020 - months after he was charged in one of the cases - an online obituary claimed he had died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rossi was arrested in Scotland the following year while being treated for COVID, after hospital staff recognised his distinctive tattoos - including the crest of a university he never attended. A protracted court battle meant he wasn't extradited until January 2024, with Rossi claiming he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators identified at least a dozen aliases that he had used to evade capture over the years.

She told the court that Rossi raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home - and went to police years later after discovering that another woman in Utah had come forward with accusations. Rossi is due to be sentenced for the second conviction in November."

Mr Zelenskyy later attempted to pour water over the suggestions, saying their meeting was \"positive\" and that Ukraine was preparing a contract to buy 25 Patriot air defence systems as a result of their talks.

Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS and everything from Amazon's Alexa to the Bank of Scotland to crypto company Coinbase, Duolingo, Fortnite, Halifax, HMRC, Lloyds Bank, Roblox and more were affected by this morning's issue. Technology correspondent Amazon is the cloud provider for so many companies that when it sneezes, the internet catches a cold. Despite the name, the cloud is really just a collection of data centres - that is, a collection of computers stored in warehouses. The problem here is apparently a DNS issue related to Amazon's data centres in North Virginia. DNS is the address book for the internet so this means that Amazon has a connection problem.  The data centre itself might be fine, but all those apps and websites can't find it. It's like a postman trying to post a letter when the address has rubbed off.  The fact that this is happening in Amazon's largest data centre complex makes the ripples even bigger. For various reasons - cheap electricity, proximity to Washington DC, access to undersea cables - North Virginia has become a global centre for cloud storage, so an issue there has the capacity to affect anyone who depends on the internet.\n These days, as we're seeing, that's almost everyone. Read more: What's affected by internet outage - all we know so far In the US, there were long queues at LaGuardia airport in New York as check-in kiosks appeared to be failing and apps were down, according to The New York Times. Some reservations weren't showing up on airline apps, and customers complained on social media that they couldn't drop their bags, CNBC reported. The United Airlines' website was among the sites that users reported issues with on Downdetector, which tracks internet outages. What has Amazon Web Services said? The UK government told Sky News it was \"aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services\" after HMRC was among those affected by the outage. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible,\" said the spokesperson. Around three hours after the problems began, AWS issued an update saying its engineers were \"seeing significant signs of recovery\". \"Most requests should now be succeeding,\" it said, although it added it was working through a \"backlog\" of requests. By 11.35am UK time, it said the issue was fully resolved, although their services might run slowly because of a backlog of requests built up over the morning. 'I haven't been able to log in' Hundreds of Sky News readers got in touch to tell us how they had been affected by this morning's outage. \"I deliver parcels for Amazon Flex and I haven't been able to log in to my account all morning to be able to go to work today,\" said Marie Louise. A worried Snapchat user told us they have a \"1,321 day streak, which I don't want to lose, and I also have 14 years of Memories on there which I don't want to lose.\" And one reader took it as an opportunity for a little treat: \"MyFitnessPal is down. I guess the calories don't count this morning, right?\" wrote Callum. If you're affected by the outage, you're partly at the mercy of AWS to get their services back up and running, but there are things you can do in the meantime. \n Hayley Andrews Smith, an automations specialist at Myriad, advised people on LinkedIn to check their business's automated processes as \"anything hosted on AWS might be affected\".\n\n She also suggested pausing critical workflows until the systems are back up. \n\n You should also keep your guard up for scammers.  When Vodafone's internet services went down last week, users were immediately plagued by scammers pretending to be customer service agents.  \"When companies rush to restore access, systems and staff are stretched thin — and that's when attackers strike,\" said Charlotte Wilson from cybersecurity firm CheckPoint. \"Expect a spike in fake 'refund' or 'discount' offers, phishing emails, and scam links claiming to fix the problem.\" Check email and web addresses from anyone saying they're contacting you from AWS and do not click on any links you aren't sure about. Should Europe rely on US tech firms? Coinbase, the world's biggest bitcoin custodian and the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, has told customers \"all funds are safe\" after the outage and reassured users that their team was working on the issue. Cori Crider, the executive director of the thinktank Future of Technology Institute, said the outage shows Europe \"can no longer afford to run the majority of its critical infrastructure on US tech monopolies like Amazon Web Services\". \"The last time this happened, the Crowdstrike outage did billions of damage to Europe's economy in a single day. How much harm will be done this time?\" Last July, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike accidentally brought parts of the world to a standstill when a software update introduced a bug. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices. Although it took just 78 minutes for the company to identify the problem and start rolling out a fix, the impact of the outage lasted far longer. In the UK, the CrowdStrike outage left GPs unable to access systems that manage appointments or allow them to view patient records or even send prescriptions to pharmacies. Flights were cancelled or delayed and passengers were left stranded as airline systems were knocked offline or staff were forced to handwrite boarding passes and luggage tags."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n  A security worker at the Louvre has told Sky News that \"obsolete\" equipment and a \"drastic cut in staff\" meant they had \"reached the limit\" of what they could do to protect the world-famous museum. Elise Muller, who patrols rooms inside the former palace, said she is \"enraged\" by Sunday's jewellery heist and that security shortcomings have long been highlighted. She said: \"We have raised the alarm through our union, and our colleagues have all repeatedly warned about the difficulties we face every day at work; equipment being in poor condition, sometimes even completely obsolete, coupled with a very drastic cut in staff. \"We inevitably reached the limit of what we could do to secure the building and its collections.\"  A day after the brazen daylight robbery, the doors of Louvre remained closed. Disappointed visitors were turned away as police continued to hunt the gang that robbed one of the world's most famous museums. \"You can't imagine it. You see it in the movies. It was very well thought out, and this is something that happened in minutes,\" Luis from Mexico told me. \"I'm really disappointed, it was a once-in-a-lifetime to come see it and now I'm not going to get to see it because the robbery is a once-in-a-lifetime too,\" added Cathy from Florida. Read more:All we know about 'theft of the decade''Race against time' as police try to recover 'priceless' jewels It was around 9.30am on Sunday when thieves used a motorised ladder to access the first floor of the Louvre. They then smashed through the window and entered the Apollo gallery which houses the jewels belonging to Napoleon and French regents. Inside, they grabbed treasures including necklaces, earrings, and a tiara and then fled on scooters after dropping a crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. The prosecutor told French media the audacious heist is likely the work of an organised criminal group possibly stealing for a collector. But it's a crime that's outraged many in France who wonder, how could this happen? In a radio interview, justice minister Gerald Darmanin said France had failed - questioning why the museum's windows weren't secure and how the thieves could break in on a busy road. Police are now desperately trying to track down the culprits before the treasures are lost. Alexandre Giquello auctions precious antiques. He said the robbers will need to shift the jewels quickly, and because they're so famous they won't be able to sell them as whole pieces on the black market. He said: \"If you want to take something like this you have to destroy it - chop up the stones, melt the gold and that's the disaster of this.\" We contacted the Louvre about the concerns Ms Muller raised but a spokesperson said they would not be making a comment. In a statement on Sunday, the Culture Ministry highlighted that a new master security plan is being implemented as part of the \"New Renaissance project\" announced by President Emmanuel Macron in January. It includes upgraded security measures with next generation cameras, perimeter detection systems, and a new security control centre. But that all takes time, and catching the thieves who broke into the Louvre is now about more than just solving a crime, it's about saving national treasures and France's reputation."

        "Headline": "Serialised productions split into episodes of roughly a minute, viewed only on smartphones, are sweeping China.",
        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n  It was a pretty wild morning. In the space of just a few hours, we witnessed a gangland killing, a jewellery heist and stepped onboard a private jet. We observed a billionaire CEO at work, a dramatic family showdown in a hospital and a drunken karaoke party. It was all part of a tour around a massive Chinese facility producing what are known as vertical micro-dramas. To describe the experience as somewhat dizzying is an understatement. If you haven't heard of them, micro-dramas are a new cultural sensation sweeping not just China but the world, a remarkable example of China's booming soft power. They are essentially serialised productions split into episodes of roughly a minute, shot in vertical and viewed solely on smartphones. Think soap operas for the TikTok generation. 'Secret surrogate to the Mafia King' The story lines are sensational and melodramatic with titles that border the ridiculous; 'Ex-Convict nanny and Billionaire single dad', 'Pregnant by my Tough Daddy CEO' and 'Secret Surrogate to the Mafia King', just some examples. The action is fast and the characters simplistic, while autoplay and multiple mini cliff hangers are designed to provide an addictive dopamine hit. It's a format which has sprung to life in just the last few years, developed initially in China in the wake of the pandemic, and its success has been extraordinary. Some of the most-watched titles have hundreds of millions of views and downloads of short drama apps were over six times higher in the first quarter of 2025 than that same period last year, according to data from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. The Chinese government recently revealed that over 50% of all internet users in China have watched a micro-drama, more than have ordered food online or used a ride-hailing service. 'You can easily binge five or six episodes on the subway commute' \"People's lives are so stressful and packed these days,\" explains Ji Jingdong, a producer of micro-dramas who made the switch from traditional film around three years ago. \"When you watch vertical-screen content, you can easily binge five or six episodes on the subway commute, right? And let's face it, you're barely halfway through an ordinary TV episode before you reach your stop. \"Scrolling through vertical screens at a fast pace is actually pretty stress-relieving. Especially those so-called 'mindless dramas' - they're incredibly relaxing to watch.\" That mass appeal, paired with extremely fast turnaround times and no-frills production is translating into massive revenues. Read more from Sky News:Tel Aviv football derby cancelled after 'violent riots'Eight 'priceless' objects stolen in Louvre museum heist Last year, the industry revenue was an astonishing $6.9bn, for the first time exceeding the value of the Chinese box office. Its figure is almost 14 times as high as in 2021, just three years ago. But with this huge reach and revenues comes both challenge and opportunity for a system like China where everything including cultural products is strictly controlled. 1,200 series taken down Indeed in February of this year over 1,200 series were taken down, deemed too \"vulgar\" or inappropriate, while a wave of new regulations now require projects over a certain value to have government approval. In addition there are initiatives to encourage production houses to make dramas that promote certain values such as 'Learn the law with Micro-Short Dramas' and 'Explore intangible cultural heritage through micro short dramas'. It's a framework they are aware of at the Meigao Micro Drama Super Factory, in the southeastern city of Quzhou. This 67,000 square metre facility was initially constructed as a COVID quarantine hotel, but it now houses around 200 different sets where multiple crews can shoot their dramas simultaneously. There is almost any indoor environment you could imagine - from a bank, courthouse and subway to a ballroom, office and multiple home environments. The CEO Dai Wenxue explains with pride how they made 500 micro-dramas last year. But there is also a clear acknowledgement that the transformation of this venue was achieved with local government support, and that this massive Chinese success story also serves a political purpose. Aligning with 'the nation's overarching strategic vision' \"The early phase emphasised growth, with the government taking a relatively relaxed but not lax approach,\" he explains. \"Now, the focus has shifted toward premium production, cultural exports and telling compelling Chinese stories. \"This aligns with the nation's overarching strategic vision. That's the current landscape.\" Indeed, while the majority of productions are fun and frivolous, for its critics, the industry is a perfect propaganda tool. This autumn, in fact, saw a huge boom in government-encouraged patriotic war productions to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two and a huge accompanying military parade in Beijing. All this mattered because the format is now being aggressively exported abroad. Almost all production houses worth their salt are leaning into English language productions. Meigao is in fact building an entire second location with American-style scenes. And it's no wonder when you look at the numbers. According to analysis undertaken by Sensor Tower, in the first quarter of 2025, downloads in the US had gone up 54% compared to the same period in 2024. In Latin America it was 69% and in India a remarkable 113%. 'A huge uptick' \"So in the past 10 months, right after the Chinese New Year, there was definitely a huge uptick,\" says Max Olsen, an American actor living in Beijing. For him and other Western actors there has been a hugely noticeable boom in work . \"A bunch of productions decided that they were going to shoot, you know, they're going to produce one a week. \"Obviously, with money, with eyeballs, with attention, comes a degree of power.\"  There are of course questions about how this type of soft power translates and what China could or would do with it. But it is just one of a number of cultural exports playing into a trend of China positioning itself as accessible and relatable, even 'cool'. Indeed for such a new format there is clearly still results yet to be seen. \"I don't think the double-digit growth will continue forever,\" says Olsen. \"But I suspect in five years' time, we'll have a very established industry.\""

Christopher Marinello says gangs have been emboldened to strike because \"law enforcement has been driven into the ground\". And while headlines have focused on thieves making off with priceless jewellery from an iconic French institution, he warns this problem isn't confined to Paris. He said: \"There are gangs operating all over Europe and not enough is being done to stop them … this was only a matter of time, they've been hitting small museums. \"If they can hit the Louvre successfully, they can hit anything. Do you know how many museums there are in the UK?\" At the start of October, at the St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales, it took just four minutes for audacious thieves to swipe irreplaceable Bronze Age jewellery. He says gangs are targeting gold \"just to melt it down\" and diamonds for their value - \"with no regard for the integrity of the artworks and the cultural heritage that they are destroying\". A spokesperson for the museum has said: \"We sympathise deeply with our friends at the Louvre … it emphasises the increased risk to organisations like ours … this highlights the dilemma we face between having items on display for people to enjoy and learn from - or keeping them locked away.\"  Mr Marinello, who investigates art crimes that the police aren't pursuing, says institutions and stately homes urgently need to wake up to what's happening. \"They need to start building vaults for these objects because otherwise they're going to be taken and melted down and used to buy Lamborghinis or drugs,\" he warned. \"If the smaller museums can't afford it, perhaps they're going to have to consolidate collections to museums that can handle it.\" Read more:Staff 'repeatedly warned about security shortcomings''Race against time' to recover 'priceless' jewels 'You can't trust anyone' Mr Marinello went on to warn that gangs are becoming \"more brazen\" - with the Louvre targeted despite the security measures it had in place. \"The system is not working … the penalties are not strong enough … police are frustrated, prosecutors say the same thing because there's nowhere to put these people.\" The art recovery expert says he's concerned how funding cutbacks are making our museums more vulnerable to those who recognise that the obvious rewards outweigh the risks. \"These museums are designed to preserve and protect our cultural heritage, and they need to be properly funded to do that job,\" he added. \"They need to be able to stay one step ahead of the criminals.\" \"This is not the 1950s any more, you can't trust anyone. These items are so valuable, and gold is at an all-time high. \"[Thieves] don't care if an item belonged to Napoleon III, it means nothing to them. All they care about is quick cash.\""

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  If you ever fly to Washington DC, look out of the window as you land at Dulles Airport - and you might snatch a glimpse of the single biggest story in economics right now. There below you, you will see scattered around the fields and woods of the local area a set of vast warehouses that might to the untrained eye look like supermarkets or distribution centres. But no: these are in fact data centres - the biggest concentration of data centres anywhere in the world. For this area surrounding Dulles Airport has more of these buildings, housing computer servers that do the calculations to train and run artificial intelligence (AI), than anywhere else. And since AI accounts for the vast majority of economic growth in the US so far this year, that makes this place an enormous deal. Down at ground level you can see the hallmarks as you drive around what is known as \"data centre alley\". There are enormous power lines everywhere - a reminder that running these plants is an incredibly energy-intensive task. This tiny area alone, Loudoun County, consumes roughly 4.9 gigawatts of power - more than the entire consumption of Denmark. That number has already tripled in the past six years, and is due to be catapulted ever higher in the coming years. Inside 'data centre alley' We know as much because we have gained rare access into the heart of \"data centre alley\", into two sites run by Digital Realty, one of the biggest datacentre companies in the world. It runs servers that power nearly all the major AI and cloud services in the world. If you send a request to one of those models or search engines there's a good chance you've unknowingly used their machines yourself. Their Digital Dulles site, under construction right now, is due to consume up to a gigawatt in power all told, with six substations to help provide that power. Indeed, it consumes about the same amount of power as a large nuclear power plant. Walking through the site, a series of large warehouses, some already equipped with rows and rows of backup generators, there to ensure the silicon chips whirring away inside never lose power, is a striking experience - a reminder of the physical underpinnings of the AI age. For all that this technology feels weightless, it has enormous physical demands. It entails the construction of these massive concrete buildings, each of which needs enormous amounts of power and water to keep the servers cool. Read more from Ed Conway:Blow to UK's bid to become minerals superpowerThere's more to your AirPods than meets the eye We were given access inside one of the company's existing server centres - behind multiple security cordons into rooms only accessible with fingerprint identification. And there we saw the infrastructure necessary to keep those AI chips running. We saw an Nvidia DGX H100 running away, in a server rack capable of sucking in more power than a small village. We saw the cooling pipes running in and out of the building, as well as the ones which feed coolant into the GPUs (graphic processing units) themselves. Such things underline that to the extent that AI has brainpower, it is provided not out of thin air, but via very physical amenities and infrastructure. And the availability of that infrastructure is one of the main limiting factors for this economic boom in the coming years. According to economist Jason Furman, once you subtract AI and related technologies, the US economy barely grew at all in the first half of this year. So much is riding on this. But there are some who question whether the US is going to be able to construct power plants quickly enough to fuel this boom.  For years, American power consumption remained more or less flat. That has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. Now, AI companies have made grand promises about future computing power, but that depends on being able to plug those chips into the grid. Last week the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned AI could indeed be a financial bubble. He said: \"There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. It was the internet then… it is AI now. We're seeing surging valuations, booming investment and strong consumption on the back of solid capital gains. The risk is that with stronger investment and consumption, a tighter monetary policy will be needed to contain price pressures. This is what happened in the late 1990s.\" 'The terrifying thing is…' For those inside the AI world, this also feels like uncharted territory. Helen Toner, executive director of Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and formerly on the OpenAI board, said: \"The terrifying thing is: no one knows how much further AI is going to go, and no one really knows how much economic growth is going to come out of it. \"The trends have certainly been that the AI systems we are developing get more and more sophisticated over time, and I don't see signs of that stopping. I think they'll keep getting more advanced. But the question of how much productivity growth will that create? How will that compare to the absolutely gobsmacking investments that are being made today?\" Whether it's a new industrial revolution or a bubble - or both - there's no denying AI is a massive economic story with massive implications. For energy. For materials. For jobs. We just don't know how massive yet."

The sentence handed down to the 38-year-old is the first of two he faces after being convicted separately in August and September of raping two women in 2008. Utah has \"indeterminate sentencing\" - meaning jail terms handed down are in a range of years rather than a fixed number, with release dates set by the state's parole board. During August's three-day trial, Rossi's accuser and her parents took the stand - with the victim telling the court that he left a \"trail of fear, pain, and destruction\" behind him. \"This is not a plea for vengeance. This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal,\" she said. Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, alleged Rossi \"uses rape to control women\" and posed a risk to community safety. Rossi - whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian - maintained his innocence during the sentencing hearing. In a soft, raspy voice, he said: \"I am not guilty of this. These women are lying.\" He was first identified in 2018 after a decade-old DNA rape kit was examined. How Rossi was caught But in February 2020 - months after he was charged in one of the cases - an online obituary claimed he had died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rossi was arrested in Scotland the following year while being treated for COVID, after hospital staff recognised his distinctive tattoos - including the crest of a university he never attended. A protracted court battle meant he wasn't extradited until January 2024, with Rossi claiming he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators identified at least a dozen aliases that he had used to evade capture over the years.

She told the court that Rossi raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home - and went to police years later after discovering that another woman in Utah had come forward with accusations.

And it comes after the Financial Times claimed the behind-the-scenes of Mr Trump and President Zelenskyy's meeting in Washington on Friday had descended into a \"shouting match\". According to the paper, the US president repeatedly told his Ukrainian counterpart to accept Vladimir Putin's terms for ending the war - warning him that the Russian leader would \"destroy\" Ukraine if it did not agree. Mr Zelenskyy later attempted to pour water over the suggestions, saying their meeting was \"positive\" and that Ukraine was preparing a contract to buy 25 Patriot air defence systems as a result of their talks. However, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not secure the Tomahawk missiles he had wanted for Ukraine. The long-range missiles would have been a major boost for Kyiv. \n                  Watch live as Trump hosts Australian PM at White House\n                 \n                  US airstrike destroyed 'drug-carrying submarine', says Trump - as survivors repatriated\n                 \n                  Donald Trump mocks 'No Kings' protests with AI video of himself dropping brown sludge on protesters from jet\n                 \"In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,\" Mr Zelenskyy said.  Meanwhile, Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijarto has announced he will visit Washington on Tuesday. It follows claims from Mr Trump that he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest soon. And on Monday, US secretary of state Marco Rubio had a phone call with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. According to the state department, Mr Rubio and Mr Lavrov spoke about possible concrete steps to implement understandings reached during the call between Mr Trump and Mr Putin last week.

Also on Monday, French president Emmanuel Macron announced there will be a meeting of the coalition of the willing in London on Friday which Mr Zelenskyy will attend. The coalition - co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz - has the aim of bringing countries together to protect a peace deal in Ukraine."

        "Headline": "After more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online by early evening - but Amazon Web Services did not say when the issue would be fully resolved. ",
        "Content": "Dozens of websites, banks and apps have been affected by a major internet outage.  The problem, which started on Monday morning, is related to an issue at Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of 5pm (UK time), there were more than 9,300 reports of the Amazon Web Services outage, according to Downdetector, which monitors issues and outages in real-time. After more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online by early evening, but AWS said it was still working on recovering connectivity. Just before midday, AWS said it had fixed the underlying problem, but said it had a backlog the system would need to deal with. Here's what we know so far. What has been affected? Multiple banks, the UK's Government Gateway services - which is accessed through the Gov.uk website and includes things like HMRC, universal credit and pensions - mobile phone networks and video-chatting platform Zoom are among the websites that reported technical issues. A UK government spokesperson said: \"We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\" A Lloyds Bank spokesperson also apologised for issues affecting customers, adding: \"We are seeing services coming back online and continue to work to see that happens as quickly as possible.\" All Amazon products - including Prime Video, Alexa and Amazon Music - have also been affected, as well as the main Amazon website. According to Downdetector, around 50 outlets have been, or still are, affected. Here's a full list: • Amazon• Amazon Alexa• Amazon Music• Amazon Prime Video• Amazon Web Services• Ancestry• Asana• Atlassian• Bank Of Scotland• Blink Security• BT• Canva• Clash Of Clans• Clash Royale• Coinbase• Dead By Daylight• Duolingo• EE• Epic Games Store• Eventbrite• Flickr• Fortnite• Government Gateway services (including HMRC)• Halifax• Hargreaves Lansdown• Hay Day• Hinge• HMRC• IMDB• Jira Software• Just Eat• Life360• Lloyds Bank• Microsoft 365• My Fitness Pal• Ocado• Peloton• Perplexity AI• Playstation Network• Pokemon Go• Rainbow Six• Reddit• Ring• Roblox• Rocket League• Signal• Sky Mobile• Slack• Smartsheet• Snapchat• Strava• Square• Tidal• WhatsApp• Wordle• Xero• Zoom What has AWS said? AWS confirmed it was suffering from \"increased error rates and latencies\" for multiple services. The company said its engineers were \"immediately engaged\" as soon as they spotted the issue. It said the error was caused by a problem with companies connecting to data services at AWS's data centres in northern Virginia. Science and technology reporter Amazon Web Services was named as the cause of the problem by the chief executive of AI company Perplexity.  Aravind Srinivas posted on X saying: \"Perplexity is down right now. The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it.\" AWS describes itself as \"the world's most comprehensive\" cloud service.  It offers companies a virtual backbone, giving them access to servers, databases and storage without having to build their own infrastructure.  Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS, so when something goes wrong, it can have a huge impact. AWS hasn't put out any information on the outage. Sky News has contacted the company for comment.  There are still some problems with a server service called EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Steps to resolve these issues resulted in some early signs of recovery across a few data centres, AWS said in an update on its status page. It said it is taking similar steps at the remaining locations and expects the problems to subside - but did not give a timeline as to how long that could take. It recommended anyone still seeing problems with DynamoDB to \"flush their DNS caches\", which will refresh the connection. Read more:'Significant signs of recovery' hours after internet outage What to do if you are affected Sky News' science and technology reporter Mickey Carroll says those affected by the outage are partly at the mercy of AWS to get their services back up and running. If you are still experiencing delays, Hayley Andrews Smith, an automations specialist working at Myriad, advised people on LinkedIn to check their business's automated processes as \"anything hosted on AWS might be affected\". She also suggested pausing critical workflows until the systems are back up. Carroll says people should also keep their guard up for scammers. Has something like this happened before? In July last year, American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike accidentally brought parts of the world to a standstill when a faulty software update caused a global IT outage. It took just 78 minutes for the company to identify the problem and start rolling out a fix, but the impact disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices. In the UK, the outage also left GPs unable to access systems that manage appointments or allow them to view patient records or even send prescriptions to pharmacies. Flights were cancelled or delayed and passengers were left stranded as airline systems were knocked offline or staff were forced to handwrite boarding passes and luggage tags. The company has now been sued by its own shareholders as well as Delta Airlines after it cancelled thousands of flights."

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  One of Harper Lee's surviving relatives says it's possible there could be major unpublished works by the author still to be discovered, following the release of eight of her previously unseen short stories. Describing the mystery around a manuscript titled The Long Goodbye, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird, Lee's nephew, Dr Edwin Conner, told Sky News: \"Even the family doesn't know everything that remains in her papers. So, it could be there waiting to be published.\" Dr Conner says Lee submitted a 111-page manuscript, titled The Long Goodbye, after writing Go Set A Watchman in 1957. The retired English professor explains: \"It's not clear to me or to others in the family, to what extent [The Long Goodbye] might have been integrated into To Kill a Mockingbird, which she wrote immediately after, or to what extent it was a freestanding manuscript that is altogether different and that might stand to be published in the future.\" A second mystery exists in the form of a true crime novel, The Reverend, which Lee was known to have begun researching in the late 1970s, about Alabama preacher Reverend Willie Maxwell who was accused of five murders before being murdered himself. Dr Conner said: \"The manuscript of a nonfiction piece, that according to some people doesn't exist, according to others who claim to have seen it, does [is also a mystery]. We don't know where it is, or whether it is, really. \"That could be a surprise that has yet to be revealed if we discover it and it's published, which is a real possibility.\" \n                  Shopaholic author Sophie Kinsella reveals aggressive brain cancer diagnosis\n                 \n                  Harvard University library removes human skin from 19th century book binding \n                 \n                  British children 'have less space' to be kids, award-winning author says\n                 He believes much of the manuscript was written in his family home and says his mother, Louise, who was Lee's older sister, saw a \"finished version of it\" on the dining room table. Dr Conner says there are \"others who just as fiercely say no, it was never completed\". 'She did want to publish these stories' There has long been debate over why Lee published just two books in her lifetime. To Kill a Mockingbird came out in 1960. Selling more than 46 million copies worldwide, translated into more than 40 languages and winning a Pulitzer Prize, it's arguably the most influential American book of the 20th century. Fifty-five years later, Lee published a sequel, Go Set A Watchman, written ahead of Mockingbird, but set at a later date. Then aged 88, and with failing health, there were questions over how much influence Lee had over the decision to publish. Asked how happy she'd be to see some of her earliest work, containing early outlines for Mockingbird's narrator Jean Louise Finch and the story's hero Atticus Finch, now hitting the shelves, Dr Conner says: \"I think she'd be delighted.\" He says Lee had presented them to her first agent, Maurice Crane, at their first meeting in 1956, \"precisely because she did want to publish these stories\". And while dubbing them \"apprentice stories,\" which he admits \"don't represent her at her best as a writer,\" he says they show \"literary genius of a kind\". Notoriously private, he says the stories - which were discovered neatly typed out in one of Lee's New York apartments after her death - offer \"deeply enthralling new glimpses into her as a person\". Never marrying or having children, he says Lee maintained a degree of privacy even with her family: \"You never saw her complete personality… We thought we knew her, we thought we'd seen everything, but no, we hadn't.\" 'That's it, I'm not giving any more interviews' While describing her as a \"complicated woman,\" he insists Lee was far from the recluse she's frequently painted as. He says: \"In company, she was most of the time delightful. She was a lively personality, she was funny, witty, and you would think she was very outgoing.\" But Lee was known to have struggled with her success. Dr Conner explains: \"She never ever wanted fame or celebrity because she suspected, or knew, that would involve the kind of uncomfortable situations in public situations that she found just no satisfaction or pleasure in\". He says while in the early years of Mockingbird Lee gave interviews, the wild success of the book soon rendered such promotion unnecessary, leading her to decide: \"That's it, I'm not giving any more interviews\". While he admits she was subsequently much happier, he goes on: \"Not that she was a recluse, as some people thought. She wasn't at all a recluse, but she didn't enjoy public appearances and interviews particularly. She wanted the work to speak for itself.\" 'Deeply hurt' by Truman Capote Famously close to Truman Capote, one of the pieces in Lee's newly released collection is a profile of her fellow author. Dr Conner says that piece - a love-letter of sorts, describing Capote's literary achievements - is all the more remarkable because at the point Lee wrote it in 1966, when she and Capote \"were not even on speaking terms\". He says Lee \"probably knew [Capote] better than any other person alive when that was written\", adding, \"she did love him as a friend very much, even when he was not speaking to her\". Friends since childhood - and the prototype for the character of Dill in Mockingbird - Capote later hired Lee to help him research his 1965 true crime novel In Cold Blood. Despite his book's relative success, Dr Conner believes Capote was \"bitter\" over the fact Mockingbird far eclipsed it in accolades and recognition. \"He had been writing for much longer. He felt that he was at least as good as she was, and he was very envious of her success\". Dr Conner says Lee was \"deeply hurt\" at Capote's rejection of her, never speaking about him in later life. Recalling his own meeting with Capote many years later, Dr Conner says he \"got a personal sense of how [Capote] could charm the socks off of anybody, male or female\". He says it was noteworthy that while Capote asked about his mother, who he had been fond of, he \"never once mentioned\" Harper. Sky News has contacted Lee's lawyer and the executor of her estate, Tonya Carter, for comment. The Land of Sweet Forever: Stories and Essays, by Harper Lee is on sale from Tuesday"

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  If you ever fly to Washington DC, look out of the window as you land at Dulles Airport - and you might snatch a glimpse of the single biggest story in economics right now. There below you, you will see scattered around the fields and woods of the local area a set of vast warehouses that might to the untrained eye look like supermarkets or distribution centres. But no: these are in fact data centres - the biggest concentration of data centres anywhere in the world. For this area surrounding Dulles Airport has more of these buildings, housing computer servers that do the calculations to train and run artificial intelligence (AI), than anywhere else. And since AI accounts for the vast majority of economic growth in the US so far this year, that makes this place an enormous deal. Down at ground level you can see the hallmarks as you drive around what is known as \"data centre alley\". There are enormous power lines everywhere - a reminder that running these plants is an incredibly energy-intensive task. This tiny area alone, Loudoun County, consumes roughly 4.9 gigawatts of power - more than the entire consumption of Denmark. That number has already tripled in the past six years, and is due to be catapulted ever higher in the coming years. Inside 'data centre alley' We know as much because we have gained rare access into the heart of \"data centre alley\", into two sites run by Digital Realty, one of the biggest datacentre companies in the world. It runs servers that power nearly all the major AI and cloud services in the world. If you send a request to one of those models or search engines there's a good chance you've unknowingly used their machines yourself. Their Digital Dulles site, under construction right now, is due to consume up to a gigawatt in power all told, with six substations to help provide that power. Indeed, it consumes about the same amount of power as a large nuclear power plant. Walking through the site, a series of large warehouses, some already equipped with rows and rows of backup generators, there to ensure the silicon chips whirring away inside never lose power, is a striking experience - a reminder of the physical underpinnings of the AI age. For all that this technology feels weightless, it has enormous physical demands. It entails the construction of these massive concrete buildings, each of which needs enormous amounts of power and water to keep the servers cool. Read more from Ed Conway:Blow to UK's bid to become minerals superpowerThere's more to your AirPods than meets the eye We were given access inside one of the company's existing server centres - behind multiple security cordons into rooms only accessible with fingerprint identification. And there we saw the infrastructure necessary to keep those AI chips running. We saw an Nvidia DGX H100 running away, in a server rack capable of sucking in more power than a small village. We saw the cooling pipes running in and out of the building, as well as the ones which feed coolant into the GPUs (graphic processing units) themselves. Such things underline that to the extent that AI has brainpower, it is provided not out of thin air, but via very physical amenities and infrastructure. And the availability of that infrastructure is one of the main limiting factors for this economic boom in the coming years. According to economist Jason Furman, once you subtract AI and related technologies, the US economy barely grew at all in the first half of this year. So much is riding on this. But there are some who question whether the US is going to be able to construct power plants quickly enough to fuel this boom.  For years, American power consumption remained more or less flat. That has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. Now, AI companies have made grand promises about future computing power, but that depends on being able to plug those chips into the grid. Last week the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned AI could indeed be a financial bubble. He said: \"There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. It was the internet then… it is AI now. We're seeing surging valuations, booming investment and strong consumption on the back of solid capital gains. The risk is that with stronger investment and consumption, a tighter monetary policy will be needed to contain price pressures. This is what happened in the late 1990s.\" 'The terrifying thing is…' For those inside the AI world, this also feels like uncharted territory. Helen Toner, executive director of Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and formerly on the OpenAI board, said: \"The terrifying thing is: no one knows how much further AI is going to go, and no one really knows how much economic growth is going to come out of it. \"The trends have certainly been that the AI systems we are developing get more and more sophisticated over time, and I don't see signs of that stopping. I think they'll keep getting more advanced. But the question of how much productivity growth will that create? How will that compare to the absolutely gobsmacking investments that are being made today?\" Whether it's a new industrial revolution or a bubble - or both - there's no denying AI is a massive economic story with massive implications. For energy. For materials. For jobs. We just don't know how massive yet."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       The internet appears to be recovering after a major outage knocked out thousands of websites, including Amazon, Snapchat, Reddit and several banks. Downdetector, a website that tracks complaints about outages, showed thousands of problems on Monday morning. The issue originates from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which describes itself as \"the world's most comprehensive\" cloud service. Internet outage - as it happened It offers companies a virtual backbone, giving them access to servers, databases and storage without having to build their own infrastructure. Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS and everything from Amazon's Alexa to the Bank of Scotland to crypto company Coinbase, Duolingo, Fortnite, Halifax, HMRC, Lloyds Bank, Roblox and more were affected by this morning's issue. Technology correspondent Amazon is the cloud provider for so many companies that when it sneezes, the internet catches a cold. Despite the name, the cloud is really just a collection of data centres - that is, a collection of computers stored in warehouses. The problem here is apparently a DNS issue related to Amazon's data centres in North Virginia. DNS is the address book for the internet so this means that Amazon has a connection problem.  The data centre itself might be fine, but all those apps and websites can't find it. It's like a postman trying to post a letter when the address has rubbed off.  The fact that this is happening in Amazon's largest data centre complex makes the ripples even bigger. For various reasons - cheap electricity, proximity to Washington DC, access to undersea cables - North Virginia has become a global centre for cloud storage, so an issue there has the capacity to affect anyone who depends on the internet.\n These days, as we're seeing, that's almost everyone. Read more: What's affected by internet outage - all we know so far In the US, there were long queues at LaGuardia airport in New York as check-in kiosks appeared to be failing and apps were down, according to The New York Times. Some reservations weren't showing up on airline apps, and customers complained on social media that they couldn't drop their bags, CNBC reported. The United Airlines' website was among the sites that users reported issues with on Downdetector, which tracks internet outages. What has Amazon Web Services said? The UK government told Sky News it was \"aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services\" after HMRC was among those affected by the outage. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible,\" said the spokesperson. Around three hours after the problems began, AWS issued an update saying its engineers were \"seeing significant signs of recovery\". \"Most requests should now be succeeding,\" it said, although it added it was working through a \"backlog\" of requests. By 11.35am UK time, it said the issue was fully resolved, although their services might run slowly because of a backlog of requests built up over the morning. 'I haven't been able to log in' Hundreds of Sky News readers got in touch to tell us how they had been affected by this morning's outage. \"I deliver parcels for Amazon Flex and I haven't been able to log in to my account all morning to be able to go to work today,\" said Marie Louise. A worried Snapchat user told us they have a \"1,321 day streak, which I don't want to lose, and I also have 14 years of Memories on there which I don't want to lose.\" And one reader took it as an opportunity for a little treat: \"MyFitnessPal is down. I guess the calories don't count this morning, right?\" wrote Callum. If you're affected by the outage, you're partly at the mercy of AWS to get their services back up and running, but there are things you can do in the meantime. \n Hayley Andrews Smith, an automations specialist at Myriad, advised people on LinkedIn to check their business's automated processes as \"anything hosted on AWS might be affected\".\n\n She also suggested pausing critical workflows until the systems are back up. \n\n You should also keep your guard up for scammers.  When Vodafone's internet services went down last week, users were immediately plagued by scammers pretending to be customer service agents.  \"When companies rush to restore access, systems and staff are stretched thin — and that's when attackers strike,\" said Charlotte Wilson from cybersecurity firm CheckPoint. \"Expect a spike in fake 'refund' or 'discount' offers, phishing emails, and scam links claiming to fix the problem.\" Check email and web addresses from anyone saying they're contacting you from AWS and do not click on any links you aren't sure about. Should Europe rely on US tech firms? Coinbase, the world's biggest bitcoin custodian and the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, has told customers \"all funds are safe\" after the outage and reassured users that their team was working on the issue. Cori Crider, the executive director of the thinktank Future of Technology Institute, said the outage shows Europe \"can no longer afford to run the majority of its critical infrastructure on US tech monopolies like Amazon Web Services\". \"The last time this happened, the Crowdstrike outage did billions of damage to Europe's economy in a single day. How much harm will be done this time?\" Last July, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike accidentally brought parts of the world to a standstill when a software update introduced a bug. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices. Although it took just 78 minutes for the company to identify the problem and start rolling out a fix, the impact of the outage lasted far longer. In the UK, the CrowdStrike outage left GPs unable to access systems that manage appointments or allow them to view patient records or even send prescriptions to pharmacies. Flights were cancelled or delayed and passengers were left stranded as airline systems were knocked offline or staff were forced to handwrite boarding passes and luggage tags."

Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week we chat to award-winning aesthetic doctor Dr Ed Robinson. The most frequent procedure is... anti-wrinkle injections. They are most non-surgical clinics' bread and butter, typically costing £200 to £350 per treatment. Recently biostimulators and laser resurfacing have surged in popularity as people seek skin quality improvements rather than just wrinkle reduction. Employed positions might start around £30,000... while experienced practitioners can earn £50,000 to £70,000, and sometimes significantly more with commission or profit share. An injector's salary varies hugely depending on their medical background, location, patient base and whether they are self-employed or employed. Read the latest consumer news here In a typical week, I work two full days... for the NHS (approximately 28 hours) and four days in clinic. Sunday is my day to rest and recuperate. As a business owner, it is very hard to not find something to be doing all the time, and establishing boundaries is something that is becoming increasingly important to me. It is not uncommon for patients to reference celebrities... in their consultations, and social media videos analysing celebrity glow-ups tend to draw a lot of attention. But... treatments should be bespoke and celebrate individuality, not trying to make everyone look the same or like someone else. The best recent example of excellent celebrity cosmetic work is... Kris Jenner. A full face approach, respecting her anatomy and almost impossible to say exactly what she's had done. Undoubtedly, a mix of non-surgical and surgical treatments but she still looks like herself, only refreshed, younger and rejuvenated. Do your research before committing to a practitioner... One of my patients developed a series of nasty abscesses on their face after dermal filler injections from a non-medical practitioner. They had to be drained, with multiple rounds of dissolving with antibiotic coverage. The patient had been given poor aftercare advice from their practitioner and was left with significant scarring. We have now done many rounds of skin resurfacing to improve this, which is working well, but it's a slow process. Warning signs include... treatments offered in non-clinical settings, prices that seem too good to be true and lack of medical background. Almost all complications require rapid assessment and administration of prescription medication, which non-medical practitioners are simply not qualified or equipped to do safely. Do not be afraid to ask about qualifications, insurance and complication management. More from Money:'I'm a private investigator - here's a common error that crack cases''I'm a nanny - this is how we're raising children wrong''I've had no training, but I sculpted the Queen' We have seen big rises in... requests for lip fillers, jawline contouring and skin tightening after posts by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, while on the other hand when Molly Mae candidly talked about dissolving her filler, we saw a large uptick in this too. While they raise awareness of aesthetics, it can create unrealistic ideals and expectations (especially when celebrity budgets are taken into account). It's important to understand that treatments should be bespoke and respect the anatomy of the patient. I turn clients down if... the treatment won't benefit them, isn't safe or if they're seeking results driven by comparison rather than personal confidence. If something will look unnatural, I will say no. Sometimes saying no is the healthiest option. The biggest mistake I've made is... not managing patient expectations. I now like to underpromise and overdeliver in my practice. Non-surgical \"tweakments\" are about making small adjustments which can build up over time, but it requires patience and compliance with treatment plans. Patients who are expecting dramatic changes are often going to be disappointed, and managing these expectations and the difficult conversation of saying no to someone is definitely something I have learnt over the years. Social media pressures and filtered images... drive unrealistic expectations and many younger patients are influenced into having treatments by people they follow online. Education, regulation and open conversations about body image are really important and clinics must take responsibility by refusing inappropriate treatments. I'm a strong advocate for encouraging my patients to dissolve dermal fillers which don't suit them. My top tip for keeping your skin looking young, fresh and wrinkle-free without intervention is... daily SPF. It's the single most effective anti-ageing step anyone can take. UVA and UVB contribute significantly to the ageing process and it's present all year round. Combine it with good sleep, hydration and a balanced lifestyle for maximum benefit. For the clean girl aesthetic... focus on skincare: gentle cleansing, hydration, vitamin C and SPF. If you don't want to explore the injectables route, regular medical facials can lay the groundwork for healthy skin. The effect of optimising lifestyle factors like sleep, stress, fitness, diet and hydration is massively underrated. I spend an enormous amount of time in clinic treating patients on... GLP-1 analogues like Mounjaro who have experienced a reduction in facial volume and skin quality. It's not due to the drugs per se, but just rapid weight loss in general. Biostimulators, which regenerate tissues, are particularly good for this. It's important to keep things like this in mind when losing weight, especially as we get older. The age of ageing gracefully isn't over... it has simply evolved into positive ageing. Many people now see treatments as part of self-care, no different to fitness or skincare. The focus is on looking well and feeling the best you can for your age, not erasing age entirely or trying to look like someone else. The biggest threat to the industry is... the lack of regulation in the UK. Non-medics can perform injectables with no regulatory oversight, which puts patient safety at risk. Stronger regulation is urgently needed to improve conditions for patients and prevent avoidable adverse outcomes."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The discount retailer B&M has seen its market value plunge by almost a fifth after a downgrade of up to £40m in annual profit expectations due to an accounting blunder. The company said its chief financial officer was leaving the business while updating the market on its outlook, which had already been cut earlier this month on the back of tough trading and rising costs, including from budget measures. Mike Schmidt had decided to step down, B&M said. Money latest: Cosmetic doctor reveals most cost-effective treatments Its statement explained: \"The Group's financial half-year end results consolidation process has identified, after the announcement of 7 October 2025, approximately £7m of overseas freight costs not correctly recognised in cost of goods sold, following an operating system update earlier this year. \"The underlying system issue has since been resolved but its financial impact is material to our outlook for FY26.\" It said that as a result, its full-year profits outlook had been revised to a range of £470m-£520m from £510m-£560m. \n                  Inside 'data centre alley' - the biggest story in economics right now\n                 \n                  Pizza Hut to shut 68 restaurants in UK after company behind venues falls into administration\n                 \n                  Money blog: Gaucho slashes waiters' share of service charge - and gives it to head office\n                 \"The Board intends to commission a comprehensive third-party review of this matter\", the company said while adding that Mr Schmidt would remain in his role until a replacement had been identified.  B&M said It still expected like-for-like sales growth to be \"between low-single-digit negative and low-single-digit positive levels\" over the second half of the financial year. Shares fell by more than 18% initially when the markets opened and were later trading 14% lower. The stock was already down by 37% in the year to date ahead of that reaction - with much of the decline booked after its profit warning of 7 October. Shares are trading at levels seen before the COVID pandemic. B&M says it has been battling weaker demand from customers and strong competition across its core UK operation at a time of higher costs from government policy, including April's rise in employer national insurance contributions. A turnaround plan by new chief executive Tjeerd Jegen aims to lower prices, tackle inconsistent pricing, improve availability of popular consumer products and simplify ranges. Analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients: \"Very poor optics for B&M, and an update that erodes trust further, highlighting potential issues in accounting controls and higher-level analytical review/oversight. \"And that is before we unpick how a £7m Q2 miss translates into a £40m FY downgrade.\" "

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The UK is ready to spend \"well over\" £100m on a possible deployment of British forces to Ukraine if Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, the defence secretary has said. John Healey also said Vladimir Putin views Britain as his \"number one enemy\" because of the country's support for Ukraine. The defence secretary's plan includes the preparation of military personnel to join a multinational force that would be sent to help secure Ukraine's borders if the US president brokers a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv. He signalled British troops could be ready to deploy as soon as that happened and he said this could include soldiers on the ground. Some of the anticipated money to prepare for any mission is already being spent. The defence secretary also warned of a \"new era of threat\" and said the risk of wider conflict in Europe has not been as great since the end of the Second World War. Mr Healey used a lecture at Mansion House in London to talk about efforts led by the UK and France to build a \"coalition of the willing\" of more than 30 nations to form what he called a \"Multinational Force Ukraine\" over the past six months. This force would help to secure Ukraine's skies and seas and train its troops if Russia agrees to halt its full-scale war. \"So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,\" the defence secretary said. \"For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine.\" Asked how much money, he said it would be \"well over\" £100m. Mr Healey trumpeted the UK's support for Ukraine, including a record £4.5bn in assistance this year, and taking over from the United States in co-chairing a wider group of nations that have been sending weapons and money to Kyiv. \"This is why President [Volodymyr]  Zelenskyy calls the UK his closest ally,\" he said. \"This is why Putin ranks Britain as his number one enemy.\" But he warned that as Russia's aggression grew in Ukraine and beyond its borders, \"Britain and our NATO allies stand more unified, and stronger\". Read more:'Ukraine can't win war,' says TrumpUK military to be given powers to shoot down threatening dronesPutin has 'sent signal to Trump that he's ready for Ukraine deal' Giving a stark verdict of the security landscape, Mr Healey said: \"This is - undeniably - a new era of threat. The world is more unstable, more uncertain, more dangerous. Not since the end of the Second World War has Europe's security been at such risk of state-on-state conflict.\" He said this required what he described as \"a new era for defence\". He said: \"This is now an age for hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.\" The defence secretary said plans for the new era would include increasing defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 - though critics have accused the UK and other European allies of playing smoke and mirrors with the target, questioning how much will really be spent on weapons and troops. \"As I look ahead to the rest of this decade, our task, in this new age of hard power is to secure peace in our continent and to forge stronger deterrence and resilience, a New Deal for European security,\" said Mr Healey. Turning to the Middle East, he also announced the UK was sending a two-star military officer to work as the deputy to the US commander, charged with monitoring the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."

        "Content": "The government will allow thousands of rapists, child sex offenders and other violent criminals to be released early from prison, the Conservatives claimed as a row over sentencing law reforms erupted. Ahead of MPs debating the Sentencing Bill, introduced to tackle the growing prison population, on Tuesday, the Tories accused Labour of favouring criminals over victims and said the government's approach is a \"betrayal of victims\". But Labour accused the Conservative Party of \"rank hypocrisy\" over prison overcrowding and the previous government's early release policies. The bill will restrict the use of short sentences and instead strengthen community punishments. It will also include an \"earned progression scheme\", which allows convicts who demonstrate good behaviour to be freed earlier, with enhanced supervision in the community followed by an unsupervised period on licence. There will be a minimum release point of 33% for standard determinate sentences and a 50% minimum for more serious standard determinate sentences - as well as more tagging to monitor offenders in the community.  The Tories claim the bill as it is would mean 85% (6,500) of the most serious jailed offenders could qualify for early release because they are serving standard sentences, while more than 83% of child sex offenders and 62% of convicted rapists would serve reduced sentences. \n                  Government looks utterly weak on Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban - and Tories have smelt blood\n                 \n                  Thatcher at 100: Lavish celebrations to mark the Iron Lady's life, leadership and legacy\n                 \n                  Is it too late for Kemi Badenoch?\n                 They have tabled an amendment to the bill to ensure a carve out for the most serious crimes, so those who commit assault by penetration, rape, grievous bodily harm, stalking and sexual offences against children cannot be released early. Under Labour plans to abolish custodial sentences below 12 months, the Tories calculated up to 43,000 offenders could avoid jail altogether. They said the bill could lead to permanent leniency in sentencing.

What an insult to thousands of victims across the country. \"Anyone who vote for these plans will have to explain exactly why these crimes do not count among the most serious offences. \"The Conservatives will fight this moral rot every step of the way.\" But sentencing minister Jake Richards accused the Tories of \"rank hypocrisy\" as he said the previous government took prisons to \"breaking point\". He said Labour are \"cleaning up the mess\" left by the Tories and accused them of \"feigned outrage\". \"The Conservatives' rank hypocrisy is shameful. They built this crisis, then feigned outrage when the consequences arrived,\" he added. \"They took our prisons to breaking point, released thousands of serious offenders early and pushed Britain to the brink of a situation where police could no longer make arrests and courts could no longer prosecute. \"That would have been a total collapse of law and order. \"Now they attack us for cleaning up the mess they made. They are behaving like arsonists complaining the fire service couldn't stop the flame. \"This Labour government believes in prison and in punishment that cuts crime. \"We're delivering the biggest prison expansion since the Victorians, reforming sentencing to keep the public safe and building a justice system worthy of the name.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was, it was claimed at the time, the election that saved the Labour Party. The brutal battle between Denis Healey and Tony Benn for Labour's deputy leadership in 1981 is said to have shaped UK politics today. Politics latest: Nandy to face MPs over Maccabi ban  Now, 44 years later, could the clash between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell for the job save Sir Keir Starmer's faltering premiership? Or perhaps undermine the PM's leadership and authority even more than they're damaged already? In 1981, former chancellor Denis Healey was the incumbent and the establishment candidate. Tony Benn, the darling of left-wing Labour activists, was the insurgent challenger. 'Independent voice' This time Ms Phillipson, the education secretary, is seen as Sir Keir's candidate - almost certainly a disadvantage - while Ms Powell, sacked in last month's cabinet reshuffle, has told Sky News she could \"provide a stronger, more independent voice\". The 1981 contest was the first fought under an \"electoral college\" giving 40% of votes to the unions, 30% to MPs and 30% to delegates from local parties. These days it's one member, one vote. Previously, the leader and deputy had been chosen by the party's MPs. And in what was seen as a surprise at the time, Mr Healey had lost to the veteran left-winger Michael Foot in the poll of Labour MPs in the leadership election in 1980. In 1981, in a mood of civil war in the party and after a campaign full of allegations of dirty tricks and ballot rigging by the unions, Mr Healey held off Mr Benn's challenge for the deputy leadership by just 50.426% of the votes to 49.574%. 'Popularity without power' As the old bruiser with the most famous bushy eyebrows in politics later admitted: \"I scraped in to victory by a hair of my eyebrow.\" Mr Benn claimed it was a \"staggering result\" and his narrow defeat had given him \"popularity without power\". Given Ms Powell's lead over Ms Phillipson in opinion polls, it will be a surprise if the 2025 result is as close as 1981. But the polls could, of course, be wrong. There have been allegations of dirty tricks in the current contest as well. With just days to go before the winner is announced on Saturday, Ms Powell accused her opponent's team of \"throwing mud\" and briefing against her. Interviewed by Sky News political editor Beth Rigby for the Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Ms Powell attacked a \"Labour source\" who told the New Statesman: \"Lucy was sacked from cabinet because she couldn't be trusted not to brief or leak.\" Asked if her team had briefed against Ms Powell, Ms Phillipson told Beth: \"Not to my knowledge.\" But she said it would be \"destabilising\" if her opponent was elected, as she was no longer in the cabinet. There was \"a risk of airing too much disagreement in public\", she claimed. In a colourful and acerbic account of the 1981 contest in his autobiography, The Time Of My Life, Mr Healey began by noting wryly that Mr Benn announced his decision to fight him for the deputy leadership on April Fool's Day. \"The next six months were the busiest and least agreeable of my life,\" he wrote. \"And it was all for the sake of a job which I found disagreeable and which in itself was not worth having. \"I felt, however, that it was essential to deny it to Tony Benn. If he had become deputy leader there would have been a haemorrhage of Labour defections to the SDP both in parliament and in the country. I do not believe the Labour Party could have recovered.\"  'Impossible for me to be heard' The defections had already begun. Former Labour cabinet ministers Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers had formed the \"Gang of Four\" and launched the SDP with a dozen more former Labour MPs. Alleging dirty tricks during the 1981 campaign, Mr Healey claimed: \"Wherever I went, a group of Militant Tendency supporters followed me round to heckle. \"In Cardiff, there was an orchestrated attempt to howl me down by extremist mobs of Trotskyites and anarchists, whom Tony Benn did nothing to discourage or condemn. \"In my rally in Birmingham, such groups were joined by a mass of IRA supporters who made it quite impossible for me to be heard.\" Mr Healey claimed dirty tricks against him continued right up to the day the electoral college met in Brighton's famous conference centre on Sunday 27 September 1981. After a third candidate, outsider John Silkin, was eliminated, the 1.25 million-strong Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) - now part of Unite - switched to Mr Benn after saying it would abstain, following a decision by the union's delegation on the floor of the conference. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 \"If even that one union's delegation had voted as it know its members wanted it to vote, I would have had a majority of two and a half million,\" Healey claimed in his autobiography. But he went on: \"My victory was a turning point.\" He reported that one of his supporters, Labour MP Giles Radice, had written in his diary that evening: \"Denis Healey has saved the Labour Party.\" But Mr Healey admitted the nature of the campaign and the \"shameless ballot rigging by the trade unions\" did the Labour Party enormous and lasting damage. The SDP \"took off\" and then the Falklands war helped the Tories recover and Margaret Thatcher won the 1983 general election. \"The scale of our defeat was devastating,\" Healey wrote about the 1983 election. \"That Tony Benn lost his seat in Bristol was small compensation.\" 'The most tremendous result' But Mr Healey's opponent, father of the current Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn, saw it very differently in his account of the 1981 contest in his acclaimed diaries. Mr Benn recorded in his diary that as he entered the conference hall at 5pm he was \"prepared for a massive defeat\". But later, recording himself for his diary at 1am in his hotel bathroom so as not to disturb his wife Caroline, he reflected: \"Of course it has been an absolutely staggering result with all the media against us, with the most violent attacks by the shadow cabinet… we got to within 0.8% of victory. \"It was the best possible result because if I had won by 0.8% people would have shouted 'cheat', but Healey can't shout cheat because he won … It is the most tremendous result.\" Mr Benn said Caroline told him: \"'You've got popularity without power, which is what you want' … It was a shrewd comment... perhaps on me personally. But at the same time it was a terrific result.\" And Mr Benn's campaign to drag the party to the left was only just beginning. The 1980s saw left-wing disciples including Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott elected as MPs, followed in the 1990s by Corbyn ally John McDonnell, and later Mr Corbyn's election as Labour leader in 2015.

The nominations threshold of 80 MPs saw to that. Ms Powell has been called \"soft left\" and Ms Phillipson is one of Sir Keir's most loyal cabinet allies and sometimes described as a Blairite. Ms Philipson hasn't been afraid, either, to suggest Ms Powell is a dangerous left-wing insurgent. \"Members might want to consider why a group that caused so much damage to the Labour Party over many years is backing my opponent,\" Ms Phillipson said after the pro-Corbyn group Momentum endorsed her rival. Left-wingers, however, claim this contest, triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation, is an uninspiring choice, unlike 1981. It is, however, the first time since 1981 that an election only for deputy leader has been held. Normally, the leader and deputy are elected at the same time. In no way is Phillipson versus Powell a repeat of the 1981 civil war between the hard left and the old right, which did indeed shape Labour's future. But some inside the party believe this election will do that as well and be just as significant."

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n The armed forces will receive new powers to shoot down drones that threaten military bases in the UK, the defence secretary will reveal. John Healey will use a speech on Monday evening to warn of the growing threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles following an incursion into Polish airspace of 19 Russian drones in September and escalating Russian drone attacks against targets in Ukraine. \"Here at home, we continue to defend ourselves daily from threats reaching from the seabed to cyberspace,\" he will say at the Lord Mayor of London Defence and Security Lecture, according to excerpts of the speech released by the Ministry of Defence. They were first reported by The Telegraph. \"We will always do what's needed to keep the British people safe, and as we speak, we are developing new powers - to be put into law through our Armed Forces Bill - to shoot down unidentified drones over UK military sites.\" The military does have the ability to open fire in the event of a serious threat to one of their bases, according to a defence source. The move announced by Mr Healey is designed to strengthen these powers so soldiers can act faster in response to a drone threat, rather than be worried about bureaucratic, peacetime red tape. During the Cold War, military bases were on alert for attacks targeting the British mainland. But this is a sense of war-readiness that has been allowed to fade following the collapse of the Soviet Union when successive governments no longer believed there was a threat to the UK that required the armed forces to be prepared to defend themselves in an instant. That is changing. The government's new National Security Strategy - published in June - warned: \"For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario.\" The potential for direct confrontation between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the UK and its NATO allies rose last month with the Russian drone incursions into Poland as well as revelations about Russian warplanes violating Estonian airspace. Unidentified drones have also caused chaos in Denmark and Germany in recent weeks. In addition, a year ago, a number of drones were spotted over several American air bases in the UK. Read more: 'Europe lacks defences to protect itself against Russia' Mr Healey will outline how the UK has moved to support its NATO allies following the latest drone and aircraft violations by Russia. This includes RAF jets extending a deployment to help defend Poland's skies until the end of the year. In addition, Britain deployed specialist RAF counter drone experts to Denmark last month, equipped with advanced kit to detect, track, identify, and, if needed, defeat hostile drones. Read more from Sky News:Huge internet outage knocks out multiple websitesPrince Andrew's disgrace and downfall is not over yet  Russia's war in Ukraine has seen an exponential increase in drone warfare by both sides. In September alone, around 5,500 one-way attack drones were launched by Russia into Ukraine - over a thousand more than were fired in August, according to the latest Defence Intelligence assessment. So far in October, over 3,000 one-way attack drones have already been launched."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  If you ever fly to Washington DC, look out of the window as you land at Dulles Airport - and you might snatch a glimpse of the single biggest story in economics right now. There below you, you will see scattered around the fields and woods of the local area a set of vast warehouses that might to the untrained eye look like supermarkets or distribution centres. But no: these are in fact data centres - the biggest concentration of data centres anywhere in the world. For this area surrounding Dulles Airport has more of these buildings, housing computer servers that do the calculations to train and run artificial intelligence (AI), than anywhere else. And since AI accounts for the vast majority of economic growth in the US so far this year, that makes this place an enormous deal. Down at ground level you can see the hallmarks as you drive around what is known as \"data centre alley\". There are enormous power lines everywhere - a reminder that running these plants is an incredibly energy-intensive task. This tiny area alone, Loudoun County, consumes roughly 4.9 gigawatts of power - more than the entire consumption of Denmark. That number has already tripled in the past six years, and is due to be catapulted ever higher in the coming years. Inside 'data centre alley' We know as much because we have gained rare access into the heart of \"data centre alley\", into two sites run by Digital Realty, one of the biggest datacentre companies in the world. It runs servers that power nearly all the major AI and cloud services in the world. If you send a request to one of those models or search engines there's a good chance you've unknowingly used their machines yourself. Their Digital Dulles site, under construction right now, is due to consume up to a gigawatt in power all told, with six substations to help provide that power. Indeed, it consumes about the same amount of power as a large nuclear power plant. Walking through the site, a series of large warehouses, some already equipped with rows and rows of backup generators, there to ensure the silicon chips whirring away inside never lose power, is a striking experience - a reminder of the physical underpinnings of the AI age. For all that this technology feels weightless, it has enormous physical demands. It entails the construction of these massive concrete buildings, each of which needs enormous amounts of power and water to keep the servers cool. Read more from Ed Conway:Blow to UK's bid to become minerals superpowerThere's more to your AirPods than meets the eye We were given access inside one of the company's existing server centres - behind multiple security cordons into rooms only accessible with fingerprint identification. And there we saw the infrastructure necessary to keep those AI chips running. We saw an Nvidia DGX H100 running away, in a server rack capable of sucking in more power than a small village. We saw the cooling pipes running in and out of the building, as well as the ones which feed coolant into the GPUs (graphic processing units) themselves. Such things underline that to the extent that AI has brainpower, it is provided not out of thin air, but via very physical amenities and infrastructure. And the availability of that infrastructure is one of the main limiting factors for this economic boom in the coming years. According to economist Jason Furman, once you subtract AI and related technologies, the US economy barely grew at all in the first half of this year. So much is riding on this. But there are some who question whether the US is going to be able to construct power plants quickly enough to fuel this boom.  For years, American power consumption remained more or less flat. That has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. Now, AI companies have made grand promises about future computing power, but that depends on being able to plug those chips into the grid. Last week the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned AI could indeed be a financial bubble. He said: \"There are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. It was the internet then… it is AI now. We're seeing surging valuations, booming investment and strong consumption on the back of solid capital gains. The risk is that with stronger investment and consumption, a tighter monetary policy will be needed to contain price pressures. This is what happened in the late 1990s.\" 'The terrifying thing is…' For those inside the AI world, this also feels like uncharted territory. Helen Toner, executive director of Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and formerly on the OpenAI board, said: \"The terrifying thing is: no one knows how much further AI is going to go, and no one really knows how much economic growth is going to come out of it. \"The trends have certainly been that the AI systems we are developing get more and more sophisticated over time, and I don't see signs of that stopping. I think they'll keep getting more advanced. But the question of how much productivity growth will that create? How will that compare to the absolutely gobsmacking investments that are being made today?\" Whether it's a new industrial revolution or a bubble - or both - there's no denying AI is a massive economic story with massive implications. For energy. For materials. For jobs. We just don't know how massive yet."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology reporter\n       The internet appears to be recovering after a major outage knocked out thousands of websites, including Amazon, Snapchat, Reddit and several banks. Downdetector, a website that tracks complaints about outages, showed thousands of problems on Monday morning. The issue originates from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which describes itself as \"the world's most comprehensive\" cloud service. Internet outage - as it happened It offers companies a virtual backbone, giving them access to servers, databases and storage without having to build their own infrastructure. Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS and everything from Amazon's Alexa to the Bank of Scotland to crypto company Coinbase, Duolingo, Fortnite, Halifax, HMRC, Lloyds Bank, Roblox and more were affected by this morning's issue. Technology correspondent Amazon is the cloud provider for so many companies that when it sneezes, the internet catches a cold. Despite the name, the cloud is really just a collection of data centres - that is, a collection of computers stored in warehouses. The problem here is apparently a DNS issue related to Amazon's data centres in North Virginia. DNS is the address book for the internet so this means that Amazon has a connection problem.  The data centre itself might be fine, but all those apps and websites can't find it. It's like a postman trying to post a letter when the address has rubbed off.  The fact that this is happening in Amazon's largest data centre complex makes the ripples even bigger. For various reasons - cheap electricity, proximity to Washington DC, access to undersea cables - North Virginia has become a global centre for cloud storage, so an issue there has the capacity to affect anyone who depends on the internet.\n These days, as we're seeing, that's almost everyone. Read more: What's affected by internet outage - all we know so far In the US, there were long queues at LaGuardia airport in New York as check-in kiosks appeared to be failing and apps were down, according to The New York Times. Some reservations weren't showing up on airline apps, and customers complained on social media that they couldn't drop their bags, CNBC reported. The United Airlines' website was among the sites that users reported issues with on Downdetector, which tracks internet outages. What has Amazon Web Services said? The UK government told Sky News it was \"aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services\" after HMRC was among those affected by the outage. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible,\" said the spokesperson. Around three hours after the problems began, AWS issued an update saying its engineers were \"seeing significant signs of recovery\". \"Most requests should now be succeeding,\" it said, although it added it was working through a \"backlog\" of requests. By 11.35am UK time, it said the issue was fully resolved, although their services might run slowly because of a backlog of requests built up over the morning. 'I haven't been able to log in' Hundreds of Sky News readers got in touch to tell us how they had been affected by this morning's outage. \"I deliver parcels for Amazon Flex and I haven't been able to log in to my account all morning to be able to go to work today,\" said Marie Louise. A worried Snapchat user told us they have a \"1,321 day streak, which I don't want to lose, and I also have 14 years of Memories on there which I don't want to lose.\" And one reader took it as an opportunity for a little treat: \"MyFitnessPal is down. I guess the calories don't count this morning, right?\" wrote Callum. If you're affected by the outage, you're partly at the mercy of AWS to get their services back up and running, but there are things you can do in the meantime. \n Hayley Andrews Smith, an automations specialist at Myriad, advised people on LinkedIn to check their business's automated processes as \"anything hosted on AWS might be affected\".\n\n She also suggested pausing critical workflows until the systems are back up. \n\n You should also keep your guard up for scammers.  When Vodafone's internet services went down last week, users were immediately plagued by scammers pretending to be customer service agents.  \"When companies rush to restore access, systems and staff are stretched thin — and that's when attackers strike,\" said Charlotte Wilson from cybersecurity firm CheckPoint. \"Expect a spike in fake 'refund' or 'discount' offers, phishing emails, and scam links claiming to fix the problem.\" Check email and web addresses from anyone saying they're contacting you from AWS and do not click on any links you aren't sure about. Should Europe rely on US tech firms? Coinbase, the world's biggest bitcoin custodian and the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange, has told customers \"all funds are safe\" after the outage and reassured users that their team was working on the issue. Cori Crider, the executive director of the thinktank Future of Technology Institute, said the outage shows Europe \"can no longer afford to run the majority of its critical infrastructure on US tech monopolies like Amazon Web Services\". \"The last time this happened, the Crowdstrike outage did billions of damage to Europe's economy in a single day. How much harm will be done this time?\" Last July, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike accidentally brought parts of the world to a standstill when a software update introduced a bug. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices. Although it took just 78 minutes for the company to identify the problem and start rolling out a fix, the impact of the outage lasted far longer. In the UK, the CrowdStrike outage left GPs unable to access systems that manage appointments or allow them to view patient records or even send prescriptions to pharmacies. Flights were cancelled or delayed and passengers were left stranded as airline systems were knocked offline or staff were forced to handwrite boarding passes and luggage tags."

        "Content": "Dozens of websites, banks and apps have been affected by a major internet outage.  The problem, which started on Monday morning, is related to an issue at Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of 5pm (UK time), there were more than 9,300 reports of the Amazon Web Services outage, according to Downdetector, which monitors issues and outages in real-time. After more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online by early evening, but AWS said it was still working on recovering connectivity. Just before midday, AWS said it had fixed the underlying problem, but said it had a backlog the system would need to deal with. Here's what we know so far. What has been affected? Multiple banks, the UK's Government Gateway services - which is accessed through the Gov.uk website and includes things like HMRC, universal credit and pensions - mobile phone networks and video-chatting platform Zoom are among the websites that reported technical issues. A UK government spokesperson said: \"We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. \"Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\" A Lloyds Bank spokesperson also apologised for issues affecting customers, adding: \"We are seeing services coming back online and continue to work to see that happens as quickly as possible.\" All Amazon products - including Prime Video, Alexa and Amazon Music - have also been affected, as well as the main Amazon website.

AWS confirmed it was suffering from \"increased error rates and latencies\" for multiple services. The company said its engineers were \"immediately engaged\" as soon as they spotted the issue. It said the error was caused by a problem with companies connecting to data services at AWS's data centres in northern Virginia. Science and technology reporter Amazon Web Services was named as the cause of the problem by the chief executive of AI company Perplexity.  Aravind Srinivas posted on X saying: \"Perplexity is down right now. The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it.\" AWS describes itself as \"the world's most comprehensive\" cloud service.  It offers companies a virtual backbone, giving them access to servers, databases and storage without having to build their own infrastructure.  Millions of businesses are thought to use AWS, so when something goes wrong, it can have a huge impact. AWS hasn't put out any information on the outage. Sky News has contacted the company for comment.  There are still some problems with a server service called EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Steps to resolve these issues resulted in some early signs of recovery across a few data centres, AWS said in an update on its status page. It said it is taking similar steps at the remaining locations and expects the problems to subside - but did not give a timeline as to how long that could take. It recommended anyone still seeing problems with DynamoDB to \"flush their DNS caches\", which will refresh the connection.

        "Content": "People who lost their sight due to a common, previously untreatable age-related condition can now read again, thanks to a ground-breaking electronic eye implant. The tiny device, measuring just 2mm by 2mm and half the thickness of a human hair, represents a \"paradigm shift\" in artificial vision, experts say. They are optimistic the technology could eventually be offered through the NHS. Fitted under the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue in the eye, it allows patients to see letters, numbers and words through an eye that was previously blind. Thanks to the so-called \"prosthetic vision\", some patients are now even able to complete crosswords and read the small print on prescription labels. The device, known as Prima, has been \"life-changing\" for patients, said Mahi Muqit, senior vitreoretinal consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology. \"I have all these patients who are blind, and when you see them, they want to know: is there anything that can restore vision?\" he said. \"And the answer has always been no,\" said Mr Muqit. \n                  Families of domestic abuse victims are at breaking point - today they hope for answers\n                 \n                  Louvre robbery: 'Matter of time' before thieves struck, expert says - and UK museums could be next\n                 \n                  Reality of life inside the classroom - as Boris Johnson set to face COVID inquiry\n                 That answer has now changed, he said. \"We've got some patients who are now reading books. Their quality of life is much higher.\" The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest 84% of patients in the trial were able to read letters, numbers and words while using Prima. On average, they could read five lines on a vision chart, whereas before the device was fitted, some could not even see the chart. How the Prima device works The ground-breaking global trial included 38 patients across 17 sites in five countries, including the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands. All participants had a condition known as geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). GA, which affects approximately five million people worldwide, can lead to complete vision loss as the central part of the retina - the macula - deteriorates. Experts estimate that around one in four people who are legally blind in the UK have GA resulting from AMD. Those who took part in the study had lost central vision in the tested eye and retained only limited peripheral vision. Surgeons performed a vitrectomy, removing the eye's jelly-like substance, and placed the tiny 2mm chip under the retina.

The camera sends an infrared beam to the chip, activating it. AI in the computer processes the image and converts it into an electrical signal, which travels through the retina and optic nerve to the brain, where it is interpreted as vision. 'New era' in artificial vision The procedures took place at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London around three years ago and lasted under two hours. Sheila Irvine, one of Moorfields' patients who took part in the trial, said that before the operation her vision \"was like having two black discs\" in her eyes, \"with the outside distorted\". She can now read her prescriptions, do crosswords and read the ingredients on tins. \"There was no pain during the operation, but you're still aware of what's happening,\" Ms Irvine said. \"It's a new way of looking through your eyes, and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter.\" Mr Muqit said the prima device allows patients who may feel depressed and socially isolated \"to start to function and pick up things that they used to enjoy\". \"In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era,\" Mr Muqit said. \"Blind patients are actually able to have meaningful central vision restoration, which has never been done before.\""

Dr Gorman said there are many examples of empty rocket fuel tanks which have returned to the Earth's surface without burning up. \"People often find them years later,\" she added. \"So this one's a bit unusual because it was found pretty quickly.\" Read more from Sky News:UK military to be given powers to shoot down dronesHuge internet outage knocks out multiple websites  In May, a car-sized piece of Soviet rocket crashed back to Earth after 53 years in orbit.

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment correspondent\n        A prominent expert in recovering stolen works of art has told Sky News it was \"a matter of time\" before the Louvre was targeted - and UK museums could be next. Christopher Marinello says gangs have been emboldened to strike because \"law enforcement has been driven into the ground\". And while headlines have focused on thieves making off with priceless jewellery from an iconic French institution, he warns this problem isn't confined to Paris. He said: \"There are gangs operating all over Europe and not enough is being done to stop them … this was only a matter of time, they've been hitting small museums. \"If they can hit the Louvre successfully, they can hit anything. Do you know how many museums there are in the UK?\" At the start of October, at the St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales, it took just four minutes for audacious thieves to swipe irreplaceable Bronze Age jewellery. He says gangs are targeting gold \"just to melt it down\" and diamonds for their value - \"with no regard for the integrity of the artworks and the cultural heritage that they are destroying\". A spokesperson for the museum has said: \"We sympathise deeply with our friends at the Louvre … it emphasises the increased risk to organisations like ours … this highlights the dilemma we face between having items on display for people to enjoy and learn from - or keeping them locked away.\"  Mr Marinello, who investigates art crimes that the police aren't pursuing, says institutions and stately homes urgently need to wake up to what's happening. \"They need to start building vaults for these objects because otherwise they're going to be taken and melted down and used to buy Lamborghinis or drugs,\" he warned. \"If the smaller museums can't afford it, perhaps they're going to have to consolidate collections to museums that can handle it.\" Read more:Staff 'repeatedly warned about security shortcomings''Race against time' to recover 'priceless' jewels 'You can't trust anyone' Mr Marinello went on to warn that gangs are becoming \"more brazen\" - with the Louvre targeted despite the security measures it had in place. \"The system is not working … the penalties are not strong enough … police are frustrated, prosecutors say the same thing because there's nowhere to put these people.\" The art recovery expert says he's concerned how funding cutbacks are making our museums more vulnerable to those who recognise that the obvious rewards outweigh the risks. \"These museums are designed to preserve and protect our cultural heritage, and they need to be properly funded to do that job,\" he added. \"They need to be able to stay one step ahead of the criminals.\" \"This is not the 1950s any more, you can't trust anyone. These items are so valuable, and gold is at an all-time high. \"[Thieves] don't care if an item belonged to Napoleon III, it means nothing to them. All they care about is quick cash.\""

        "Content": "\n          Arts and entertainment reporter\n              @BethanyMinelle\n  One of Harper Lee's surviving relatives says it's possible there could be major unpublished works by the author still to be discovered, following the release of eight of her previously unseen short stories. Describing the mystery around a manuscript titled The Long Goodbye, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird, Lee's nephew, Dr Edwin Conner, told Sky News: \"Even the family doesn't know everything that remains in her papers. So, it could be there waiting to be published.\" Dr Conner says Lee submitted a 111-page manuscript, titled The Long Goodbye, after writing Go Set A Watchman in 1957. The retired English professor explains: \"It's not clear to me or to others in the family, to what extent [The Long Goodbye] might have been integrated into To Kill a Mockingbird, which she wrote immediately after, or to what extent it was a freestanding manuscript that is altogether different and that might stand to be published in the future.\" A second mystery exists in the form of a true crime novel, The Reverend, which Lee was known to have begun researching in the late 1970s, about Alabama preacher Reverend Willie Maxwell who was accused of five murders before being murdered himself. Dr Conner said: \"The manuscript of a nonfiction piece, that according to some people doesn't exist, according to others who claim to have seen it, does [is also a mystery]. We don't know where it is, or whether it is, really. \"That could be a surprise that has yet to be revealed if we discover it and it's published, which is a real possibility.\" \n                  Shopaholic author Sophie Kinsella reveals aggressive brain cancer diagnosis\n                 \n                  Harvard University library removes human skin from 19th century book binding \n                 \n                  British children 'have less space' to be kids, award-winning author says\n                 He believes much of the manuscript was written in his family home and says his mother, Louise, who was Lee's older sister, saw a \"finished version of it\" on the dining room table. Dr Conner says there are \"others who just as fiercely say no, it was never completed\". 'She did want to publish these stories' There has long been debate over why Lee published just two books in her lifetime. To Kill a Mockingbird came out in 1960. Selling more than 46 million copies worldwide, translated into more than 40 languages and winning a Pulitzer Prize, it's arguably the most influential American book of the 20th century. Fifty-five years later, Lee published a sequel, Go Set A Watchman, written ahead of Mockingbird, but set at a later date. Then aged 88, and with failing health, there were questions over how much influence Lee had over the decision to publish. Asked how happy she'd be to see some of her earliest work, containing early outlines for Mockingbird's narrator Jean Louise Finch and the story's hero Atticus Finch, now hitting the shelves, Dr Conner says: \"I think she'd be delighted.\" He says Lee had presented them to her first agent, Maurice Crane, at their first meeting in 1956, \"precisely because she did want to publish these stories\". And while dubbing them \"apprentice stories,\" which he admits \"don't represent her at her best as a writer,\" he says they show \"literary genius of a kind\". Notoriously private, he says the stories - which were discovered neatly typed out in one of Lee's New York apartments after her death - offer \"deeply enthralling new glimpses into her as a person\". Never marrying or having children, he says Lee maintained a degree of privacy even with her family: \"You never saw her complete personality… We thought we knew her, we thought we'd seen everything, but no, we hadn't.\" 'That's it, I'm not giving any more interviews' While describing her as a \"complicated woman,\" he insists Lee was far from the recluse she's frequently painted as. He says: \"In company, she was most of the time delightful. She was a lively personality, she was funny, witty, and you would think she was very outgoing.\" But Lee was known to have struggled with her success. Dr Conner explains: \"She never ever wanted fame or celebrity because she suspected, or knew, that would involve the kind of uncomfortable situations in public situations that she found just no satisfaction or pleasure in\". He says while in the early years of Mockingbird Lee gave interviews, the wild success of the book soon rendered such promotion unnecessary, leading her to decide: \"That's it, I'm not giving any more interviews\". While he admits she was subsequently much happier, he goes on: \"Not that she was a recluse, as some people thought. She wasn't at all a recluse, but she didn't enjoy public appearances and interviews particularly. She wanted the work to speak for itself.\" 'Deeply hurt' by Truman Capote Famously close to Truman Capote, one of the pieces in Lee's newly released collection is a profile of her fellow author. Dr Conner says that piece - a love-letter of sorts, describing Capote's literary achievements - is all the more remarkable because at the point Lee wrote it in 1966, when she and Capote \"were not even on speaking terms\". He says Lee \"probably knew [Capote] better than any other person alive when that was written\", adding, \"she did love him as a friend very much, even when he was not speaking to her\". Friends since childhood - and the prototype for the character of Dill in Mockingbird - Capote later hired Lee to help him research his 1965 true crime novel In Cold Blood. Despite his book's relative success, Dr Conner believes Capote was \"bitter\" over the fact Mockingbird far eclipsed it in accolades and recognition. \"He had been writing for much longer. He felt that he was at least as good as she was, and he was very envious of her success\". Dr Conner says Lee was \"deeply hurt\" at Capote's rejection of her, never speaking about him in later life. Recalling his own meeting with Capote many years later, Dr Conner says he \"got a personal sense of how [Capote] could charm the socks off of anybody, male or female\". He says it was noteworthy that while Capote asked about his mother, who he had been fond of, he \"never once mentioned\" Harper. Sky News has contacted Lee's lawyer and the executor of her estate, Tonya Carter, for comment. The Land of Sweet Forever: Stories and Essays, by Harper Lee is on sale from Tuesday"

        "Content": " Metropolitan Police is to stop investigating \"non-crime hate incidents\" to \"reduce ambiguity\" after prosecutors dropped a case against Graham Linehan. Linehan, 57, will face no further action after being arrested over his social media posts about transgender people. The Father Ted and IT Crowd creator said his lawyers had been told the case wouldn't proceed. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed the move. Linehan, 57, was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence when he landed at Heathrow from his home in the US on 1 September. The incident drew criticism of the police and government from some politicians and free-speech campaigners.

Posting on X, Linehan announced : \"After a successful hearing to get my bail conditions lifted (one which the police officer in charge of the case didn't even bother to attend) the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped the case. \n                  Graham Linehan says satire is 'dying' and that he wouldn't be able to make Father Ted today\n                 \n                  Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan's trial begins after allegation he harassed transgender activist\n                 \n                  Graham Linehan and cancel culture: Is comedy becoming bland?\n                 \"With the aid of the Free Speech Union, I still aim to hold the police accountable for what is only the latest attempt to silence and suppress gender critical voices on behalf of dangerous and disturbed men.\" The union said it had hired a \"top flight team of lawyers to sue the Met for wrongful arrest, among other things\". \"The police need to be taught a lesson that they cannot allow themselves to be continually manipulated by woke activists,\" it added. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson confirmed it had reviewed the case file and decided \"no further action\" would be taken. In one of his posts, Linehan wrote: \"If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls.\" Another was a photo of a trans-rights protest, with the comment \"a photo you can smell\", and a follow-up post saying: \"I hate them. Misogynists and homophobes. F*** em\". A Met Police statement after the case was dropped acknowledged \"concern\" around Linehan's arrest. It added: \"The commissioner has been clear he doesn't believe officers should be policing toxic culture war debates, with current laws and rules on inciting violence online leaving them in an impossible position. \"As a result, the Met will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents. \"We believe this will provide clearer direction for officers, reduce ambiguity and enable them to focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations.\" A non-crime hate incident (NCHI) involves an act perceived to be motivated - wholly or partly - by hostility or prejudice towards someone over a particular characteristic, such as their race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or transgender identity. They can often take the form of abusive or insulting social media activity which doesn't meet the threshold for a crime. For example, there is no physical threat to someone, or an incitement to harm them. For something to be a hate crime, it has to be an actual offence - such as an assault, vandalism, harassment, or threats - motivated by prejudice against someone with one of the characteristics listed above. The Home Office advises a \"common sense\" and proportionate approach to police recording an NCHI. It says \"even where the speech is potentially offensive, a person has the right to express personally held views in a lawful manner\" - including through controversial humour and satire. An NCHI should only be recorded against someone if it will mitigate a real risk of significant harm in the future, or of a criminal offence being committed. Linehan said on his blog that he was arrested by five armed officers and had to go to A&E after his blood pressure reached \"stroke territory\" during his interrogation. Police said the officers' guns were never drawn and were only present as Linehan was detained by the aviation unit, which routinely carries firearms.

        "Headline": "Serialised productions split into episodes of roughly a minute, viewed only on smartphones, are sweeping China.",
        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n  It was a pretty wild morning. In the space of just a few hours, we witnessed a gangland killing, a jewellery heist and stepped onboard a private jet. We observed a billionaire CEO at work, a dramatic family showdown in a hospital and a drunken karaoke party. It was all part of a tour around a massive Chinese facility producing what are known as vertical micro-dramas. To describe the experience as somewhat dizzying is an understatement. If you haven't heard of them, micro-dramas are a new cultural sensation sweeping not just China but the world, a remarkable example of China's booming soft power. They are essentially serialised productions split into episodes of roughly a minute, shot in vertical and viewed solely on smartphones. Think soap operas for the TikTok generation. 'Secret surrogate to the Mafia King' The story lines are sensational and melodramatic with titles that border the ridiculous; 'Ex-Convict nanny and Billionaire single dad', 'Pregnant by my Tough Daddy CEO' and 'Secret Surrogate to the Mafia King', just some examples. The action is fast and the characters simplistic, while autoplay and multiple mini cliff hangers are designed to provide an addictive dopamine hit. It's a format which has sprung to life in just the last few years, developed initially in China in the wake of the pandemic, and its success has been extraordinary. Some of the most-watched titles have hundreds of millions of views and downloads of short drama apps were over six times higher in the first quarter of 2025 than that same period last year, according to data from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. The Chinese government recently revealed that over 50% of all internet users in China have watched a micro-drama, more than have ordered food online or used a ride-hailing service. 'You can easily binge five or six episodes on the subway commute' \"People's lives are so stressful and packed these days,\" explains Ji Jingdong, a producer of micro-dramas who made the switch from traditional film around three years ago. \"When you watch vertical-screen content, you can easily binge five or six episodes on the subway commute, right? And let's face it, you're barely halfway through an ordinary TV episode before you reach your stop. \"Scrolling through vertical screens at a fast pace is actually pretty stress-relieving. Especially those so-called 'mindless dramas' - they're incredibly relaxing to watch.\" That mass appeal, paired with extremely fast turnaround times and no-frills production is translating into massive revenues. Read more from Sky News:Tel Aviv football derby cancelled after 'violent riots'Eight 'priceless' objects stolen in Louvre museum heist Last year, the industry revenue was an astonishing $6.9bn, for the first time exceeding the value of the Chinese box office. Its figure is almost 14 times as high as in 2021, just three years ago. But with this huge reach and revenues comes both challenge and opportunity for a system like China where everything including cultural products is strictly controlled. 1,200 series taken down Indeed in February of this year over 1,200 series were taken down, deemed too \"vulgar\" or inappropriate, while a wave of new regulations now require projects over a certain value to have government approval. In addition there are initiatives to encourage production houses to make dramas that promote certain values such as 'Learn the law with Micro-Short Dramas' and 'Explore intangible cultural heritage through micro short dramas'. It's a framework they are aware of at the Meigao Micro Drama Super Factory, in the southeastern city of Quzhou. This 67,000 square metre facility was initially constructed as a COVID quarantine hotel, but it now houses around 200 different sets where multiple crews can shoot their dramas simultaneously. There is almost any indoor environment you could imagine - from a bank, courthouse and subway to a ballroom, office and multiple home environments. The CEO Dai Wenxue explains with pride how they made 500 micro-dramas last year. But there is also a clear acknowledgement that the transformation of this venue was achieved with local government support, and that this massive Chinese success story also serves a political purpose. Aligning with 'the nation's overarching strategic vision' \"The early phase emphasised growth, with the government taking a relatively relaxed but not lax approach,\" he explains. \"Now, the focus has shifted toward premium production, cultural exports and telling compelling Chinese stories. \"This aligns with the nation's overarching strategic vision. That's the current landscape.\" Indeed, while the majority of productions are fun and frivolous, for its critics, the industry is a perfect propaganda tool. This autumn, in fact, saw a huge boom in government-encouraged patriotic war productions to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two and a huge accompanying military parade in Beijing. All this mattered because the format is now being aggressively exported abroad. Almost all production houses worth their salt are leaning into English language productions. Meigao is in fact building an entire second location with American-style scenes. And it's no wonder when you look at the numbers. According to analysis undertaken by Sensor Tower, in the first quarter of 2025, downloads in the US had gone up 54% compared to the same period in 2024. In Latin America it was 69% and in India a remarkable 113%. 'A huge uptick' \"So in the past 10 months, right after the Chinese New Year, there was definitely a huge uptick,\" says Max Olsen, an American actor living in Beijing. For him and other Western actors there has been a hugely noticeable boom in work . \"A bunch of productions decided that they were going to shoot, you know, they're going to produce one a week. \"Obviously, with money, with eyeballs, with attention, comes a degree of power.\"  There are of course questions about how this type of soft power translates and what China could or would do with it. But it is just one of a number of cultural exports playing into a trend of China positioning itself as accessible and relatable, even 'cool'. Indeed for such a new format there is clearly still results yet to be seen. \"I don't think the double-digit growth will continue forever,\" says Olsen. \"But I suspect in five years' time, we'll have a very established industry.\""
