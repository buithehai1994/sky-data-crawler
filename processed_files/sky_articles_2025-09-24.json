        "Content": " A gunman who carried out a fatal shooting at an immigration facility in the US left a bullet engraved with the phrase \"ANTI-ICE\", the FBI has said. The deadly attack at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, Texas, is being investigated as an act of \"targeted violence\". Donald Trump said he had been briefed, describing the attacker as \"deranged\" and the shooting as \"despicable\". Referencing what he called \"continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists\", the US president said he would be signing an executive order this week to \"dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks\". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said one detainee had died while two others were in a critical condition. The attacker also died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officials have named the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, Sky's US partner NBC News reported. Jahn's brother Noah told NBC his sibling \"didn't have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew\". \"I didn't think he was politically interested,\" he added. \"He wasn't interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.\" How did the attack unfold? The gunman opened fire on the office from an adjacent building at about 6.40am local time, officers said. He \"fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot\", according to the DHS. Dallas FBI Special Agent Joseph Rothrock said it was a \"coordinated attack\" and \"just the most recent example we've seen of targeted violence\". Early evidence suggested the incident was \"anti-ICE in nature\", he added. A recovered, unspent shell casing was engraved with the phrase \"ANTI ICE\", said FBI director Kash Patel. He said an initial review of evidence showed an \"ideological motive behind this attack\", describing the assault as \"despicable\". The victims were being led into the building to be processed and repatriated, Fox News reported, citing Dallas police Department sources. Arianny Sierra told NBC News she was in her car with her nine-year-old son when a series of shots rang out. \"There were like 20 shots in a row,\" she said. \"I sheltered myself under the car with my son.\" Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said the shooting would \"not slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants\". He added: \"We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.\" US correspondent The shooting at an ICE field office bears the hallmarks of a politically motivated attack. The gunman took a sniper approach, firing indiscriminately from an adjacent rooftop, and left an unspent bullet casing inscribed \"ANTI-ICE\". These elements suggest a planned assault rather than a spontaneous act, hence the FBI branding it \"targeted violence\". They regard it as an attempt to make a symbolic point, rather than a random crime. The motive has not been definitively established, and whether this is part of a broader radicalised trend or an isolated attack is unclear. The fact that the victims were not ICE agents only adds to the confusion. But the attack escalates political tensions around immigration, rhetoric from both sides creating a charged environment. The assassination of Charlie Kirk two weeks ago prompted calls for a toning-down of the rhetoric. But America is confronting once more how often political difference becomes political violence here. US Vice President JD Vance said: \"The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. \"I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.\" No ICE agents were shot or hurt, NBC News reported. US Attorney General Ken Paxton said: \"We will continue to do everything in our power to combat the alarming increase of targeted attacks against ICE and all law enforcement by evil, twisted individuals.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump is right that European countries should stop buying Russian oil and gas, one of the EU's top officials has told Sky News. Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, European Commission vice president Kaja Kallas said it was of \"great regret\" that this was still happening among some of the bloc's member states. The commission has proposed legislation to phase out Russian imports of its oil and gas by 1 January 2028, as Brussels tries to cut its decades-old energy relations with Moscow following Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Most European countries stopped importing Russian crude oil in 2022 and Russian fuel in 2023, but crude imports by Hungary and Slovakia have continued. Ms Kallas, who is the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said of Mr Trump's energy call: \"Of course he has a point. I mean, we have been saying this for quite some time, that the dependency on Russian oil and gas is actually also fuelling the war. \"But you have to see that we have done a lot to diminish that, really, to get rid of Russian oil and gas. And there are a few countries who are still buying oil and also there America has leverage because they are also good friends of America. \"Neighbours around those countries have also proposed alternatives, so we can do this.\" \n                  Trump rages against three 'very sinister events' at UN and says Secret Service is investigating\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy's UN speech was a warning and a plea - as he knows Trump can turn on a dime\n                 \n                  Trump makes major shift in Ukraine policy\n                 Ms Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, does not think NATO and EU members Hungary or Slovakia should be sanctioned, but instead they should \"really build on the alternatives that neighbours are providing them to get rid of the Russian oil and gas like President Trump has asked\". She added that \"the neighbouring countries are providing or offering different alternative routes. The thing is that this oil and gas is just cheaper…\" She continued: \"It is of great regret that we haven't been able to put all these member states in the same position… getting rid of the Russian oil and gas.\" On Wednesday, Slovakia pushed back on pressure it is facing to cut back its purchases of Russian energy, saying it was ready to discuss the issue, but singled out some European states for increasing their gas purchases from Moscow. Slovakian foreign minister Juraj Blanar said there was hypocrisy in criticising his country when liquefied natural gas purchases from Russia to Western Europe had increased by 30% over the last year. \"France, Spain, and the Netherlands... so can you see the picture is a little bit more colourful than black and white,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Zelenskyy's UN speech was a warning and a pleaTrump is 'racist, sexist and Islamophobic', says London mayor Donald Trump has said the US was prepared to impose energy sanctions against Russia - but only if all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil and implement similar measures. \"I am ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all NATO nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO nations stop buying oil from Russia,\" the US president said on his Truth Social platform earlier this month. And at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, he said: \"In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly.\" But for the measures to be effective, he said, \"European nations, all of you gathered here, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.\"  Energy revenues remain the Kremlin's single most important source of cash to finance the war effort, making oil and gas exports a central target of Western sanctions. But officials and analysts warn that aggressive curbs on Russian crude also risk driving up global oil prices, a prospect that could strain Western economies and weaken public support for the measures. Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third-largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has claimed his appearance at the United Nations was marred by three acts of \"sabotage\". The US president alleged an escalator had malfunctioned as he was travelling up it with the first lady, Melania, that a teleprompter had failed to work, and that world leaders couldn't hear his speech. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said an escalator carrying him and his wife \"came to a screeching halt\" on the way to the main floor and nearly caused them to fall \"onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first\". \"This was absolutely sabotage,\" he claimed, as he called for the arrest of those responsible. He also said his teleprompter did not work at the start of his speech and world leaders could not hear him because the sound system failed. \"Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" Mr Trump wrote. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\" He also said he had asked the UN to preserve security camera footage and demanded an investigation, adding that the Secret Service was involved in looking into the escalator incident. Mr Trump complained about both the escalator and the teleprompter during his speech to the UN on Tuesday. UN officials have said the escalator's built-in safety mechanism had been triggered and the teleprompter was operated by the White House rather than the organisation. Analysis: Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN On Monday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a readout of the escalator's central processing unit indicated it \"had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator\". He said Mr Trump's videographer had been travelling backward up the escalator to capture his arrival with the first lady and \"may have inadvertently triggered the safety function\". A UN official told Reuters the sound system had been designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through their earpieces."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  A US vaccine firm has opened the first mRNA manufacturing plant in the UK, against a backdrop of increasing anti-jab rhetoric back home. The new facility outside Oxford is part of a £1bn investment in the UK by Moderna, which specialises in mRNA. The novel vaccine technology delivered some of the most effective and fastest-to-develop jabs during the COVID pandemic. Several pharma companies, including Germany's leading mRNA pioneer BioNTech, are now racing to develop new therapies. Moderna says the plant will produce up to 100 million doses of its existing vaccine products each year. It has also been designed to scale-up production to 250 million doses a year in the event of a new disease outbreak. \"God-forbid, if there is another pandemic, we can switch the facility any day,\" said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. The UK investment deal was agreed by the previous government, but the plant's opening is welcome relief for the current one. In recent weeks, four major pharmaceutical companies have halted planned investments in the UK following disputes over drug pricing and profitability in the UK. 'A great statement' It also promises to restore domestic vaccine manufacturing capability in the UK, the lack of which was exposed when dangerous supply interruptions threatened the early COVID response. \"It's a really fast way of getting new vaccines discovered,\" said Lord Patrick Vallance, former chief scientist and now science minister. \"It's also a great statement of confidence in the UK that [Moderna has] chosen to base themselves here.\" Moderna: UK 'still believes' in vaccines The mRNA molecule is the same used by our cells to order the production of new proteins, and allows vaccines to be produced using just the genetic code of a virus or other biological target. Moderna's investment decision pre-dated Donald Trump's return to the White House, but the Moderna CEO said its operation in the UK - a country that \"still believes in vaccination\" - may pay dividends if anti-vaccine rhetoric translates into a lack of demand for its products in the US. \"If there is less appetite by governments around the world, including in the US, to use vaccines, we might invest less in vaccines,\" said Mr Bancel. \"We have to invest where there's a demand for our products.\" Read more: All health claims made by Trump - and what experts say  The UK presents other attractions for the company which has suffered substantial losses as demand for its COVID vaccine has fallen. It's betting that leading UK universities and a large patient population will make for successful clinical trials.

Moderna says it is now the largest private commercial sponsor of clinical trials in the UK."

        "Content": " Andy Burnham has claimed Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge the prime minister, as he unveiled his \"plan to turn the country around\". The mayor of Greater Manchester, who served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, has been tipped to make a return to Westminster. Speculation has ramped up amid a rough start to the new parliamentary term for the government, with Sir Keir Starmer forced into a cabinet reshuffle and the sacking of his ambassador to the US. Speaking to The Telegraph and the New Statesman, Mr Burnham has further fuelled rumours that he is plotting another leadership challenge. He lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 and Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. \"People have contacted me throughout the summer - yeah,\" the former minister told The Telegraph when asked if Labour MPs had encouraged him to try again. \"I'm not going to say to you that that hasn't happened. \"But as I say, it's more a decision for those people than it is for me.\" He added: \"I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?\" 'Climate of fear' He refused to rule out making a challenge before May 2026, widely seen as the point at which some Labour MPs feel Sir Keir's time could be up - if the party does badly in the next set of local elections. They include London, while the Scottish and Welsh parliaments are also up for grabs. In a direct criticism of Sir Keir, Mr Burnham said Number 10 had created a \"climate of fear\" among MPs and created \"alienation and demoralisation\" within the party. The government has already run up against its own backbenchers over issues including welfare cuts, the winter fuel payment changes, and the two-child benefit cap. A debate continues to rage on tax ahead of the budget, with the chancellor being told significant increases are needed. Labour remain behind Reform UK in the polls, having seen their popularity plummet since the 2024 general election, while the prime minister is also unpopular with the public. Despite his previous failed leadership challenges, Mr Burnham has rebuilt his image as a mayor in Manchester. He notably sparred with Boris Johnson during the pandemic, and became known as the \"King in the North\".  Burnham's manifesto Mr Burnham has set out a raft of policies he said would \"turn the country around\", including higher council tax on expensive homes in London and the South East. He would cut income tax for lower earners, but introduce a 50p rate for the highest earners, and borrow £40bn to boost the building of council houses. He also called for more public control of energy, water and rail, and signalled a willingness to work with progressive parties - including Jeremy Corbyn's still-unnamed venture. Read more politics news:Trump is 'racist', says Sadiq KhanRoyal Parks dismisses Farage's swans claim Any attempt to replace the prime minister would require him to secure a parliamentary seat in a possible by-election, though the polls suggest no seat would be a slam-dunk victory for Labour. Mr Burnham will likely use Labour's party conference, starting Sunday, to make his pitch to members, though should expect hostile briefings from those inside the government. Speaking to Politics Hub With Darren McCaffrey on Wednesday, Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire said he should \"stop sticking his oar in\". \"Keir Starmer is our prime minister,\" she said, and he should be allowed to get on with the job."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer is to announce a \"Pride in Place\" programme with funding for over 330 disadvantaged communities as part of a fightback against Reform UK. The money will come alongside new powers for local groups to seize boarded-up shops, save derelict pubs and block gambling and vape stores on high streets, the government said. Politics Live: Cabinet minister claims to have been victim of 'sexist briefings'  The plan aims to address the sense of isolation in deprived communities, which Labour insiders believe is feeding the rise of Reform UK. A Labour source described the programme as \"absolutely essential\" and \"transformative\". They told Sky News: \"Reform is trying to divide communities, Labour wants to empower them, and we are giving them the tools and resources to turn them around.\" The full list of places that will receive the cash boost, and how much they will get, will be confirmed by the prime minister on Thursday. \n                  Andy Burnham says Labour MPs want him to oust Starmer\n                 \n                  Big Issue founder on the 'great distraction' stopping Britain tackling 'emergency' crisis\n                 \n                  Donald Trump is 'racist, sexist and Islamophobic', says Sadiq Khan amid feud with US president\n                 The money is part of the communities funding plan announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her June spending review, which promised new investment for 350 deprived areas across the UK \"to improve parks, youth facilities, swimming pools and libraries\". The government said at the time these areas included the 75 places previously named in the Plan for Neighbourhoods, each of which will get £20m of funding over the next 10 years. The Spending Review named another 20 \"pilot neighbourhoods\" in England to receive the same amount of funding, mainly in the north or the Midlands, as well as five other pilots across the rest of the UK. Sir Keir is expected to announce the rest on Thursday. Speaking ahead of that announcement, the new housing secretary, Steve Reed, said the money will allow local people to \"decide how best to restore pride in their neighbourhoods, not us in Westminster\". He added: \"That's what real patriotism looks like: building up our communities and choosing renewal over division.\" How will the funding work?  The funding will be allocated to neighbourhood boards made up of community leaders and stakeholders, who will work closely with local councils, it is understood. They will be granted Community Right to Buy and Compulsory Purchase Powers, allowing them to buy assets like grassroots football clubs, seize derelict buildings and save local pubs, the government said. Councils will also be given powers to block betting shops, vape stores and fake barbers. The programme draws similarities with Tony Blair's New Deal for Communities (NDC), a 10-year regeneration drive that targeted 39 of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England from 2001. An independent evaluation found NDC partnerships delivered improvements across several indicators, including crime, education and health. The biggest change was how people felt about their neighbourhoods as places to live. Each area had around £50m of investment under the former Labour prime minister's programme, but these were geographically bigger than the ones the government is now targeting, it is understood. The \"Pride in Place\" Programme has been informed by the work of the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods (ICON), launched in September last year to review the state of England's neighbourhoods. ICON identified 613 \"mission critical\" neighbourhoods - those they said needed the most urgent attention to make progress on Sir Keir's \"missions\" for government. Read More;Rivals could take lessons from how Farage 'hogs the headlines' The bulk of these were in post-industrial areas in northern England, though high need was also identified in the West Midlands and coastal towns such as Blackpool and Clacton - the latter being the seat of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Many of the sites to be announced are expected to contain a mission-critical neighbourhood within them. Baroness Hilary Armstrong, a former Labour minister and chair of ICON, said: \"If residents start to see positive, tangible changes in their neighbourhoods, this should start to restore the public's faith in the power of government to do good.\" It comes at a critical time for Sir Keir, who has faced questions over whether he can survive after spending most of his first year in office languishing behind Reform UK in the polls. Labour MPs have been lobbying for the funding for some time, expressing concern that Number 10's mission to grow the economy with big infrastructure investments will not directly benefit people in areas that look and feel \"left behind\". Luke Akehurst, the Labour MP for North Durham, told Sky News: \"This is what Labour governments are all about - properly funding the areas of the county that most need help.\""

UEFA - along with world body FIFA - is facing growing calls to suspend Israel's national teams and club sides from international competitions. A group of United Nations advisory experts says sporting sanctions are now needed after a UN commission of inquiry said Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Those accusations are denied by Israel as it has continued to wage war on Hamas, two years since the October 7 2023 atrocities. On Wednesday, fans of Greek side PAOK booed players from Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv at the start of their Europa League match, as they waved Palestinian flags and unveiled a big banner which read \"Show Israel the red card\". Several demonstrators were detained ahead of the game in Thessaloniki, which ended 0-0. Two small protests took place in the northern Greek city, calling for Israeli clubs to be expelled from European competition in response to mass casualties in the war in Gaza. \n                  Israel kills 22 people including nine children in 'horrific massacre' in Gaza, Palestinian officials say\n                 \n                  'Your countries are going to hell': Trump vs the world at the UN \n                 \n                  Israel is increasingly ostracised - and no matter how strong its army, it's not a good place to be\n                 Around 120 Israeli fans were held behind a police cordon while the Maccabi team bus was escorted by police to the 28,000-seater Toumba Stadium. Alexandra Xanthaki, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, told Sky News: \"I think that when we talk about teams, national teams, not individual athletes, of states that are subject to valid claims of genocide… this is where this is for sure a red line.\" FIFA and UEFA have previously rejected calls to suspend Israel but have not commented on the plea from UN rapporteurs. Ms Xanthaki said Aston Villa should consider refusing to play Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League in November at Villa Park - echoing calls from the club's local independent MP, Ayoub Khan. He told Sky News: \"I think Aston Villa ought to take the high moral ground and refuse to play with Maccabi. I understand they want three points but there is also this moral argument and I suspect a large number of Villa fans wouldn't really mind Aston making that decision.\" He highlighted potential security challenges in Birmingham dealing with visiting Israel fans at a game that could attract both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activism. Mr Khan said: \"My concern is around the safety of the local businesses, the local community, the local private hire drivers, bus drivers.\" Maccabi fans faced antisemitic attacks while playing in Amsterdam last year, while there were also anti-Arab chants heard. Israel's football association declined to comment on calls for the suspension of its teams from external competitions because they have not come from footballing counterparts. But lawyers defending Israel have been fighting attempts to exclude the country from sport. \"It's very unfortunate that there is destruction during a war, but the Israeli Football Association and Maccabi Tel Aviv are not responsible for that destruction,\" Jonathan Turner, the chief executive of UK Lawyers for Israel, told Sky News. \"It does strike Jewish people perhaps to a considerable extent because many of us recall that the Nazis started with boycotting Jews.\" Read more from Sky News:Israel 'kills 22 people including nine children' in GazaWhat recognising a Palestinian state actually means One country banned from football is Russia, since 2022 following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That's because of European sides refusing to play against Russians and safety concerns if they did. It's understood that European football chiefs are now starting to hear of teams not wanting to play Israeli opposition. And UEFA has started to speak up against deaths in Gaza, with a \"stop killing children\" banner displayed on the pitch at the Super Cup in August. But whether football should take a moral stand against Israel - and whether it can legally - is still being discussed."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  A US vaccine firm has opened the first mRNA manufacturing plant in the UK, against a backdrop of increasing anti-jab rhetoric back home. The new facility outside Oxford is part of a £1bn investment in the UK by Moderna, which specialises in mRNA. The novel vaccine technology delivered some of the most effective and fastest-to-develop jabs during the COVID pandemic. Several pharma companies, including Germany's leading mRNA pioneer BioNTech, are now racing to develop new therapies. Moderna says the plant will produce up to 100 million doses of its existing vaccine products each year. It has also been designed to scale-up production to 250 million doses a year in the event of a new disease outbreak. \"God-forbid, if there is another pandemic, we can switch the facility any day,\" said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. The UK investment deal was agreed by the previous government, but the plant's opening is welcome relief for the current one. In recent weeks, four major pharmaceutical companies have halted planned investments in the UK following disputes over drug pricing and profitability in the UK. 'A great statement' It also promises to restore domestic vaccine manufacturing capability in the UK, the lack of which was exposed when dangerous supply interruptions threatened the early COVID response. \"It's a really fast way of getting new vaccines discovered,\" said Lord Patrick Vallance, former chief scientist and now science minister. \"It's also a great statement of confidence in the UK that [Moderna has] chosen to base themselves here.\" Moderna: UK 'still believes' in vaccines The mRNA molecule is the same used by our cells to order the production of new proteins, and allows vaccines to be produced using just the genetic code of a virus or other biological target. Moderna's investment decision pre-dated Donald Trump's return to the White House, but the Moderna CEO said its operation in the UK - a country that \"still believes in vaccination\" - may pay dividends if anti-vaccine rhetoric translates into a lack of demand for its products in the US. \"If there is less appetite by governments around the world, including in the US, to use vaccines, we might invest less in vaccines,\" said Mr Bancel. \"We have to invest where there's a demand for our products.\" Read more: All health claims made by Trump - and what experts say  The UK presents other attractions for the company which has suffered substantial losses as demand for its COVID vaccine has fallen. It's betting that leading UK universities and a large patient population will make for successful clinical trials. The company has ongoing NHS trials of new jabs against seasonal flu, a combination COVID and flu vaccine, cancer vaccines and mRNA therapies for two inherited childhood diseases. Moderna says it is now the largest private commercial sponsor of clinical trials in the UK."

        "Content": " Andy Burnham has claimed Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge the prime minister, as he unveiled his \"plan to turn the country around\". The mayor of Greater Manchester, who served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, has been tipped to make a return to Westminster. Speculation has ramped up amid a rough start to the new parliamentary term for the government, with Sir Keir Starmer forced into a cabinet reshuffle and the sacking of his ambassador to the US. Speaking to The Telegraph and the New Statesman, Mr Burnham has further fuelled rumours that he is plotting another leadership challenge. He lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 and Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. \"People have contacted me throughout the summer - yeah,\" the former minister told The Telegraph when asked if Labour MPs had encouraged him to try again. \"I'm not going to say to you that that hasn't happened. \"But as I say, it's more a decision for those people than it is for me.\" He added: \"I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?\" 'Climate of fear' He refused to rule out making a challenge before May 2026, widely seen as the point at which some Labour MPs feel Sir Keir's time could be up - if the party does badly in the next set of local elections. They include London, while the Scottish and Welsh parliaments are also up for grabs. In a direct criticism of Sir Keir, Mr Burnham said Number 10 had created a \"climate of fear\" among MPs and created \"alienation and demoralisation\" within the party. The government has already run up against its own backbenchers over issues including welfare cuts, the winter fuel payment changes, and the two-child benefit cap. A debate continues to rage on tax ahead of the budget, with the chancellor being told significant increases are needed. Labour remain behind Reform UK in the polls, having seen their popularity plummet since the 2024 general election, while the prime minister is also unpopular with the public. Despite his previous failed leadership challenges, Mr Burnham has rebuilt his image as a mayor in Manchester. He notably sparred with Boris Johnson during the pandemic, and became known as the \"King in the North\".  Burnham's manifesto Mr Burnham has set out a raft of policies he said would \"turn the country around\", including higher council tax on expensive homes in London and the South East. He would cut income tax for lower earners, but introduce a 50p rate for the highest earners, and borrow £40bn to boost the building of council houses. He also called for more public control of energy, water and rail, and signalled a willingness to work with progressive parties - including Jeremy Corbyn's still-unnamed venture. Read more politics news:Trump is 'racist', says Sadiq KhanRoyal Parks dismisses Farage's swans claim Any attempt to replace the prime minister would require him to secure a parliamentary seat in a possible by-election, though the polls suggest no seat would be a slam-dunk victory for Labour. Mr Burnham will likely use Labour's party conference, starting Sunday, to make his pitch to members, though should expect hostile briefings from those inside the government. Speaking to Politics Hub With Darren McCaffrey on Wednesday, Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire said he should \"stop sticking his oar in\". \"Keir Starmer is our prime minister,\" she said, and he should be allowed to get on with the job."

        "Content": "A new gene therapy has slowed the progression of Huntington's disease by as much as 75%. Known as AMT-130, it is delivered via brain surgery, and a single dose is expected to last someone's whole life. \"This result changes everything,\" said principal investigator Professor Ed Wild. Thirty-year-old Jack May-Davis, who took part in trials, said the results were \"astonishing\", leaving him \"lost for words\". Huntington's is a neurodegenerative disease which gets worse over time and has no cure, affecting thinking, movement and mood. About 8,000 people in the UK suffer from it. While the disease typically lasts for about 20 years, loss of function can begin quite quickly. In a trial, 12 patients were given the highest dose of AMT-130. Researchers reported they experienced 75% less disease progression after 36 months compared to a group of people with Huntington's who were not given the treatment. AMT-130 works by permanently introducing new functional DNA into a person's cells, researchers said. \"On the basis of these results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease, which is truly world-changing stuff,\" said Prof Wild, from the University College London (UCL) Huntington's Disease Centre. \"My patients in the trial are stable over time in a way I'm not used to seeing in Huntington's disease.\" One of them, he added, was medically retired but has been able to return to work. 'Absolutely breathtaking' findings Prof Wild told Sky News presenter Jayne Secker the 75% slowing was \"absolutely breathtaking... that could be years or decades of top quality life or even complete disease freedom if we treat early enough\".  He added: \"There are undoubtedly patients in this trial who would have been in wheelchairs by now, who are still able to walk and are independent. \"And if we can bring this therapy to as many people as possible, the impact on families who are struggling with this condition for themselves and their children will be immense.\" Could symptoms be prevented from occurring? Professor Sarah Tabrizi, also from UCL, said AMT-130 had the potential to \"preserve daily function\", keep people in work longer, and \"meaningfully slow disease progression\". She told Jayne Secker that those in the trial had \"very early symptomatic disease\", but she hopes that the therapy in future will be given to people with \"stage zero and stage one disease who have no symptoms at all\". \"And that one day we might be able to prevent the symptoms occurring, which would be a true prevention in people who carry the Huntington's gene but don't yet have symptoms. And that's the goal of all of our research currently.\" Read more:Boris Becker 'shocked' by drug use in UK prisonMan arrested in connection with airports cyber attack Jack May-Davis, from Sussex, discovered he was carrying the Huntington's gene when he was 19.

The police are present and investigating further.\" The force said more than one drone was sighted in the airport's airspace, adding that it was not known if they were the same ones that affected Copenhagen Airport earlier this week. It said the purpose of the drones was unknown, and it was not clear who was controlling them, but they were flying with their lights on. Aalborg is located in the north of the country, in the Jutland region, and is Denmark's fourth-largest city by population. Denmark's national police said the drones followed a similar pattern to the ones that had halted flights at Copenhagen Airport. It also said it had received notices of drones in other parts of the country. It said the Danish Armed Forces were also affected as they use Aalborg Airport as a military base. Danish police later said the unidentified drones were no longer located over the airport's airspace. Southern Jutland police later said drones had also been observed near airports in the Danish towns of Esbjerg, Sonderborg and Skrydstrup. Fighter Wing Skrydstrup in Southern Jutland is the base for Denmark's F-16 and F-35 fighter jets. Denmark's national police commissioner, Thorkild Fogde, said many people around the country had reported drone sightings to the police since the disruption earlier this week. \"Of course many of these reports do not cover activities that are of interest to the police or the military, but some of them do, and I think the one in Aalborg does,\" he said. The incident at Copenhagen Airport on Monday was described by the government as the most serious attack yet on its critical infrastructure and linked the drones to a series of suspected Russian drone incursions and other disruptions across Europe. Authorities in Norway also shut the airspace at Oslo airport for three hours after a drone was seen there. Denmark's prime minister later said she \"cannot deny\" that drones seen over the airport were flown by Russia. Authorities in Norway and Denmark are in close contact over the incidents in Copenhagen and Oslo, but their investigation has not yet established a connection, Norway's foreign minister said on Wednesday. It also comes after disruption at Heathrow Airport last week following a cyber attack that also hit other major airports in Europe."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n  Volodymyr Zelenskyy's moment in the United Nations General Assembly chamber came a day after he told Sky News that Donald Trump's language represented a \"big shift\" in America's stance on Ukraine.  The dust is settling on US President Trump's social media post on Tuesday. While it unquestionably represents a shift in position - now claiming Ukraine can take back all of the land lost - big questions remain about Mr Trump's personal and material commitment to a Ukrainian victory.  Mr Zelenskyy is taking the win that the language represents, but he, more than anyone, knows that Mr Trump can turn on a dime. And so his speech was a warning, a message and a continued plea for help. The Ukrainian leader cited history in warning that Russia won't stop unless it is defeated. Mr Zelenskyy said: \"We have already lost Georgia in Europe. Human rights and the European nature of the state system are only shrinking there. \n                  Trump rages against three 'very sinister events' at UN and says Secret Service is investigating\n                 \n                  'Great regret' some European nations buying Russian oil and gas, says top EU official\n                 \n                  Trump makes major shift in Ukraine policy\n                 \"Georgia is dependent on Russia and for many, many years, Belarus has also been moving towards dependence on Russia.\" \"Putin will keep driving the war forward, wider and deeper... Ukraine is only the first. Russian drones are already flying across Europe.\" \"Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too,\" he said. UN latest: Zelenskyy tells UN 'God saved' Trump from assassination  Drawing on the experience of his country, he warned of what he said was a uniquely dangerous proliferation of weapons. \"We are living through the most destructive arms race in human history,\" he said, warning specifically of the dangers of drones which will soon be controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). But he also warned of the proliferation of the use of violence, whether it be from nation states or from political activists. He cited the assassination attempts on Mr Trump and the assassination of Charlie Kirk.  He included these moments not just because he believes they represent a dangerous and tragic shift but because he knows he needs to keep President Trump and his base of support on side. Showing empathy with them is important. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈 He spoke in perfect English. Not long ago, he struggled with the language. He knows that now, more than ever, he needs to communicate in the language of those who hold the key to his country's future. \"Of course, we are doing everything to make sure Europe truly helps, and we count on the United States,\" he said. He closed with a plea to the nations of the world, gathered in the chamber. \"Don't stay silent while Russia keeps dragging this war on... Please join us in defending life, international law and order,\" he said. \"People are waiting for action.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump is right that European countries should stop buying Russian oil and gas, one of the EU's top officials has told Sky News. Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, European Commission vice president Kaja Kallas said it was of \"great regret\" that this was still happening among some of the bloc's member states. The commission has proposed legislation to phase out Russian imports of its oil and gas by 1 January 2028, as Brussels tries to cut its decades-old energy relations with Moscow following Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Most European countries stopped importing Russian crude oil in 2022 and Russian fuel in 2023, but crude imports by Hungary and Slovakia have continued. Ms Kallas, who is the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said of Mr Trump's energy call: \"Of course he has a point. I mean, we have been saying this for quite some time, that the dependency on Russian oil and gas is actually also fuelling the war. \"But you have to see that we have done a lot to diminish that, really, to get rid of Russian oil and gas. And there are a few countries who are still buying oil and also there America has leverage because they are also good friends of America. \"Neighbours around those countries have also proposed alternatives, so we can do this.\" \n                  Trump rages against three 'very sinister events' at UN and says Secret Service is investigating\n                 \n                  Zelenskyy's UN speech was a warning and a plea - as he knows Trump can turn on a dime\n                 \n                  Trump makes major shift in Ukraine policy\n                 Ms Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, does not think NATO and EU members Hungary or Slovakia should be sanctioned, but instead they should \"really build on the alternatives that neighbours are providing them to get rid of the Russian oil and gas like President Trump has asked\". She added that \"the neighbouring countries are providing or offering different alternative routes. The thing is that this oil and gas is just cheaper…\" She continued: \"It is of great regret that we haven't been able to put all these member states in the same position… getting rid of the Russian oil and gas.\" On Wednesday, Slovakia pushed back on pressure it is facing to cut back its purchases of Russian energy, saying it was ready to discuss the issue, but singled out some European states for increasing their gas purchases from Moscow. Slovakian foreign minister Juraj Blanar said there was hypocrisy in criticising his country when liquefied natural gas purchases from Russia to Western Europe had increased by 30% over the last year. \"France, Spain, and the Netherlands... so can you see the picture is a little bit more colourful than black and white,\" he said. Read more from Sky News:Zelenskyy's UN speech was a warning and a pleaTrump is 'racist, sexist and Islamophobic', says London mayor Donald Trump has said the US was prepared to impose energy sanctions against Russia - but only if all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil and implement similar measures. \"I am ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all NATO nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO nations stop buying oil from Russia,\" the US president said on his Truth Social platform earlier this month. And at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, he said: \"In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly.\" But for the measures to be effective, he said, \"European nations, all of you gathered here, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.\"  Energy revenues remain the Kremlin's single most important source of cash to finance the war effort, making oil and gas exports a central target of Western sanctions. But officials and analysts warn that aggressive curbs on Russian crude also risk driving up global oil prices, a prospect that could strain Western economies and weaken public support for the measures. Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third-largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air."

Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal described the killings as a \"horrific massacre\". Video purportedly from the scene of the attack on the Souq Firas area of the city showed the bodies of children being pulled from rubble. \"We were sleeping in God's care, there was nothing - they did not inform us, or not even give us a sign - it was a surprise,\" said Sami Hajjaj. \"There are children and women, around 200 people maybe, six to seven families - this square is full of families.\" The Israeli military claimed the strike targeted Hamas militants and that its forces tried to reduce harm to civilians in the area.

It comes as 20 people were wounded, including two seriously, after a drone fired from Yemen struck the southern Israeli city of Eilat, medics said. Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, saying Eilat \"will remain under constant targeting\".  The Iranian-backed group has regularly fired drones and missiles at Israel in what it says is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the oxygen station at Al Quds Hospital in Gaza had stopped operating \"due to Israeli occupation forces firing at it\". \"Operations are currently being conducted using pre-filled oxygen cylinders, which are sufficient for only three days,\" the group said. \"Occupation forces are currently stationed at the southern gate of the society's Al Quds Hospital in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City, preventing anyone from entering or leaving the hospital.\" The world's leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive had pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but UN agencies and aid groups say an estimated 700,000 remain. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than half of them women and children. Its figure does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. The current wave of violence began on 7 October, 2023, when Hamas-led militants carried out an attack inside Israel that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw around 250 people taken hostage. Israel claims its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages. Israel believes around 20 of the captives are still alive. Critics say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not interested in peace negotiations and wants to continue the war with a view to displacing Gaza's population and expand Israeli settlements. He has repeatedly rejected the possibility of a Palestinian state. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said: \"In Gaza, the horrors are approaching a third monstrous year. \"They are the result of decisions that defy basic humanity,\" he continued, citing \"a scale of death and destruction beyond any other conflict\" in his years as secretary-general. \"Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people and the systematic destruction of Gaza,\" he added. The world's leading association of genocide scholars, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), declared in August that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Several other leading rights organisations, including two Israeli groups, have also said Israel is committing genocide. Israel has repeatedly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and claims they are justified as a means of self-defence."

UEFA - along with world body FIFA - is facing growing calls to suspend Israel's national teams and club sides from international competitions. A group of United Nations advisory experts says sporting sanctions are now needed after a UN commission of inquiry said Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Those accusations are denied by Israel as it has continued to wage war on Hamas, two years since the October 7 2023 atrocities. On Wednesday, fans of Greek side PAOK booed players from Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv at the start of their Europa League match, as they waved Palestinian flags and unveiled a big banner which read \"Show Israel the red card\". Several demonstrators were detained ahead of the game in Thessaloniki, which ended 0-0. Two small protests took place in the northern Greek city, calling for Israeli clubs to be expelled from European competition in response to mass casualties in the war in Gaza. \n                  Israel kills 22 people including nine children in 'horrific massacre' in Gaza, Palestinian officials say\n                 \n                  'Your countries are going to hell': Trump vs the world at the UN \n                 \n                  Israel is increasingly ostracised - and no matter how strong its army, it's not a good place to be\n                 Around 120 Israeli fans were held behind a police cordon while the Maccabi team bus was escorted by police to the 28,000-seater Toumba Stadium. Alexandra Xanthaki, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, told Sky News: \"I think that when we talk about teams, national teams, not individual athletes, of states that are subject to valid claims of genocide… this is where this is for sure a red line.\" FIFA and UEFA have previously rejected calls to suspend Israel but have not commented on the plea from UN rapporteurs. Ms Xanthaki said Aston Villa should consider refusing to play Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League in November at Villa Park - echoing calls from the club's local independent MP, Ayoub Khan. He told Sky News: \"I think Aston Villa ought to take the high moral ground and refuse to play with Maccabi. I understand they want three points but there is also this moral argument and I suspect a large number of Villa fans wouldn't really mind Aston making that decision.\" He highlighted potential security challenges in Birmingham dealing with visiting Israel fans at a game that could attract both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activism. Mr Khan said: \"My concern is around the safety of the local businesses, the local community, the local private hire drivers, bus drivers.\" Maccabi fans faced antisemitic attacks while playing in Amsterdam last year, while there were also anti-Arab chants heard. Israel's football association declined to comment on calls for the suspension of its teams from external competitions because they have not come from footballing counterparts. But lawyers defending Israel have been fighting attempts to exclude the country from sport. \"It's very unfortunate that there is destruction during a war, but the Israeli Football Association and Maccabi Tel Aviv are not responsible for that destruction,\" Jonathan Turner, the chief executive of UK Lawyers for Israel, told Sky News. \"It does strike Jewish people perhaps to a considerable extent because many of us recall that the Nazis started with boycotting Jews.\" Read more from Sky News:Israel 'kills 22 people including nine children' in GazaWhat recognising a Palestinian state actually means One country banned from football is Russia, since 2022 following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That's because of European sides refusing to play against Russians and safety concerns if they did. It's understood that European football chiefs are now starting to hear of teams not wanting to play Israeli opposition. And UEFA has started to speak up against deaths in Gaza, with a \"stop killing children\" banner displayed on the pitch at the Super Cup in August. But whether football should take a moral stand against Israel - and whether it can legally - is still being discussed."

NASA is under pressure from Donald Trump's administration and US politicians to be first back down to the lunar surface. But China is increasingly confident in its own space programme. Jeremy Hansen, a Canadian joining three American astronauts for the Artemis mission, told me the crew were well aware of \"what's going on in the world\". \"We understand why there's this perspective of a race,\" he said at a NASA news conference. \"There are very real things happening, and you got to have heads-up play and you got to be thinking a few steps ahead. This all makes sense to us. \"Winning that race is very important to all of us.\" The mission to loop around the moon will launch as soon as February, flight testing the rocket and capsule that will play a key role in landing a crew on the lunar surface in 2027. It will be the first time that humans have looped around the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. NASA had delayed the launch because a test flight without humans on board in 2022 resulted in significant damage to the heatshield that protects the capsule as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. The space agency is now satisfied that engineering upgrades have fixed the problem and the Orion crew capsule is safe to fly. Mission commander Reid Wiseman said the crew were confident in the technology. \"When I get into Orion, it's like climbing into my bed,\" he said. \"I feel warm and tucked in.\"  The crew's trajectory around the moon will take them 5,000 miles above the surface. But they will pass over the far side of the moon, which always faces away from Earth. Christina Koch, who could become the first female astronaut to head beyond Earth's orbit, said it would be a special moment. \"We could see parts of the moon that never have had human eyes lay upon them before,\" she said.\"Human eyes are one of the best scientific instruments that we have and our geologists are beyond excited for our eyes to look at the moon. And we've been training how to turn those observations into tangible science for them.\" In the 1960s, the space race was with the Soviet Union. America won, the first to plant a flag.

Water would provide hydration for astronauts exploring and potentially mining minerals from a permanent moon base. Splitting the water molecule, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen would also provide air to breathe and the ingredients for rocket fuel. The return of Mr Trump to the White House and an accelerated Chinese space programme has made the space race 2.0 more intense. China has already beaten the US to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. And it plans to land taikonauts on the surface by 2030. There is an Outer Space Treaty which means no country can make a territorial claim to a celestial body. But Bleddyn Bowen, professor of astropolitics at Durham University, said it matters which nation reaches the surface first because they'll be able to influence ground rules. \"If China is to sustain a significant presence on the moon in the century to come, I would expect the United States and India, and perhaps Europe as well, to do something similar,\" he said. \"They'll say: 'Hey, don't forget about us, we're here as well. And if you want to develop rules and best practices in space, you can't do it without us.'\""

At least 10 deaths have been reported in the Philippines, where nearly 700,000 people were affected by the super typhoon in the main northern region of Luzon. Typhoon, hurricane or cyclone - what's the difference? The deaths in Taiwan were reported in the eastern Taiwanese county of Hualien, a beauty spot which is popular with tourists. The country's fire department initially said at least 152 people were missing after a town, Guangfu, was flooded by a deluge from a barrier lake, which burst its banks on Tuesday afternoon. That total was revised down to 17 on Wednesday. Around 60 million tonnes of water was released, the Taiwanese government said, the equivalent of 36,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools or a major reservoir in southern Taiwan. One resident, a postman who gave his family name as Hsieh, told Reuters news agency the water hit like a \"tsunami\" which swept his car into his living room.  Elsewhere, Dama, a village of around 1,000 people, has been completely flooded. Its chieftain, Wang Tse-an, told Reuters many locals are still stranded there, adding: \"It's chaotic now. There are mud and rocks everywhere.\" Regions across Taiwan have sent at least 340 soldiers to Hualien to boost rescue efforts. In Guangfu, troops operating from an armoured personnel carrier to avoid the thick mud on the streets went door-to-door handing out water and instant noodles.  Taiwan's Premier Cho Jung-tai has called for an inquiry into what went wrong with evacuation orders. Ragasa made landfall in the southern Chinese city of Yangjiang in the province of Guangdong on the South China Sea coastline at just before 5.30pm, local time, on Wednesday, the national meteorological centre said. Nearly 1.9 million people were relocated from Guangdong before it arrived. Gusts of up to 150mph (241kmh) were recorded at noon by a weather station in Chuandao, while huge waves battered the city of Zhuhai's coastline and strong winds buffeted trees under intense rain.

The city's storm level had been at its highest level of 10 as winds whipped waves taller than lampposts and people reported being woken by fierce gales in the early hours. Parts of a pedestrian bridge's roof were blown away, hundreds of trees were knocked down across the city and more than 60 injured people were treated at hospitals. A video that showed waves of water crashing through the doors of a hotel and flooding its interiors went viral in the financial hub, where warnings of hurricane-force winds of well over 120mph have been issued. Ragasa is the strongest tropical cyclone in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea region so far this year and the second-strongest since records began in 1950, the observatory said."

The Home Office said the arrival was part of \"critical first steps\" under the scheme, following the removal of four people from Britain. The incoming party was a family of three, including a small child. The agreement, which came into force last month, is aimed at deporting migrants who have crossed the English Channel in exchange for allowing those who apply in France and are approved to come to the UK. The government has said the newly-established legal route for those entering the country includes rigorous documentation as well as eligibility and security checks.

        "Content": " A gunman who carried out a fatal shooting at an immigration facility in the US left a bullet engraved with the phrase \"ANTI-ICE\", the FBI has said. The deadly attack at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, Texas, is being investigated as an act of \"targeted violence\". Donald Trump said he had been briefed, describing the attacker as \"deranged\" and the shooting as \"despicable\". Referencing what he called \"continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists\", the US president said he would be signing an executive order this week to \"dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks\". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said one detainee had died while two others were in a critical condition. The attacker also died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officials have named the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, Sky's US partner NBC News reported. Jahn's brother Noah told NBC his sibling \"didn't have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew\". \"I didn't think he was politically interested,\" he added. \"He wasn't interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.\" How did the attack unfold? The gunman opened fire on the office from an adjacent building at about 6.40am local time, officers said. He \"fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot\", according to the DHS. Dallas FBI Special Agent Joseph Rothrock said it was a \"coordinated attack\" and \"just the most recent example we've seen of targeted violence\". Early evidence suggested the incident was \"anti-ICE in nature\", he added. A recovered, unspent shell casing was engraved with the phrase \"ANTI ICE\", said FBI director Kash Patel. He said an initial review of evidence showed an \"ideological motive behind this attack\", describing the assault as \"despicable\". The victims were being led into the building to be processed and repatriated, Fox News reported, citing Dallas police Department sources. Arianny Sierra told NBC News she was in her car with her nine-year-old son when a series of shots rang out. \"There were like 20 shots in a row,\" she said. \"I sheltered myself under the car with my son.\" Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said the shooting would \"not slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants\". He added: \"We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.\" US correspondent The shooting at an ICE field office bears the hallmarks of a politically motivated attack. The gunman took a sniper approach, firing indiscriminately from an adjacent rooftop, and left an unspent bullet casing inscribed \"ANTI-ICE\". These elements suggest a planned assault rather than a spontaneous act, hence the FBI branding it \"targeted violence\". They regard it as an attempt to make a symbolic point, rather than a random crime. The motive has not been definitively established, and whether this is part of a broader radicalised trend or an isolated attack is unclear. The fact that the victims were not ICE agents only adds to the confusion. But the attack escalates political tensions around immigration, rhetoric from both sides creating a charged environment. The assassination of Charlie Kirk two weeks ago prompted calls for a toning-down of the rhetoric. But America is confronting once more how often political difference becomes political violence here. US Vice President JD Vance said: \"The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. \"I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.\" No ICE agents were shot or hurt, NBC News reported. US Attorney General Ken Paxton said: \"We will continue to do everything in our power to combat the alarming increase of targeted attacks against ICE and all law enforcement by evil, twisted individuals.\""

        "Content": " Donald Trump has claimed his appearance at the United Nations was marred by three acts of \"sabotage\". The US president alleged an escalator had malfunctioned as he was travelling up it with the first lady, Melania, that a teleprompter had failed to work, and that world leaders couldn't hear his speech. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said an escalator carrying him and his wife \"came to a screeching halt\" on the way to the main floor and nearly caused them to fall \"onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first\". \"This was absolutely sabotage,\" he claimed, as he called for the arrest of those responsible. He also said his teleprompter did not work at the start of his speech and world leaders could not hear him because the sound system failed. \"Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" Mr Trump wrote. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\" He also said he had asked the UN to preserve security camera footage and demanded an investigation, adding that the Secret Service was involved in looking into the escalator incident. Mr Trump complained about both the escalator and the teleprompter during his speech to the UN on Tuesday. UN officials have said the escalator's built-in safety mechanism had been triggered and the teleprompter was operated by the White House rather than the organisation. Analysis: Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN On Monday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a readout of the escalator's central processing unit indicated it \"had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator\". He said Mr Trump's videographer had been travelling backward up the escalator to capture his arrival with the first lady and \"may have inadvertently triggered the safety function\". A UN official told Reuters the sound system had been designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through their earpieces."

NASA is under pressure from Donald Trump's administration and US politicians to be first back down to the lunar surface. But China is increasingly confident in its own space programme. Jeremy Hansen, a Canadian joining three American astronauts for the Artemis mission, told me the crew were well aware of \"what's going on in the world\". \"We understand why there's this perspective of a race,\" he said at a NASA news conference. \"There are very real things happening, and you got to have heads-up play and you got to be thinking a few steps ahead. This all makes sense to us. \"Winning that race is very important to all of us.\" The mission to loop around the moon will launch as soon as February, flight testing the rocket and capsule that will play a key role in landing a crew on the lunar surface in 2027. It will be the first time that humans have looped around the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. NASA had delayed the launch because a test flight without humans on board in 2022 resulted in significant damage to the heatshield that protects the capsule as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. The space agency is now satisfied that engineering upgrades have fixed the problem and the Orion crew capsule is safe to fly. Mission commander Reid Wiseman said the crew were confident in the technology. \"When I get into Orion, it's like climbing into my bed,\" he said. \"I feel warm and tucked in.\"  The crew's trajectory around the moon will take them 5,000 miles above the surface. But they will pass over the far side of the moon, which always faces away from Earth. Christina Koch, who could become the first female astronaut to head beyond Earth's orbit, said it would be a special moment. \"We could see parts of the moon that never have had human eyes lay upon them before,\" she said.\"Human eyes are one of the best scientific instruments that we have and our geologists are beyond excited for our eyes to look at the moon. And we've been training how to turn those observations into tangible science for them.\" In the 1960s, the space race was with the Soviet Union. America won, the first to plant a flag. Read more:Man banned from every Boots storeGene therapy slows progression of Huntington's disease But growing evidence that there could be substantial quantities of frozen water on the moon has started a new space race, this time between the US and China. Water would provide hydration for astronauts exploring and potentially mining minerals from a permanent moon base. Splitting the water molecule, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen would also provide air to breathe and the ingredients for rocket fuel. The return of Mr Trump to the White House and an accelerated Chinese space programme has made the space race 2.0 more intense. China has already beaten the US to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. And it plans to land taikonauts on the surface by 2030. There is an Outer Space Treaty which means no country can make a territorial claim to a celestial body. But Bleddyn Bowen, professor of astropolitics at Durham University, said it matters which nation reaches the surface first because they'll be able to influence ground rules. \"If China is to sustain a significant presence on the moon in the century to come, I would expect the United States and India, and perhaps Europe as well, to do something similar,\" he said. \"They'll say: 'Hey, don't forget about us, we're here as well. And if you want to develop rules and best practices in space, you can't do it without us.'\""

        "Content": "Infection rates from drug-resistant \"nightmare bacteria\" rose by 70% in the US, according to a new report.  The increase is driven by a difficult-to-treat gene called NDM, say researchers from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only two antibiotics work to treat it - and the drugs are expensive and have to be administered intraveneously. Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas, and though the numbers are still small, the rate of US cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported. \"The rise of NDMs in the US is a grave danger and very worrisome,\" said David Weiss, an infectious diseases researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The report took data from 29 states. It counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 - an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 - an increase of 460%, the authors said. \n                  China does targets differently to the West - and it may be just what the world needs\n                 \n                  UK boosts pandemic readiness with new vaccine factory\n                 \n                  Meet the NASA crew being sent to the moon - a feat not achieved for more than 50 years\n                 In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died. It's likely many people are unrecognised carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists warned. It is feared that infections long considered routine and easy to combat - like urinary tract infections - could become harder to treat, said Dr Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors. Read more from Sky News:How a tractor, lifeboat and ambulance crew saved my lifeThe health claims made by Trump Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise - unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger. 'Huge surge' A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,\" said Dr Jason Burnham, of Washington University. The CDC's count is also only a partial picture. Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to only be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of US infections \"is definitely underestimated,\" Dr Burnham said."

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  A US vaccine firm has opened the first mRNA manufacturing plant in the UK, against a backdrop of increasing anti-jab rhetoric back home. The new facility outside Oxford is part of a £1bn investment in the UK by Moderna, which specialises in mRNA. The novel vaccine technology delivered some of the most effective and fastest-to-develop jabs during the COVID pandemic. Several pharma companies, including Germany's leading mRNA pioneer BioNTech, are now racing to develop new therapies. Moderna says the plant will produce up to 100 million doses of its existing vaccine products each year. It has also been designed to scale-up production to 250 million doses a year in the event of a new disease outbreak. \"God-forbid, if there is another pandemic, we can switch the facility any day,\" said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. The UK investment deal was agreed by the previous government, but the plant's opening is welcome relief for the current one. In recent weeks, four major pharmaceutical companies have halted planned investments in the UK following disputes over drug pricing and profitability in the UK. 'A great statement' It also promises to restore domestic vaccine manufacturing capability in the UK, the lack of which was exposed when dangerous supply interruptions threatened the early COVID response. \"It's a really fast way of getting new vaccines discovered,\" said Lord Patrick Vallance, former chief scientist and now science minister. \"It's also a great statement of confidence in the UK that [Moderna has] chosen to base themselves here.\" Moderna: UK 'still believes' in vaccines The mRNA molecule is the same used by our cells to order the production of new proteins, and allows vaccines to be produced using just the genetic code of a virus or other biological target. Moderna's investment decision pre-dated Donald Trump's return to the White House, but the Moderna CEO said its operation in the UK - a country that \"still believes in vaccination\" - may pay dividends if anti-vaccine rhetoric translates into a lack of demand for its products in the US. \"If there is less appetite by governments around the world, including in the US, to use vaccines, we might invest less in vaccines,\" said Mr Bancel. \"We have to invest where there's a demand for our products.\" Read more: All health claims made by Trump - and what experts say  The UK presents other attractions for the company which has suffered substantial losses as demand for its COVID vaccine has fallen. It's betting that leading UK universities and a large patient population will make for successful clinical trials. The company has ongoing NHS trials of new jabs against seasonal flu, a combination COVID and flu vaccine, cancer vaccines and mRNA therapies for two inherited childhood diseases. Moderna says it is now the largest private commercial sponsor of clinical trials in the UK."

Liam Hutchinson, 32, of no fixed address, was sentenced to a year in prison at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. He was also issued with a criminal behaviour order, banning him from every Boots store in the UK for 10 years - and the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea for five years. Metropolitan Police detectives trawled through hours of CCTV footage to find that Hutchinson had committed 99 shoplifting offences at Boots stores in the borough between May and August 2025.

Sky News has learnt that Clive Whiley is to be parachuted in as the new chairman of STV, whose Two Cities production company is responsible for the hit BBC police drama Blue Lights. An announcement could come as soon as the media group's half-year results on Thursday, one City insider said on Wednesday evening. Sources close to one of STV's top investors said that Mr Whiley had been asked to consider taking on the role amid mounting concern over its performance. Money latest: Closure of 49 bank branches announced He is expected to replace Paul Reynolds, the former BT Wholesale chief executive who has chaired STV since 2021.

Mr Whiley remains chairman of Mothercare, the listed retailer, and Griffin Mining, which is also quoted on the London Stock Exchange. Earlier this year, he oversaw the sale of De La Rue's currency business to Atlas Holdings, a US-based private equity investor, for more than £260m. Combined with the proceeds from the earlier sale of its authentication business, the disposals significantly exceeded investors' expectations. If confirmed in the STV role as expected, Mr Whiley will have another challenging turnaround job on his hands. In July, the company which holds the ITV licence in parts of Scotland issued a bleak profit warning, saying that \"as a result of a further deterioration in the commissioning and advertising markets towards the end of [the first half of the financial year] and into [the second half], our expectations for full-year revenue and adjusted operating profit are expected to be materially below consensus\". Rufus Radcliffe, STV's chief executive, said in the same statement: \"The deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop continues to lower business confidence impacting both markets in which we operate. \"We're making good progress in combining and streamlining our Broadcast and Digital businesses into a new Audience division, and launch plans for the creation of our radio station are going well, with key appointments made and infrastructure plans forging ahead.\" He added that its Studios arm's delivery schedule had been hit by the UK commissioning market, \"which has further weakened at the end of H1 and into the second half of the year\". \"However, in addition to winning new and repeat business in H1, we have completed production on key titles with international appeal, including high-end drama Amadeus for Sky and a third series of Blue Lights for BBC One, with the second series of The Fortune Hotel airing on ITV and STV this summer - and our development pipeline is strong.\" STV has evolved substantially from its origins in the 1950s, having changed its corporate name on several occasions since. It has owned assets spanning the newspaper, advertising and radio sectors. On Wednesday, the stock closed at just under 112p, down more than 3% on the day.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n All household energy suppliers in Britain should introduce at least one lower standing charge tariff by the end of January, according to plans set out by the industry regulator. Ofgem, which has been considering complaints that low energy users are unfairly penalised by the fees, says it is aiming to give consumers more choice. But it admitted that the move was unlikely to reduce overall bills as reduced standing charges would likely be reflected in higher charges for units of energy used. Money latest: The three crucial questions to ask estate agents Standing charges are fixed daily fees added to unit prices households pay for gas and electricity. They are designed to cover costs of connecting to the energy system and investment in new infrastructure. The latter element is being cited as an increasing threat to bill levels given the need to prepare the electricity network for the green energy future demanded by the government. \n                  UK boosts pandemic readiness with new vaccine factory\n                 \n                  Man banned from every Boots store\n                 \n                  Sky News coverage to be featured on MSNBC as part of commercial agreement\n                 Ofgem dropped initial plans that could have seen the charges ditched entirely for some energy deals, in return for customers paying higher unit prices instead.  Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, said: \"We've listened to thousands of consumers that wanted to see changes to the standing charge and taken action. \"We have carefully considered how we can offer more choice on how they pay these fixed costs, however we have taken care to ensure we don't make some customers worse off. \"After examining all the options available to us, we believe that the right way forward is to require all major suppliers to offer at least one tariff with a lower standing charge. \"This will deliver the choice we know customers want, without having a detrimental impact on customers that have high energy needs.\" But he added: \"We cannot remove these charges, we can only move costs around. \"These changes would give households the choice they have asked for, but it's important that everyone carefully considers what's right for them as these tariffs are unlikely to reduce bills on their own.\"  A final decision is due by the end of the year and could be introduced from late January. It's described by the regulator as a short-term measure as a review is carried out over how to best pay for the grid upgrades needed, including storage. The move was announced as around 34 million households prepare for a 2% rise in the energy price cap from 1 October. The 20 million on a fixed rate tariff will not be affected by the shift. Read more:Energy bill payers to back 'super-battery' projectsThe changing face of your bill as poverty and climate demands grow While high wholesale costs for gas have driven bills up sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the costs of government policy are making up a greater proportion of bills for both households and businesses. The expansion of the warm home discount was the main factor behind October's cap increase. Emily Seymour, Which? Energy editor, said of the standing charges proposal: \"For most of us, energy unit rates will make up the majority of our bill and standing charges will be a low proportion of the total. \"But for very low energy users, the daily standing charge will make up a larger amount of your bill and you could save money with one of these new tariffs as you will pay a lower standing charge every day. \"To figure out which type of energy tariff is best for them, people should look at their annual energy usage to see how much of it is typically made up of standing charges and how much is energy unit costs to see whether their usage is low enough to benefit from these new tariffs.\""

The Institute for Government (IfG), a leading think tank, said Labour's \"rash\" and \"unrealistic\" approach to tax has left the chancellor reaching for \"piecemeal changes\". Politics Hub: Follow the latest political news The government has repeatedly said it will not increase VAT rates, income tax or national insurance at the budget in November. But a report by the think tank calls on Ms Reeves to commit to serious tax reform, instead of reaching for an \"eclectic grab bag of tax raisers\", which could further complicate the system. It comes after the Resolution Foundation proposed a 2p cut in national insurance, matched by a 2p rise in income tax, to create a \"level playing field\" and protect workers' pay. Tory shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said Ms Reeves was \"preparing even more tax rises, set to hit families already struggling and choke off jobs at the very moment we need them most\".

Scrapping two-child benefit limit would reduce child poverty, report suggests Meanwhile, a report has suggested scrapping the controversial two-child benefit limit would reduce child poverty, but not necessarily help with a youngster's early development and their readiness for school. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded the policy has \"no statistically significant impact\" on the proportion of children in England achieving what is known as a \"good level of development\" by age five. The two-child limit, which was announced by the Conservatives in 2015 and came into effect in 2017, limits child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. The government is expected to publish a strategy to tackle child poverty this autumn and has been under pressure to scrap the policy, which charities and organisations working in the sector estimate pulls more than 100 children a day into poverty."

        "Content": " Andy Burnham has claimed Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge the prime minister, as he unveiled his \"plan to turn the country around\". The mayor of Greater Manchester, who served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, has been tipped to make a return to Westminster. Speculation has ramped up amid a rough start to the new parliamentary term for the government, with Sir Keir Starmer forced into a cabinet reshuffle and the sacking of his ambassador to the US. Speaking to The Telegraph and the New Statesman, Mr Burnham has further fuelled rumours that he is plotting another leadership challenge. He lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 and Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. \"People have contacted me throughout the summer - yeah,\" the former minister told The Telegraph when asked if Labour MPs had encouraged him to try again. \"I'm not going to say to you that that hasn't happened. \"But as I say, it's more a decision for those people than it is for me.\" He added: \"I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?\" 'Climate of fear' He refused to rule out making a challenge before May 2026, widely seen as the point at which some Labour MPs feel Sir Keir's time could be up - if the party does badly in the next set of local elections. They include London, while the Scottish and Welsh parliaments are also up for grabs. In a direct criticism of Sir Keir, Mr Burnham said Number 10 had created a \"climate of fear\" among MPs and created \"alienation and demoralisation\" within the party. The government has already run up against its own backbenchers over issues including welfare cuts, the winter fuel payment changes, and the two-child benefit cap. A debate continues to rage on tax ahead of the budget, with the chancellor being told significant increases are needed. Labour remain behind Reform UK in the polls, having seen their popularity plummet since the 2024 general election, while the prime minister is also unpopular with the public. Despite his previous failed leadership challenges, Mr Burnham has rebuilt his image as a mayor in Manchester. He notably sparred with Boris Johnson during the pandemic, and became known as the \"King in the North\".  Burnham's manifesto Mr Burnham has set out a raft of policies he said would \"turn the country around\", including higher council tax on expensive homes in London and the South East. He would cut income tax for lower earners, but introduce a 50p rate for the highest earners, and borrow £40bn to boost the building of council houses. He also called for more public control of energy, water and rail, and signalled a willingness to work with progressive parties - including Jeremy Corbyn's still-unnamed venture.

Mr Burnham will likely use Labour's party conference, starting Sunday, to make his pitch to members, though should expect hostile briefings from those inside the government. Speaking to Politics Hub With Darren McCaffrey on Wednesday, Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire said he should \"stop sticking his oar in\". \"Keir Starmer is our prime minister,\" she said, and he should be allowed to get on with the job."

Politics latest: Labour hits highest poll rating in months The president continued his long-running criticism of Mr Khan and told delegates the UK capital was being run by a \"terrible mayor\" who had \"changed\" the city. One of his most outlandish claims was that London wanted to operate under Sharia law, Islam's legal system - something there is no evidence for.

Mr Trump has also blamed crime in London - which he said was \"through the roof\" - on Sir Sadiq's leadership, and said he had also been a \"disaster\" on immigration. The president's comments, which he made on Air Force One on the way back to Washington from London after the state visit, prompted a spokesperson for the mayor to issue a staunch defence of the city. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here,\" they said.

The London mayor's approach to Mr Trump comes in stark contrast to his Labour government colleagues, who have sought to keep the US president on side over issues including trade and tariffs. The UK steel industry has been hit with 25% tariffs, as opposed to the 50% that has been levied on other countries. The relationship between Mr Trump and Sir Sadiq presented the prime minister with an awkward moment during an hour-long news conference when the president visited Scotland in July. Mr Trump called Sir Sadiq a \"nasty person\" who has done \"a terrible job\" - to which Sir Keir interjected with a laugh: \"He's a friend of mine.\" The president added: \"I think he's done a terrible job but I will certainly visit London, I hope so.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Sir Keir Starmer is to announce a \"Pride in Place\" programme with funding for over 330 disadvantaged communities as part of a fightback against Reform UK. The money will come alongside new powers for local groups to seize boarded-up shops, save derelict pubs and block gambling and vape stores on high streets, the government said. Politics Live: Cabinet minister claims to have been victim of 'sexist briefings'  The plan aims to address the sense of isolation in deprived communities, which Labour insiders believe is feeding the rise of Reform UK. A Labour source described the programme as \"absolutely essential\" and \"transformative\". They told Sky News: \"Reform is trying to divide communities, Labour wants to empower them, and we are giving them the tools and resources to turn them around.\" The full list of places that will receive the cash boost, and how much they will get, will be confirmed by the prime minister on Thursday. \n                  Andy Burnham says Labour MPs want him to oust Starmer\n                 \n                  Big Issue founder on the 'great distraction' stopping Britain tackling 'emergency' crisis\n                 \n                  Donald Trump is 'racist, sexist and Islamophobic', says Sadiq Khan amid feud with US president\n                 The money is part of the communities funding plan announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her June spending review, which promised new investment for 350 deprived areas across the UK \"to improve parks, youth facilities, swimming pools and libraries\". The government said at the time these areas included the 75 places previously named in the Plan for Neighbourhoods, each of which will get £20m of funding over the next 10 years. The Spending Review named another 20 \"pilot neighbourhoods\" in England to receive the same amount of funding, mainly in the north or the Midlands, as well as five other pilots across the rest of the UK. Sir Keir is expected to announce the rest on Thursday. Speaking ahead of that announcement, the new housing secretary, Steve Reed, said the money will allow local people to \"decide how best to restore pride in their neighbourhoods, not us in Westminster\". He added: \"That's what real patriotism looks like: building up our communities and choosing renewal over division.\" How will the funding work?  The funding will be allocated to neighbourhood boards made up of community leaders and stakeholders, who will work closely with local councils, it is understood. They will be granted Community Right to Buy and Compulsory Purchase Powers, allowing them to buy assets like grassroots football clubs, seize derelict buildings and save local pubs, the government said. Councils will also be given powers to block betting shops, vape stores and fake barbers. The programme draws similarities with Tony Blair's New Deal for Communities (NDC), a 10-year regeneration drive that targeted 39 of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England from 2001. An independent evaluation found NDC partnerships delivered improvements across several indicators, including crime, education and health. The biggest change was how people felt about their neighbourhoods as places to live. Each area had around £50m of investment under the former Labour prime minister's programme, but these were geographically bigger than the ones the government is now targeting, it is understood. The \"Pride in Place\" Programme has been informed by the work of the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods (ICON), launched in September last year to review the state of England's neighbourhoods. ICON identified 613 \"mission critical\" neighbourhoods - those they said needed the most urgent attention to make progress on Sir Keir's \"missions\" for government. Read More;Rivals could take lessons from how Farage 'hogs the headlines' The bulk of these were in post-industrial areas in northern England, though high need was also identified in the West Midlands and coastal towns such as Blackpool and Clacton - the latter being the seat of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Many of the sites to be announced are expected to contain a mission-critical neighbourhood within them. Baroness Hilary Armstrong, a former Labour minister and chair of ICON, said: \"If residents start to see positive, tangible changes in their neighbourhoods, this should start to restore the public's faith in the power of government to do good.\" It comes at a critical time for Sir Keir, who has faced questions over whether he can survive after spending most of his first year in office languishing behind Reform UK in the polls. Labour MPs have been lobbying for the funding for some time, expressing concern that Number 10's mission to grow the economy with big infrastructure investments will not directly benefit people in areas that look and feel \"left behind\". Luke Akehurst, the Labour MP for North Durham, told Sky News: \"This is what Labour governments are all about - properly funding the areas of the county that most need help.\""

Her actions led to Mr Corbyn issuing his own statement, in which he urged members of the party to ignore an \"unauthorised\" email urging them to become paid members and that legal advice was being taken. But in a statement issued on Sunday evening, Ms Sultana acknowledged her supporters had been left feeling \"demoralised\" by the saga. \"For the sake of the party, and as an act of good faith, I will not be pursuing legal proceedings despite the baseless and unsubstantiated allegations against me,\" she said. \"I know many people are feeling demoralised - I share that feeling.

The Institute for Government (IfG), a leading think tank, said Labour's \"rash\" and \"unrealistic\" approach to tax has left the chancellor reaching for \"piecemeal changes\". Politics Hub: Follow the latest political news The government has repeatedly said it will not increase VAT rates, income tax or national insurance at the budget in November. But a report by the think tank calls on Ms Reeves to commit to serious tax reform, instead of reaching for an \"eclectic grab bag of tax raisers\", which could further complicate the system. It comes after the Resolution Foundation proposed a 2p cut in national insurance, matched by a 2p rise in income tax, to create a \"level playing field\" and protect workers' pay. Tory shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said Ms Reeves was \"preparing even more tax rises, set to hit families already struggling and choke off jobs at the very moment we need them most\". She added: \"Every Labour government ends the same way, with more people out of work, higher taxes and a bigger black hole in the public finances.\" Read more from Sky News:Government loses appeal to challenge asylum seeker's deportation blockDavey warns Farage wants to turn Britain into 'Trump's America'  Ms Whately's remarks came as the government announced a £25m funding boost for the expansion of youth hubs.

Scrapping two-child benefit limit would reduce child poverty, report suggests Meanwhile, a report has suggested scrapping the controversial two-child benefit limit would reduce child poverty, but not necessarily help with a youngster's early development and their readiness for school. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded the policy has \"no statistically significant impact\" on the proportion of children in England achieving what is known as a \"good level of development\" by age five. The two-child limit, which was announced by the Conservatives in 2015 and came into effect in 2017, limits child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. The government is expected to publish a strategy to tackle child poverty this autumn and has been under pressure to scrap the policy, which charities and organisations working in the sector estimate pulls more than 100 children a day into poverty."

Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, described Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, as a \"highly talented individual\", and suggested recent reports about him was the work of political opponents trying to discredit him. Politics latest: Minister dodges questions on two-child benefit cap Mr McSweeney, who is seen as the mastermind behind Labour's landslide election victory, is facing questions over the failure to declare more than £700,000 in donations to Labour Together, the thinktank that fuelled Sir Keir's Labour leadership campaign in 2020. Mr McSweeney led the thinktank from 2017 to 2020. As a members' association, Labour Together is required to report donations and loans to the Electoral Commission, the body that regulates election spending. In 2021, the commission fined the thinktank £14,250 for more than 20 breaches - prompting Mr McFadden to say: \"All these issues had been looked into three or four years ago.\" However, the issue has been thrust into the spotlight after the Daily Mail reported that a lawyer for the Labour Party had advised Mr McSweeney to describe the undeclared £740,000 in donations as an \"admin error\". Mr McFadden told Wilfred Frost on Sky News Breakfast: \"I think Morgan is a highly talented individual. \"I'm not surprised the Tories are targeting someone like that. They'll see him as a formidable opponent. After all, he's someone who worked with me to help deliver the biggest Labour election victory for a long, long time. So I'm not surprised that his political opponents will use every weapon they can, to try and attack him.\" Asked whether he believed Mr McSweeney would stay in post, Mr McFadden said: \"Yes, I do. \"I can see why the Tories want to make as much of this as they can, and they want you to be asking me and other Labour spokespeople about it. But the Electoral Commission... took action at the time and they issued a statement last night making clear that was the case.\" The Conservatives have called for an investigation into the donations received by Sir Keir's leadership campaign, with party chair Kevin Hollinrake alleging the prime minister may have failed to declare \"potentially thousands of pounds' worth\" of support from the thinktank. Alex Burghart, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told Sky News he would be \"pretty worried if I was Morgan McSweeney\". Referring to the scandals over the resignations of Angela Rayner and Peter Mandelson - a close ally of Mr McSweeney - Mr Burghart said: \"It seems that whenever the Labour Party announces they've got full confidence in someone, they have to resign a couple of days later.\" He accused the prime minister of not declaring to the parliamentary authorities the support he had taken from the thinktank for his leadership campaign. \"We have a register of interests... and there is no record of Keir Starmer ever having declared any support from Labour Together, despite the fact that everybody knows that it was set up in order to make him Labour leader,\" he said.

The new facility outside Oxford is part of a £1bn investment in the UK by Moderna, which specialises in mRNA. The novel vaccine technology delivered some of the most effective and fastest-to-develop jabs during the COVID pandemic. Several pharma companies, including Germany's leading mRNA pioneer BioNTech, are now racing to develop new therapies. Moderna says the plant will produce up to 100 million doses of its existing vaccine products each year. It has also been designed to scale-up production to 250 million doses a year in the event of a new disease outbreak. \"God-forbid, if there is another pandemic, we can switch the facility any day,\" said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. The UK investment deal was agreed by the previous government, but the plant's opening is welcome relief for the current one. In recent weeks, four major pharmaceutical companies have halted planned investments in the UK following disputes over drug pricing and profitability in the UK. 'A great statement' It also promises to restore domestic vaccine manufacturing capability in the UK, the lack of which was exposed when dangerous supply interruptions threatened the early COVID response. \"It's a really fast way of getting new vaccines discovered,\" said Lord Patrick Vallance, former chief scientist and now science minister. \"It's also a great statement of confidence in the UK that [Moderna has] chosen to base themselves here.\" Moderna: UK 'still believes' in vaccines The mRNA molecule is the same used by our cells to order the production of new proteins, and allows vaccines to be produced using just the genetic code of a virus or other biological target. Moderna's investment decision pre-dated Donald Trump's return to the White House, but the Moderna CEO said its operation in the UK - a country that \"still believes in vaccination\" - may pay dividends if anti-vaccine rhetoric translates into a lack of demand for its products in the US. \"If there is less appetite by governments around the world, including in the US, to use vaccines, we might invest less in vaccines,\" said Mr Bancel. \"We have to invest where there's a demand for our products.\" Read more: All health claims made by Trump - and what experts say  The UK presents other attractions for the company which has suffered substantial losses as demand for its COVID vaccine has fallen.

NASA is under pressure from Donald Trump's administration and US politicians to be first back down to the lunar surface. But China is increasingly confident in its own space programme. Jeremy Hansen, a Canadian joining three American astronauts for the Artemis mission, told me the crew were well aware of \"what's going on in the world\". \"We understand why there's this perspective of a race,\" he said at a NASA news conference. \"There are very real things happening, and you got to have heads-up play and you got to be thinking a few steps ahead. This all makes sense to us. \"Winning that race is very important to all of us.\" The mission to loop around the moon will launch as soon as February, flight testing the rocket and capsule that will play a key role in landing a crew on the lunar surface in 2027. It will be the first time that humans have looped around the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. NASA had delayed the launch because a test flight without humans on board in 2022 resulted in significant damage to the heatshield that protects the capsule as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. The space agency is now satisfied that engineering upgrades have fixed the problem and the Orion crew capsule is safe to fly. Mission commander Reid Wiseman said the crew were confident in the technology. \"When I get into Orion, it's like climbing into my bed,\" he said. \"I feel warm and tucked in.\"  The crew's trajectory around the moon will take them 5,000 miles above the surface. But they will pass over the far side of the moon, which always faces away from Earth. Christina Koch, who could become the first female astronaut to head beyond Earth's orbit, said it would be a special moment. \"We could see parts of the moon that never have had human eyes lay upon them before,\" she said.\"Human eyes are one of the best scientific instruments that we have and our geologists are beyond excited for our eyes to look at the moon. And we've been training how to turn those observations into tangible science for them.\" In the 1960s, the space race was with the Soviet Union. America won, the first to plant a flag.

Water would provide hydration for astronauts exploring and potentially mining minerals from a permanent moon base. Splitting the water molecule, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen would also provide air to breathe and the ingredients for rocket fuel. The return of Mr Trump to the White House and an accelerated Chinese space programme has made the space race 2.0 more intense. China has already beaten the US to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. And it plans to land taikonauts on the surface by 2030. There is an Outer Space Treaty which means no country can make a territorial claim to a celestial body. But Bleddyn Bowen, professor of astropolitics at Durham University, said it matters which nation reaches the surface first because they'll be able to influence ground rules. \"If China is to sustain a significant presence on the moon in the century to come, I would expect the United States and India, and perhaps Europe as well, to do something similar,\" he said. \"They'll say: 'Hey, don't forget about us, we're here as well. And if you want to develop rules and best practices in space, you can't do it without us.'\""

        "Content": "Infection rates from drug-resistant \"nightmare bacteria\" rose by 70% in the US, according to a new report.  The increase is driven by a difficult-to-treat gene called NDM, say researchers from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only two antibiotics work to treat it - and the drugs are expensive and have to be administered intraveneously. Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas, and though the numbers are still small, the rate of US cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported. \"The rise of NDMs in the US is a grave danger and very worrisome,\" said David Weiss, an infectious diseases researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The report took data from 29 states. It counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 - an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 - an increase of 460%, the authors said. \n                  China does targets differently to the West - and it may be just what the world needs\n                 \n                  UK boosts pandemic readiness with new vaccine factory\n                 \n                  Meet the NASA crew being sent to the moon - a feat not achieved for more than 50 years\n                 In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died. It's likely many people are unrecognised carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists warned. It is feared that infections long considered routine and easy to combat - like urinary tract infections - could become harder to treat, said Dr Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors. Read more from Sky News:How a tractor, lifeboat and ambulance crew saved my lifeThe health claims made by Trump Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise - unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger. 'Huge surge' A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,\" said Dr Jason Burnham, of Washington University. The CDC's count is also only a partial picture. Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to only be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of US infections \"is definitely underestimated,\" Dr Burnham said."

Known as AMT-130, it is delivered via brain surgery, and a single dose is expected to last someone's whole life. \"This result changes everything,\" said principal investigator Professor Ed Wild. Thirty-year-old Jack May-Davis, who took part in trials, said the results were \"astonishing\", leaving him \"lost for words\". Huntington's is a neurodegenerative disease which gets worse over time and has no cure, affecting thinking, movement and mood. About 8,000 people in the UK suffer from it. While the disease typically lasts for about 20 years, loss of function can begin quite quickly. In a trial, 12 patients were given the highest dose of AMT-130. Researchers reported they experienced 75% less disease progression after 36 months compared to a group of people with Huntington's who were not given the treatment. AMT-130 works by permanently introducing new functional DNA into a person's cells, researchers said. \"On the basis of these results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease, which is truly world-changing stuff,\" said Prof Wild, from the University College London (UCL) Huntington's Disease Centre. \"My patients in the trial are stable over time in a way I'm not used to seeing in Huntington's disease.\" One of them, he added, was medically retired but has been able to return to work. 'Absolutely breathtaking' findings Prof Wild told Sky News presenter Jayne Secker the 75% slowing was \"absolutely breathtaking... that could be years or decades of top quality life or even complete disease freedom if we treat early enough\".  He added: \"There are undoubtedly patients in this trial who would have been in wheelchairs by now, who are still able to walk and are independent. \"And if we can bring this therapy to as many people as possible, the impact on families who are struggling with this condition for themselves and their children will be immense.\" Could symptoms be prevented from occurring? Professor Sarah Tabrizi, also from UCL, said AMT-130 had the potential to \"preserve daily function\", keep people in work longer, and \"meaningfully slow disease progression\". She told Jayne Secker that those in the trial had \"very early symptomatic disease\", but she hopes that the therapy in future will be given to people with \"stage zero and stage one disease who have no symptoms at all\". \"And that one day we might be able to prevent the symptoms occurring, which would be a true prevention in people who carry the Huntington's gene but don't yet have symptoms.

Two family members, including his father, died from Huntington's. \"It is just amazing,\" he said. \"When I started participating in trials I never thought something would be developed in a time frame that might actually be useful for me. \"This feels like a huge moment that will mean so much to families who carry the Huntington's gene.\" Professor Mike Hanna, director of the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said: \"These findings point to a new chapter in gene therapy development for Huntington's disease, and have clear relevance for other devastating neurodegenerative disorders.\" Cath Staney, chief executive of the Huntington's Disease Association, said: \"This is a significant breakthrough, and I am sure it will bring hope to anyone affected by Huntington's disease. \"This trial shows an astonishing 75% slowing of progression in the disease. \"That is remarkable and will bring much-needed optimism to the Huntington's disease community.\""

        "Content": "Jimmy Kimmel has said it was \"never my intention to make light of\" Charlie Kirk's death. The presenter appeared almost tearful as he opened his first show since being taken off-air last week over comments about the assassination of the conservative influencer. \"I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" he said as he choked up. \"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make\". Kimmel was accused of being \"offensive and insensitive\" after using his programme, Jimmy Kimmel Live, to accuse Donald Trump and his allies of capitalising on the killing. Speaking on Tuesday night's show, Kimmel said he understood why the remarks \"felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both\".  'Not legal' to take me off-air, says Kimmel Appearing tearful again, Kimmel praised Kirk's widow, Erika, for forgiving her husband's killer at his memorial service, calling it a \"selfless act of grace... that touched me deeply\". In contrast, Mr Trump has said he disagreed, telling the service: \"I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them.\" Kimmel went on to criticise the ABC affiliates who took his show off the air, saying: \"That's not legal. That's not American. It's un-American.\" He also thanked those who supported him, adding: \"It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\" Disney announced the return of the show to its ABC network after backlash to the suspension, although two major operators said they still wouldn't show it.

I think we're going to test ABC out on this.\" In his opening monologue, Kimmel mocked Mr Trump for criticising him for bad ratings, saying: \"He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.\" Mr Trump had welcomed Kimmel's suspension, saying he had \"bad ratings\", but the move was criticised by Hollywood stars and senior Democrats including Barack Obama. What did Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk? The comments that saw Kimmel taken off-air were made last week. The TV presenter said: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" Speaking about Mr Trump, he added: \"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. \"This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.\" \"Many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalise on the murder of Charlie Kirk,\" he continued."

        "Content": " Donald Trump has claimed his appearance at the United Nations was marred by three acts of \"sabotage\". The US president alleged an escalator had malfunctioned as he was travelling up it with the first lady, Melania, that a teleprompter had failed to work, and that world leaders couldn't hear his speech. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said an escalator carrying him and his wife \"came to a screeching halt\" on the way to the main floor and nearly caused them to fall \"onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first\". \"This was absolutely sabotage,\" he claimed, as he called for the arrest of those responsible. He also said his teleprompter did not work at the start of his speech and world leaders could not hear him because the sound system failed. \"Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" Mr Trump wrote. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\" He also said he had asked the UN to preserve security camera footage and demanded an investigation, adding that the Secret Service was involved in looking into the escalator incident. Mr Trump complained about both the escalator and the teleprompter during his speech to the UN on Tuesday. UN officials have said the escalator's built-in safety mechanism had been triggered and the teleprompter was operated by the White House rather than the organisation. Analysis: Trump makes full-throttle assault on UN On Monday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a readout of the escalator's central processing unit indicated it \"had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator\". He said Mr Trump's videographer had been travelling backward up the escalator to capture his arrival with the first lady and \"may have inadvertently triggered the safety function\". A UN official told Reuters the sound system had been designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through their earpieces."
