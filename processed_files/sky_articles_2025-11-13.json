        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have scrapped plans to break their manifesto pledge and raise income tax rates in a massive U-turn less than two weeks from the budget. The decision, first reported in the Financial Times, comes after a bruising few days which has brought about a change of heart in Downing Street. Read more: How No 10 plunged itself into crisis I understand Downing Street has backed down amid fears about the backlash from disgruntled MPs and voters. The Treasury and Number 10 declined to comment. The decision is a massive about-turn. In a news conference last week, the chancellor appeared to pave the way for manifesto-breaking tax rises in the budget on 26 November. She spoke of difficult choices and insisted she could neither increase borrowing nor cut spending in order to stabilise the economy, telling the public \"everyone has to play their part\".  The decision to backtrack was communicated to the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday in a submission of \"major measures\", according to the Financial Times. The chancellor will now have to fill an estimated £30bn black hole with a series of narrower tax-raising measures and is also expected to freeze income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"We've had the longest ever run-up to a budget, damaging the economy with uncertainty, and yet - with just days to go - it is clear there is chaos in No 10 and No 11.\" How did we get here? For weeks, the government has been working up options to break the manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT on working people. I was told only this week the option being worked up was to do a combination of tax rises and action on the two-child benefit cap in order for the prime minister to be able to argue that in breaking his manifesto pledges, he is trying his hardest to protect the poorest in society and those \"working people\" he has spoken of so endlessly.  But days ago, officials and ministers were working on a proposal to lift the basic rate of income tax - perhaps by 2p - and then simultaneously cut national insurance contributions for those on the basic rate of income tax (those who earn up to £50,000 a year). That way the chancellor can raise several billion in tax from those with the \"broadest shoulders\" - higher-rate taxpayers and pensioners or landlords, while also trying to protect \"working people\" earning salaries under £50,000 a year. The chancellor was also going to take action on the two-child benefit cap in response to growing demand from the party to take action on child poverty. It is unclear whether those plans will now be shelved given the U-turn on income tax. A rough week for the PM The change of plan comes after the prime minister found himself engulfed in a leadership crisis after his allies warned rivals that he would fight any attempted post-budget coup. It triggered a briefing war between Wes Streeting and anonymous Starmer allies attacking the health secretary as the chief traitor.  Read more: Is Starmer 'in office but not in power'? The prime minister has since apologised to Mr Streeting, who I am told does not want to press for sackings in No 10 in the wake of the briefings against him. But the saga has further damaged Sir Keir and increased concerns among MPs about his suitability to lead Labour into the next general election. Insiders clearly concluded that the ill mood in the party, coupled with the recent hits to the PM's political capital, makes manifesto-breaking tax rises simply too risky right now. But it also adds to a sense of chaos, given the chancellor publicly pitch-rolled tax rises in last week's news conference."

        "Content": "The BBC has apologised to Donald Trump over the editing of a speech in a Panorama programme in 2024. The corporation said it was an \"error of judgement\" and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". But it added that it \"strongly\" disagrees that there is \"a basis for a defamation claim\". The White House has not offered comment, but instead told Sky News to direct questions to \"the president's outside counsel on this matter\". Sky News is awaiting a response from the President's counsel. BBC Trump row latest: BBC apology may be better for Trump than a lawsuit Donald Trump's legal team earlier revealed that the US president has not yet filed a lawsuit against the BBC over thebroadcaster's editing of a speech he made in 2021 on the day his supporters overran the Capitol building. Legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. \n                  Reform pulls out of BBC documentary amid Trump legal threat\n                 \n                  Trump has 'obligation' to sue 'very dishonest' BBC\n                 \n                  BBC staff seemed fed up of Tim Davie's 'nothing to see' approach\n                 Deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch. Despite this, Mr Trump's legal team sent a letter over the weekend threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn and issuing three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the Panorama programme• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president On Sunday evening, two of the BBC's top figures, including the director-general, resigned amid the row over the edit and concerns about impartiality. Arts and entertainment correspondent With the deadline fast approaching for Donald Trump's billion-dollar legal threat, all eyes were on the BBC to see how it would respond. The corporation's failure to act swiftly and decisively in the face of negative headlines is arguably what brought it to this point of crisis in the first place. An apology to Mr Trump was the right thing to do. Few within journalism would defend the edit Panorama aired. But it was equally important for the corporation to use this moment to stand by its journalists — and it has done so. Many legal experts have agreed with what the BBC implies in its statement, that it's questionable that Trump has any grounds for a defamation claim. Will a personal letter from the BBC chair be enough to silence a president who's successfully taken on other media outlets he feels wronged by? For an organisation long paralysed by fear and internal division, this is a pivotal moment. The BBC must be seen to act — and to act decisively — or risk losing the reputation it has spent decades building. Fresh allegations reported by The Telegraph tonight only deepen the sense of turmoil, suggesting that the corporation's editorial oversight has faltered at a time when clarity and leadership are most needed.\n  In a statement, the corporation said: \"Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday. \"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" On Thursday, the BBC said it was looking into fresh allegations, published in The Telegraph newspaper. The Telegraph claims another BBC programme, Newsnight, also selectively edited footage of the same speech, in a report broadcast in June 2022, two years before Panorama's edit. A BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.\" Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, on Thursday said the party had written to Sir Keir Starmer, calling on him to demand that Mr Trump \"drop his ludicrous one billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC\"."

        "Headline": "Better and more frequent train services, higher flying taxes, concern about the environmental impact of flying, and changing work patterns - especially since COVID -  have contributed to the change.",
        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n The number of domestic UK flights has more than halved over the past 20 years, even as global air travel continues to grow. This month, another UK regional airline, Eastern Airways, officially went into administration as our appetite for flying internally continues its steady descent. A total of 213,025 UK flights were scheduled in 2025, compared to a peak in 2006 of 454,375 flights, research by aviation analytics firm Cirium, has found. In other words, a fall of more than 240,000 flights, or an average daily reduction of 661 flights across the UK. Perhaps surprisingly, cost isn't a major factor in customers choosing to ditch flying for the car, coach or train, as fares have stayed roughly flat. A pre-booked London to Edinburgh flight 20 years ago cost on average between £50 and £100 (once adjusted for inflation) compared with fares of around £40 - £70 today. So what's driving the trend? A combination of better and more frequent train services, higher Air Passenger Duty tax, concern about the environmental impact of flying, and changing work patterns - especially since the pandemic - have all played a part. Jeremy Bowen, Cirium CEO, said the results showed a \"staggering change in the way we travel throughout the UK\". \"Airlines have responded by reducing their internal services and prioritising more popular destinations including Spain, France, and Italy,\" he added. Twenty years ago, Britain's skies were busy with short domestic hops - British Airways (BA) and British Midland (bmi) shuttled passengers between London and the regions, and Flybe's purple planes connected cities like Exeter, Leeds, Norwich, and Southampton. Counting the cost The impact of changing demand has been brutal. Flybe, once Europe's largest regional airline, has collapsed twice; bmi and its low-cost arm, bmibaby, is long gone; and several UK hubs have closed their commercial operations over the past 20 years, including Doncaster Sheffield in 2022, Blackpool in 2014 and Plymouth in 2011. Also, airlines have shifted their priorities to making greater profits from short-haul services beyond the UK. Aviation consultant Gavin Eccles said key low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, \"have been ordering larger aircraft which means they can fly longer sectors\". \"They need to serve routes that are predominantly with strong ancillary options [baggage, seating] and domestic is more about commuting, so fewer chances to make extra revenues,\" he explained. Read more from Sky News:Epstein called Trump 'dangerous'How AI-generated music is fooling us Indeed, many surviving airports - like Southampton, Norwich, and Exeter - now rely mainly on seasonal leisure flights. Domestic flights tend to be limited to feeder flights to long-distance hubs like Heathrow, Amsterdam, and Dublin, plus so-called lifeline-style services to remote regions, mostly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Rail firms are benefitting, with passenger journeys rising from about 1.08 billion in 2005/06 to 1.73 billion in 2024/25 - an increase of around 60%, according to the Office of Rail and Road Data."

        "Content": " Blue Origin has launched its huge New Glenn rocket with two spacecraft on board destined for Mars, as the firm makes a major step forward in its race against Elon Musk's SpaceX. Crowds cheered at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as they watched liftoff, which had been stalled for four days by bad weather, and then on Thursday suffered two further delays. Blue Origin latest: Successful launch after last-minute delay On board were two identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, which are now heading to the Red Planet and due to arrive in 2027. But the firm's big success was the recovery of the rocket's reusable first-stage booster, a critical development in the space race with SpaceX. Mr Musk posted his congratulations on X. It is only the second flight for this new type of rocket, from the company owned by Amazon tycoon, Jeff Bezos. The rocket headed out over the Atlantic, where it split into its two stages. \n                  Blue Origin latest: Big win for Jeff Bezos as rocket booster lands back on Earth after Mars mission launch\n                 \n                  Blue Origin launch: Space missions don't get any weirder than this\n                 \n                  Katy Perry floats in space as part of star-studded all-female Blue Origin mission\n                 The inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite into orbit, but failed to land the booster stage. Relief after booster recovery This time, staff cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on its platform 375 miles (600km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean. The company had never managed the feat before with a rocket so large. The recovery of the booster is an essential step to recycle and slash costs. The feat has already been achieved with such large rockets by SpaceX. Blue Origin had achieved this with its much smaller models, but if it wants to consistently run science-scale missions for NASA this is an important step. The rocket, named after American astronaut John Glenn, weighs roughly the same as 20 trucks. It can put into space a payload of 45 metric tonnes. At 98m tall and 7m wide, it is larger than most rockets, but not as big as SpaceX's Starship nor the Saturn Vs which sent humans to the moon. Science correspondent There's a new space race. And this one is for billionaires. The rocket company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has launched its first two space probes, both of them heading to Mars. It means the world's second-richest man is going head-to-head with the wannabe trillionaire Elon Musk. Jeff Bezos is a long way behind Musk's SpaceX. So far, his Blue Origin company has been focused on space tourism with the smaller New Shepard rocket.  Remember Katy Perry singing What A Wonderful World in space? That was on Bezos's rocket. But Blue Origin's second-ever launch of the much bigger New Glenn rocket, with the bragging rights of carrying two NASA spacecraft, means the competition between the two tech bros just got combustible.

Wednesday's attempt was also postponed as a powerful \"cannibal storm\" hit Earth."

Sir Keir Starmer's closest confidante has been under fire in recent days following a briefing row that saw allies of the PM say Sir Keir Starmer would fight any attempts to remove him from office. Health Secretary Wes Streeting was also accused of plotting to replace Sir Keir Starmer after the chancellor's autumn budget. Mr Streeting has strongly denied the claim, and accused Number 10 of having a \"toxic\" culture and of attempting to \"kneecap\" him. Sir Keir also disavowed the briefings, saying he \"never authorised\" the attack on his health secretary, and said cabinet ministers should not be briefed against.  This morning, several national newspapers led with calls from Labour MPs and unnamed ministers for Mr McSweeney to resign or be sacked - the chief of staff himself becoming a victim of anonymous briefings.

Mr Streeting was not among those who had called for Mr McSweeney to go, saying on Wednesday that \"there wouldn't be a Labour government\" without him. But he had a furious reaction to the briefings against him, telling Mornings With Ridge And Frost: \"I do think that going out and calling your Labour MPs 'feral' is not very helpful.\"  He added: \"I do think that trying to kneecap one of your own team when they are out, not just making the case for the government, but actually delivering the change that we promised, I think that is also self-defeating and self-destructive behaviour.\" Sir Keir said at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: \"Let me be clear. I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members. I appointed them to that post because they're the best people to carry out that job.\" He also said: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country.\" The prime minister and his health secretary spoke \"very briefly\" later that evening, in which he apologised.  On Thursday, Sir Keir said that he had been \"assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10\", and it appears that no formal investigation into who spoke to journalists on Tuesday is under way. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused Sir Keir of having \"lost control of Number 10\" and said two weeks from the 26 November budget, \"the government has descended into civil war\"."

        "Content": " The wife of British journalist Sami Hamdi, who was held for more than a fortnight by US immigration, has issued a stark warning to football fans travelling to the 2026 World Cup about the risk of being detained. Mr Hamdi, who returned to the UK on Thursday, was initially arrested at San Francisco International Airport on 26 October. US officials revoked his visa without warning while on a speaking tour, during which he criticised Israel's actions in Gaza. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the tour was cancelled due to security rules and that he was in the country illegally. Sitting alongside him in an interview for Sky's The World With Yalda Hakim, Soumaya Hamdi explained her concerns about British people travelling to the US. \"I would say to British citizens who value their freedom of speech to be very careful, because you got the World Cup in the United States coming up next year. \"If this could happen to Sami on a valid visa, a British citizen, a registered journalist, then it could very well happen again.\" \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  Police pantomime and migrants shopping for life jackets: Inside the route to the Channel\n                 \n                  'Staggering' 20-year fall in domestic UK flights - as another form of transport benefits\n                 Ms Hamdi added she was not happy about how the UK government had handled their case. \"The assistance that we received from the British government... was really very disappointing. \"I think this is really very concerning that the government is not taking more serious action with regards to our closest ally.\" Speaking about his arrest, Mr Hamdi said it had been \"quite an aggressive experience\". \"They escorted me outside of the airport, there was this black car, the kind of things you see in the movies,\" he said. \"When I asked them 'Can I call my family to let them know I'm OK?', a lady from behind grabs me, pushes me on the car, and says, 'All right, that's enough. You're under arrest'.\" Read more from Sky News:New arrest over alleged Hamas plotFears about ceasefire in SudanBritish man returns following ICE detention He added that, while in detention, he felt there was an attempt to wear him down by restricting access to justice. \"You felt, like, with ICE, it's a battle of wills. Based on the merits of the case, they can't actually win, but what they do is they keep delaying you and delaying until you're just desperate to go home.\" Mr Hamdi, who is Muslim and lives in London, insisted he had complied with all visa conditions and alleged the move was linked to his advocacy for Gaza. According to Mr Hamdi's legal team, he accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily after being charged with visa overstay. His family announced on Monday the US government had agreed to free him and confirmed on Thursday morning he was on a flight home. Discussing his treatment while in detention, Mr Hamdi said he noticed a distinct change when news outlets like Sky News became aware of his case. \"They throw you in a cell, you sleep in the foot cuffs. They kept me there with 24 hours until my legs were swollen. When I told the guards, 'Look, my legs are swollen, visibly swollen', the guards simply ignored it. \"They only started treating me better when everybody at Sky News and the other media started raising their voices.\" The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown this year, revoking visas for people accused of supporting terrorism and deporting foreign nationals who have voiced support for Palestinians. After Mr Hamdi's arrest, a spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security said his visa had been revoked as \"those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country\". But he told Sky News he strongly disputed the reason for his detention. \"On the charge sheet... there was no mention of anything related to terrorism or anything related to what they were saying online,\" he said. \"They knew no evidence existed of any of the accusations they were making. And in the end, the deal was about face-saving. I was happy to go home. \"Of course, they get to say that Sami Hamdi ended up leaving America, the case gets closed, and it worked out for both of us.\""

The easterly flow means east-facing hills could see much more rain, potentially up to 150mm (6in) in southeast Wales. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Matthew Lehnert said: \"Storm Claudia will bring very heavy rainfall to a large swathe of central and southern England and Wales on Friday into Saturday. \"This rain will become slow-moving, and some areas could see up to a month's worth of rain in 24 hours.\" Ireland's meteorological service, Met Eireann, has also issued weather warnings for parts of Ireland, with significant rain likely in the south-east into the weekend. The rain is the main hazard from Storm Claudia, but a strong easterly wind will develop, bringing gusts up to 70mph to parts of northwest Wales and north-west England, the Met Office said. A colder weekend By the weekend, the north of the UK will see a colder air mass, with overnight frosts, according to the Met Office. Some showers will persist, but overall it will be a considerably drier and brighter period of weather in this area. Further south, the weekend will start off largely cloudy and wet, and still mild in the far south. Gradually, the rain will ease and eventually clear to the south, with the drier, colder conditions further north spreading to all areas by the start of next week. Early next week, temperatures will drop sharply across the country, particularly in the north and east, bringing the first snow of the season in some areas.

Half of the country was under red and orange weather warnings on Thursday, with nearly 14,000 people left without electricity. Parts of Spain have also been under orange and yellow weather warnings on Thursday due to Storm Claudia."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  A damning independent report into the failings by the various authorities who came into contact with Sara Sharif has said the 10-year-old should never have been placed in the care of her father and stepmother, describing the killers as a \"lethal combination\". The schoolgirl was murdered by Urfan Sharif and Beinash Batool in August 2023 after a brutal campaign of abuse - which a judge at the Old Bailey later described as \"torture\". Her body was found in a bunk bed at the family home, after a crying Urfan Sharif dialled 999 from Pakistan, saying he had \"killed\" and \"beaten\" his daughter. The 10-year-old was covered in fractures, bruises and burns. It became clear that in the weeks before her death, Sara had been beaten at home with items such as a cricket bat and metal pole, and burnt with an iron. She had clearly also suffered a traumatic head injury. She had been known to social services from birth, and was twice placed in foster care by the time she was three. Later in life, she would be moved between the custody of her father and mother - with both accusing the other of abuse. In December 2024, a local Child Safeguarding Practice Review was instigated, and its independent report has now been published, concluding that \"the system failed Sara\" - from social services to the NHS and education. \n                  Sara Sharif's father and stepmother will not have murder sentences reduced, appeal judges rule\n                 \n                  Judges involved in Sara Sharif family court proceedings named\n                 \n                  Judges who oversaw family court proceedings related to care of Sara Sharif can be named\n                 \"Sara's death was not caused by one specific malfunction within the safeguarding system,\" it said. \"Numerous factors came together over many years, which cumulatively laid the foundations for the severe abuse she experienced.\" • Even though the authorities knew Urfan Sharif was a \"serial perpetrator of domestic abuse\", that information was \"overlooked, not acted on and underestimated by almost all professionals\" • The court hearing in 2019 which gave Urfan Sharif custody did \"not maintain sufficient focus on the needs of the children\" while the supervision orders put in place to protect her \"did not provide adequate safeguards\" • When her primary school reported bruising on her face to social services in the spring of 2023, the case was closed after just six days and \"safeguarding processes were not followed\" • Sara was then taken out of school. The report found \"Sara's father and stepmother used home education to keep Sara hidden from view\" - the report highlighted safeguarding gaps in the national guidance around home schooling of potentially vulnerable children, and said that locally social services failed to follow up with a home visit • When it came to the sharing of information, opportunities were \"lost to join up all the dots and recognise the dangers\" facing the little girl • There's no evidence in the children's services or health records that race, culture, religion or heritage were properly considered, and Sara's Polish mother was left in court proceedings without a translator The Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership said: \"All agencies represented by the Partnership take the findings of this report extremely seriously and will work urgently together to agree a joint action plan that puts in place the local learnings from the review.\" The report also contained 15 recommendations, which included calls on the Department for Education to close loopholes around at-risk children being withdrawn from school. The report also demanded safeguarding teams be better trained in understanding the manipulative behaviours of domestic abusers. It said agencies must ensure more robust, joined-up safeguarding processes when children are first referred to social care, and called for the impact of culture, race and language to be considered in safeguarding decisions. Surrey County Council says it will be \"working to implement all local recommendations relating to the organisation in full. Many of those are well under way or already complete, but practice is continuously reviewed and this report will help all partners improve further\".

Christopher Harrison, 68, struck Helen Holland at a pedestrian crossing while he travelled through Earl's Court, west London, on 10 May 2023. The 81-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in the collision on West Cromwell Road and died in hospital two weeks later. PC Harrison was travelling at between 44mph and 58mph as he approached the crossing, which had a 30mph speed limit, the trial previously heard. On Thursday, the officer was found not guilty at the Old Bailey of causing death by careless driving. He was acquitted by a jury who had deliberated for more than two hours. After the verdict was returned, someone shouted from the public gallery: \"You ruined our family with no consequences.\" The judge, Mr Justice Martin Chamberlain, then said PC Harrison was free to leave. The defendant, who had 21 years of experience in the specialist escort group, said he \"couldn't put it into numbers\" how many times he had undertaken the trip and that he was \"very familiar\" with the route. Ms Holland was 2.9 metres on to the crossing when PC Harrison's motorbike struck her, the court heard. She suffered a skull fracture, bruising to her arms, legs and body, as well as sustaining fractures to her lower legs. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as complications from a severe head injury. PC Harrison, who became emotional while giving evidence during the trial, told jurors the crash was a \"tragic accident\" which happened in circumstances that he had \"no control over\". Under cross-examination, he accepted he forgot to switch on his body-worn camera and did not use his whistle as he approached the pedestrian crossing, but insisted he had not been complacent on the day. \"She was just there in front of me,\" he told jurors. \"She just appeared, between the kerb line and the point of collision. \"At no point did I see her on the island, I'm sorry.\""

        "Headline": "The proportion of AI tracks - made using written prompts - has more than tripled this year, says streaming platform Deezer.",
        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n  Do you care if the music you're listening to is artificially generated? That question - once the realm of science fiction - is becoming increasingly urgent. An AI-generated country track, Walk My Walk, is currently sitting at number one on the US Billboard chart of digital sales and a new report by streaming platform Deezer has revealed the sheer scale of AI production in the music industry. Deezer's AI-detection system found that around 50,000 fully AI-generated tracks are now uploaded every day, accounting for 34% of all daily uploads. The true number is most likely higher, as Deezer's AI-detection system does not catch every AI-generated track. Nor does this figure include partially AI-generated tracks. In January 2025, Deezer's system identified 10% of uploaded tracks as fully AI-generated. Since then, the proportion of AI tracks - made using written prompts such as \"country, 1990s style, male singer\" - has more than tripled, leading the platform's chief executive, Alexis Lanternier, to say that AI music is \"flooding music streaming\". \n                  New law could help tackle AI-generated child abuse at source, says watchdog\n                 \n                  Ex-Starmer adviser's start-ups backer nears £1bn valuation\n                 \n                  Nvidia boss defends AI against claims of bubble by 'Big Short' investor\n                 'Siphoning money from royalty pool' What's more, when Deezer surveyed 9,000 people in eight countries - the US, Canada, Brazil, UK, France, Netherlands, Germany and Japan - and asked them to detect whether three tracks were real or AI, 97% could not tell the difference. That's despite the fact that the motivation behind the surge of AI music is not in the least bit creative, according to Deezer. The company says that roughly 70% of fully AI-generated tracks are what it calls \"fraudulent\" - that is, designed purely to make money. \"The common denominator is the ambition to boost streams on specific tracks in order to siphon money from the royalty pool,\" a Deezer spokesperson told Sky News. \"With AI-generated content, you can easily create massive amounts of tracks that can be used for this purpose.\" The tracks themselves are not actually fraudulent, Deezer says, but the behaviour around them is. Someone will upload an AI track then use an automated system - a bot - to listen to a song over and over again to make royalties from it. Even though the total number of streams for each individual track is very low - Deezer estimates that together they account for 0.5% of all streams - the work needed to make an AI track is so tiny that the rewards justify the effort. Are fully-AI tracks being removed? Deezer is investing in AI-detection software and has filed two patents for systems that spot AI music. But it is not taking down the tracks it marks as fully-AI. Instead it removes them from algorithmic recommendations and editorial playlists, a measure designed to stop the tracks getting streams and therefore generating royalties, and marks the tracks as \"AI-generated content\". \"If people want to listen to an AI-generated track however, they can and we are not stopping them from doing so - we just want to make sure they are making a conscious decision,\" the Deezer spokesperson says. Read more from Sky News:How Elon Musk is boosting the British rightThe extraordinary impact of a crime on UK growth Concerns about artists' livelihoods Deezer's survey found that more than half (52%) of respondents felt uncomfortable with not being able to tell the difference between AI and human-made music. \"The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they're listening to AI or human-made tracks or not,\" said the company's boss Alexis Lanternier. \"There's also no doubt that there are concerns about how AI-generated music will affect the livelihood of artists.\"  Earlier this year, more than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album to protest plans by the UK government to let artificial intelligence companies use copyright-protected work without permission. A recent study commissioned by the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers suggested that generative AI music could be worth £146bn a year in 2028 and account for around 60% of music libraries' revenues. By this metric, the authors concluded, 25% of creators' revenues are at risk by 2028, a sum of £3.5bn."

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have scrapped plans to break their manifesto pledge and raise income tax rates in a massive U-turn less than two weeks from the budget. The decision, first reported in the Financial Times, comes after a bruising few days which has brought about a change of heart in Downing Street. Read more: How No 10 plunged itself into crisis I understand Downing Street has backed down amid fears about the backlash from disgruntled MPs and voters. The Treasury and Number 10 declined to comment. The decision is a massive about-turn. In a news conference last week, the chancellor appeared to pave the way for manifesto-breaking tax rises in the budget on 26 November. She spoke of difficult choices and insisted she could neither increase borrowing nor cut spending in order to stabilise the economy, telling the public \"everyone has to play their part\".  The decision to backtrack was communicated to the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday in a submission of \"major measures\", according to the Financial Times. The chancellor will now have to fill an estimated £30bn black hole with a series of narrower tax-raising measures and is also expected to freeze income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"We've had the longest ever run-up to a budget, damaging the economy with uncertainty, and yet - with just days to go - it is clear there is chaos in No 10 and No 11.\" How did we get here? For weeks, the government has been working up options to break the manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT on working people. I was told only this week the option being worked up was to do a combination of tax rises and action on the two-child benefit cap in order for the prime minister to be able to argue that in breaking his manifesto pledges, he is trying his hardest to protect the poorest in society and those \"working people\" he has spoken of so endlessly.  But days ago, officials and ministers were working on a proposal to lift the basic rate of income tax - perhaps by 2p - and then simultaneously cut national insurance contributions for those on the basic rate of income tax (those who earn up to £50,000 a year). That way the chancellor can raise several billion in tax from those with the \"broadest shoulders\" - higher-rate taxpayers and pensioners or landlords, while also trying to protect \"working people\" earning salaries under £50,000 a year. The chancellor was also going to take action on the two-child benefit cap in response to growing demand from the party to take action on child poverty. It is unclear whether those plans will now be shelved given the U-turn on income tax. A rough week for the PM The change of plan comes after the prime minister found himself engulfed in a leadership crisis after his allies warned rivals that he would fight any attempted post-budget coup. It triggered a briefing war between Wes Streeting and anonymous Starmer allies attacking the health secretary as the chief traitor.  Read more: Is Starmer 'in office but not in power'? The prime minister has since apologised to Mr Streeting, who I am told does not want to press for sackings in No 10 in the wake of the briefings against him. But the saga has further damaged Sir Keir and increased concerns among MPs about his suitability to lead Labour into the next general election. Insiders clearly concluded that the ill mood in the party, coupled with the recent hits to the PM's political capital, makes manifesto-breaking tax rises simply too risky right now. But it also adds to a sense of chaos, given the chancellor publicly pitch-rolled tax rises in last week's news conference."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n The number of domestic UK flights has more than halved over the past 20 years, even as global air travel continues to grow. This month, another UK regional airline, Eastern Airways, officially went into administration as our appetite for flying internally continues its steady descent. A total of 213,025 UK flights were scheduled in 2025, compared to a peak in 2006 of 454,375 flights, research by aviation analytics firm Cirium, has found. In other words, a fall of more than 240,000 flights, or an average daily reduction of 661 flights across the UK. Perhaps surprisingly, cost isn't a major factor in customers choosing to ditch flying for the car, coach or train, as fares have stayed roughly flat. A pre-booked London to Edinburgh flight 20 years ago cost on average between £50 and £100 (once adjusted for inflation) compared with fares of around £40 - £70 today. So what's driving the trend? A combination of better and more frequent train services, higher Air Passenger Duty tax, concern about the environmental impact of flying, and changing work patterns - especially since the pandemic - have all played a part. Jeremy Bowen, Cirium CEO, said the results showed a \"staggering change in the way we travel throughout the UK\". \"Airlines have responded by reducing their internal services and prioritising more popular destinations including Spain, France, and Italy,\" he added. Twenty years ago, Britain's skies were busy with short domestic hops - British Airways (BA) and British Midland (bmi) shuttled passengers between London and the regions, and Flybe's purple planes connected cities like Exeter, Leeds, Norwich, and Southampton. Counting the cost The impact of changing demand has been brutal. Flybe, once Europe's largest regional airline, has collapsed twice; bmi and its low-cost arm, bmibaby, is long gone; and several UK hubs have closed their commercial operations over the past 20 years, including Doncaster Sheffield in 2022, Blackpool in 2014 and Plymouth in 2011. Also, airlines have shifted their priorities to making greater profits from short-haul services beyond the UK. Aviation consultant Gavin Eccles said key low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, \"have been ordering larger aircraft which means they can fly longer sectors\". \"They need to serve routes that are predominantly with strong ancillary options [baggage, seating] and domestic is more about commuting, so fewer chances to make extra revenues,\" he explained. Read more from Sky News:Epstein called Trump 'dangerous'How AI-generated music is fooling us Indeed, many surviving airports - like Southampton, Norwich, and Exeter - now rely mainly on seasonal leisure flights. Domestic flights tend to be limited to feeder flights to long-distance hubs like Heathrow, Amsterdam, and Dublin, plus so-called lifeline-style services to remote regions, mostly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Rail firms are benefitting, with passenger journeys rising from about 1.08 billion in 2005/06 to 1.73 billion in 2024/25 - an increase of around 60%, according to the Office of Rail and Road Data."

The White House has not offered comment, but instead told Sky News to direct questions to \"the president's outside counsel on this matter\". Sky News is awaiting a response from the President's counsel. BBC Trump row latest: BBC apology may be better for Trump than a lawsuit Donald Trump's legal team earlier revealed that the US president has not yet filed a lawsuit against the BBC over thebroadcaster's editing of a speech he made in 2021 on the day his supporters overran the Capitol building. Legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. \n                  Reform pulls out of BBC documentary amid Trump legal threat\n                 \n                  Trump has 'obligation' to sue 'very dishonest' BBC\n                 \n                  BBC staff seemed fed up of Tim Davie's 'nothing to see' approach\n                 Deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch. Despite this, Mr Trump's legal team sent a letter over the weekend threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn and issuing three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the Panorama programme• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president On Sunday evening, two of the BBC's top figures, including the director-general, resigned amid the row over the edit and concerns about impartiality. Arts and entertainment correspondent With the deadline fast approaching for Donald Trump's billion-dollar legal threat, all eyes were on the BBC to see how it would respond. The corporation's failure to act swiftly and decisively in the face of negative headlines is arguably what brought it to this point of crisis in the first place. An apology to Mr Trump was the right thing to do. Few within journalism would defend the edit Panorama aired. But it was equally important for the corporation to use this moment to stand by its journalists — and it has done so. Many legal experts have agreed with what the BBC implies in its statement, that it's questionable that Trump has any grounds for a defamation claim. Will a personal letter from the BBC chair be enough to silence a president who's successfully taken on other media outlets he feels wronged by? For an organisation long paralysed by fear and internal division, this is a pivotal moment. The BBC must be seen to act — and to act decisively — or risk losing the reputation it has spent decades building. Fresh allegations reported by The Telegraph tonight only deepen the sense of turmoil, suggesting that the corporation's editorial oversight has faltered at a time when clarity and leadership are most needed.\n  In a statement, the corporation said: \"Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday. \"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" On Thursday, the BBC said it was looking into fresh allegations, published in The Telegraph newspaper. The Telegraph claims another BBC programme, Newsnight, also selectively edited footage of the same speech, in a report broadcast in June 2022, two years before Panorama's edit. A BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.\" Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, on Thursday said the party had written to Sir Keir Starmer, calling on him to demand that Mr Trump \"drop his ludicrous one billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC\"."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @rachaelvenables\n  A damning independent report into the failings by the various authorities who came into contact with Sara Sharif has said the 10-year-old should never have been placed in the care of her father and stepmother, describing the killers as a \"lethal combination\". The schoolgirl was murdered by Urfan Sharif and Beinash Batool in August 2023 after a brutal campaign of abuse - which a judge at the Old Bailey later described as \"torture\". Her body was found in a bunk bed at the family home, after a crying Urfan Sharif dialled 999 from Pakistan, saying he had \"killed\" and \"beaten\" his daughter. The 10-year-old was covered in fractures, bruises and burns. It became clear that in the weeks before her death, Sara had been beaten at home with items such as a cricket bat and metal pole, and burnt with an iron. She had clearly also suffered a traumatic head injury. She had been known to social services from birth, and was twice placed in foster care by the time she was three. Later in life, she would be moved between the custody of her father and mother - with both accusing the other of abuse. In December 2024, a local Child Safeguarding Practice Review was instigated, and its independent report has now been published, concluding that \"the system failed Sara\" - from social services to the NHS and education. \n                  Sara Sharif's father and stepmother will not have murder sentences reduced, appeal judges rule\n                 \n                  Judges involved in Sara Sharif family court proceedings named\n                 \n                  Judges who oversaw family court proceedings related to care of Sara Sharif can be named\n                 \"Sara's death was not caused by one specific malfunction within the safeguarding system,\" it said. \"Numerous factors came together over many years, which cumulatively laid the foundations for the severe abuse she experienced.\" • Even though the authorities knew Urfan Sharif was a \"serial perpetrator of domestic abuse\", that information was \"overlooked, not acted on and underestimated by almost all professionals\" • The court hearing in 2019 which gave Urfan Sharif custody did \"not maintain sufficient focus on the needs of the children\" while the supervision orders put in place to protect her \"did not provide adequate safeguards\" • When her primary school reported bruising on her face to social services in the spring of 2023, the case was closed after just six days and \"safeguarding processes were not followed\" • Sara was then taken out of school. The report found \"Sara's father and stepmother used home education to keep Sara hidden from view\" - the report highlighted safeguarding gaps in the national guidance around home schooling of potentially vulnerable children, and said that locally social services failed to follow up with a home visit • When it came to the sharing of information, opportunities were \"lost to join up all the dots and recognise the dangers\" facing the little girl • There's no evidence in the children's services or health records that race, culture, religion or heritage were properly considered, and Sara's Polish mother was left in court proceedings without a translator The Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership said: \"All agencies represented by the Partnership take the findings of this report extremely seriously and will work urgently together to agree a joint action plan that puts in place the local learnings from the review.\" The report also contained 15 recommendations, which included calls on the Department for Education to close loopholes around at-risk children being withdrawn from school. The report also demanded safeguarding teams be better trained in understanding the manipulative behaviours of domestic abusers. It said agencies must ensure more robust, joined-up safeguarding processes when children are first referred to social care, and called for the impact of culture, race and language to be considered in safeguarding decisions. Surrey County Council says it will be \"working to implement all local recommendations relating to the organisation in full. Many of those are well under way or already complete, but practice is continuously reviewed and this report will help all partners improve further\".

        "Content": " The wife of British journalist Sami Hamdi, who was held for more than a fortnight by US immigration, has issued a stark warning to football fans travelling to the 2026 World Cup about the risk of being detained. Mr Hamdi, who returned to the UK on Thursday, was initially arrested at San Francisco International Airport on 26 October. US officials revoked his visa without warning while on a speaking tour, during which he criticised Israel's actions in Gaza. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the tour was cancelled due to security rules and that he was in the country illegally. Sitting alongside him in an interview for Sky's The World With Yalda Hakim, Soumaya Hamdi explained her concerns about British people travelling to the US. \"I would say to British citizens who value their freedom of speech to be very careful, because you got the World Cup in the United States coming up next year. \"If this could happen to Sami on a valid visa, a British citizen, a registered journalist, then it could very well happen again.\" \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  Police pantomime and migrants shopping for life jackets: Inside the route to the Channel\n                 \n                  'Staggering' 20-year fall in domestic UK flights - as another form of transport benefits\n                 Ms Hamdi added she was not happy about how the UK government had handled their case. \"The assistance that we received from the British government... was really very disappointing. \"I think this is really very concerning that the government is not taking more serious action with regards to our closest ally.\" Speaking about his arrest, Mr Hamdi said it had been \"quite an aggressive experience\". \"They escorted me outside of the airport, there was this black car, the kind of things you see in the movies,\" he said. \"When I asked them 'Can I call my family to let them know I'm OK?', a lady from behind grabs me, pushes me on the car, and says, 'All right, that's enough. You're under arrest'.\" Read more from Sky News:New arrest over alleged Hamas plotFears about ceasefire in SudanBritish man returns following ICE detention He added that, while in detention, he felt there was an attempt to wear him down by restricting access to justice. \"You felt, like, with ICE, it's a battle of wills. Based on the merits of the case, they can't actually win, but what they do is they keep delaying you and delaying until you're just desperate to go home.\" Mr Hamdi, who is Muslim and lives in London, insisted he had complied with all visa conditions and alleged the move was linked to his advocacy for Gaza. According to Mr Hamdi's legal team, he accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily after being charged with visa overstay. His family announced on Monday the US government had agreed to free him and confirmed on Thursday morning he was on a flight home. Discussing his treatment while in detention, Mr Hamdi said he noticed a distinct change when news outlets like Sky News became aware of his case. \"They throw you in a cell, you sleep in the foot cuffs. They kept me there with 24 hours until my legs were swollen. When I told the guards, 'Look, my legs are swollen, visibly swollen', the guards simply ignored it. \"They only started treating me better when everybody at Sky News and the other media started raising their voices.\" The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown this year, revoking visas for people accused of supporting terrorism and deporting foreign nationals who have voiced support for Palestinians. After Mr Hamdi's arrest, a spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security said his visa had been revoked as \"those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country\". But he told Sky News he strongly disputed the reason for his detention. \"On the charge sheet... there was no mention of anything related to terrorism or anything related to what they were saying online,\" he said. \"They knew no evidence existed of any of the accusations they were making. And in the end, the deal was about face-saving. I was happy to go home. \"Of course, they get to say that Sami Hamdi ended up leaving America, the case gets closed, and it worked out for both of us.\""

        "Content": "A Metropolitan Police motorcyclist has been found not guilty of causing death by careless driving after hitting a pensioner while escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh. Christopher Harrison, 68, struck Helen Holland at a pedestrian crossing while he travelled through Earl's Court, west London, on 10 May 2023. The 81-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in the collision on West Cromwell Road and died in hospital two weeks later. PC Harrison was travelling at between 44mph and 58mph as he approached the crossing, which had a 30mph speed limit, the trial previously heard. On Thursday, the officer was found not guilty at the Old Bailey of causing death by careless driving. He was acquitted by a jury who had deliberated for more than two hours. After the verdict was returned, someone shouted from the public gallery: \"You ruined our family with no consequences.\" The judge, Mr Justice Martin Chamberlain, then said PC Harrison was free to leave. The defendant, who had 21 years of experience in the specialist escort group, said he \"couldn't put it into numbers\" how many times he had undertaken the trip and that he was \"very familiar\" with the route. Ms Holland was 2.9 metres on to the crossing when PC Harrison's motorbike struck her, the court heard. She suffered a skull fracture, bruising to her arms, legs and body, as well as sustaining fractures to her lower legs. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as complications from a severe head injury. PC Harrison, who became emotional while giving evidence during the trial, told jurors the crash was a \"tragic accident\" which happened in circumstances that he had \"no control over\". Under cross-examination, he accepted he forgot to switch on his body-worn camera and did not use his whistle as he approached the pedestrian crossing, but insisted he had not been complacent on the day. \"She was just there in front of me,\" he told jurors. \"She just appeared, between the kerb line and the point of collision. \"At no point did I see her on the island, I'm sorry.\""

        "Content": "The prime minister's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney will not leave his job at Number 10, Sky News understands, despite furious calls for him to be dismissed. Sir Keir Starmer's closest confidante has been under fire in recent days following a briefing row that saw allies of the PM say Sir Keir Starmer would fight any attempts to remove him from office. Health Secretary Wes Streeting was also accused of plotting to replace Sir Keir Starmer after the chancellor's autumn budget. Mr Streeting has strongly denied the claim, and accused Number 10 of having a \"toxic\" culture and of attempting to \"kneecap\" him. Sir Keir also disavowed the briefings, saying he \"never authorised\" the attack on his health secretary, and said cabinet ministers should not be briefed against.  This morning, several national newspapers led with calls from Labour MPs and unnamed ministers for Mr McSweeney to resign or be sacked - the chief of staff himself becoming a victim of anonymous briefings. But Sky News understands that he categorically denies he was \"directly or indirectly\" behind the briefings and will be remaining in his job. \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  'In office but not in power' - Is Norman Lamont's famous quote relevant today?\n                 \n                  PM apologises to Streeting after 'Traitors' row\n                 Mr McSweeney has been in post as chief of staff since October 2024, and is credited as being a key architect of Labour's transformation following the 2019 election defeat and subsequent victory in 2024. Mr Streeting was not among those who had called for Mr McSweeney to go, saying on Wednesday that \"there wouldn't be a Labour government\" without him. But he had a furious reaction to the briefings against him, telling Mornings With Ridge And Frost: \"I do think that going out and calling your Labour MPs 'feral' is not very helpful.\"  He added: \"I do think that trying to kneecap one of your own team when they are out, not just making the case for the government, but actually delivering the change that we promised, I think that is also self-defeating and self-destructive behaviour.\" Sir Keir said at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: \"Let me be clear. I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members. I appointed them to that post because they're the best people to carry out that job.\" He also said: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country.\" The prime minister and his health secretary spoke \"very briefly\" later that evening, in which he apologised.  On Thursday, Sir Keir said that he had been \"assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10\", and it appears that no formal investigation into who spoke to journalists on Tuesday is under way. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused Sir Keir of having \"lost control of Number 10\" and said two weeks from the 26 November budget, \"the government has descended into civil war\"."

        "Content": "Three men have been jailed after they collected cocaine worth £26.5m from a ship off the Somerset coast, having claimed they were selling a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). Craig Nuttall, 51, and his brother Raymond Nuttall, 47, provided details of an RHIB, named \"Guzzla\", after arriving at Watchet Marina in Somerset on 23 July this year. They told the marina manager they had planned to stay in the area for a few days to fish. When the Guzzla was searched by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers early on 31 July, it was found to have on board a large number of bale-sized packages containing cocaine of 89% purity. A firearm was also discovered. The evening before, the Nuttalls were joined by Greek national Anestis Tsepa, 24, from Thessalonika, and 38-year-old Albanian national Melios Delvina. Raymond Nuttall was seen to drive a van down the quayside before removing two jerry cans and a hose from the rear. By 8.46pm on 30 July, Craig Nuttall, Tsepa and Delvina were in the RHIB wearing lifejackets and making their way out to sea. What did audio messages show? Audio messages, forming part of the NCA investigation, later found on Tsepa's device, showed that they took the boat out to sea and were organising an at-sea drop-off. A larger vessel is believed to have dropped illegal drugs into the sea and was set to be collected by a smaller boat. In the messages, over the sound of the Guzzla's engine, they can be heard discussing how long it would take their boat to arrive, clarifying which mother vessel they should follow, and stating that they were now ready, and waiting for that larger vessel to give a signal. They returned to the marina at 1am on 31 July and began to try to connect the boat to a trailer that Raymond Nuttall had driven down the slipway. However, NCA officers then stepped in and arrested the four men on suspicion of importation of Class A drugs. What happened during NCA search? When the boat was searched, it was found to contain packages that had been stored along the floor and between the seats. There were 14 packages in total, containing a further 322 smaller packages, each weighing a kilo. The Nuttalls and Tsepa provided no comment responses to NCA officers in interview.

Tsepa also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition. Raymond Nuttall and Craig Nuttall were sentenced to 11 years and three months, and 11 years and two months respectively, while Anestis Tsepa was given a 16-year jail term at the same court.

From 2 January, the owners of electric cars will be charged £13.50 a day, while electric van and lorry drivers will pay £9. These are reductions of 25% and 50% respectively on the £18 which other motorists will have to pay from that date, a £3 increase on the current fee of £15. At the moment, pure battery-powered EVs are eligible for a 100% discount on the congestion charge, which was first introduced in 2003.

Mayor Sadiq Khan has insisted it is essential the scheme \"stays fit for purpose\", claiming the capital faces an increase of 2,200 extra vehicles in the zone on an average weekday next year.

TfL said this would \"undermine the benefits\" of the scheme by causing \"more queues and delays\". Sir Sadiq said: \"Keeping London moving by reducing congestion is vital for our city and for our economy. \"While the congestion charge has been a huge success since its introduction, we must ensure it stays fit for purpose.\" The decision to put up the charges comes ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget - when there are suggestions she could bring in a pay as you drive tax on EVs in the upcoming budget."

        "Content": "By Felix Pope, news reporter  Since he served in the First World War and was mocked by his fellow soldiers, rumours have circulated about Adolf Hitler's sexual abnormalities.  Now, fresh research conducted by an international team of scientists and historians is said to finally shed light on what exactly was wrong with the Nazi leader. After analysing a strand of his DNA, they say there is a high likelihood he suffered from some form of Kallman Syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty. Contrary to another myth, however, they also found that the German dictator had no Jewish ancestry. The findings include the discovery that a gene named PROK2, which is related to the development of sexual organs, was depleted for Hitler. Its absence is associated with lower-than-normal testosterone levels and can result in a micropenis, which is typically just a few centimetres long. Professor Turi King, who is the lead geneticist on the research and previously identified the remains of King Richard III, told Sky News: \"If you'd told me a few years ago I'd be talking about Hitler's genitals, I would never would have believed it.\" \n                  Monument honours millions who did not fight in WWII - but whose roles were vital to war effort\n                 \n                  Appeal for 100th birthday cards for Second World War veteran Dougie Shelley\n                 \n                  Queen appears emotional following 'off script' comments by veteran about King at VJ event\n                 She said she \"agonised\" over the decision of whether to examine his DNA but decided to because thousands of other archaeological remains had been subjected to the same process. \"Why should Hitler be any different?\" she asked herself. \"Why should we not do him? That would be to put him on a pedestal.\" The team's findings, Professor King said, would add \"another layer of information\" to our understanding of one of the most studied men in history. It also offers insight into the central theme of the famous wartime song Hitler Has Only Got One Ball, which was popular among Britons as part of efforts to malign the German leadership. The DNA studied came originally from a bloodstained sofa in Hitler's bunker. When Soviet forces let in General Dwight D Eisenhower after the fall of the Nazi regime, his communications officer, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren, cut off a piece and took it home with him. After sitting in his safe for decades, it was eventually sold to the Gettysburg Museum of History.

Yet now that Hitler's DNA has been analysed, it would be wrong and even unethical to attempt to put the genie back into the bottle and to ignore the results of the analysis. \"The genetic make-up of extremists and non-extremists is on average the same.

        "Content": "A top adviser to the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has said US secretary of state Marco Rubio's remarks on halting weapons supplies \"jeopardise ceasefire efforts\". In his remarks yesterday, Mr Rubio called for international powers to stop sending military support to the RSF, the paramilitary group which has been at war with the Sudanese Army since 2023. \"This needs to stop. They're clearly receiving assistance from outside,\" Mr Rubio said. In a statement on X, Elbasha Tibeig, adviser to RSF leader Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, dismissed Mr Rubio's comments as \"an unsuccessful step\" that does not serve global efforts aimed at reaching a humanitarian ceasefire. Mr Tibeig said Mr Rubio's comments may lead to an escalation of the fighting. The US, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - known as the Quad - have been working on ways to end the war. The war began in April 2023 after the Sudanese army and RSF, then partners, clashed over plans to integrate. \n                  Police pantomime and migrants shopping for life jackets: Inside the route to the Channel\n                 \n                  Epstein latest: Paedophile financier calls Trump 'dangerous' and the worst person he knows in released email\n                 \n                  Why Putin is like 'medieval monarch' - and one thing could bring him around to ceasefire | Michael Clarke Q&A\n                 Last week, the RSF said they had agreed to a US-led proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire. Mr Rubio doesn't believe the RSF intends to comply with that agreement. \"The RSF has concluded that they're winning and they want to keep going,\" he said yesterday. He added that they're \"not just fighting a war, which war alone is bad enough. They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind. And it needs to end immediately\". The war has killed at least 40,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, and displaced millions more. Aid groups say that the true death toll could be much higher. The RSF is accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity across Sudan since the war started. Most recently, there were reports of mass killings during the fall of Al Fashir, a city which was recently captured by the RSF. A Sky News investigation into events in Al Fashir found thousands were targeted in 'killing fields' around the Sudanese city. Marco Rubio did not specify which countries he was referring to in his calls to halt arms supplies, but US intelligence assessments have found that the United Arab Emirates, a close US ally, has been supplying weapons. Previous reporting on Sky News has supported allegations that the UAE militarily supports the RSF, though the country officially denies it. \"I can just tell you, at the highest levels of our government, that case is being made and that pressure is being applied to the relevant parties,\" Mr Rubio said."

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n The Paralympics is preparing the ground for a potential ban on transgender women competing in women's sports, with science to guide their decision, and plans to take the lead from the Olympic movement. International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons was part of the Olympic scientific meetings last week that were understood to have highlighted trans women retaining physical advantages after going through male puberty - providing an edge in the pursuit of medals. Such a ban could be seen as discriminatory but safety and fairness concerns are now being prioritised by sports leaders amid pressure from US President Donald Trump. No new policy would be in place in time for the Winter Games next year in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy. The Paralympics are in March. Mr Parsons, who is also an International Olympic Committee (IOC) member, told Sky News: \"Science should guide this decision, so it should not be cultural, religious or even social elements driving how the transgender situation should be dealt with in the world of sport. \"And what I have seen, the only thing I can share with you is that science is guiding the IOC direction that they are still going to take on the transgender issue. \"But I think it's important that the IOC is taking the lead. We do understand that it affects different sports differently. \"But again, when you have the IOC taking the leadership, it's very positive because it also provides directions to everyone else in the sport world.\" Paris 2024 saw sprinter Valentina Petrillo become the first openly transgender athlete to compete at a Paralympics but the Italian won no medals. The IPC has been allowing each sport to set its own gender eligibility policies. Read more from Sky News:Wife of Briton held in US warns UK fans going to World CupAmber weather warning issued for parts of UK Mr Parsons is still cautious, saying the IPC would have to consider after the IOC decision \"if it's something we would like to follow\" and if further research is required. The Brazilian said: \"We may see more transgender (athletes) taking part in sport activities. And then there is a big discussion on if they have a sport advantage or not compared to female athletes. \"So I think it's a hot topic, obviously, that we do not ignore the big discussions in the world of sport.\" The plan at the IOC, Sky News understands, is a blanket ban also on athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) from women's sport. The IOC said no decision has been taken. That could come at an IOC session meeting next year."

Mohammed Shia al Sudani, who has led the Middle Eastern nation since 2022, was seeking a second term in power. During the campaign, he attempted to portray himself as a leader who could bring stability to Iraq after years of crisis. But many young voters saw the vote as a means for the country's elite to divide the spoils of the country's oil wealth among themselves. The coalition Mr Sudani leads received 1.32 million votes. Turnout was 56.11%, the electoral commission said on Wednesday. Supporters of the prime minister held celebrations in Baghdad shortly after the announcement of the preliminary results. Hamid Hemid hailed his victory, saying: \"He is the number one in Iraq, and not only Baghdad.\" However, the result does not mean Mr Sudani will necessarily remain the prime minister. No single bloc of parties won enough seats to form the government themselves, meaning a coalition deal will have to be struck. In several past elections in Iraq, the group winning the most seats has not been able to impose its preferred candidate.

Earlier this year, Mr Sudani travelled to London to negotiate a series of deals on the economy and diplomacy. Speaking to Sky News during his visit, he insisted he was in control of Iraq despite the presence of armed groups using its territory to attack Israel. He said: \"We're not embarrassed in any way, we carry out our duties to enforce the law, to maintain security and stability in Iraq and reject all means of violence. We won't allow any side to dictate the decision between peace and war.\""

Police alleged that he took possession of an automatic rifle, eight pistols and 600 pieces of ammunition in August. A statement by the federal prosecutor said he was given the weapons in the central German city of Hesse by another member of the group named Borhan El-K. El-K was arrested on Tuesday night near the Czech border. It's alleged that following the exchange, Mahmoud Z then brought the guns to Berlin and handed them to another alleged Hamas member called Wael FM.

        "Content": "By Felix Pope, news reporter  Since he served in the First World War and was mocked by his fellow soldiers, rumours have circulated about Adolf Hitler's sexual abnormalities.  Now, fresh research conducted by an international team of scientists and historians is said to finally shed light on what exactly was wrong with the Nazi leader. After analysing a strand of his DNA, they say there is a high likelihood he suffered from some form of Kallman Syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty. Contrary to another myth, however, they also found that the German dictator had no Jewish ancestry. The findings include the discovery that a gene named PROK2, which is related to the development of sexual organs, was depleted for Hitler. Its absence is associated with lower-than-normal testosterone levels and can result in a micropenis, which is typically just a few centimetres long. Professor Turi King, who is the lead geneticist on the research and previously identified the remains of King Richard III, told Sky News: \"If you'd told me a few years ago I'd be talking about Hitler's genitals, I would never would have believed it.\" \n                  Monument honours millions who did not fight in WWII - but whose roles were vital to war effort\n                 \n                  Appeal for 100th birthday cards for Second World War veteran Dougie Shelley\n                 \n                  Queen appears emotional following 'off script' comments by veteran about King at VJ event\n                 She said she \"agonised\" over the decision of whether to examine his DNA but decided to because thousands of other archaeological remains had been subjected to the same process. \"Why should Hitler be any different?\" she asked herself. \"Why should we not do him? That would be to put him on a pedestal.\" The team's findings, Professor King said, would add \"another layer of information\" to our understanding of one of the most studied men in history. It also offers insight into the central theme of the famous wartime song Hitler Has Only Got One Ball, which was popular among Britons as part of efforts to malign the German leadership. The DNA studied came originally from a bloodstained sofa in Hitler's bunker. When Soviet forces let in General Dwight D Eisenhower after the fall of the Nazi regime, his communications officer, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren, cut off a piece and took it home with him. After sitting in his safe for decades, it was eventually sold to the Gettysburg Museum of History. The research also found that Hitler had a high polygenic risk score - a measure created by examining an individual's DNA against the genetics of the population at large - for autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Crowds cheered at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as they watched liftoff, which had been stalled for four days by bad weather, and then on Thursday suffered two further delays. Blue Origin latest: Successful launch after last-minute delay On board were two identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, which are now heading to the Red Planet and due to arrive in 2027. But the firm's big success was the recovery of the rocket's reusable first-stage booster, a critical development in the space race with SpaceX. Mr Musk posted his congratulations on X.

Relief after booster recovery This time, staff cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on its platform 375 miles (600km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean. The company had never managed the feat before with a rocket so large. The recovery of the booster is an essential step to recycle and slash costs. The feat has already been achieved with such large rockets by SpaceX. Blue Origin had achieved this with its much smaller models, but if it wants to consistently run science-scale missions for NASA this is an important step. The rocket, named after American astronaut John Glenn, weighs roughly the same as 20 trucks. It can put into space a payload of 45 metric tonnes. At 98m tall and 7m wide, it is larger than most rockets, but not as big as SpaceX's Starship nor the Saturn Vs which sent humans to the moon. Science correspondent There's a new space race. And this one is for billionaires. The rocket company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has launched its first two space probes, both of them heading to Mars. It means the world's second-richest man is going head-to-head with the wannabe trillionaire Elon Musk. Jeff Bezos is a long way behind Musk's SpaceX. So far, his Blue Origin company has been focused on space tourism with the smaller New Shepard rocket.  Remember Katy Perry singing What A Wonderful World in space? That was on Bezos's rocket. But Blue Origin's second-ever launch of the much bigger New Glenn rocket, with the bragging rights of carrying two NASA spacecraft, means the competition between the two tech bros just got combustible.

Based on the merits of the case, they can't actually win, but what they do is they keep delaying you and delaying until you're just desperate to go home.\" Mr Hamdi, who is Muslim and lives in London, insisted he had complied with all visa conditions and alleged the move was linked to his advocacy for Gaza. According to Mr Hamdi's legal team, he accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily after being charged with visa overstay. His family announced on Monday the US government had agreed to free him and confirmed on Thursday morning he was on a flight home. Discussing his treatment while in detention, Mr Hamdi said he noticed a distinct change when news outlets like Sky News became aware of his case. \"They throw you in a cell, you sleep in the foot cuffs. They kept me there with 24 hours until my legs were swollen. When I told the guards, 'Look, my legs are swollen, visibly swollen', the guards simply ignored it. \"They only started treating me better when everybody at Sky News and the other media started raising their voices.\" The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown this year, revoking visas for people accused of supporting terrorism and deporting foreign nationals who have voiced support for Palestinians. After Mr Hamdi's arrest, a spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security said his visa had been revoked as \"those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country\". But he told Sky News he strongly disputed the reason for his detention. \"On the charge sheet... there was no mention of anything related to terrorism or anything related to what they were saying online,\" he said. \"They knew no evidence existed of any of the accusations they were making. And in the end, the deal was about face-saving. I was happy to go home. \"Of course, they get to say that Sami Hamdi ended up leaving America, the case gets closed, and it worked out for both of us.\""

Tremane Wood, 46, was condemned to die for stabbing a man to death during a botched robbery on New Year's Day 2002. Wood, who has always denied the killing, was set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester at 10am local time on Thursday (4pm UK time). But Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt accepted the recommendation of the Pardon and Parole Board that he be spared, commuting his sentence to life in prison without parole.

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have scrapped plans to break their manifesto pledge and raise income tax rates in a massive U-turn less than two weeks from the budget. The decision, first reported in the Financial Times, comes after a bruising few days which has brought about a change of heart in Downing Street. Read more: How No 10 plunged itself into crisis I understand Downing Street has backed down amid fears about the backlash from disgruntled MPs and voters. The Treasury and Number 10 declined to comment. The decision is a massive about-turn. In a news conference last week, the chancellor appeared to pave the way for manifesto-breaking tax rises in the budget on 26 November. She spoke of difficult choices and insisted she could neither increase borrowing nor cut spending in order to stabilise the economy, telling the public \"everyone has to play their part\".  The decision to backtrack was communicated to the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday in a submission of \"major measures\", according to the Financial Times. The chancellor will now have to fill an estimated £30bn black hole with a series of narrower tax-raising measures and is also expected to freeze income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"We've had the longest ever run-up to a budget, damaging the economy with uncertainty, and yet - with just days to go - it is clear there is chaos in No 10 and No 11.\" How did we get here? For weeks, the government has been working up options to break the manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT on working people. I was told only this week the option being worked up was to do a combination of tax rises and action on the two-child benefit cap in order for the prime minister to be able to argue that in breaking his manifesto pledges, he is trying his hardest to protect the poorest in society and those \"working people\" he has spoken of so endlessly.  But days ago, officials and ministers were working on a proposal to lift the basic rate of income tax - perhaps by 2p - and then simultaneously cut national insurance contributions for those on the basic rate of income tax (those who earn up to £50,000 a year). That way the chancellor can raise several billion in tax from those with the \"broadest shoulders\" - higher-rate taxpayers and pensioners or landlords, while also trying to protect \"working people\" earning salaries under £50,000 a year. The chancellor was also going to take action on the two-child benefit cap in response to growing demand from the party to take action on child poverty. It is unclear whether those plans will now be shelved given the U-turn on income tax. A rough week for the PM The change of plan comes after the prime minister found himself engulfed in a leadership crisis after his allies warned rivals that he would fight any attempted post-budget coup. It triggered a briefing war between Wes Streeting and anonymous Starmer allies attacking the health secretary as the chief traitor.  Read more: Is Starmer 'in office but not in power'? The prime minister has since apologised to Mr Streeting, who I am told does not want to press for sackings in No 10 in the wake of the briefings against him. But the saga has further damaged Sir Keir and increased concerns among MPs about his suitability to lead Labour into the next general election. Insiders clearly concluded that the ill mood in the party, coupled with the recent hits to the PM's political capital, makes manifesto-breaking tax rises simply too risky right now. But it also adds to a sense of chaos, given the chancellor publicly pitch-rolled tax rises in last week's news conference."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n The number of domestic UK flights has more than halved over the past 20 years, even as global air travel continues to grow. This month, another UK regional airline, Eastern Airways, officially went into administration as our appetite for flying internally continues its steady descent. A total of 213,025 UK flights were scheduled in 2025, compared to a peak in 2006 of 454,375 flights, research by aviation analytics firm Cirium, has found. In other words, a fall of more than 240,000 flights, or an average daily reduction of 661 flights across the UK. Perhaps surprisingly, cost isn't a major factor in customers choosing to ditch flying for the car, coach or train, as fares have stayed roughly flat. A pre-booked London to Edinburgh flight 20 years ago cost on average between £50 and £100 (once adjusted for inflation) compared with fares of around £40 - £70 today. So what's driving the trend? A combination of better and more frequent train services, higher Air Passenger Duty tax, concern about the environmental impact of flying, and changing work patterns - especially since the pandemic - have all played a part. Jeremy Bowen, Cirium CEO, said the results showed a \"staggering change in the way we travel throughout the UK\". \"Airlines have responded by reducing their internal services and prioritising more popular destinations including Spain, France, and Italy,\" he added. Twenty years ago, Britain's skies were busy with short domestic hops - British Airways (BA) and British Midland (bmi) shuttled passengers between London and the regions, and Flybe's purple planes connected cities like Exeter, Leeds, Norwich, and Southampton. Counting the cost The impact of changing demand has been brutal. Flybe, once Europe's largest regional airline, has collapsed twice; bmi and its low-cost arm, bmibaby, is long gone; and several UK hubs have closed their commercial operations over the past 20 years, including Doncaster Sheffield in 2022, Blackpool in 2014 and Plymouth in 2011. Also, airlines have shifted their priorities to making greater profits from short-haul services beyond the UK. Aviation consultant Gavin Eccles said key low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, \"have been ordering larger aircraft which means they can fly longer sectors\". \"They need to serve routes that are predominantly with strong ancillary options [baggage, seating] and domestic is more about commuting, so fewer chances to make extra revenues,\" he explained. Read more from Sky News:Epstein called Trump 'dangerous'How AI-generated music is fooling us Indeed, many surviving airports - like Southampton, Norwich, and Exeter - now rely mainly on seasonal leisure flights. Domestic flights tend to be limited to feeder flights to long-distance hubs like Heathrow, Amsterdam, and Dublin, plus so-called lifeline-style services to remote regions, mostly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Rail firms are benefitting, with passenger journeys rising from about 1.08 billion in 2005/06 to 1.73 billion in 2024/25 - an increase of around 60%, according to the Office of Rail and Road Data."

Sky News has learnt that Octopus Electric Vehicles (Octopus EV) has struck a deal with lenders including Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Agricole to take its total funding line to £2bn. The additional financing paves the way for the expansion of the company's UK fleet from 40,000 to 75,000 cars, and is an extension to a facility agreed with Lloyds in 2023. Sources said a public announcement would be made at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. Last month, EVs accounted for 26% of all new cars in the UK, a record figure, while across Europe, more than 1.7 million EVs were registered in September - a 19% jump from the same month last year.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n  The UK's economic slowdown gathered further momentum during the third quarter of the year with growth of just 0.1%, according to an early official estimate that makes horrific reading for the chancellor. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a surprise contraction for economic output during September of -0.1% - with some of the downwards pressure being applied by the cyber attack disruption to production at Jaguar Land Rover. The figures for July-September followed on the back of a 0.3% growth performance over the previous three months and the 0.7% expansion achieved between January and March. Money latest: The £110 benefit 1.1 million older Britons don't claim  The encouraging start to 2025 was soon followed by the worst of Donald Trump's trade war salvoes and the implementation of budget measures that placed employers on the hook for £25bn of extra taxes. Economists have blamed those factors since for pushing up inflation and harming investment and employment.  ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: \"Growth slowed further in the third quarter of the year with both services and construction weaker than in the previous period. There was also a further contraction in production. \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  'In office but not in power' - Is Norman Lamont's famous quote relevant today?\n                 \n                  Professional services chiefs join chorus of opposition to Reeves tax threat\n                 \"Across the quarter as a whole, manufacturing drove the weakness in production. There was a particularly marked fall in car production in September, reflecting the impact of a cyber incident, as well as a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry.  \"Services were the main contributor to growth in the latest quarter, with business rental and leasing, live events and retail performing well, partially offset by falls in R&D [research and development] and hair and beauty salons.\" When measured by per head of population- a preferred measure of living standards - zero growth was registered during the third quarter. The weaker-than-expected figures will add fuel to expectations that the Bank of England can cut interest rates at its December meeting after November's hold. The vast majority of financial market participants now expect a reduction to 3.75% from 4% on 18 December. Data earlier this week showed the UK's unemployment rate at 5% - up from 4.1% when Labour came to power with a number one priority of growing the economy. Since then, the government's handling of the economy has centred on its stewardship of the public finances.  The chancellor was accused by business groups of harming private sector investment and employment through hikes to minimum wage levels and employer national insurance contributions. The Bank has backed the assertion that hiring and staff retention has been hit as a result of those extra costs. There is also evidence that rising employment costs have been passed on to consumers and contributed to the UK's stubbornly high rate of inflation of 3.8% - a figure that is now expected to ease considerably in the coming months. Rachel Reeves has blamed other factors - such as Brexit and the US trade war - for weighing on the economy, leaving her facing a similar black hole to the one she says she inherited from the Conservatives. Her second budget is due on 26 November.

At the moment, pure battery-powered EVs are eligible for a 100% discount on the congestion charge, which was first introduced in 2003. The charges are paid to drive into central London between 7am and 6pm on weekdays, and between noon and 6pm on weekends and bank holidays. Mayor Sadiq Khan has insisted it is essential the scheme \"stays fit for purpose\", claiming the capital faces an increase of 2,200 extra vehicles in the zone on an average weekday next year. The EV discount will be cut further from 4 March 2030, to 12.5% for cars and 25% for vans and lorries. \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  Police pantomime and migrants shopping for life jackets: Inside the route to the Channel\n                 \n                  'Staggering' 20-year fall in domestic UK flights - as another form of transport benefits\n                 But Ginny Buckley, chief executive of EV advice website Electrifying.com, said: \"It's far too soon for TfL (Transport for London) to remove exemptions for electric vehicles from the London congestion charge.\" 'Move will backfire on air quality' Edmund King, the AA president, has urged Sir Sadiq to reconsider. He said: \"This is a backward step which sadly will backfire on air quality in London. \"Many drivers are not quite ready to make the switch to electric vehicles, so incentives are still needed to help them over the line. \"This policy sends a confusing signal. You can't champion clean air while penalising the vehicles that deliver it.\" EVs will account for nearly a fifth of all vehicles in the congestion charging zone by the end of this year, according to Transport for London (TfL).

TfL said this would \"undermine the benefits\" of the scheme by causing \"more queues and delays\". Sir Sadiq said: \"Keeping London moving by reducing congestion is vital for our city and for our economy. \"While the congestion charge has been a huge success since its introduction, we must ensure it stays fit for purpose.\" The decision to put up the charges comes ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget - when there are suggestions she could bring in a pay as you drive tax on EVs in the upcoming budget."

        "Content": "\n          Economics and data editor\n              @EdConwaySky\n  We'll get to the actual economics in a moment - to the questions of why the economy is flatlining and what it means for Rachel Reeves' forthcoming budget. But before that, let's take a moment to ponder something rather extraordinary. The hackers whose cyber attack took down production at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) a couple of months ago have single-handedly caused a fall in UK gross domestic product. Were it not for the 28.6% collapse in car production we saw in September (save for the pandemic, the biggest monthly drop in car output in modern record), the UK economy would have grown by 0.1% that month. Instead, it fell by 0.1%. Money latest: The £110 benefit 1.1 million older Britons don't claim Now, there are many provisos. These monthly numbers are volatile at the best of times. And the JLR hack wasn't the only thing going on with vehicle production in September. It so happens some van plants were also down that month.  Even so, even if you conservatively assume that only about half of the drop in output was due to the hack (which is a massively conservative assumption), the fact remains: hackers have caused a fall in official GDP figures, published only a few weeks ahead of the budget. It is very rare - unheard of nearly - for a single company to be able to impact overall GDP numbers.  That this episode has done precisely that says something - about the profundity of the problems the hack caused at JLR and its suppliers, about the concentration of Britain's car industry (there used to be plenty more producers) but also about the relatively precarious position of the wider economy right now. After all, the main reason this cyber attack was the difference between rising and falling GDP is that GDP was so close to zero even before taking this into account. And that says something deeper about where Britain's economy is right now.  Even when you ignore JLR and its travails, economic output is essentially flatlining. After a relatively strong start to the year, activity is depressed. And that has a bearing on all of our lives. For one thing, it means we are getting better off less quickly. Second, it has consequences for the public finances. The less extra money is being generated across the country (which, ultimately, is what GDP is measuring), the less tax revenue comes into the Exchequer and the bigger the deficit the Treasury faces. Part of the reason the chancellor is expected to raise taxes at the budget later this month is that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which produces the official government forecasts - is expected to cut its estimate for underlying economic growth, which, all else equal, raises the scale of the deficit.  Read more:Chancellor's own goals have exacerbated budget challengesStarmer hints two-child benefit cap to be axed in budgetWill Reeves repeat Denis Healey's 1975 horror budget? These are far from the only issues facing the chancellor. She has to reckon with an ever lengthening list of things to be tackled: she needs to pay for the U-turns already performed by this government on winter fuel and benefits reforms, to address long term worklessness, to try to protect the capital spending she committed to only last year, not to mention dealing with the consequences of a global trade war. I could go on, but you get the point. Achieving any of that with an economy growing at what was previously considered the \"trend\" rate of about 2.5% would have been hard enough. Achieving it with economic growth on a knife-edge is an extraordinarily challenging task - for any chancellor."

        "Content": "The announcement of plans to issue Scottish government bonds is a \"very proud day for Scotland\", First Minister John Swinney has said. The SNP leader confirmed bonds should be issued in 2026-27 in a bid to attract investment for \"key infrastructure\" projects - though this is subject to the outcome of May's Scottish parliament election as well as other factors. It comes after two global credit rating agencies awarded Scotland the same ranking as the UK. Moody's rated the Scottish government as Aa3, while S&P Global rated it as AA, both identical to the UK's sovereign rating and higher than countries such as Spain, Italy and Japan. Mr Swinney said: \"This is a very proud day for Scotland, because we've achieved the best possible credit ratings we could within the United Kingdom from two of the world's leading credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard and Poor's. \"That's a reflection of the economic strength of Scotland, the strength of our financial management, and the strength of the financial institutions within Scotland, and it gives us a really strong foundation for the issuing of a bond up to a value of £1.5bn in the next parliamentary term, over a number of years, which can underpin investment in the capital programme of Scotland.\" The bond issuance - which would allow investors to buy Scottish government debt - would provide \"another option\" for the nation to attract investment, Mr Swinney said. \n                  First Minister John Swinney 'open' to national inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland\n                 \n                  Scottish government yet to pay up after losing legal battle over definition of a woman\n                 \n                  Claire Inglis: Call for 'damning' report into mother's murder to be fully released\n                 While he said housing and the drive to net zero could benefit from the bonds, he would not go further on specific programmes which would be financed. Mr Swinney added: \"The government will set out in the investment programme in January exactly the projects that we're taking forward over the course of the next few years. \"But obviously we need to have the funds to underpin that programme and what the announcement overnight from the credit rating agencies demonstrates is that Scotland has every potential to attract investment on international financial markets and that we can use those resources to support our capital programme.\" The Moody's report, however, included independence as a possible factor that could see the nation's credit rating downgraded. The report said: \"Although not our baseline scenario, Scottish independence could exert downward pressure on the rating by introducing heightened uncertainty about the institutional framework and potentially raising financial stability risks.\" Mr Swinney said \"specific issuance plans will be subject to market conditions closer to the time\". He added the Scottish government would \"shortly commence engagement with banks to act as joint lead managers to enable the next Scottish government to proceed without delay\" on the proposed Scottish bond scheme, which has been nicknamed \"kilts\" in a play on the UK equivalent of gilts.

That came after advisers in the Scottish government's investor panel recommended making bonds available to the market as a means of raising Scotland's profile and attracting investment. Angus Macpherson, chairman of financial advisory firm Noble & Co and former co-chair of the investor panel, said he was \"greatly encouraged by the progress the Scottish government is making in achieving a credit rating to raise Scotland's profile in the international capital markets\". He added: \"This is a positive step forward and demonstrates they are serious about becoming a more investor friendly destination.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have scrapped plans to break their manifesto pledge and raise income tax rates in a massive U-turn less than two weeks from the budget. The decision, first reported in the Financial Times, comes after a bruising few days which has brought about a change of heart in Downing Street. Read more: How No 10 plunged itself into crisis I understand Downing Street has backed down amid fears about the backlash from disgruntled MPs and voters. The Treasury and Number 10 declined to comment. The decision is a massive about-turn. In a news conference last week, the chancellor appeared to pave the way for manifesto-breaking tax rises in the budget on 26 November. She spoke of difficult choices and insisted she could neither increase borrowing nor cut spending in order to stabilise the economy, telling the public \"everyone has to play their part\".  The decision to backtrack was communicated to the Office for Budget Responsibility on Wednesday in a submission of \"major measures\", according to the Financial Times. The chancellor will now have to fill an estimated £30bn black hole with a series of narrower tax-raising measures and is also expected to freeze income tax thresholds for another two years beyond 2028, which should raise about £8bn. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"We've had the longest ever run-up to a budget, damaging the economy with uncertainty, and yet - with just days to go - it is clear there is chaos in No 10 and No 11.\" How did we get here? For weeks, the government has been working up options to break the manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT on working people. I was told only this week the option being worked up was to do a combination of tax rises and action on the two-child benefit cap in order for the prime minister to be able to argue that in breaking his manifesto pledges, he is trying his hardest to protect the poorest in society and those \"working people\" he has spoken of so endlessly.  But days ago, officials and ministers were working on a proposal to lift the basic rate of income tax - perhaps by 2p - and then simultaneously cut national insurance contributions for those on the basic rate of income tax (those who earn up to £50,000 a year). That way the chancellor can raise several billion in tax from those with the \"broadest shoulders\" - higher-rate taxpayers and pensioners or landlords, while also trying to protect \"working people\" earning salaries under £50,000 a year. The chancellor was also going to take action on the two-child benefit cap in response to growing demand from the party to take action on child poverty. It is unclear whether those plans will now be shelved given the U-turn on income tax. A rough week for the PM The change of plan comes after the prime minister found himself engulfed in a leadership crisis after his allies warned rivals that he would fight any attempted post-budget coup. It triggered a briefing war between Wes Streeting and anonymous Starmer allies attacking the health secretary as the chief traitor.  Read more: Is Starmer 'in office but not in power'? The prime minister has since apologised to Mr Streeting, who I am told does not want to press for sackings in No 10 in the wake of the briefings against him. But the saga has further damaged Sir Keir and increased concerns among MPs about his suitability to lead Labour into the next general election. Insiders clearly concluded that the ill mood in the party, coupled with the recent hits to the PM's political capital, makes manifesto-breaking tax rises simply too risky right now. But it also adds to a sense of chaos, given the chancellor publicly pitch-rolled tax rises in last week's news conference."

Mr Streeting has strongly denied the claim, and accused Number 10 of having a \"toxic\" culture and of attempting to \"kneecap\" him. Sir Keir also disavowed the briefings, saying he \"never authorised\" the attack on his health secretary, and said cabinet ministers should not be briefed against.

I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members. I appointed them to that post because they're the best people to carry out that job.\" He also said: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country.\" The prime minister and his health secretary spoke \"very briefly\" later that evening, in which he apologised.  On Thursday, Sir Keir said that he had been \"assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10\", and it appears that no formal investigation into who spoke to journalists on Tuesday is under way. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused Sir Keir of having \"lost control of Number 10\" and said two weeks from the 26 November budget, \"the government has descended into civil war\"."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n A taunt famously used by a friend-turned-foe against John Major is now being deployed by senior Tories against Sir Keir Starmer. \"A prime minister and chancellor who are in office but not in power,\" declared shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride, reacting to the latest economic figures. \"The PM has shown he is in office but not in power,\" the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in response to the Labour civil war and plotting allegations. But the phrase \"in office but not in power\" is not new. It has been part of political folklore since it was first used by former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont in 1993. Politics latest: Police and crime commissioners to be abolished And it's suddenly back in fashion, being used once again by top Tories. And Sir Keir's opponents clearly believe it's just as relevant today. Lamont used it in a blockbuster resignation speech in the Commons after he was sacked by Major, whose Tory leadership campaign he had run less than three years earlier. \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  Professional services chiefs join chorus of opposition to Reeves tax threat\n                 \n                  Economy grew by 0.1% in third quarter, official figures show\n                 \"We give the impression of being in office but not in power,\" he said in a blistering critique of the Major government from the back benches during a debate on the economy. After middle-ranking government jobs under Margaret Thatcher, Lamont was rewarded with the Treasury for masterminding Major's leadership election victory, but endured a torrid time as chancellor. He was humiliated when the pound crashed out of the EU's exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992 and forced to raise taxes in his March 1993 budget. When he admitted defeat in the ERM debacle on 16 September 1992, the TV pictures showed him flanked by two little known figures back then who later rose to high office. On one side was Gus O'Donnell, Treasury and then No. 10 press secretary and later cabinet secretary, and on the other was a callow youth who was Lamont's special adviser, David Cameron. Nine months later, after being sacked in May 1993 and turning down demotion to Environment Secretary, Lamont's resignation speech was bitter and vitriolic. In his memoirs, called simply In Office, he claimed he had previously said the identical words privately to Michael Heseltine on the steps of No. 10. But many of his criticisms of the Major government of the 1990s in that famous speech are remarkably like those being levelled at Sir Keir Starmer's government today. \"There is something wrong with the way in which we make our decisions,\" he said, leading up to his famous quote. \"The government listen too much to the pollsters and the party managers. The trouble is they are not even very good at politics and they are entering too much into policy decisions. \"As a result, there is too much short-termism, too much reacting to events and not enough shaping of events.\" Then, after the \"in office but not in power\" line, he continued: \"Far too many decisions are made for 36 hours' publicity. \"I believe that in politics one should decide what is right and then decide the presentation, not the other way round. \"Unless this approach is changed, the government will not survive and will not deserve to survive.\" Bad decision-making? Obsessed by opinion polls? Not good at politics? Reacting to events? Chasing headlines? Sir Keir's critics would claim it all sounds depressingly familiar. In fact, Major's government survived for another four years, though he faced a leadership challenge in 1995 and the Tories were defeated in a Labour landslide in 1997. A sacked chancellor, a leadership challenge, an election defeat. Surely history couldn't repeat itself? Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir beware."

It follows a review of the loan charge, which was introduced in 2017 to recover backdated income tax from contract and agency workers who were paid their salaries in \"loans\", usually by third party umbrella companies. Politics Live: Starmer urged to sack Number 10 aide behind leadership briefing Loans are not subject to income tax. But these loans were not expected to be paid back, so HMRC sees it as a form of tax avoidance. However, the crackdown has alarmed MPs across the political spectrum as it has been linked to 10 suicides and driven people to bankruptcy. Sky News understands the former HMRC official who lead the review has suggested a new settlement mechanism based on income and profession, where the least well off would be offered the most respite. Campaigners argue that the 50,000 or so affected are victims of mis-selling, as the loan schemes were promoted as legitimate by professional accountants who made commission getting clients into these arrangements. \n                  Budget 2025: Starmer and Reeves ditch plans to raise income tax\n                 \n                  Politics latest: Top Starmer aide will not leave No 10 - despite calls for him to be sacked\n                 \n                  Top Starmer aide will not leave No 10 - despite calls for him to be sacked\n                 HMRC has been accused of failing to warn people off these schemes at the time, with the loan charge designed to let it go back 10 years and demand multiple years of unpaid tax in one go and with interest, resulting in huge bills. The review, led by former HMRC inspector Ray McCann, focused on barriers to settling tax liabilities, with some 40,000 people yet to reach a resolution. Greg Smith, the Conservative chair of the loan charge All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Sky News there needed to be a fair deal for all \"and not just those Labour finds politically convenient\". How did the schemes work? A large proportion of those affected by the loan schemes were working in IT, finance and other contract-based industries. However, umbrella companies supplying public sector agency workers used these schemes too - and it is this group who are expected to be offered the most help. While no final decision has been made, campaigners point to a meeting in the spring with Mr McCann and the loan charge APPG, where he is said to have described a plan to recommend settlements based on categories.  The categories suggested included income type, different professions, and how and why people got into the schemes, according to a letter from the APPG to Mr McCann which recounts the meeting. The letter says Mr McCann acknowledged his plan was \"probably a wee bit unfair\". It adds: \"You said that you believe that people on the lower end of the income scale are \"less sophisticated\" and less likely to have access to tax advice. \"Whilst the latter may be the case for many, the reality is that the mis-selling happened to people across the income scale.\" One campaigner said the meeting points to a wider \"subtle narrative about the deserving and undeserving\" and they believe that politically, the government is gearing up \"to let off nurses and social workers\" while claiming the rest largely knew what they were doing. Mr Smith said such a plan would be \"morally reprehensible\" if it went ahead. He told Sky News: \"There is significant talk of the government looking at only subsets of loan charge victims to offer respite too. \"Whilst potentially good for those set for reprieve, it would be morally reprehensible not to apply equity across all victims, recognising the huge impact this has had on so many lives and families. \"We need proper and fair settlement for all victims, not just those Labour see as politically convenient.\" A government spokesperson said they would set out their position by the time of Rachel Reeves' budget later this month - when she is widely expected to raise income tax to repair a hole in the public finances. Ministers have previously hinted at some sort of compromise, saying they want to help people who can't resolve their debts while \"ensuring fairness for all taxpayers\". HMRC says the schemes, which they call disguised remuneration, allowed people to avoid paying £20k of income tax per year on average and that they were never allowed. MPs and campaigners have previously branded the review a \"sham\", as it did not look into the principle of retrospective tax legislation, HMRC's conduct or the schemes' promoters - only ways to make people pay. Steve Packham, a spokesman for the Loan Charge Action Group, said: \"The concern is that the McCann Review will focus only on helping lower-income public sector workers, when this would be discriminatory and manifestly unfair. \"People in all sorts of roles and professions are clear victims of the same industrial mis-selling by chartered accountants, tax advisers, recruitment agencies and scheme promoters, all of whom made huge sums recommending these arrangements.\" If you've been affected by this story and want to talk to someone, you can call the Samaritans free on 116 123 or at jo@samaritans.org"

        "Content": "A&E departments and ambulance crews faced their busiest October on record - and now the NHS is braced for \"one of the toughest winters the health service has faced\". New figures from NHS England revealed up to 40% of those attending A&E are already waiting longer than four hours, with the number surging from 129,004 patients in September to 142,734 in October. Of those admitted to hospital after attending an accident or emergency department, one in 10 are having to wait 12 hours or longer for a bed - 54,314 in October, up from 44,765 in September.  Waits for cancer treatment are also rising, the figures revealed. In September, 73.9% of patients who suspected they had cancer had the disease either diagnosed or ruled out within 28 days, down from 74.6% in August, and below the target of 75%. In the same period, the proportion of patients who had waited no longer than 62 days for their first definitive cancer treatment fell from 69.1% to 67.9%. Meanwhile, the latest figures show that A&E attendances were 37,000 higher than October 2024, at 2.36 million.

Overall, an estimated 7.39 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of September, relating to 6.24 million patients, down from 7.41 million treatments and 6.25 million patients at the end of August. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the slight decline on the number waiting for treatment was evidence the NHS was \"now on the road to recovery\". But Meghana Pandit, NHS national medical director, warned that services would be pushed to capacity this winter. She said: \"It is fantastic news that the health service managed to get the waiting list down in September, but there's no doubt NHS staff will be approaching their limits this winter. \"Flu is peaking early and looking like it will be long lasting, while industrial action starting on Friday comes on the back of the busiest October in A&E in NHS history.\" To ease the pressure, she urged the public to get flu, COVID, and RSV jabs, to use the NHS 111 helpline for non-urgent help, and to only call 999 or attend A&E for life-threatening emergencies. Tim Gardner, assistant director of policy at the Health Foundation, painted a similarly ominous picture. He said: \"The figures present a challenging outlook for the NHS, particularly as it heads into what NHS leaders have warned is likely to be one of the toughest winters the health service has faced.\" It came as, at the end of September, an estimated 1,489 patients were waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment, up from 1,418 in August. But health chiefs noted that the number stood at 2,701 a year earlier, in September 2024. There was also a drop in the number of people waiting more than a year to start routine hospital treatment, from 190,549 at the end of August to 180,329 a month later. The number now represents 2.4% of the total, down from 2.6% a month before - with a goal to get it below 1% by March next year. 👉 Tap here to follow Politics at Sam and Anne’s wherever you get your podcasts 👈 14.4 million flu vaccines have also been delivered so far this autumn - some 160,000 more than at the same point last year. Mr Streeting said: \"The past year is the first time in 15 years that waiting lists have fallen. \"There's a long way to go, but the NHS is now on the road to recovery,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n A woman claiming to be a victim of an alleged Pakistani grooming gang has urged Scotland's first minister to launch a national inquiry. Taylor, which is not her real name, has written to John Swinney with claims of how she was preyed on by at least 10 men when she was 13 years old and in care. Mr Swinney said the government was \"open\" to launching an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland. The woman, who is now in her 20s, says she and her friends were sexually abused and exploited after being plied with alcohol and drugs. The alleged gang was said to have operated from flats in the Govanhill area of Glasgow and Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire. In her letter, Taylor says it is \"clear\" such abuse is still ongoing in Scotland as she called for a rapid audit into grooming gangs across the country. She added: \"A full inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland must follow any audit in order to protect children suffering now, and any potential victims in the future.\" \n                  'Human error' may have led to grooming gangs investigations being dropped, review says\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage 'unhappy' with MP over 'clumsy' comments - but says they are not 'racist'\n                 \n                  Harriet Harman: Jess Phillips can repair relations with grooming gang survivors so inquiry can go ahead\n                 Taylor's plea comes following several high-profile cases, including the \"beastie house\" paedophile ring in Glasgow and the recently sentenced Romanian grooming gang in Dundee. A national inquiry into grooming gangs will take place in England and Wales but one has not been set up in Scotland. The Scottish Conservatives attempted to add an amendment to the Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill in September which would have seen an inquiry, but it was rejected. Taylor's plight was highlighted during First Minister's Questions by Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay. Mr Swinney acknowledged receipt of the letter and shared his \"admiration for her courage to speak out on such an important and very difficult subject\". The first minister added: \"I am deeply saddened to hear of any cases of sexual abuse.\" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government is taking action through the work of the National Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Strategic Group. He added: \"The government has remained open to the question of a grooming gangs inquiry, but there is a series of steps being taken to explore these issues at the present moment.\" Read more from Sky News:Why are abuse survivors losing faith in grooming gang inquiry?Grooming probes potentially dropped due to 'human error' Mr Findlay raised concerns from Taylor that Police Scotland allegedly failed to investigate her complaints. She said she contacted the first minister and the force directly after finding \"upsetting information\" within her care records. Taylor said she had initially believed the care home, police and social services \"knew nothing\" about the alleged abuse she suffered, but her records \"say different\". She said she had chosen to \"make sure my voice is heard\" after receiving \"dismissive replies\" from Mr Swinney and Police Scotland. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"A complaint about the police was received in September 2025. \"The complainer was spoken to and we confirmed information had been passed to us, but since no report was made to police in reference to any crime, this complaint did not fit the criteria as a complaint about the police. \"The complainer was advised she should make a report to police if she had been a victim of a crime. The complainer confirmed she was happy to have the complaint closed with this advice.\" Highlighting the force's response to Taylor's complaint, Mr Swinney reiterated that his government remains open to the question of a grooming gangs inquiry. He added: \"But what I am satisfied about is that the police will address these issues and that our judicial system will address them too, and we will reflect on whether there is any further scrutiny that is required in the light of those investigations.\" In a statement after, Mr Findlay said the first minister \"must not bury his head in the sand\". The MSP for West Scotland added: \"Taylor and other victims say there must be a grooming gangs inquiry in Scotland to uncover the scale of the abuse, why it was allowed to go unchecked and to ensure that it cannot continue. \"Victims do not trust that what happened to them will be fully investigated by organisations they believe turned a blind eye or even engaged in covering up what happened. \"The authorities' actions should be independently examined to establish what exactly has happened.\""

The SNP leader confirmed bonds should be issued in 2026-27 in a bid to attract investment for \"key infrastructure\" projects - though this is subject to the outcome of May's Scottish parliament election as well as other factors. It comes after two global credit rating agencies awarded Scotland the same ranking as the UK. Moody's rated the Scottish government as Aa3, while S&P Global rated it as AA, both identical to the UK's sovereign rating and higher than countries such as Spain, Italy and Japan. Mr Swinney said: \"This is a very proud day for Scotland, because we've achieved the best possible credit ratings we could within the United Kingdom from two of the world's leading credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard and Poor's. \"That's a reflection of the economic strength of Scotland, the strength of our financial management, and the strength of the financial institutions within Scotland, and it gives us a really strong foundation for the issuing of a bond up to a value of £1.5bn in the next parliamentary term, over a number of years, which can underpin investment in the capital programme of Scotland.\" The bond issuance - which would allow investors to buy Scottish government debt - would provide \"another option\" for the nation to attract investment, Mr Swinney said. \n                  First Minister John Swinney 'open' to national inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland\n                 \n                  Scottish government yet to pay up after losing legal battle over definition of a woman\n                 \n                  Claire Inglis: Call for 'damning' report into mother's murder to be fully released\n                 While he said housing and the drive to net zero could benefit from the bonds, he would not go further on specific programmes which would be financed. Mr Swinney added: \"The government will set out in the investment programme in January exactly the projects that we're taking forward over the course of the next few years. \"But obviously we need to have the funds to underpin that programme and what the announcement overnight from the credit rating agencies demonstrates is that Scotland has every potential to attract investment on international financial markets and that we can use those resources to support our capital programme.\" The Moody's report, however, included independence as a possible factor that could see the nation's credit rating downgraded. The report said: \"Although not our baseline scenario, Scottish independence could exert downward pressure on the rating by introducing heightened uncertainty about the institutional framework and potentially raising financial stability risks.\" Mr Swinney said \"specific issuance plans will be subject to market conditions closer to the time\". He added the Scottish government would \"shortly commence engagement with banks to act as joint lead managers to enable the next Scottish government to proceed without delay\" on the proposed Scottish bond scheme, which has been nicknamed \"kilts\" in a play on the UK equivalent of gilts.

That came after advisers in the Scottish government's investor panel recommended making bonds available to the market as a means of raising Scotland's profile and attracting investment. Angus Macpherson, chairman of financial advisory firm Noble & Co and former co-chair of the investor panel, said he was \"greatly encouraged by the progress the Scottish government is making in achieving a credit rating to raise Scotland's profile in the international capital markets\".

Crowds cheered at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as they watched liftoff, which had been stalled for four days by bad weather, and then on Thursday suffered two further delays. Blue Origin latest: Successful launch after last-minute delay On board were two identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, which are now heading to the Red Planet and due to arrive in 2027. But the firm's big success was the recovery of the rocket's reusable first-stage booster, a critical development in the space race with SpaceX. Mr Musk posted his congratulations on X.

The company had never managed the feat before with a rocket so large. The recovery of the booster is an essential step to recycle and slash costs. The feat has already been achieved with such large rockets by SpaceX. Blue Origin had achieved this with its much smaller models, but if it wants to consistently run science-scale missions for NASA this is an important step. The rocket, named after American astronaut John Glenn, weighs roughly the same as 20 trucks. It can put into space a payload of 45 metric tonnes. At 98m tall and 7m wide, it is larger than most rockets, but not as big as SpaceX's Starship nor the Saturn Vs which sent humans to the moon. Science correspondent There's a new space race. And this one is for billionaires. The rocket company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has launched its first two space probes, both of them heading to Mars. It means the world's second-richest man is going head-to-head with the wannabe trillionaire Elon Musk. Jeff Bezos is a long way behind Musk's SpaceX. So far, his Blue Origin company has been focused on space tourism with the smaller New Shepard rocket.  Remember Katy Perry singing What A Wonderful World in space? That was on Bezos's rocket. But Blue Origin's second-ever launch of the much bigger New Glenn rocket, with the bragging rights of carrying two NASA spacecraft, means the competition between the two tech bros just got combustible.

        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n  Do you care if the music you're listening to is artificially generated? That question - once the realm of science fiction - is becoming increasingly urgent. An AI-generated country track, Walk My Walk, is currently sitting at number one on the US Billboard chart of digital sales and a new report by streaming platform Deezer has revealed the sheer scale of AI production in the music industry. Deezer's AI-detection system found that around 50,000 fully AI-generated tracks are now uploaded every day, accounting for 34% of all daily uploads. The true number is most likely higher, as Deezer's AI-detection system does not catch every AI-generated track. Nor does this figure include partially AI-generated tracks. In January 2025, Deezer's system identified 10% of uploaded tracks as fully AI-generated. Since then, the proportion of AI tracks - made using written prompts such as \"country, 1990s style, male singer\" - has more than tripled, leading the platform's chief executive, Alexis Lanternier, to say that AI music is \"flooding music streaming\". \n                  New law could help tackle AI-generated child abuse at source, says watchdog\n                 \n                  Ex-Starmer adviser's start-ups backer nears £1bn valuation\n                 \n                  Nvidia boss defends AI against claims of bubble by 'Big Short' investor\n                 'Siphoning money from royalty pool' What's more, when Deezer surveyed 9,000 people in eight countries - the US, Canada, Brazil, UK, France, Netherlands, Germany and Japan - and asked them to detect whether three tracks were real or AI, 97% could not tell the difference. That's despite the fact that the motivation behind the surge of AI music is not in the least bit creative, according to Deezer. The company says that roughly 70% of fully AI-generated tracks are what it calls \"fraudulent\" - that is, designed purely to make money. \"The common denominator is the ambition to boost streams on specific tracks in order to siphon money from the royalty pool,\" a Deezer spokesperson told Sky News. \"With AI-generated content, you can easily create massive amounts of tracks that can be used for this purpose.\" The tracks themselves are not actually fraudulent, Deezer says, but the behaviour around them is. Someone will upload an AI track then use an automated system - a bot - to listen to a song over and over again to make royalties from it. Even though the total number of streams for each individual track is very low - Deezer estimates that together they account for 0.5% of all streams - the work needed to make an AI track is so tiny that the rewards justify the effort. Are fully-AI tracks being removed? Deezer is investing in AI-detection software and has filed two patents for systems that spot AI music. But it is not taking down the tracks it marks as fully-AI. Instead it removes them from algorithmic recommendations and editorial playlists, a measure designed to stop the tracks getting streams and therefore generating royalties, and marks the tracks as \"AI-generated content\". \"If people want to listen to an AI-generated track however, they can and we are not stopping them from doing so - we just want to make sure they are making a conscious decision,\" the Deezer spokesperson says.

A recent study commissioned by the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers suggested that generative AI music could be worth £146bn a year in 2028 and account for around 60% of music libraries' revenues. By this metric, the authors concluded, 25% of creators' revenues are at risk by 2028, a sum of £3.5bn."

        "Content": "Surging childhood obesity has driven rates of high blood pressure in kids to almost double since 2000, an analysis suggests. That's the \"deeply concerning\" conclusion of a new study, which found more than one in 20 children under the age of 19 (6.2%) had high blood pressure in 2020. In 2000 the figure was 3.2%, according to the paper published in the journal Lancet Child and Adolescent Health. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, now affects 114 million children around the world, the international team of researchers found. The authors, including academics from the University of Edinburgh and Zhejiang University in China, examined data on 443,000 children from 21 countries. Obesity was found to be a \"substantial driver\" of the problem. They found nearly 19% of children and adolescents with obesity have high blood pressure, compared with 3% among those with a healthy weight  The latest figures for England suggest one in 10 (10.5%) children in the first year of primary school is obese. By the final year of primary school, 22.2% of children are obese, according to data from the National Child Measurement Programme. Co-author Dr Peige Song of Zhejiang University attributed higher rates of high blood pressure to \"unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, and the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity\". She said: \"The analysis showed that children and adolescents with obesity are nearly eight times more likely to develop hypertension. \"Parents play a pivotal role in preventing and managing high blood pressure in children. \"Promoting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while minimising salt and sugar intake, can substantially reduce the risk of hypertension.\" Read more:Hundreds of pregnancy drug victims call for inquiryParkinson's patient plays clarinet during brain surgery Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, called on the government to act. He said: \"The doubling in childhood high blood pressure rates is deeply concerning. \"Elevated blood pressure in childhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke later in life. \"While genetics and kidney disease play a role, the sharp rise in childhood hypertension is most likely driven by the growing prevalence of childhood obesity. \"The good news is that obesity-related high blood pressure can be reversed. \"We need bold government action to help prevent obesity in the first place. \"This includes expanding restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy products and exploring further measures to drive the food industry to make our everyday foods healthier.\""

The corporation said it was an \"error of judgement\" and the programme will \"not be broadcast again in this form on any BBC platforms\". But it added that it \"strongly\" disagrees that there is \"a basis for a defamation claim\". The White House has not offered comment, but instead told Sky News to direct questions to \"the president's outside counsel on this matter\". Sky News is awaiting a response from the President's counsel. BBC Trump row latest: BBC apology may be better for Trump than a lawsuit Donald Trump's legal team earlier revealed that the US president has not yet filed a lawsuit against the BBC over thebroadcaster's editing of a speech he made in 2021 on the day his supporters overran the Capitol building. Legal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the UK or the US. \n                  Reform pulls out of BBC documentary amid Trump legal threat\n                 \n                  Trump has 'obligation' to sue 'very dishonest' BBC\n                 \n                  BBC staff seemed fed up of Tim Davie's 'nothing to see' approach\n                 Deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000 ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch. Despite this, Mr Trump's legal team sent a letter over the weekend threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn and issuing three demands: • Issue a \"full and fair retraction\" of the Panorama programme• Apologise immediately• \"Appropriately compensate\" the US president On Sunday evening, two of the BBC's top figures, including the director-general, resigned amid the row over the edit and concerns about impartiality. Arts and entertainment correspondent With the deadline fast approaching for Donald Trump's billion-dollar legal threat, all eyes were on the BBC to see how it would respond. The corporation's failure to act swiftly and decisively in the face of negative headlines is arguably what brought it to this point of crisis in the first place. An apology to Mr Trump was the right thing to do. Few within journalism would defend the edit Panorama aired. But it was equally important for the corporation to use this moment to stand by its journalists — and it has done so. Many legal experts have agreed with what the BBC implies in its statement, that it's questionable that Trump has any grounds for a defamation claim. Will a personal letter from the BBC chair be enough to silence a president who's successfully taken on other media outlets he feels wronged by? For an organisation long paralysed by fear and internal division, this is a pivotal moment. The BBC must be seen to act — and to act decisively — or risk losing the reputation it has spent decades building. Fresh allegations reported by The Telegraph tonight only deepen the sense of turmoil, suggesting that the corporation's editorial oversight has faltered at a time when clarity and leadership are most needed.\n  In a statement, the corporation said: \"Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday. \"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" On Thursday, the BBC said it was looking into fresh allegations, published in The Telegraph newspaper. The Telegraph claims another BBC programme, Newsnight, also selectively edited footage of the same speech, in a report broadcast in June 2022, two years before Panorama's edit. A BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.\" Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, on Thursday said the party had written to Sir Keir Starmer, calling on him to demand that Mr Trump \"drop his ludicrous one billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC\"."

        "Headline": "The proportion of AI tracks - made using written prompts - has more than tripled this year, says streaming platform Deezer.",
        "Content": "\n          Technology correspondent\n              @rowlsmanthorpe\n  Do you care if the music you're listening to is artificially generated? That question - once the realm of science fiction - is becoming increasingly urgent. An AI-generated country track, Walk My Walk, is currently sitting at number one on the US Billboard chart of digital sales and a new report by streaming platform Deezer has revealed the sheer scale of AI production in the music industry. Deezer's AI-detection system found that around 50,000 fully AI-generated tracks are now uploaded every day, accounting for 34% of all daily uploads. The true number is most likely higher, as Deezer's AI-detection system does not catch every AI-generated track. Nor does this figure include partially AI-generated tracks. In January 2025, Deezer's system identified 10% of uploaded tracks as fully AI-generated. Since then, the proportion of AI tracks - made using written prompts such as \"country, 1990s style, male singer\" - has more than tripled, leading the platform's chief executive, Alexis Lanternier, to say that AI music is \"flooding music streaming\". \n                  New law could help tackle AI-generated child abuse at source, says watchdog\n                 \n                  Ex-Starmer adviser's start-ups backer nears £1bn valuation\n                 \n                  Nvidia boss defends AI against claims of bubble by 'Big Short' investor\n                 'Siphoning money from royalty pool' What's more, when Deezer surveyed 9,000 people in eight countries - the US, Canada, Brazil, UK, France, Netherlands, Germany and Japan - and asked them to detect whether three tracks were real or AI, 97% could not tell the difference. That's despite the fact that the motivation behind the surge of AI music is not in the least bit creative, according to Deezer. The company says that roughly 70% of fully AI-generated tracks are what it calls \"fraudulent\" - that is, designed purely to make money. \"The common denominator is the ambition to boost streams on specific tracks in order to siphon money from the royalty pool,\" a Deezer spokesperson told Sky News. \"With AI-generated content, you can easily create massive amounts of tracks that can be used for this purpose.\" The tracks themselves are not actually fraudulent, Deezer says, but the behaviour around them is. Someone will upload an AI track then use an automated system - a bot - to listen to a song over and over again to make royalties from it. Even though the total number of streams for each individual track is very low - Deezer estimates that together they account for 0.5% of all streams - the work needed to make an AI track is so tiny that the rewards justify the effort. Are fully-AI tracks being removed? Deezer is investing in AI-detection software and has filed two patents for systems that spot AI music. But it is not taking down the tracks it marks as fully-AI.

An American pop culture institution, SNL launched the careers of stars including Bill Murray, Tina Fey, Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell - and now a \"new generation\" of British comedians is set to be cast in the first UK spin-off on Sky. While the show's stars are yet to be revealed, details of the creative team behind it have now been announced. Two-time Emmy winner James Longman will serve as lead producer, BAFTA winner and live broadcast specialist Liz Clare will direct the series, while writer, comedian and composer Daran Jonno Johnson takes on the role of head writer. Longman's credits include The Late Late Show With James Corden, for which he produced famous sketches with stars and notable figures including Sir Paul McCartney, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise and then president Joe Biden. He also worked on the Friends reunion special in 2021 and hit UK shows such as Never Mind The Buzzcocks, Alan Carr: Chatty Man, The F Word and The Friday Night Project. Clare's directing credits include An Audience With Adele, The Brits and MTV awards ceremonies, Glastonbury, the BAFTAs and shows such as The Voice UK and Britain's Got Talent, while Johnson, who is part of the acclaimed sketch group SHEEPS, has written for shows including Wedding Season for Disney+, Siblings for the BBC and Rose d'Or winner Parlement for France.TV. Saturday Night Live UK marks the first time the US producers have adapted the show, which celebrated 50 years on air earlier this year, for a British audience. Channel 4 ran several series of a similar programme on Saturday and Friday nights in the 1980s, featuring comedians like Ben Elton and Harry Enfield, but it was domestically produced. 'A lot of big US comedy is stolen from the UK' Comedian Pete Davidson, another SNL star, told Sky News he's excited about the UK version - and that it is about time the UK is able to take from US comedy, rather than the other way round. Speaking in the summer during promotion for The Pickup, Davidson said: \"I think it's a smart idea to have SNL over there because... not that it's a different brand of comedy, but it is a little bit. \"A lot of the biggest stuff that's in the States is stuff that we stole from you guys, like The Office or literally anything Ricky Gervais does... there's just tonnes of great comedy over there. Jimmy Carr is a great stand-up.\" Also highlighting Jack Whitehall, he continued: \"I think anything that's great over there, we just kind of steal... and it doesn't seem like the other way around. This is the first time I've ever heard anything American going to the UK, so I think it's great.\" Read more from Sky News entertainment:Dua Lipa backs ticket resale capSam Fender donates Mercury Prize cash Producers say the UK series will follow the same format as the original, featuring \"a new generation of comedy players in the core cast, alongside guest hosts and musical performances\".

Along with his production company Broadway Video, which has made The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and 30 Rock, the show will be led by UK production team Universal Television Alternative Studio.

        "Content": "By Felix Pope, news reporter  Since he served in the First World War and was mocked by his fellow soldiers, rumours have circulated about Adolf Hitler's sexual abnormalities.  Now, fresh research conducted by an international team of scientists and historians is said to finally shed light on what exactly was wrong with the Nazi leader. After analysing a strand of his DNA, they say there is a high likelihood he suffered from some form of Kallman Syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty. Contrary to another myth, however, they also found that the German dictator had no Jewish ancestry. The findings include the discovery that a gene named PROK2, which is related to the development of sexual organs, was depleted for Hitler. Its absence is associated with lower-than-normal testosterone levels and can result in a micropenis, which is typically just a few centimetres long. Professor Turi King, who is the lead geneticist on the research and previously identified the remains of King Richard III, told Sky News: \"If you'd told me a few years ago I'd be talking about Hitler's genitals, I would never would have believed it.\" \n                  Monument honours millions who did not fight in WWII - but whose roles were vital to war effort\n                 \n                  Appeal for 100th birthday cards for Second World War veteran Dougie Shelley\n                 \n                  Queen appears emotional following 'off script' comments by veteran about King at VJ event\n                 She said she \"agonised\" over the decision of whether to examine his DNA but decided to because thousands of other archaeological remains had been subjected to the same process. \"Why should Hitler be any different?\" she asked herself. \"Why should we not do him? That would be to put him on a pedestal.\" The team's findings, Professor King said, would add \"another layer of information\" to our understanding of one of the most studied men in history. It also offers insight into the central theme of the famous wartime song Hitler Has Only Got One Ball, which was popular among Britons as part of efforts to malign the German leadership. The DNA studied came originally from a bloodstained sofa in Hitler's bunker. When Soviet forces let in General Dwight D Eisenhower after the fall of the Nazi regime, his communications officer, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren, cut off a piece and took it home with him. After sitting in his safe for decades, it was eventually sold to the Gettysburg Museum of History. The research also found that Hitler had a high polygenic risk score - a measure created by examining an individual's DNA against the genetics of the population at large - for autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Read more:Hitler speeches go viral on TikTokNeo-Nazis plan UK terror attack The findings are due to be broadcast in a two-part documentary that will air on Channel 4 from 15 November, called Hitler's DNA: Blueprint Of A Dictator. Professor King cautioned against reading too much into the findings, however. \"Genetics are one part of the picture of your personality,\" she said. \"Hitler's father was an alcoholic who beat him. He had four or five siblings die. His mum dies. He has gone through a lot of adverse life events, the time he's living in, his society: these all affect him.\" Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, an autism expert, told the programme: \"We can't reduce his behaviour to these diagnoses. Autism is a disability and a difference. It's a disability in the sense that people who are autistic struggle with social relationships and communication. They struggle with that first kind of empathy. \"The vast majority of these individuals do not do bad things. We've just got to keep that in mind so that it doesn't become out of balance.\" Another expert, Professor Thomas Weber of the University of Aberdeen, also cautioned against extrapolating the dictator's role in history from his DNA, adding: \"I was concerned what damage the analysis of his DNA might do... Yet now that Hitler's DNA has been analysed, it would be wrong and even unethical to attempt to put the genie back into the bottle and to ignore the results of the analysis. \"The genetic make-up of extremists and non-extremists is on average the same. There simply is no dictator gene. Nor is Hitler's DNA, or the DNA of any other tyrant for that matter, the blueprint of a dictator. \"What we need to do with the results of Hitler's DNA analysis is what we as historians do with any source: apply source criticism, use them extremely carefully and soberly, compare them with other accounts and calibrate them.\""

        "Content": "Some of the biggest names in music - including Coldplay, Dua Lipa and Radiohead - have urged the government to honour a pledge to cap ticket resale prices and shutout touts. They have joined artists including The Cure's Robert Smith, New Order, Mark Knopfler, Iron Maiden, PJ Harvey and this year's Mercury Prize winner Sam Fender to sign a statement calling for a cap to \"restore faith in the ticketing system\" and \"help democratise public access to the arts\". Other signatories include the watchdog Which?, FanFair Alliance, O2, the Football Supporters' Association and organisations representing the music and theatre industries, venues, managers, and ticket retailers. In the statement, the coalition says new protections are needed to \"help fix elements of the extortionate and pernicious secondary ticketing market that serve the interests of touts, whose exploitative practices are preventing genuine fans from accessing the music, theatre, and sports they love\". Labour had promised in its manifesto to put a stop to concert-goers being scammed or priced out of events by touts using bots to buy tickets in bulk the moment they go on sale, which they can then sell on for huge mark-ups on secondary ticketing websites. In government, the party again made that promise - but more than a year after it vowed action, and seven months since its consultation on the issue closed, there has been no clear indication of when new laws will be introduced. The campaign comes as a new investigation from Which? found prolific sellers in locations including Brazil, Dubai, Singapore, Spain, and the US hoovering up tickets for popular events in the UK before relisting them at vastly inflated prices on StubHub and Viagogo.

Which? found Oasis tickets for Wembley shows listed for £3,498.85 on StubHub and £4,442 on Viagogo. A seat for the Minnesota Vikings vs Cleveland Browns NFL clash at Tottenham Hotspur was listed for £3,568.39 on StubHub, while a Coldplay ticket, also for Wembley, was £814.52 on StubHub. And a ticket for the All Points East festival in London's Victoria Park, headlined by Raye, for £114,666 on Viagogo. The watchdog found it was often difficult for buyers to establish the seller's identity or to contact them - despite the Competition and Markets Authority securing a court order in 2018 requiring Viagogo to outline the identity of traders. While Viagogo agrees that the ticket ecosystem needs reforming, it says price caps would only harm fans. In a statement to Money, it said price caps have \"repeatedly failed fans\", pushing them towards social media and unregulated sites. UK Finance, representing over 300 financial institutions, has also warned the government that price caps would increase fraud risk. \"We urge industry to consider the evidence presented by banks and for a formal risk assessment to be conducted before introducing reforms,\" Viagogo said. \"Most sellers use Viagogo to resell a few spare tickets - 73% sold fewer than five in 2023. This year, Beyonce's London tickets were listed for under £75, below primary prices. As of September 2025, nearly 30% of UK events had an average ticket price under £50 on Viagogo, and 84% under £100.\" Instead, it said the solution is \"open ticketing\", which would connect primary and resale platforms in real time to verify tickets. \"Open ticketing allows the sharing of critical information to identify illegal bot activity and eliminate fraud. Opening the market to greater competition also helps drive prices down as more platforms compete on prices, fees and services,\" it said. And there's more… Which? also found evidence of speculative selling - when tickets are listed on secondary sites even though the seller has not bought them yet. Tickets for a Busted vs McFly show in Glasgow, which were available through Ticketmaster - the original seller - were simultaneously being listed on StubHub and Viagogo at double the price. Government to set out plans 'shortly' Which? consumer law expert Lisa Webb urged Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer to commit to legislation. A government spokeswoman said it is \"fully committed to clamping down on touts,\" had listened to comments in response to the consultation earlier this year, and would set out its plans \"shortly\"."
