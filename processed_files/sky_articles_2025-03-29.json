        "Content": " The chair of the charity set up by Prince Harry has accused him of \"harassment and bullying at scale\" after he and several others quit the organisation earlier this week. The Duke of Sussex was said to have initiated the campaign by the \"unleashing of the Sussex [PR] machine\". Sentebale chair Dr Sophie Chandauka told Trevor Phillips on Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"The only reason I'm here... is because at some point on Tuesday, Prince Harry authorised the release of a damaging piece of news to the outside world without informing me or my country directors, or my executive director. \"And can you imagine what that attack has done for me, on me and the 540 individuals in the Sentebale organisations and their family? \"That is an example of harassment and bullying at scale.\" Sky News contacted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about the contents of the interview and they declined to offer any formal response. A source close to the former trustees of the Sentebale charity has described as \"completely baseless\" Dr Chandauka's claims that she was bullied and harassed, briefed against by Prince Harry, or that the Sussex machine was unleashed on her. On Tuesday, Prince Harry quit as patron of the charity, which he set up in honour of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the time, he released a joint statement with co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, saying they had been forced to step down \"in support of and solidarity with\" the board of trustees who had also resigned, following their disagreements with the chairwoman. Presenter It takes something pretty spectacular to knock Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Rachel Reeves out of the headlines. But this week, the goings-on at a small, Africa-based charity did exactly that. A spate of resignations at Sentebale, set up to support families with children stricken with AIDS, garnered global attention. The reason is, of course, that the charity's patron was the Duke of Sussex, formerly HRH Prince Harry, who created the organisation partly in memory of his mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales. The conflict has torn the charity apart, and threatens its life-saving work – not to mention the reputations of all involved. The organisation's chair, Sophie Chandauka, is a distinguished Zimbabwean-born corporate lawyer, who I have known for many years. We have worked together to persuade City firms to increase the gender and ethnic diversity of their boards.  But I had little knowledge of her royal connections until now. In our interview, she accuses the Duke of unleashing \"the Sussex machine\" on her and Sentebale's staff. A source close to the former trustees of the charity has described the claims as \"completely baseless\". Watch the entire interview, and judge for yourself. They wrote that the relationship \"broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation\". The problems reportedly stem from a decision to focus fundraising in Africa. In a statement earlier this week, seemingly targeted at Prince Harry, Dr Chandauka said: \"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct. \"Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to the press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir - and the cover-up that ensued.\" Royal correspondent This could not be more damning to a charity that has meant so much to Prince Harry.  Sophie Chandauka laying the blame for the collapse of Sentebale firmly at the door of the Duke of Sussex. Her statement on Wednesday felt like a hit at him with its mention of using the press he despises, but now we're left in no uncertain terms who she holds responsible.  There have been bullying allegations levelled at the Duke before, he refuted them then and those close to him refuse to accept them on this occasion too. I spoke to one of the former trustees, Dr Kelello Lerotholi, who told me he didn't recognise any of the allegations made. He wanted to share with me that issues around stewardship, concerns about the future direction of the charity, and financial worries led to this huge divide and breakdown between the trustees, the patrons and the chair.  Dr Lerotholi was also there from the very beginning - he met Harry when he went to Lesotho for his gap year, the foundation stone for setting up the charity in Princess Diana's name.  He's also a close friend of Prince Seisso, Sentebale's co-founder. He couldn't have been clearer that this has left them all devastated. I went to Lesotho in 2015 when they opened the Mamohato Centre - a place for children and teenagers who had HIV and AIDS to share their experiences and a place where it was clear Harry felt at home. Yet now after five years where Harry has had to give up so much, his beloved charity, how it's been run and the behaviour of those within it is now at the centre of a UK Charity Commission investigation. The behaviour of Harry has been called into question in the most serious way. On Wednesday, a former trustee of Sentebale, Dr Kelello Lerotholi, told Sky's royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills he did not recognise any of the allegations. Dr Lerotholi said he had never witnessed these issues and that the claims \"came to me as a surprise\".

In the statement, they said: \"With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice in support and solidarity with the board of trustees, who have had to do the same. \"These trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind. \"In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship. \"We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they've had to follow through with this act. \"What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\" Sentebale was established in 2006 to help children and young people in southern Africa, particularly those with HIV and Aids. Prince Harry was inspired to start the charity after spending two months in Lesotho, when he was on a gap year in 2004. He was in the small African country - which has one of the world's highest rates of HIV and AIDS - as recently as last October.

        "Content": " The number of people killed in Myanmar following a powerful earthquake has risen to 1,644, with 3,408 others injured, according to local reports. A further 139 people are also reportedly missing across the country. It comes as dramatic footage shows the moment a building several stories high collapsed into rubble in the city of Mandalay - near to the earthquake's epicentre. Survivors in the city dug with their bare hands in a desperate attempt to find trapped people. It struck at around 12.50pm local time (6.20am UK time) on Friday at a shallow depth of six miles (9.6km).  The quake's epicentre was about 10 miles from Mandalay. There were also aftershocks, with one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude 12 minutes later. King Charles sent a message of condolence. \"I know that the people of Myanmar continue to endure so much hardship and tragedy in your lives, and I have long admired your extraordinary resilience and spirit,\" he said in a statement. \"At this most difficult and heartbreaking of times, my wife and I send our deepest possible sympathy to all those who have suffered the profound tragedy of losing their loved ones, their homes and their precious livelihoods.\" The UK government has announced a package of £10m to support the people of Myanmar in the aftermath of the quake. International affairs editor This will be the first natural disaster to happen after President Donald Trump shut down America's international aid agency with potentially devastating consequences. The impact in the aftermath of this earthquake is likely to be severe. Trump's decision to shut down the US Agency for International Development was already reported to have decimated US aid operations in Myanmar. Its global impact is hard to overstate. American aid had provided 40% of developmental aid worldwide. Yesterday, Trump promised Myanmar aid for the earthquake. In reality, his administration has fired most of the people most experienced at organising that help and shut down the means to provide it.\n The last of its staff were ironically only let go yesterday, even as the president was making lofty promises to help.\n\n The US State Department says it has maintained a team of experts in the country. But former USAID officials say the system is now 'in shambles' without the wherewithal to conduct search and rescue or transfer aid. Read the full story here.  China's President Xi Jinping also sent his condolences to Myanmar's leader Min Aung Hlaing after the earthquake, and, according to the Chinese embassy in Myanmar, they have spoken on the phone. A Chinese rescue team arrived in Yangon, Myanmar's former capital, early on Saturday, while Russia and the US have also offered to provide humanitarian assistance and relief. Neighbouring Thailand was also affected by the quake, leaving at least seven people dead, eight injured, and 47 missing. Buildings in five of Myanmar's cities and towns collapsed, along with a railway bridge and a road bridge on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway, state media reported. A dam also burst. The control tower at Nay Pyi Taw airport, which serves the capital Naypyidaw, collapsed, meaning runways cannot be used.  Recalling the moment they left their home in Mandalay, one resident said they \"ran out of the house as everything started shaking\". They said they \"witnessed a five-storey building collapse in front of [their] eyes\", adding, \"everyone in my town is out on the road and no one dares to go back inside buildings\".  The natural disaster - the largest earthquake in this region in nearly 80 years - comes as the country is in the grip of a civil war. Search efforts continued on Saturday morning in Bangkok as the city's governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said people were believed to be alive in the wreckage at three construction sites, including one where a partially built high-rise collapsed. Most of the city's metro and light rail resumed normal operation on Saturday morning, according to their operators. Major General Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for the military government, told MRTV that blood was in high demand in earthquake-hit areas, as he urged donors to contact hospitals as soon as possible.  United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said UN staff were working to gather information on the number of people impacted by the earthquake and the scope of the humanitarian needs.

We will also work to provide necessary disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.\" The Red Cross has said its attempts to reach Mandalay and Sagaing regions and the southern Shan state are made more challenging by downed power lines. China will provide 100 million yuan (£10.63m) worth of aid to Myanmar, including tents, blankets, emergency medical kits, food and water. The first batch is set to arrive on 31 March, according to the Chinese embassy's Facebook page."

        "Content": " In Bangkok, at the site where a mass of rubble sits, rescue workers have the machinery they need and the manpower to try and pull people out of the high-rise building that collapsed. In neighbouring Myanmar, they certainly don't have that kind of capacity and they're confronting a much larger death toll - one that is rising. And yet, progress at the site where an unfinished building was instantly destroyed has been painfully slow. All day, we watched as cranes tried to shift the concrete and steel around to make way for rescuers to enter. Tide Banluerit, a volunteer rescuer, emerged looking bewildered after 11 hours inside. \"I looked at the structure and the foundation looked strong,'\" he said. \"But it's not meant to collapse like dominoes and stack like pancakes in that way.\" But there is still hope. Myanmar earthquake: Follow live updates  The Thai police told us overnight that they had seen signs of life on thermal imaging systems. Perhaps as many as 15 people, they believed. Families of the missing were holding on to those nuggets of information - holding vigil at a dusty area now full of makeshift water and footstalls, laid on to support the round-the-clock rescue efforts. Hovering outside a white tent, Munyapa Thongkorn was waiting for news. Wiping away tears as she clutched onto her husband, she told me her 17-year-old daughter Naiyana was trapped. She was working as an electrician inside the multi-storey building when the quake hit.

But I haven't been able to reach her since.\" A rescuer told me he thought it could be 72 hours before they could properly get inside the mangled structure. That's a long time when every second counts. In Myanmar, people are using their own hands to pull their neighbours from the rubble. There have been some miraculous escapes. One video from Mandalay shows a young woman emerging from the smallest of gaps - a flash of a hand and then a smile - confirmation after a long rescue that she had survived against all the odds. China, Russia, and India have sent teams into the country now after the ruling military junta asked for international support - a rare move. They have their work cut out. Information in the isolated country has been slow to emerge - the junta restricting access to the internet. But videos are starting to show the scale of destruction and the death toll, at over 1,600 as of Saturday evening, is expected to rise. The US Geological Survey says it could rise as high as 10,000. The infrastructure has long been under pressure from a bloody civil war in Myanmar. It could easily be totally overwhelmed by this disaster. Hospitals are among the buildings hit. Over the next 48 hours, we will find out a bit more about just how grave the situation is on the ground. Traversing the roads, let alone the whim of the ruling junta, is deeply challenging. But even the military concedes, this time, it needs help and fast."

The formation of the new government marks a key milestone after decades of Assad family rule came to an end in December last year. Syria's interim president Ahmad al Sharaa has since been at the head of a transitional government led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He has pledged to form an inclusive transitional government and has faced pressure to keep that promise from both Western and Arab nations. That pressure increased after the deaths of hundreds of Alawite civilians in violent scenes along Syria's western coast earlier this month.  Bashar al Assad, who was toppled in December, hailed from the minority sect. On Saturday, the new government's 23-member cabinet was announced. Among those announced was Hind Kabawat, a Christian woman and activist who opposed Assad since the conflict began in March 2011, and who will serve as minister for social affairs and labour. Meanwhile, Mohammed Yosr Bernieh has been named Syria's finance minister in the new government. Both Murhaf Abu Qasra and Asaad al Shibani will remain in their roles as defence and foreign ministers, respectively. They had both served in the previous caretaker government following the fall of the Assad regime.

The win marked the club's first domestic trophy in 70 years, with the streets turning into a sea of black and white for an open-top bus parade. It was estimated ahead of the event that as many as 150,000 fans were due to line the streets for the parade. An estimated 150,000 fans then gathered at the park Town Moor for a ticketed event, which saw players gather on stage to lift the trophy, recreating what they did at London's Wembley Stadium nearly two weeks ago on 16 March.

Goalscorer Dan Burn, a childhood fan of Newcastle, also couldn't hide his emotions, telling Sky Sports News: \"I don't know what I was expecting, but it is everything I have ever dreamed of. \"It is something I will never forget.\" Joining the team on the open-top bus were Newcastle-born TV icons Ant and Dec (Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly). The pair, who both support the Premier League team, posted a clip of them following the squad to the bus as McPartlin shouted \"let's get ready to rumble\" in reference to the pair's hit single as PJ and Duncan. North of England correspondent From about 12 noon Newcastle United fans began to gather at Town Moor to celebrate the team's Carabao Cup triumph.  From the field, which is more than 1,000 acres, you can see St James' Park, sitting in the heart of the city.  Stood waiting for the party to start was John Poland, a 68-year-old fan who said the club is \"in his DNA\".  Mr Poland, who is from the city, says he can remember Newcastle's last trophy win, the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup.  For him, the club is an extension of the community.  We \"wrap our arms around you here, we make you feel welcome\", he said, gesturing at the gathering sea of people in black and white scarves and shirts.  As the grass filled up and the parade rolled across the city, the roars ratcheted up us the players appeared on the big screen. Fans of all ages understood the magnitude of the moment, including Archie, a nine-year-old who wants to one day play for Newcastle when he grows up.  \"I cried when they won and went upstairs and started playing Newcastle songs on my Alexa,\" he said.  As Newcastle's record scorer Alan Shearer appeared on the stage, Andrea, a lifelong fan, leaned over the railings to get a closer look.  \"This is everything,\" she said. \"We're a working-class city and this is in the blood.\" In another social media post, Donnelly said: \"Well, we're about to start the parade. I don't know how we've sneaked on here, how have we done this? We just followed the team on and we're on the parade.\" McPartlin then began to chant \"ole, ole, ole, ole\", while in another video the pair could be seen overlooking fans as the bus passed the club's St James' Park ground. As the bus and crowd approached the Town Moor site, white smoke blanketed the area as the crowd sang Hey Jude, replacing the word Jude with Geordies. The celebration ended with a drone show over the park, which sponsor of the team Sela, had teased as a \"spectacular surprise\" earlier in the day. The drones morphed into various images and words, including a Newcastle shirt with the words \"making history\" underneath."

A spate of resignations at Sentebale, set up to support families with children stricken with AIDS, garnered global attention. The reason is, of course, that the charity's patron was the Duke of Sussex, formerly HRH Prince Harry, who created the organisation partly in memory of his mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales. The conflict has torn the charity apart, and threatens its life-saving work – not to mention the reputations of all involved. The organisation's chair, Sophie Chandauka, is a distinguished Zimbabwean-born corporate lawyer, who I have known for many years. We have worked together to persuade City firms to increase the gender and ethnic diversity of their boards.  But I had little knowledge of her royal connections until now. In our interview, she accuses the Duke of unleashing \"the Sussex machine\" on her and Sentebale's staff. A source close to the former trustees of the charity has described the claims as \"completely baseless\". Watch the entire interview, and judge for yourself. They wrote that the relationship \"broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation\". The problems reportedly stem from a decision to focus fundraising in Africa. In a statement earlier this week, seemingly targeted at Prince Harry, Dr Chandauka said: \"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct. \"Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to the press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir - and the cover-up that ensued.\" Royal correspondent This could not be more damning to a charity that has meant so much to Prince Harry.  Sophie Chandauka laying the blame for the collapse of Sentebale firmly at the door of the Duke of Sussex. Her statement on Wednesday felt like a hit at him with its mention of using the press he despises, but now we're left in no uncertain terms who she holds responsible.  There have been bullying allegations levelled at the Duke before, he refuted them then and those close to him refuse to accept them on this occasion too. I spoke to one of the former trustees, Dr Kelello Lerotholi, who told me he didn't recognise any of the allegations made. He wanted to share with me that issues around stewardship, concerns about the future direction of the charity, and financial worries led to this huge divide and breakdown between the trustees, the patrons and the chair.  Dr Lerotholi was also there from the very beginning - he met Harry when he went to Lesotho for his gap year, the foundation stone for setting up the charity in Princess Diana's name.  He's also a close friend of Prince Seisso, Sentebale's co-founder. He couldn't have been clearer that this has left them all devastated. I went to Lesotho in 2015 when they opened the Mamohato Centre - a place for children and teenagers who had HIV and AIDS to share their experiences and a place where it was clear Harry felt at home. Yet now after five years where Harry has had to give up so much, his beloved charity, how it's been run and the behaviour of those within it is now at the centre of a UK Charity Commission investigation. The behaviour of Harry has been called into question in the most serious way. On Wednesday, a former trustee of Sentebale, Dr Kelello Lerotholi, told Sky's royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills he did not recognise any of the allegations. Dr Lerotholi said he had never witnessed these issues and that the claims \"came to me as a surprise\".  Read more:Prince Harry 'in shock' as he quits Sentebale charity Charity misconduct claims 'a surprise', says Sentebale trustee \"I can honestly say, in the meetings I was present in, there was never even a hint of such,\" he said. \"The general tone and conduct of the board has been one of respect for each other, accommodating each other's opinions and inputs, and speaking with respect to each other. \"So this all came as a shock to me.\" On Tuesday, Prince Harry released a joint statement with his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, announcing they were stepping down from Sentebale. In the statement, they said: \"With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice in support and solidarity with the board of trustees, who have had to do the same. \"These trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind. \"In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship. \"We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they've had to follow through with this act. \"What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\" Sentebale was established in 2006 to help children and young people in southern Africa, particularly those with HIV and Aids. Prince Harry was inspired to start the charity after spending two months in Lesotho, when he was on a gap year in 2004. He was in the small African country - which has one of the world's highest rates of HIV and AIDS - as recently as last October.

        "Content": " Hundreds of thousands of joyous Newcastle United fans gathered in the city to celebrate the team's Carabao Cup victory over Liverpool. The win marked the club's first domestic trophy in 70 years, with the streets turning into a sea of black and white for an open-top bus parade. It was estimated ahead of the event that as many as 150,000 fans were due to line the streets for the parade. An estimated 150,000 fans then gathered at the park Town Moor for a ticketed event, which saw players gather on stage to lift the trophy, recreating what they did at London's Wembley Stadium nearly two weeks ago on 16 March. Read more: Newcastle parade as it happened For manager Eddie Howe, Saturday's event was an emotional moment as the city honoured him with a massive banner, unfurled outside St James' Park - the team's home stadium.  Goalscorer Dan Burn, a childhood fan of Newcastle, also couldn't hide his emotions, telling Sky Sports News: \"I don't know what I was expecting, but it is everything I have ever dreamed of. \"It is something I will never forget.\" Joining the team on the open-top bus were Newcastle-born TV icons Ant and Dec (Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly). The pair, who both support the Premier League team, posted a clip of them following the squad to the bus as McPartlin shouted \"let's get ready to rumble\" in reference to the pair's hit single as PJ and Duncan. North of England correspondent From about 12 noon Newcastle United fans began to gather at Town Moor to celebrate the team's Carabao Cup triumph.  From the field, which is more than 1,000 acres, you can see St James' Park, sitting in the heart of the city.  Stood waiting for the party to start was John Poland, a 68-year-old fan who said the club is \"in his DNA\".  Mr Poland, who is from the city, says he can remember Newcastle's last trophy win, the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup.  For him, the club is an extension of the community.  We \"wrap our arms around you here, we make you feel welcome\", he said, gesturing at the gathering sea of people in black and white scarves and shirts.  As the grass filled up and the parade rolled across the city, the roars ratcheted up us the players appeared on the big screen. Fans of all ages understood the magnitude of the moment, including Archie, a nine-year-old who wants to one day play for Newcastle when he grows up.  \"I cried when they won and went upstairs and started playing Newcastle songs on my Alexa,\" he said.  As Newcastle's record scorer Alan Shearer appeared on the stage, Andrea, a lifelong fan, leaned over the railings to get a closer look.  \"This is everything,\" she said. \"We're a working-class city and this is in the blood.\" In another social media post, Donnelly said: \"Well, we're about to start the parade. I don't know how we've sneaked on here, how have we done this? We just followed the team on and we're on the parade.\" McPartlin then began to chant \"ole, ole, ole, ole\", while in another video the pair could be seen overlooking fans as the bus passed the club's St James' Park ground. As the bus and crowd approached the Town Moor site, white smoke blanketed the area as the crowd sang Hey Jude, replacing the word Jude with Geordies. The celebration ended with a drone show over the park, which sponsor of the team Sela, had teased as a \"spectacular surprise\" earlier in the day. The drones morphed into various images and words, including a Newcastle shirt with the words \"making history\" underneath."

A further 139 people are also reportedly missing across the country. It comes as dramatic footage shows the moment a building several stories high collapsed into rubble in the city of Mandalay - near to the earthquake's epicentre. Survivors in the city dug with their bare hands in a desperate attempt to find trapped people. It struck at around 12.50pm local time (6.20am UK time) on Friday at a shallow depth of six miles (9.6km).  The quake's epicentre was about 10 miles from Mandalay. There were also aftershocks, with one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude 12 minutes later. King Charles sent a message of condolence. \"I know that the people of Myanmar continue to endure so much hardship and tragedy in your lives, and I have long admired your extraordinary resilience and spirit,\" he said in a statement. \"At this most difficult and heartbreaking of times, my wife and I send our deepest possible sympathy to all those who have suffered the profound tragedy of losing their loved ones, their homes and their precious livelihoods.\" The UK government has announced a package of £10m to support the people of Myanmar in the aftermath of the quake. International affairs editor This will be the first natural disaster to happen after President Donald Trump shut down America's international aid agency with potentially devastating consequences. The impact in the aftermath of this earthquake is likely to be severe. Trump's decision to shut down the US Agency for International Development was already reported to have decimated US aid operations in Myanmar. Its global impact is hard to overstate. American aid had provided 40% of developmental aid worldwide. Yesterday, Trump promised Myanmar aid for the earthquake. In reality, his administration has fired most of the people most experienced at organising that help and shut down the means to provide it.\n The last of its staff were ironically only let go yesterday, even as the president was making lofty promises to help.\n\n The US State Department says it has maintained a team of experts in the country. But former USAID officials say the system is now 'in shambles' without the wherewithal to conduct search and rescue or transfer aid. Read the full story here.  China's President Xi Jinping also sent his condolences to Myanmar's leader Min Aung Hlaing after the earthquake, and, according to the Chinese embassy in Myanmar, they have spoken on the phone. A Chinese rescue team arrived in Yangon, Myanmar's former capital, early on Saturday, while Russia and the US have also offered to provide humanitarian assistance and relief. Neighbouring Thailand was also affected by the quake, leaving at least seven people dead, eight injured, and 47 missing. Buildings in five of Myanmar's cities and towns collapsed, along with a railway bridge and a road bridge on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway, state media reported. A dam also burst. The control tower at Nay Pyi Taw airport, which serves the capital Naypyidaw, collapsed, meaning runways cannot be used.  Recalling the moment they left their home in Mandalay, one resident said they \"ran out of the house as everything started shaking\". They said they \"witnessed a five-storey building collapse in front of [their] eyes\", adding, \"everyone in my town is out on the road and no one dares to go back inside buildings\".  The natural disaster - the largest earthquake in this region in nearly 80 years - comes as the country is in the grip of a civil war. Search efforts continued on Saturday morning in Bangkok as the city's governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said people were believed to be alive in the wreckage at three construction sites, including one where a partially built high-rise collapsed. Most of the city's metro and light rail resumed normal operation on Saturday morning, according to their operators. Major General Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for the military government, told MRTV that blood was in high demand in earthquake-hit areas, as he urged donors to contact hospitals as soon as possible.  United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said UN staff were working to gather information on the number of people impacted by the earthquake and the scope of the humanitarian needs.

We will also work to provide necessary disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.\" The Red Cross has said its attempts to reach Mandalay and Sagaing regions and the southern Shan state are made more challenging by downed power lines. China will provide 100 million yuan (£10.63m) worth of aid to Myanmar, including tents, blankets, emergency medical kits, food and water. The first batch is set to arrive on 31 March, according to the Chinese embassy's Facebook page."

        "Content": " In Bangkok, at the site where a mass of rubble sits, rescue workers have the machinery they need and the manpower to try and pull people out of the high-rise building that collapsed. In neighbouring Myanmar, they certainly don't have that kind of capacity and they're confronting a much larger death toll - one that is rising. And yet, progress at the site where an unfinished building was instantly destroyed has been painfully slow. All day, we watched as cranes tried to shift the concrete and steel around to make way for rescuers to enter. Tide Banluerit, a volunteer rescuer, emerged looking bewildered after 11 hours inside. \"I looked at the structure and the foundation looked strong,'\" he said. \"But it's not meant to collapse like dominoes and stack like pancakes in that way.\" But there is still hope. Myanmar earthquake: Follow live updates  The Thai police told us overnight that they had seen signs of life on thermal imaging systems. Perhaps as many as 15 people, they believed. Families of the missing were holding on to those nuggets of information - holding vigil at a dusty area now full of makeshift water and footstalls, laid on to support the round-the-clock rescue efforts. Hovering outside a white tent, Munyapa Thongkorn was waiting for news. Wiping away tears as she clutched onto her husband, she told me her 17-year-old daughter Naiyana was trapped. She was working as an electrician inside the multi-storey building when the quake hit.

But I haven't been able to reach her since.\" A rescuer told me he thought it could be 72 hours before they could properly get inside the mangled structure. That's a long time when every second counts. In Myanmar, people are using their own hands to pull their neighbours from the rubble. There have been some miraculous escapes. One video from Mandalay shows a young woman emerging from the smallest of gaps - a flash of a hand and then a smile - confirmation after a long rescue that she had survived against all the odds. China, Russia, and India have sent teams into the country now after the ruling military junta asked for international support - a rare move. They have their work cut out. Information in the isolated country has been slow to emerge - the junta restricting access to the internet. But videos are starting to show the scale of destruction and the death toll, at over 1,600 as of Saturday evening, is expected to rise. The US Geological Survey says it could rise as high as 10,000. The infrastructure has long been under pressure from a bloody civil war in Myanmar. It could easily be totally overwhelmed by this disaster. Hospitals are among the buildings hit. Over the next 48 hours, we will find out a bit more about just how grave the situation is on the ground. Traversing the roads, let alone the whim of the ruling junta, is deeply challenging. But even the military concedes, this time, it needs help and fast."

As they count the cost of this massive earthquake, the people of Myanmar will be hoping, though, for a silver lining, that the disaster may hasten the fall of their despised dictator. The catastrophe comes at a very bad time for General Min Aung Hlaing, who seized power in a coup four years ago. The Myanmar junta is losing a civil war against an array of opposition forces, ceding territory now largely kettled into the country's big cities. And some of its worst damage has been done in its urban strongholds. Read more:More than 1,000 killed in Myanmar earthquakeMoment building collapses in Bangkok earthquake The disaster is so bad that Hlaing has broken his government's self-imposed isolation to appeal for help from the outside world. But the country's inaccessibility will remain a huge obstacle to aid efforts. Myanmar is a deeply superstitious country. The generals who have ruled it since the end of colonial rule have consulted astrologers and use talismanic objects and animals, including white elephants, to protect their grip on power. But earthquakes are thought to portend great change in Myanmar and sometimes the fall of leaders. That in itself may accelerate the toppling of its hated junta. It remains powerful, supplied by ally China with advanced weaponry. It has used fighter jets to wreak havoc and carnage on opponents and civilians as the civil war has intensified. But its enemies are gaining strength too, improvising with drones and other tactics to maintain momentum against a regime that lost all legitimacy. They will be encouraged in the belief that this disaster will bring closer their day of victory."

The formation of the new government marks a key milestone after decades of Assad family rule came to an end in December last year. Syria's interim president Ahmad al Sharaa has since been at the head of a transitional government led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He has pledged to form an inclusive transitional government and has faced pressure to keep that promise from both Western and Arab nations. That pressure increased after the deaths of hundreds of Alawite civilians in violent scenes along Syria's western coast earlier this month.  Bashar al Assad, who was toppled in December, hailed from the minority sect. On Saturday, the new government's 23-member cabinet was announced. Among those announced was Hind Kabawat, a Christian woman and activist who opposed Assad since the conflict began in March 2011, and who will serve as minister for social affairs and labour. Meanwhile, Mohammed Yosr Bernieh has been named Syria's finance minister in the new government. Both Murhaf Abu Qasra and Asaad al Shibani will remain in their roles as defence and foreign ministers, respectively. They had both served in the previous caretaker government following the fall of the Assad regime.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Grand Theft Auto VI is the most anticipated game of the year. The long-awaited sequel by developer Rockstar Games is expected in the autumn - 12 years on from the record-breaking GTA V. While gamers excitedly await its release, the industry itself is buzzing with anticipation over rumblings the base game could command a premium $100 (about £80) price point and still achieve colossal sales. Setting this precedent could lead to other game publishers wanting a slice of the action by increasing their own starting prices. However, the GTA series boasts two winning ingredients that some other games do not have - brand power and fan loyalty. Expert research analyst Michael Pachter told Sky News he believes Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive Software will be able to charge $100 with little complaint. Mr Pachter, a managing director at US-based Wedbush Securities, highlighted the rising cost of entertainment since GTA V was released in September 2013. \n                  Pizza Hut franchisee in Scotland accused of 'wage theft' as workers stage protest\n                 \n                  Major investigation into ongoing gang feud which has seen properties firebombed and shots fired in Edinburgh streets\n                 \n                  Tour de France returning to the UK in 2027\n                 He said: \"Realistically, video games are the only form of entertainment that hasn't kept up pricing with inflation. \"Look at movie tickets, concerts, Disneyland, video on demand (VOD) - all have doubled.\" Mr Pachter said the key to \"charging\" more is to justify the value to the consumer. He explained: \"I expect GTA VI to be fully integrated with GTA Online, and Rockstar can offer premium edition purchasers $100-worth of in-game items - currency, skins, vehicles, weapons, etc - as a trade-off for the higher price point. \"The level of integration will make the in-game items more valuable, and I don't expect a lot of pushback. \"I think $100 or so makes sense, and don't expect that we will ever see a $500 game.\" If history repeats itself, GTA Online will be the moneymaker. The persistent online world offers endless monetisation opportunities - with gamers enticed to splash out on new vehicles, weapons, properties, businesses and cosmetic upgrades. Mr Pachter said GTA VI's integration with its online offering provides an \"excuse\" for engaged players to spend more money. He added: \"Some players will spend an additional $500 and most won't, but those who spend more than $100 will do so if they perceive there is value derived from the purchase.\" The GTA series - which was created in Dundee, Scotland - is one of the biggest franchises in the industry. GTA V became the fastest entertainment product in history to make $1bn (in its first three days) and has since sold more than 210 million copies worldwide. Developer Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), based in Edinburgh, has achieved additional success by collaborating with fellow studio Rockstar San Diego on the Red Dead Redemption games. Read more from Sky News:The impact and legacy of Rockstar's biggest gameThe 'geeky' hobby that's a billion-pound industry When GTA V made its debut, it launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That was two consoles ago, with the new game set to arrive via PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. AAA (Triple-A) games - big budget, high-profile productions - are now taking longer to make as gamers demand seamless multiplayer experiences, cross-device gaming capabilities, visually impressive graphics, and fully immersive storylines. From the GTA VI trailer footage, players will be returning to the Miami-flavoured metropolis of Vice City in the fictional state of Leonida. The Bonnie and Clyde-style story is set to include the first playable female character in the series' history. GTA has always poked fun at American culture, with the nation's past decade of politics like something out of the game. GTA VI looks certain to continue the series' tradition of satire, but the trailer also shows that no expense has been spared in regards to bringing the sun-soaked streets of Vice City to life. The cost of creating a game can vary widely based on a multitude of factors, including the studio size, staff skill level, and development time. Given the size of Rockstar's workforce and the number of years the game has been in development, Mr Pachter believes the cost of GTA VI \"is highly likely to be nearly $1bn\". Mr Pachter said: \"They spent this much time because they can, and the scope of the game is typically immense.\" Rockstar has so far remained tight-lipped over its budget and whether GTA VI is indeed the most expensive video game ever made. Scotland reporter The gateway toy that sparked my love for gaming was the Tomytronic Shark Attack 3D device. It was the early 1980s and I’d received the binocular-style game for Christmas. I soon upgraded to the ZX Spectrum, and as the years have passed I’ve been fortunate to enjoy many of the consoles released via Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox. Let me be clear, I’m a console gamer. If I had the spare money and patience, maybe I would build my own gaming PC – but I don’t see that in my future. I love the GTA series and rank Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire, Bully (Canis Canem Edit) and The Warriors amongst my top favourites. Although the GTA games are meant for adults, I expect many youths across the UK will either want it on day one or will add it to their Christmas list. Rolling back to when I was in primary school, I was able to borrow ZX Spectrum games from the local library. My friends and I would share these around between ourselves, and in later years we would continue to swap our own Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox games. This meant that someone like myself – who didn’t come from money – was able to play a game I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford. I highlight this because some of the newer consoles don’t have a disc drive, and most games are now bought and downloaded digitally. I certainly don’t begrudge the price of video games rising to ensure a good quality product, but by making it more difficult to share them with friends is a hindrance. With the cost of living crisis affecting households right across the UK, there may be parents who do not have the money to buy a new game on release or even while on sale for their children. Speaking from experience, some of my greatest gaming nights have been round at friends’ houses watching them play their new game while having a little go myself. You see, that’s the beauty of the gaming community – it’s a supportive sharing space where we want to see everyone join in on the fun. After COVID all but wiped out trips to see a movie on the silver screen, film studios are now having to contend with the cost of living crisis and audiences preferring to wait for digital releases instead of spending money at the cinema. For those concerned about a $100 starting point for GTA VI, or indeed if it becomes the new standard for video games, Mr Pachter is advising to similarly wait it out. He said: \"Like theatrical releases, game prices decline over time. \"Rockstar can charge $100 for six months, can drop to $70 for six months, then drop periodically thereafter. \"Nobody has to 'afford' $100; they all know they can wait.\" Even if GTA VI fans do wait it out for a cheaper price or for it to potentially drop via Xbox Games Pass, Mr Pachter is confident that will not affect Rockstar's overall success. He said: \"There is no question they will sell 100 million copies - or more - eventually.\" So, while there is little doubt all eyes will be on GTA VI's launch, the lasting question is whether other studios will attempt to follow suit if we do indeed see a price rise. But a word to the wise, there are few games with a legacy as formidable as GTA and any price increase may turn out to be the exception rather than the rule. As career criminal and former bank robber Trevor Philips (GTA V character) nicely put it: \"I said something nice, not expensive.\""

Nigel Farage arrived on stage in a JCB accompanied by a live band and greeted with a standing ovation. \n                  Reform UK leader Nigel Farage attacks 'woke virus' in big companies after end of NatWest debanking battle\n                 \n                  Farage and NatWest agree to settle debanking dispute\n                 \n                  Nigel Farage would turn UK into a 'Trump tribute act', Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says\n                 Thousands cheered from the stands at the 15,000 capacity venue, though a lot of empty seats were noticeable. Speaking to loyal supporters who had waited hours for their party leader to speak, many raised their concerns with how the expulsion of one of Reform's former MPs was handled. Recent division in the party started when Rupert Lowe was reported to the police by Reform UK over alleged threats of physical violence towards the party chairman, Zia Yusuf, something Lowe called untrue and false. The party also commissioned an independent report which found \"credible evidence\" of separate allegations of bullying, which Lowe also disputes. Among the chants of support for the party during the rally, there were also shouts of \"Rupert\" in the crowd - quickly quietened by security. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 Poll popularity rivals government While the energy was more subdued than previous events, their popularity in the polls still rivals the government. In retaliation we saw a dozen or so Labour-backed billboards around the venue attacking the party. The city's Birmingham Mail newspaper front cover was also co-opted by Labour warning against Farage, and Wes Streeting namechecked the party on Friday, accusing them of wanting to privatise the NHS. With not just the locals but a by-election in just one month's time, it's clear who Labour see as the direct threat this time around. Reform doesn't need to announce any policy at these rallies. But it hinted at a government efficiency strategy, borrowing language from across the pond, Farage stating he will create a version of Elon Musk's DOGE - department of government efficiency.

        "Content": "\n          Science and technology editor\n              @t0mclark3\n  A British-built Mars rover stuck on Earth since the start of the war in Ukraine may soon be on its way after the UK Space Agency agreed to pay for its ride down to the Red Planet. The European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover was supposed to land on Mars in 2023. But the rocket powered system designed to ferry the fragile rover down to the planet's surface was being built under contract by Russia's space agency Roscosmos. After the invasion of Ukraine, ESA cancelled the contract, leaving the Rosalind rover, designed to search for signs of past life on Mars, stranded. The £150m contract from the UK Space Agency for Airbus to replace the Russian landing system puts the mission back on track. \"We could unlock some of the key questions that humanity is asking of itself,\" said Peter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science. \"If we could do that, and benefit from some of the results and the innovation that will flow from it, then I think this is a pretty good investment for Britain to have.\" \n                  London City Airport targets leisure market with A320neo move\n                 \n                  SpaceX rivalry prompts Airbus to cut 2,000 jobs \n                 \n                  Airbus Beluga lands at London's Heathrow Airport\n                 It's good news for the Rosalind rover - a central part of ESA's ExoMars programme - because it's been one of the most delayed, and disrupted missions in space history. Early plans saw it launching in 2018. But NASA, originally a partner in the venture, pulled out due to funding constraints leaving ESA member states having to make up the shortfall. Completion of the lander was then delayed by COVID restrictions, then essentially grounded when Russia was booted out of the project. 'Scary but exciting' Constructed by Airbus UK at its facility in Hertfordshire, it looked for a while as if Stevenage was as close to Mars as the Rosalind rover was going to get. Now Airbus has the contract to build the lander for the rover as well. It's a boost for the UK space sector, but a fraught one. The company has just three years to complete the project and neither Airbus, nor the UK has built a propulsion system for landing on another planet before. More stressful still, the fact 60% of Mars missions end in failure, many in the crucial landing phase. Europe's last Mars lander - a mission called Schiaparelli designed to test the rover's landing system - crash landed in 2016. The UK's last bid to land on Mars with the bin lid-sized Beagle 2 probe, shared the same fate. \"There's a lot of effort all working together to make sure we go through each technical detail, that this is sound and we can make it happen,\" said Caroline Rodier, ExoMars lander lead at Airbus. \"It is scary, but it is very exciting.\" The Rosalind Franklin rover is designed to look for signs of past, or even present, life on Mars. Named after the British scientist who helped discover the structure of DNA, the rover carries with it an on-board laboratory to test rock and soil samples for chemical signatures of life. NASA Mars rover missions have aimed to do the same, but Rosalind's edge comes in the form of a drill capable of penetrating two metres into Martian soil, hopefully deep enough to find molecules that haven't been degraded by the harsh radiation on the planet's surface. Having its all-important landing system built under the same roof in Stevenage as Rosalind herself, is if anything, a confidence boost, according to the man who led the rover's development. \"Before we were building our rover and had to rely on others to get it down safely. Whereas now we're playing a big part in that lander platform,\" said Chris Draper, head of Mars programmes at Airbus. \"Knowing these guys as well as I do, I'm pleased we're part of it.\" Read more from Sky News:Analysis - JD Vance felt the cold in GreenlandClocks go forward this weekend Since their earlier departure NASA has since rejoined the partnership to provide the rocket that will carry the rover to Mars. It's due to launch in 2028 and if all goes to plan, Rosalind Franklin could be drilling into the surface of Mars looking for evidence of life by late 2030."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n British authors have told Sky News they felt \"absolutely sick\" to see their book titles appear in a \"shadow library\" allegedly used by tech giant Meta to help develop artificial intelligence software. \"It's my whole life,\" said one best-selling novelist. \"The thought somebody in Silicon Valley or wherever is taking that work to produce identikit fake AI versions... it's so upsetting.\" The tool to search the LibGen database was published by The Atlantic last week after court documents filed as part of a lawsuit by US comedian Sarah Silverman and other authors against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and has a current market value of more than £1trn, were made public earlier this year. Meta is accused of breaching copyright laws by using LibGen - a prominent so-called \"shadow library\", operated anonymously, that allegedly contains millions of pirated copies of books, journal articles and other materials - to develop its AI software. Meta has denied the claim and argues the case should be thrown out. In a legal document filed earlier this week, the tech company said it did not violate copyright law by downloading books from some parts of LibGen to train its flagship AI system Llama 3, saying it made \"fair use\" of the material, and that Llama 3 does not \"replicate\" authors' works. In earlier court documents, lawyers for Silverman and the other authors alleged internal communications showed Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg \"approved\" use of the LibGen dataset despite concerns from some workers. The Society of Authors (SoA) trade union has described Meta's alleged behaviour as \"appalling\" and says the company \"needs to compensate the rightsholders of all the works it has been exploiting\". \"It's every single book I have ever written,\" says novelist Rowan Coleman, who has had about 40 books published since her first in 2002, including the Sunday Times bestseller The Memory Book in 2014, and The Bronte Mysteries series under a pen name. \"I felt absolutely sick… I have no way of knowing how much revenue that has cost me. Like most writers, I struggle to pay the bills. I have three jobs, I have children to support and a mortgage to pay. And there are tech billionaires who are profiting from my work and the work of countless other authors as well. How can that be right?\" Meta, Coleman says, allegedly decided to obtain \"what they needed cheaply and quickly\". But financial compensation aside, she says there is a bigger issue. \"It's a threat to this profession even being able to continue to exist. We are, I think, at genuine risk of not having any books for people to actually pirate - at least not any written by humans.\" Coleman highlights the recent Netflix drama Adolescence, co-written by and starring Stephen Graham, which has been discussed everywhere from US talk shows to UK parliament. \"We wouldn't have that if it wasn't for writers sitting down and working and grafting for hours. While JK Rowling, Stephen King and James Patterson may be worth millions, a survey in 2022 found that authors in the UK earned an average median income of about £7,000. Hannah Doyle, a romcom novelist who is about to publish her fifth novel, The Spa Break, in May, says two of her previous works appear in the LibGen search. Like Coleman, she has other jobs to supplement her author earnings. Each book takes about a year to complete, she says. 'It's David and Goliath' \"We're kind of the little people, it's like David and Goliath,\" she says. \"How do we stand up for our rights when we're facing these tech giants worth trillions of pounds? \"This isn't right, because it's theft, ultimately. They're [allegedly] stealing our work and they're using it to better their AI systems. What's going to happen to our careers as a result of that?\" Doyle says the situation might be different had authors been approached and offered remuneration. \"I think AI has so many benefits in certain fields,\" she says. \"For medical research, for example, it's got the potential to be incredibly useful. What needs to happen is we really need to give it some boundaries before it totally takes over.\" Award-winning writer Damian Barr, whose books also appear to be featured in the database, shared a post on Instagram, writing: \"Readers and viewers - because so much TV and film and theatre starts with a book - are being subjected to BILGE generated by machines… creatively and culturally and financially, AI is robbing us all.\" TV presenter and author Richard Osman, who has had huge success with his Thursday Murder Club series, wrote on X: \"Copyright law is not complicated at all. If you want to use an author's work you need to ask for permission. If you use it without permission you're breaking the law. It's so simple. It'll be incredibly difficult for us, and for other affected industries, to take on Meta, but we'll have a good go!\" In his article, Atlantic writer Alex Reisner, who created the LibGen search tool, gave the caveats that it is \"impossible\" to know exactly which parts of LibGen Meta has used and which parts it hasn't, and the database is \"constantly growing\". His snapshot was created in January 2025, he says, more than a year after the lawsuit says it was accessed by the tech giant, so some titles that appear now would not have been available to download at that point. The SoA is urging authors in the UK to write to Meta, as well as to their local MPs. \"Rather than ask permission and pay for these copyright-protected materials, AI companies are knowingly choosing to steal them in the race to dominate the market,\" chief executive Anna Ganley said in a statement. \"This is shocking behaviour by big tech that is currently being enabled by governments who are not intervening to strengthen and uphold current copyright protections.\" A Meta spokesperson told Sky News in a statement that the company \"has developed transformational GenAI open source LLMs that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies\". The statement continued: \"Fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this. We disagree with plaintiffs' assertions, and the full record tells a different story. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and to protect the development of GenAI for the benefit of all.\" The US lawsuit Authors including comedian Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Ta-Nehisi Coates filed their class-action lawsuit against Meta in California in 2023. They have accused the tech firm of illegally downloading digital copies of their books and using them - without their consent or offering compensation - to train AI. The controversy surrounding LibGen is part of a wider debate about AI and copyright law. In the US, the Authors Guild says legal action is under way against other AI companies for allegedly using pirated books, as well as Meta. The organisation has advised authors that if their books have been used by Meta, they are automatically included in the Kadrey vs Meta class action, the lawsuit involving Silverman and other authors, \"without needing to take any immediate action\". Read more from Sky News:BAFTA TV Awards nominations revealedOasis fans may have been misled, watchdog says Separately in 2023, the Authors Guild and 17 authors filed a class-action suit against OpenAI in New York for alleged copyright infringement. The named plaintiffs include John Grisham, George RR Martin and Jodi Picoult. The issue was also one of the driving forces behind the strikes in Hollywood in 2023. But not everyone in the creative industries is against it. Last year, publisher Harper Collins reached an agreement with an unnamed technology company to allow \"limited use of select non-fiction backlist titles\" for training AI models. And in 2023, award-winning crime author Ajay Chowdhury told Sky News he was embracing the technology. AI law in the UK - what is happening? A consultation on AI copyright law in the UK ended in February. Under the plans, an exemption to copyright would be created for training AI, so tech firms would not need a licence to use copyrighted material - and creators would need to opt out to prevent their work from being used. A government spokesperson said at the time that the UK's current regime for copyright and AI was \"holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\". No changes will be made \"until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives, including increased control for rights holders to help them easily license their content, enabling lawful access to material to train world-leading AI models in the UK, and building greater transparency over material being used\", the spokesperson said. But plenty of authors and others in the creative industries are not convinced. \"It just leaves the door open for so much exploitation of people's rights, people's data and their work,\" says Coleman. \"I would really urge the government to think again about this and to protect what is a jewel in the crown of British cultural identity - to do the right thing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Grand Theft Auto VI is the most anticipated game of the year. The long-awaited sequel by developer Rockstar Games is expected in the autumn - 12 years on from the record-breaking GTA V. While gamers excitedly await its release, the industry itself is buzzing with anticipation over rumblings the base game could command a premium $100 (about £80) price point and still achieve colossal sales. Setting this precedent could lead to other game publishers wanting a slice of the action by increasing their own starting prices. However, the GTA series boasts two winning ingredients that some other games do not have - brand power and fan loyalty. Expert research analyst Michael Pachter told Sky News he believes Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive Software will be able to charge $100 with little complaint. Mr Pachter, a managing director at US-based Wedbush Securities, highlighted the rising cost of entertainment since GTA V was released in September 2013. \n                  Pizza Hut franchisee in Scotland accused of 'wage theft' as workers stage protest\n                 \n                  Major investigation into ongoing gang feud which has seen properties firebombed and shots fired in Edinburgh streets\n                 \n                  Tour de France returning to the UK in 2027\n                 He said: \"Realistically, video games are the only form of entertainment that hasn't kept up pricing with inflation. \"Look at movie tickets, concerts, Disneyland, video on demand (VOD) - all have doubled.\" Mr Pachter said the key to \"charging\" more is to justify the value to the consumer. He explained: \"I expect GTA VI to be fully integrated with GTA Online, and Rockstar can offer premium edition purchasers $100-worth of in-game items - currency, skins, vehicles, weapons, etc - as a trade-off for the higher price point. \"The level of integration will make the in-game items more valuable, and I don't expect a lot of pushback. \"I think $100 or so makes sense, and don't expect that we will ever see a $500 game.\" If history repeats itself, GTA Online will be the moneymaker. The persistent online world offers endless monetisation opportunities - with gamers enticed to splash out on new vehicles, weapons, properties, businesses and cosmetic upgrades. Mr Pachter said GTA VI's integration with its online offering provides an \"excuse\" for engaged players to spend more money. He added: \"Some players will spend an additional $500 and most won't, but those who spend more than $100 will do so if they perceive there is value derived from the purchase.\" The GTA series - which was created in Dundee, Scotland - is one of the biggest franchises in the industry. GTA V became the fastest entertainment product in history to make $1bn (in its first three days) and has since sold more than 210 million copies worldwide. Developer Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), based in Edinburgh, has achieved additional success by collaborating with fellow studio Rockstar San Diego on the Red Dead Redemption games. Read more from Sky News:The impact and legacy of Rockstar's biggest gameThe 'geeky' hobby that's a billion-pound industry When GTA V made its debut, it launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That was two consoles ago, with the new game set to arrive via PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. AAA (Triple-A) games - big budget, high-profile productions - are now taking longer to make as gamers demand seamless multiplayer experiences, cross-device gaming capabilities, visually impressive graphics, and fully immersive storylines. From the GTA VI trailer footage, players will be returning to the Miami-flavoured metropolis of Vice City in the fictional state of Leonida. The Bonnie and Clyde-style story is set to include the first playable female character in the series' history. GTA has always poked fun at American culture, with the nation's past decade of politics like something out of the game. GTA VI looks certain to continue the series' tradition of satire, but the trailer also shows that no expense has been spared in regards to bringing the sun-soaked streets of Vice City to life. The cost of creating a game can vary widely based on a multitude of factors, including the studio size, staff skill level, and development time. Given the size of Rockstar's workforce and the number of years the game has been in development, Mr Pachter believes the cost of GTA VI \"is highly likely to be nearly $1bn\". Mr Pachter said: \"They spent this much time because they can, and the scope of the game is typically immense.\" Rockstar has so far remained tight-lipped over its budget and whether GTA VI is indeed the most expensive video game ever made. Scotland reporter The gateway toy that sparked my love for gaming was the Tomytronic Shark Attack 3D device. It was the early 1980s and I’d received the binocular-style game for Christmas. I soon upgraded to the ZX Spectrum, and as the years have passed I’ve been fortunate to enjoy many of the consoles released via Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox. Let me be clear, I’m a console gamer. If I had the spare money and patience, maybe I would build my own gaming PC – but I don’t see that in my future. I love the GTA series and rank Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire, Bully (Canis Canem Edit) and The Warriors amongst my top favourites. Although the GTA games are meant for adults, I expect many youths across the UK will either want it on day one or will add it to their Christmas list. Rolling back to when I was in primary school, I was able to borrow ZX Spectrum games from the local library. My friends and I would share these around between ourselves, and in later years we would continue to swap our own Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox games. This meant that someone like myself – who didn’t come from money – was able to play a game I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford. I highlight this because some of the newer consoles don’t have a disc drive, and most games are now bought and downloaded digitally. I certainly don’t begrudge the price of video games rising to ensure a good quality product, but by making it more difficult to share them with friends is a hindrance. With the cost of living crisis affecting households right across the UK, there may be parents who do not have the money to buy a new game on release or even while on sale for their children. Speaking from experience, some of my greatest gaming nights have been round at friends’ houses watching them play their new game while having a little go myself. You see, that’s the beauty of the gaming community – it’s a supportive sharing space where we want to see everyone join in on the fun. After COVID all but wiped out trips to see a movie on the silver screen, film studios are now having to contend with the cost of living crisis and audiences preferring to wait for digital releases instead of spending money at the cinema. For those concerned about a $100 starting point for GTA VI, or indeed if it becomes the new standard for video games, Mr Pachter is advising to similarly wait it out. He said: \"Like theatrical releases, game prices decline over time. \"Rockstar can charge $100 for six months, can drop to $70 for six months, then drop periodically thereafter. \"Nobody has to 'afford' $100; they all know they can wait.\" Even if GTA VI fans do wait it out for a cheaper price or for it to potentially drop via Xbox Games Pass, Mr Pachter is confident that will not affect Rockstar's overall success. He said: \"There is no question they will sell 100 million copies - or more - eventually.\" So, while there is little doubt all eyes will be on GTA VI's launch, the lasting question is whether other studios will attempt to follow suit if we do indeed see a price rise. But a word to the wise, there are few games with a legacy as formidable as GTA and any price increase may turn out to be the exception rather than the rule. As career criminal and former bank robber Trevor Philips (GTA V character) nicely put it: \"I said something nice, not expensive.\""

        "Content": "The \"bowcaster\" used by Chewbacca in the original Star Wars trilogy has sold for more than $750,000 at auction - while the medal given to Luke Skywalker at the end of \"A New Hope\" has fetched over $370,000. \"Chewie's\" weapon, which featured in all of the first three Star Wars films between 1977 and 1983, sold for far more than its estimate of between $250,000 and $500,000 (£193,203 to £386,407). The item sold for $768,600 (£593,985) and is a real Horton crossbow, which was modified to give it a futuristic look so it could serve as a laser weapon. Some of the components have been removed, and missing parts have been recreated, according to the auctioneer Propstore. Chewbacca, a huge hairy Wookie who was played by London-born actor Peter Mayhew, is one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars franchise. His weapon was described by Propstore as \"one of the rarest Star Wars hero props in existence\". Meanwhile, a medal given to Luke Skywalker after he destroyed the Death Star in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) was sold for $378,000 (£292,124). \"The Medal of Yavin\" was presented to Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, by his sister Princess Leia Organa, who was played by Carrie Fisher. It was estimated to sell for between $300,000 and $600,000 (£231,844 and £463,689). It is also believed to have been worn by Harrison Ford - who played Han Solo - during rehearsals. Propstore has claimed it is the \"first and only medal to be offered for public sale\", coming from the collection of props master Gerard Bourke, who worked on the original Star Wars films. Skywalker blows up the Death Star in the movie after the rebels find the plans for the planet-destroying weapon, which is later rebuilt in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi.

The bowcaster and the medal sold for a combined $1,146,600 (£886,109). Brandon Alinger, Propstore's chief operating officer, said after the auction: \"Propstore are thrilled with the incredible success of the first day of our Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction. \"The auction surpassed our expectations and showcased the enduring popularity of franchises like Star Wars.\" Star Wars, originally filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, is a huge and iconic franchise, spawning prequels, sequels and spin-off shows including The Mandalorian, Andor and 2019's Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n British authors have told Sky News they felt \"absolutely sick\" to see their book titles appear in a \"shadow library\" allegedly used by tech giant Meta to help develop artificial intelligence software. \"It's my whole life,\" said one best-selling novelist. \"The thought somebody in Silicon Valley or wherever is taking that work to produce identikit fake AI versions... it's so upsetting.\" The tool to search the LibGen database was published by The Atlantic last week after court documents filed as part of a lawsuit by US comedian Sarah Silverman and other authors against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and has a current market value of more than £1trn, were made public earlier this year. Meta is accused of breaching copyright laws by using LibGen - a prominent so-called \"shadow library\", operated anonymously, that allegedly contains millions of pirated copies of books, journal articles and other materials - to develop its AI software. Meta has denied the claim and argues the case should be thrown out. In a legal document filed earlier this week, the tech company said it did not violate copyright law by downloading books from some parts of LibGen to train its flagship AI system Llama 3, saying it made \"fair use\" of the material, and that Llama 3 does not \"replicate\" authors' works. In earlier court documents, lawyers for Silverman and the other authors alleged internal communications showed Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg \"approved\" use of the LibGen dataset despite concerns from some workers. The Society of Authors (SoA) trade union has described Meta's alleged behaviour as \"appalling\" and says the company \"needs to compensate the rightsholders of all the works it has been exploiting\". \"It's every single book I have ever written,\" says novelist Rowan Coleman, who has had about 40 books published since her first in 2002, including the Sunday Times bestseller The Memory Book in 2014, and The Bronte Mysteries series under a pen name. \"I felt absolutely sick… I have no way of knowing how much revenue that has cost me. Like most writers, I struggle to pay the bills. I have three jobs, I have children to support and a mortgage to pay. And there are tech billionaires who are profiting from my work and the work of countless other authors as well. How can that be right?\" Meta, Coleman says, allegedly decided to obtain \"what they needed cheaply and quickly\". But financial compensation aside, she says there is a bigger issue. \"It's a threat to this profession even being able to continue to exist. We are, I think, at genuine risk of not having any books for people to actually pirate - at least not any written by humans.\" Coleman highlights the recent Netflix drama Adolescence, co-written by and starring Stephen Graham, which has been discussed everywhere from US talk shows to UK parliament. \"We wouldn't have that if it wasn't for writers sitting down and working and grafting for hours. While JK Rowling, Stephen King and James Patterson may be worth millions, a survey in 2022 found that authors in the UK earned an average median income of about £7,000. Hannah Doyle, a romcom novelist who is about to publish her fifth novel, The Spa Break, in May, says two of her previous works appear in the LibGen search. Like Coleman, she has other jobs to supplement her author earnings. Each book takes about a year to complete, she says. 'It's David and Goliath' \"We're kind of the little people, it's like David and Goliath,\" she says. \"How do we stand up for our rights when we're facing these tech giants worth trillions of pounds? \"This isn't right, because it's theft, ultimately. They're [allegedly] stealing our work and they're using it to better their AI systems. What's going to happen to our careers as a result of that?\" Doyle says the situation might be different had authors been approached and offered remuneration. \"I think AI has so many benefits in certain fields,\" she says. \"For medical research, for example, it's got the potential to be incredibly useful. What needs to happen is we really need to give it some boundaries before it totally takes over.\" Award-winning writer Damian Barr, whose books also appear to be featured in the database, shared a post on Instagram, writing: \"Readers and viewers - because so much TV and film and theatre starts with a book - are being subjected to BILGE generated by machines… creatively and culturally and financially, AI is robbing us all.\" TV presenter and author Richard Osman, who has had huge success with his Thursday Murder Club series, wrote on X: \"Copyright law is not complicated at all. If you want to use an author's work you need to ask for permission. If you use it without permission you're breaking the law. It's so simple. It'll be incredibly difficult for us, and for other affected industries, to take on Meta, but we'll have a good go!\" In his article, Atlantic writer Alex Reisner, who created the LibGen search tool, gave the caveats that it is \"impossible\" to know exactly which parts of LibGen Meta has used and which parts it hasn't, and the database is \"constantly growing\". His snapshot was created in January 2025, he says, more than a year after the lawsuit says it was accessed by the tech giant, so some titles that appear now would not have been available to download at that point. The SoA is urging authors in the UK to write to Meta, as well as to their local MPs. \"Rather than ask permission and pay for these copyright-protected materials, AI companies are knowingly choosing to steal them in the race to dominate the market,\" chief executive Anna Ganley said in a statement. \"This is shocking behaviour by big tech that is currently being enabled by governments who are not intervening to strengthen and uphold current copyright protections.\" A Meta spokesperson told Sky News in a statement that the company \"has developed transformational GenAI open source LLMs that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies\". The statement continued: \"Fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this. We disagree with plaintiffs' assertions, and the full record tells a different story. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and to protect the development of GenAI for the benefit of all.\" The US lawsuit Authors including comedian Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Ta-Nehisi Coates filed their class-action lawsuit against Meta in California in 2023. They have accused the tech firm of illegally downloading digital copies of their books and using them - without their consent or offering compensation - to train AI. The controversy surrounding LibGen is part of a wider debate about AI and copyright law. In the US, the Authors Guild says legal action is under way against other AI companies for allegedly using pirated books, as well as Meta. The organisation has advised authors that if their books have been used by Meta, they are automatically included in the Kadrey vs Meta class action, the lawsuit involving Silverman and other authors, \"without needing to take any immediate action\". Read more from Sky News:BAFTA TV Awards nominations revealedOasis fans may have been misled, watchdog says Separately in 2023, the Authors Guild and 17 authors filed a class-action suit against OpenAI in New York for alleged copyright infringement. The named plaintiffs include John Grisham, George RR Martin and Jodi Picoult. The issue was also one of the driving forces behind the strikes in Hollywood in 2023. But not everyone in the creative industries is against it. Last year, publisher Harper Collins reached an agreement with an unnamed technology company to allow \"limited use of select non-fiction backlist titles\" for training AI models. And in 2023, award-winning crime author Ajay Chowdhury told Sky News he was embracing the technology. AI law in the UK - what is happening? A consultation on AI copyright law in the UK ended in February. Under the plans, an exemption to copyright would be created for training AI, so tech firms would not need a licence to use copyrighted material - and creators would need to opt out to prevent their work from being used. A government spokesperson said at the time that the UK's current regime for copyright and AI was \"holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\". No changes will be made \"until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives, including increased control for rights holders to help them easily license their content, enabling lawful access to material to train world-leading AI models in the UK, and building greater transparency over material being used\", the spokesperson said. But plenty of authors and others in the creative industries are not convinced. \"It just leaves the door open for so much exploitation of people's rights, people's data and their work,\" says Coleman. \"I would really urge the government to think again about this and to protect what is a jewel in the crown of British cultural identity - to do the right thing.\""

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Grand Theft Auto VI is the most anticipated game of the year. The long-awaited sequel by developer Rockstar Games is expected in the autumn - 12 years on from the record-breaking GTA V. While gamers excitedly await its release, the industry itself is buzzing with anticipation over rumblings the base game could command a premium $100 (about £80) price point and still achieve colossal sales. Setting this precedent could lead to other game publishers wanting a slice of the action by increasing their own starting prices. However, the GTA series boasts two winning ingredients that some other games do not have - brand power and fan loyalty. Expert research analyst Michael Pachter told Sky News he believes Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive Software will be able to charge $100 with little complaint. Mr Pachter, a managing director at US-based Wedbush Securities, highlighted the rising cost of entertainment since GTA V was released in September 2013. \n                  Pizza Hut franchisee in Scotland accused of 'wage theft' as workers stage protest\n                 \n                  Major investigation into ongoing gang feud which has seen properties firebombed and shots fired in Edinburgh streets\n                 \n                  Tour de France returning to the UK in 2027\n                 He said: \"Realistically, video games are the only form of entertainment that hasn't kept up pricing with inflation. \"Look at movie tickets, concerts, Disneyland, video on demand (VOD) - all have doubled.\" Mr Pachter said the key to \"charging\" more is to justify the value to the consumer. He explained: \"I expect GTA VI to be fully integrated with GTA Online, and Rockstar can offer premium edition purchasers $100-worth of in-game items - currency, skins, vehicles, weapons, etc - as a trade-off for the higher price point. \"The level of integration will make the in-game items more valuable, and I don't expect a lot of pushback. \"I think $100 or so makes sense, and don't expect that we will ever see a $500 game.\" If history repeats itself, GTA Online will be the moneymaker. The persistent online world offers endless monetisation opportunities - with gamers enticed to splash out on new vehicles, weapons, properties, businesses and cosmetic upgrades. Mr Pachter said GTA VI's integration with its online offering provides an \"excuse\" for engaged players to spend more money. He added: \"Some players will spend an additional $500 and most won't, but those who spend more than $100 will do so if they perceive there is value derived from the purchase.\" The GTA series - which was created in Dundee, Scotland - is one of the biggest franchises in the industry. GTA V became the fastest entertainment product in history to make $1bn (in its first three days) and has since sold more than 210 million copies worldwide. Developer Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), based in Edinburgh, has achieved additional success by collaborating with fellow studio Rockstar San Diego on the Red Dead Redemption games. Read more from Sky News:The impact and legacy of Rockstar's biggest gameThe 'geeky' hobby that's a billion-pound industry When GTA V made its debut, it launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That was two consoles ago, with the new game set to arrive via PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. AAA (Triple-A) games - big budget, high-profile productions - are now taking longer to make as gamers demand seamless multiplayer experiences, cross-device gaming capabilities, visually impressive graphics, and fully immersive storylines. From the GTA VI trailer footage, players will be returning to the Miami-flavoured metropolis of Vice City in the fictional state of Leonida. The Bonnie and Clyde-style story is set to include the first playable female character in the series' history. GTA has always poked fun at American culture, with the nation's past decade of politics like something out of the game. GTA VI looks certain to continue the series' tradition of satire, but the trailer also shows that no expense has been spared in regards to bringing the sun-soaked streets of Vice City to life. The cost of creating a game can vary widely based on a multitude of factors, including the studio size, staff skill level, and development time. Given the size of Rockstar's workforce and the number of years the game has been in development, Mr Pachter believes the cost of GTA VI \"is highly likely to be nearly $1bn\". Mr Pachter said: \"They spent this much time because they can, and the scope of the game is typically immense.\" Rockstar has so far remained tight-lipped over its budget and whether GTA VI is indeed the most expensive video game ever made. Scotland reporter The gateway toy that sparked my love for gaming was the Tomytronic Shark Attack 3D device. It was the early 1980s and I’d received the binocular-style game for Christmas. I soon upgraded to the ZX Spectrum, and as the years have passed I’ve been fortunate to enjoy many of the consoles released via Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox. Let me be clear, I’m a console gamer. If I had the spare money and patience, maybe I would build my own gaming PC – but I don’t see that in my future. I love the GTA series and rank Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire, Bully (Canis Canem Edit) and The Warriors amongst my top favourites. Although the GTA games are meant for adults, I expect many youths across the UK will either want it on day one or will add it to their Christmas list. Rolling back to when I was in primary school, I was able to borrow ZX Spectrum games from the local library. My friends and I would share these around between ourselves, and in later years we would continue to swap our own Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox games. This meant that someone like myself – who didn’t come from money – was able to play a game I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford. I highlight this because some of the newer consoles don’t have a disc drive, and most games are now bought and downloaded digitally. I certainly don’t begrudge the price of video games rising to ensure a good quality product, but by making it more difficult to share them with friends is a hindrance. With the cost of living crisis affecting households right across the UK, there may be parents who do not have the money to buy a new game on release or even while on sale for their children. Speaking from experience, some of my greatest gaming nights have been round at friends’ houses watching them play their new game while having a little go myself. You see, that’s the beauty of the gaming community – it’s a supportive sharing space where we want to see everyone join in on the fun.

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The television production company founded by broadcaster Jake Humphrey and former racing driver David Coulthard is in talks with potential buyers about a sale. Sky News has learnt that Whisper Group, which was established in 2010 and won a BAFTA for its coverage of the Women's Euros in 2022, is working with advisers on a deal. The company is said to be open to a range of options, including the sale of a majority or minority stake to either financial investors or a strategic buyer. Corporate financiers at KPMG are orchestrating talks with potential bidders. Whisper is already 30%-owned by Sony Pictures Television, which acquired the stake in 2020. It replaced Channel 4's Indie Growth Fund as an investor in the business. A majority of the shares in Whisper are owned by its founders and management team. \n                  'I was kicked off a plane for having a nut allergy'\n                 \n                  'Money dysmorphia' searches are rocketing - here are telltale signs you have it\n                 \n                  Britain's shrinking families: An economic 'timebomb'\n                 The company is best-known for its sports productions, and is responsible for Channel 4's Formula One coverage as well as international cricket, boxing and the Paralympics. Whisper employs about 300 people, and has operations in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Riyadh. Its chief executive, Sunil Patel, co-founded the producer alongside Mr Coulthard and Mr Humphrey. It is said to be plotting further expansion in sport in the form of bigger events and rightsholders, as well as in events, where its clients include Red Bull. Whisper is also focused on growing its presence in the US, where it currently works with Tom Brady's Religion of Sport, and the Middle East, where it is partnered with Neom and Saudi Pro League teams. Outside of sports rights, it has produced documentaries about Ben Stokes, the England Test cricket captain, and Sven-Goran Eriksson, the late England football manager. It has also diversified into entertainment programming, producing the Wheel of Fortune gameshow hosted by Graham Norton. Its most recent accounts disclosed a £4.3m pre-tax profit for the year to March 31, 2024. \"Whisper has successful diversified into factual, entertainment and events to complement the wider blend of work across its sports broadcast contracts,\" it said in a statement accompanying the accounts. \"It has been another successful year for contract wins, with a series of renewals with key clients and a new range of significant projects which will help ensure visibility over the next few years.\" The sale process comes as ITV holds talks about a merger of its Studios arm with RedBird IMI-owned All3Media, one of Britain's biggest production companies. A combination of the two businesses could be announced during the spring, according to banking sources. This weekend, a spokesman for Whisper declined to comment."
