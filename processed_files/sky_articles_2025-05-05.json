        "Content": "Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip will be intensive, with troops to remain there for an unspecified length of time. The Israeli prime minister says IDF forces will not launch raids and then abandon territory, \"but the opposite\". The plan includes distributing aid, though supplies will not be let in yet. The Israeli official said the newly approved offensive plan would move Gaza's civilian population southward and keep humanitarian aid from falling into Hamas's hands. On Sunday, the United Nations rejected what it said was a new plan for aid to be distributed in what it described as Israeli hubs. Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Olga Cherevko from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the proposal was \"in contravention of globally-established humanitarian principles\". She warned that the idea could mean \"putting people at greater risk\" and raises the chance of aid \"not getting through to the most vulnerable people\", such as those with mobility issues, who cannot make it to these proposed hubs that would be established\". \n                  Speculation and excitement grow in Rome as papal conclave prepares to choose next pope\n                 \n                  Israel's decision to occupy all of Gaza could mean there will be many more years of fighting to achieve its aims - if it ever will\n                 \n                  Trump latest: I know nothing about Pope Trump picture, says Trump\n                 Ms Chervoko rejected Israeli claims that much of the aid delivered to Gaza was being siphoned off by Hamas and warned her agency was \"rapidly running out of everything\". Asked about the situation in Gaza, she described it as \"absolutely desperate\" as \"almost every day I see people fighting over water, fighting over food\". It comes as the blockade of Gaza continues, despite international outcry and the devastating humanitarian situation inside. Israeli cabinet ministers approved plans for the new offensive on Monday morning, hours after it was announced that tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are being called up. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far failed to achieve his goal of destroying Hamas or returning all the hostages, despite more than a year of brutal war in Gaza. Officials say the plan will help with these war aims, but it would also push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis. They said the plan included the \"capturing of the strip and the holding of territories\". It would also try to prevent Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid, which Israel says strengthens the group's rule in Gaza. The UN rejected the plan, saying it would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said it \"appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic - as part of a military strategy\".

        "Content": "\n          Middle East correspondent\n              @AliBunkallSKY\n Israel's decision to expand military operations inside Gaza is a significant development with perhaps permanent consequences for the future of the Strip and the two million Palestinians who live there. Firstly, it illustrates a failure by Israel to achieve its goals so far. Renewed fighting hasn't forced Hamas to surrender, nor has it resulted in the release of more hostages. The cabinet has decided that the most likely way to succeed, is to increase the military pressure. One Israeli official explained the shift in strategy to me as away from \"clear and leave\" to one of \"clear and hold\". That is a military tactic used by Western forces in the past, by the US and British in parts of Iraq and Afghanistan for example. Much can be said in criticism of those wars, but the allied intention was never to permanently occupy either of those countries. We cannot confidently say the same in respect to Gaza. Israeli commentators today are divided in their opinion of whether the plan is to conquer and hold all of Gaza or just large swathes of it. \n                  Israeli pilots' protest letter reveals deepening rift over ongoing war in Gaza\n                 \n                  Recording reveals details about IDF arrest of Gaza paramedic after aid attack\n                 \n                  Ship carrying aid for Gaza bombed by drones, as NGO points finger at Israel\n                 Also unclear is how long the \"hold\" element will be: until the hostages are released? Until Hamas is no longer able to fight? Or permanent. Sources have told me that's yet to be defined, but the latter - a permanent Israeli occupation of Gaza - is no longer an unrealistic or unthinkable prospect.  Read more:Israeli pilots' letter reveals deepening riftSeriously ill children from Gaza allowed into UK President Trump's announcement in February that America should \"own\" and redevelop Gaza, with all Palestinians forced to leave was extraordinary but could, to some extent, be dismissed coming from a President that doesn't have the patience or time span to achieve something so complex and controversial. What it did do, however, was legitimise a dream that some in the Israeli government hold. Discussions are reportedly taking place with a number of countries to rehouse Gazans. The Israeli government says it intends to push Gazans into the south of the strip, to give it freedom to operate elsewhere. It's not too much of a stretch to envisage a situation where the population is moved into the Rafah area on the border with Egypt, Rafah would then effectively become an enclave within Gaza and the responsibility of aid distribution becomes Cairo's problem. Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement last week, that the goal of \"supreme victory\" is now the defeat of Hamas, not the return the hostages, effectively ends any hope for a permanent ceasefire in the short term. The implication is that even were Hamas to release all the remaining 59 hostages tomorrow, Israel's war in Gaza would not be over. Furthermore, if Israel is committed to the total defeat of Hamas, as opposed to a political solution that sees Hamas leaders leave Gaza and the group disarmed for example, then that is an ambition that could take many more years of fighting to realise, if ever; just imagine how many young Gazans have been radicalised as a result of the last eighteen months of war. We cannot, confidently, say where this will all go. There remains some small hope that Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar later this month will push the sides towards a new agreement but the 'day after' in Gaza has retreated over an ever-retreating horizon and the only certainty now seems to be increased fighting for many months to come."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n The cardinals have arrived, the finishing touches are being made; Vatican City is preparing for an election like no other. On Wednesday, the papal conclave begins and many visitors to St Peter's Square already have a clear view on what they would like the outcome to be. \"I want a liberal pope,\" says Joyce who has travelled to Rome from the US. \"My number one is Pierbattista Pizzaballa,\" says blogger Teodorita Giovannella referencing the 60-year-old Italian cardinal. Rome resident Michele Rapinesi thinks the next pope will be the Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, who was Pope Francis' number two. Although the job of selecting the next pontiff lies with 133 cardinal electors, Ms Giovannella and Mr Rapinesi are among 75,000 Italians playing an online game trying to predict who they'll pick. Fantapapa is a similar format to fantasy football, but teams are made up of prospective pontiffs. \n                  How does the Sistine Chapel prepare for conclave?\n                 \n                  When does conclave start and how does it work?\n                 \n                  Who could be the next pope?\n                 Ms Giovannella has chosen three popular Italians as her favourites: Cardinals Pizzaballa, Zuppi and Parolin. After 47 years she wants an Italian pope but believes an Asian or African would be a good \"plot twist\". Despite the growing speculation and excitement, for the cardinal electors the papal conclave is the serious and sombre process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion followers. To keep the vote secret, they are locked in the Sistine Chapel which has been swept for hidden cameras, recording equipment and bugs. The windows are covered to keep the outside world out and to stop drones from spying. Mobile phones are banned and signal jammers have been installed to help stop any information being leaked. Ballots are burned after they are cast and a plume of coloured smoke shows people if a new pope has been chosen. Read more:How Pope Francis heralded a new kind of leadership for Catholic ChurchWhen does conclave start and how does it work?How does the Sistine Chapel prepare for conclave? The cardinal who is elected will become one of the most powerful men in the world and will set the course for the Catholic Church for years to come, making decisions which will affect the lives of millions of people worldwide. Pope Francis' 12-year reign pulled the church in a more progressive direction. His fight for migrants and climate change made him a muse for Roman street artist Mauro Pallotta. He met him five times and painted more than 30 pictures of him, celebrating his life on the walls of Rome. One shows Francis with a catapult shooting out hearts. \"It depicts the strong love he had for people,\" Mr Pallotta explains. In another, he wears a cape and is depicted as a superhero. \"I hope the new pope continues the way of Pope Francis and remembers the poor people of the world,\" he says. Whether the next pontiff is another pope of the people, a progressive or conservative will soon be decided by the cardinals. Their choice will determine if the Catholic Church continues down the route set by Francis or takes a different path."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n At Sony Production studios in Culver City, an area of Los Angeles steeped in the movie business, a steady stream of cars and lorries comes and goes through the security gate. It occupies the MGM lot which dates back to 1924. Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz and Citizen Kane were shot here and, more recently, Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises. But this is no longer the beating heart of movie making. In Tinsel Town the bright lights of the film industry have been fading for some time. Production in Hollywood has fallen by 40% in the last decade, sometimes moving to other states like New Mexico, New York and Georgia, but more often outside the US entirely. A recent survey of film and TV executives indicates that Britain, Australia and Canada are now favoured locations over California when it comes to making movies. San Andreas, a blockbuster film about a California earthquake, was shot in Australia. In America, a film about an Irish family settling in New York, was shot in Canada. Trump's movie tariff could deal knock-out blow to UK film industry, union says The exodus of the film industry from Hollywood is mostly owing to economic reasons, with other countries boasting lower labour costs and more expansive tax incentives. But as productions have moved overseas, studios across Los Angeles are frequently empty and those who work behind the scenes are often out of work. \n                  iPhones sold in US will no longer come from China - as Apple reveals impact of Trump's tariffs\n                 \n                  Trump's trade war could ease the squeeze on household finances\n                 \n                  'De minimis': The rarely examined trade clause about to become a very big deal\n                 President Trump has approached this problem with a familiar reaction - sweeping tariffs, a 100% tariff on all foreign made films coming into the USA. 'It's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas' Justine Bateman is a filmmaker and sister of actor Jason Bateman. She is glad Trump is looking for solutions but does not understand how the tariffs will work. \"I will say, I'm very glad to hear that President Trump is interested in helping the film business. But part of the problem is we just don't have very much detail, do we?,\" she says. \"He's made this big announcement, but we don't have the detail to really mull over. He doesn't even say whether it's going to be films that are shown in the cinema or streaming movies, for example. \"Tariffs can be a profitable situation for when we're just talking about hard goods, but something like a film and, particularly if you've got an American film that takes place in the south of France, you want to be in a particular location. \"So it's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas and bringing them back here.\" At the Hand Prop Room in Los Angeles, they supply props for TV and film. The warehouse is brimful of virtually any prop you could imagine, from portraits of former presidents, to replica handguns to African artefacts and 18th century teapots. The walls are decorated with posters from some of the productions they've supplied, including Babylon, Oppenheimer and Ghostbusters. 'It needs to be thought through' In the past five years, the prop shop has been impacted by the COVID pandemic, by both the writers' and actors' strikes and the globalisation of the film industry. Business is at an all time low. \"It's not helping when so many productions are not just leaving the state, but also leaving the country,\" says Reynaldo Castillo, the general manager of the Hand Prop Room. \"It's Hollywood, we have the infrastructure that nobody else has and I think maybe to a certain point we took it for granted. \"I think we can all agree that we want more filming to stay in the country to help promote jobs. But you also don't want to do something to hurt it. \"How does it work? Are there exceptions for X, Y, and Z? What about independent movies that have small budgets that are shot somewhere else that would destroy their ability to make something? It needs to be thought through and make sure it's implemented the right way.\""

Since Queen Elizabeth II's death, it is the first VE Day event without a member of the royal family who also waved to crowds from the balcony in 1945. The King stood to salute as personnel from Allied countries, including the US, Germany, and France, joined 1,300 members of the UK armed forces in a march towards Buckingham Palace. Crowds also gathered near the Cenotaph - draped in a Union Flag - and fell silent as Big Ben struck 12 o'clock. \n                  'The least we could do': Why King's VE Day message to veterans is very personal\n                 \n                  VE Day in pictures: The Royal Family, huge crowds, a military parade and a flypast\n                 \n                  Royal Family 'fully focused' on VE Day, palace aide says after Prince Harry's interview\n                  Actor Timothy Spall read extracts from Sir Winston's rousing victory speech from beneath the wartime leader's statue. More than 30 Second World War veterans attended the celebrations, which included a street party in Downing Street and a tea party inside Buckingham Palace. Prince George and his mother were pictured speaking to veterans inside the palace, with the King appearing in good spirits as he chatted to guests.  Monday's parade was officially started by RAF veteran Alan Kennett, 100, who in 1945 was in a cinema in Germany when a soldier drove a jeep inside and shouted: \"The war is over.\" The Royal Horse Artillery led the march down Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall, while members of the Ukrainian military were also cheered and clapped. Prince Louis was seen fiddling with his hair in the breezy conditions, apparently mimicking Prince George at one point, while the Princess of Wales sat next to veteran Bernard Morgan.  The King's balcony appearance was his first in public since Prince Harry said his father wouldn't speak to him, and he didn't know how much longer he had left. However, a Palace aide insisted the royals were \"fully focused\" on VE Day events after Harry's shock interview. VE Day in 1945 marked the end of almost six years of war in Europe, in which 384,000 British soldiers and 70,000 civilians were killed. It sparked two days of joyous celebrations in London - with an estimated one million people packing the centre of the capital. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in an open letter to veterans: \"VE Day is a chance to acknowledge, again, that our debt to those who achieved it can never fully be repaid.\" Read more:VE Day commemorations - In picturesHow people celebrated in 1945WWII codebreaker recalls chance encounter with ChurchillVE Day celebrations - what's planned Along with the events in London, people are celebrating across the UK with street parties, tea parties and 1940s fancy dress-ups.

In last week's local elections, Reform UK gained control of 10 councils, two mayoralties and won more than 500 council seats. And after saying last week they want to end all diversity and equality hire roles, another policy was announced this morning by party chairman Zia Yusuf. Politics latest: Follow live updates He said on social media that Reform-controlled councils will move \"at speed\" to ensure the only flag that will be flown on public authority buildings \"will be the Union Jack and the St George's flag\". He added: \"No other flags will be permitted to be flown on flag-poles, balconies, reception desks or council-chamber walls.\" The announcement quickly drew criticism from across the political divide - including from Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Labour MPs, including Dover and Deal's Mike Tapp, said this would stop councils flying the Ukrainian flag. Mr Tapp said: \"Reform are to ban the flying of Ukrainian flags from public buildings. A gesture of solidarity we see across the whole country.\" He then branded the party: \"Putin's puppets.\" This is an attack line often used by the prime minister in Prime Minister's Questions, with Sir Keir Starmer accusing Nigel Farage of \"fawning\" over the Russian leader. During last year's election campaign, the Reform leader reiterated his belief that the West and NATO had \"provoked\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine - though said it was \"of course\" Vladimir Putin's \"fault\". In 2014, he said Mr Putin was the statesman he most admired.  Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, proceeded to mock Mr Tapp on social media, replying with a series of water drop emojis and saying \"drip, drip, drip\" - adding: \"Oh, it's the Tapp again\". However, the loudest criticism came from the Conservative ranks. Councillors and MPs attacked Reform's policy for potentially stopping regional flags like that of Kent or Yorkshire from being flown. A Reform spokesperson said: \"Reform UK will proudly fly the Union Jack, St George's Flag and County flags. Unlike the Tories and Labour, we are proud of our country and history.\" It is understood that flags with \"national heritage\" will also be allowed.

He said: \"The White Horse has been the symbol of Kent for almost two thousand years. \"The first king of Kent, Hengest, is said to have used the flag as he and his brother, Horsa, conquered their new kingdom. \"Denying our flag is denying our history.\" Dr Luke Evans, the Conservative MP for Hinckley and Bosworth, asked on social media if Reform would allow the Leicestershire county flag to fly. Similar comments were made by Tory councillors on social media, as well as some Liberal Democrats. The war of words comes after the Conservatives and Labour both suffered heavily at the hands of Reform in last week's local elections, as well as the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 As well as flags belonging to other countries, the measure will also prevent councils controlled by Reform from flying flags associated with movements, causes or anything else - for example the Pride flag. A Reform source said: \"The Tories seem more upset about Reform councils flying the union flag than their councils flying the trans flag. It sums up the state of the Tory party, the sooner they're consigned to the dustbin of history, the better.\""

        "Headline": "Jurors are being picked to hear the trial of rap star Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. The 55-year-old has pleaded not guilty and strenuously denied all allegations against him",
        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has begun, with the process to pick the jurors who will determine his fate now under way. Combs, wearing a white shirt with a black crew-neck sweater, grey trousers and glasses, his hair and goatee now grey, hugged and shook hands with all his lawyers as he arrived at the federal courtroom in Manhattan, New York, for the start of the proceedings. The 55-year-old has been held in detention in Brooklyn since he was arrested and charged in September 2024, accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, said all his sexual relationships and encounters were consensual, and strenuously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the jury selection process is expected to last all this week, with opening statements by the lawyers set to begin next week. Unlike some other high-profile trials in the US, this one won't be broadcast live because federal courtrooms, unlike some state courtrooms, don't allow electronic recordings inside. Judge Arun Subramanian started proceedings shortly after 9am on Monday (2pm UK time), first making several rulings on what issues experts will be allowed to testify on when they take to the witness stand. He then gave an overview of the case and began the questioning of prospective jurors one by one - a process known as \"voir dire\" - with the aim of finding a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who can be fair and impartial despite heavy media coverage of the case. Read more:Diddy on trial: Everything you need to knowSean Combs: A timeline of allegations Jurors are being asked if they have any views on the prosecution or the defence, if they or someone close to them has been a victim of crime, and their beliefs on hiring sex workers, the use of illegal drugs, hip-hop artists and law enforcement. They are also being questioned on whether they have heard of names included on a list of individuals, including celebrities, who may be mentioned during the trial. The list is long, the court heard, with the judge saying it reminded him of Lord Of The Rings. What have potential jurors been asked? One prospective juror said they had heard of actors Michael B Jordan and Mike Myers, but this would not prevent them being fair and impartial should they be selected. Another said they had heard of Kanye West. The context in which Jordan, Myers, West and other people may be mentioned is not yet known. Other names that came up included Aubrey O'Day and Dawn Richard - former members of girl group Danity Kane, who were signed to Bad Boy - and singer Michelle Williams. Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports about Combs, and one prospective juror described a still image she had seen as \"damning evidence\". She was rejected from consideration. Another potential juror was excluded because she said a family member had experienced something that made them feel uncomfortable about hearing the case. At one point during proceedings, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: \"I'm sorry your honour, I'm a little nervous today.\" One potential juror said they had seen a joke on social media about baby oil authorities say they found in Combs' residences during searches in March 2024. They said they could remain impartial. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, Combs appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no, to his attorneys. What is Combs accused of? In the indictment listing the formal charges against the rapper, he is accused of a pattern of abusive behavior over two decades, allegedly with the help of people in his entourage. Prosecutors say he manipulated women into participating in drug-fuelled sexual performances with male sex workers, which he called \"Freak Offs\". Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts, including beatings, kidnapping and arson, when he didn't get his way, they allege. Lawyers for Combs say any group sex was consensual, that there was no coercion involved, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.  The Cassie video One issue likely to be featured in the trial is an incident in 2016, when a security camera recorded Combs allegedly kicking and hitting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Cassie filed a lawsuit in November 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape, but the case was settled the following day. The hotel footage emerged in May 2024. Shortly afterwards, Combs released a video apology, saying his behaviour in the video was at a time when he had \"hit rock bottom\" but nonetheless was \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"disgusted\" with himself. One of his lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, has said Combs was \"not a perfect person\" and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual. Jury selection continues today and throughout this week, with the trial expected to last about eight weeks."

Five others from the British Supersport race were taken to the track's medical centre but didn't need hospital treatment.

It said there was a \"chain reaction\" with 11 riders coming off their bikes. \"Due to the extreme severity of the incident and ongoing medical intervention, the remainder of the Bennetts British Superbike Championship event was cancelled,\" organisers said in a statement.

        "Content": " The Royal Family watched a flypast from the Buckingham Palace balcony to mark the start of four days of celebrations for the 80th anniversary of VE Day.  Thousands gathered in front of the palace and on The Mall as the Red Arrows and other RAF planes flew over. The King and Queen were joined by the Prince and Princess of Wales, their three children, and other senior royals.As it happened - Royals take part in VE Day celebrations  Monday is the first day of commemorations of the moment Sir Winston Churchill declared on 8 May, 80 years ago, that all Nazi forces had surrendered. Since Queen Elizabeth II's death, it is the first VE Day event without a member of the royal family who also waved to crowds from the balcony in 1945. The King stood to salute as personnel from Allied countries, including the US, Germany, and France, joined 1,300 members of the UK armed forces in a march towards Buckingham Palace. Crowds also gathered near the Cenotaph - draped in a Union Flag - and fell silent as Big Ben struck 12 o'clock. \n                  'The least we could do': Why King's VE Day message to veterans is very personal\n                 \n                  VE Day in pictures: The Royal Family, huge crowds, a military parade and a flypast\n                 \n                  Royal Family 'fully focused' on VE Day, palace aide says after Prince Harry's interview\n                  Actor Timothy Spall read extracts from Sir Winston's rousing victory speech from beneath the wartime leader's statue. More than 30 Second World War veterans attended the celebrations, which included a street party in Downing Street and a tea party inside Buckingham Palace. Prince George and his mother were pictured speaking to veterans inside the palace, with the King appearing in good spirits as he chatted to guests.  Monday's parade was officially started by RAF veteran Alan Kennett, 100, who in 1945 was in a cinema in Germany when a soldier drove a jeep inside and shouted: \"The war is over.\" The Royal Horse Artillery led the march down Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall, while members of the Ukrainian military were also cheered and clapped. Prince Louis was seen fiddling with his hair in the breezy conditions, apparently mimicking Prince George at one point, while the Princess of Wales sat next to veteran Bernard Morgan.  The King's balcony appearance was his first in public since Prince Harry said his father wouldn't speak to him, and he didn't know how much longer he had left. However, a Palace aide insisted the royals were \"fully focused\" on VE Day events after Harry's shock interview. VE Day in 1945 marked the end of almost six years of war in Europe, in which 384,000 British soldiers and 70,000 civilians were killed. It sparked two days of joyous celebrations in London - with an estimated one million people packing the centre of the capital. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in an open letter to veterans: \"VE Day is a chance to acknowledge, again, that our debt to those who achieved it can never fully be repaid.\" Read more:VE Day commemorations - In picturesHow people celebrated in 1945WWII codebreaker recalls chance encounter with ChurchillVE Day celebrations - what's planned Along with the events in London, people are celebrating across the UK with street parties, tea parties and 1940s fancy dress-ups. The Palace of Westminster, the Shard, Lowther Castle in Penrith, Manchester Printworks, Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall are among hundreds of buildings which will be lit up from 9pm on Tuesday. A new display of almost 30,000 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London will form another tribute. On Thursday, a service at Westminster Abbey will begin with a two-minute silence before Horse Guards Parade holds a concert to round off the commemorations. Churches and cathedrals across the country will ring their bells as a collective act of thanksgiving at 6.30pm, echoing the sounds that swept across the country in 1945. Pubs and bars have also been granted permission to stay open for longer to mark the anniversary - two extra hours past 11pm."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's plan to put a 100% tariff on films made outside the US could be \"a knock-out blow\" to the sector in the UK, a broadcasting union has said. The president has said he will target films made elsewhere as part of his ongoing tariff war, to save what he has called the \"dying\" movie industry in the US. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said he had authorised government departments to put a 100% tariff \"on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands\", and described the issue as a \"national security threat\". Responding to his post, Philippa Childs, head of the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU), said such a move could seriously damage the UK film sector - which is \"only just recovering\" from the impact of the pandemic, when many productions were delayed or cancelled. \"The UK is a world leader in film and TV production, employing thousands of talented workers, and this is a key growth sector in the government's industrial strategy,\" she said. \"These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\" Ms Childs called on the government to \"move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest\". It is unclear how the tariff scheme would affect international productions, such as the upcoming Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, which is filmed in the US as well as other countries around the world. Much of the 2023 box office smash Barbie was filmed at the Warner Bros Leavesden studios, in Hertfordshire, as was Wonka and 2022 hit The Batman, while the vast majority of James Bond films were shot at Pinewood Studios, in Berkshire. It was also unclear whether the duties will apply to films on streaming platforms as well as those that are released in cinemas. Netflix shares were down 2.5% in early trading and Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Universal-owner Comcast (which owns Sky News) fell between 0.7% and 1.7%. The share prices of theatre operators Cinemark and IMAX were down 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, said Mr Trump was \"right to address the fact that there's a decline in the entertainment sector\" - but the issue is not foreign films taking precedence over domestic films. \"It's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places... the unions, the lower cost of labour, and buying budgets have been drastically reduced over two years, all driven by the change in viewing habits.\" She also highlighted that people aren't going to the cinema as much and that the industry is \"entirely changed\" due to the rise of social media platforms and content creators. \"The answer is not tariffs if he's trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood,\" she said. \"It's developing an ecosystem for film-making that is entirely different to what has been before. There's seismic changes in how the entertainment industry is structured needing to happen.\" A government spokesperson said talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK were ongoing - \"but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest\". The latest tariff announcement from Mr Trump is part of a wider crackdown on US imports. In a news conference outside the White House in April, he outlined a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with varying levies allocated - later increasing the tariff on Chinese goods to 145%. US film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the Hollywood strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area, as well as the pandemic. Last year, the UK government introduced the Independent Film Tax Credit, which allows productions costing up to £15m to benefit from an increased tax relief of 53%."

The Met said in a statement on Monday: \"As part of the proactive Counter Terrorism Policing investigation into a suspected terrorist plot, a man was arrested in the Stockport area on Saturday, 3 May. \"During the course of that particular arrest, three people in the close vicinity appeared to have run away from the location as the officers carried out the arrest.

Sarah Owen-Jones, said her son broke down in tears after being trapped in the local park with his friends as armed officers pounced. The five men arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts include: • A 29-year-old man arrested in the Swindon area• A 46-year-old man arrested in west London• A 29-year-old man arrested in the Stockport area• A 40-year-old man arrested in the Rochdale area• A 24-year-old man arrested in the Manchester area. Police said warrants for further detention have been secured for the first four men, who were held under terrorism laws, meaning they can be detained until Saturday. The 24-year-old man, who was initially detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) has been released on conditional bail until a date in May. Officers are carrying out searches at a number of addresses in the Greater Manchester, London and Swindon areas in connection with the investigation. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of enquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter.\"Police also arrested three further Iranian nationals in London on Saturday as part of another, unrelated counter-terror investigation. The men, aged 39, 44, and 55, were detained under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, which allows police to arrest those suspected of being \"involved in foreign power threat activity\". Further warrants of detention have been obtained, meaning they can be held in custody until 10 May."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       A row has erupted after Reform UK pledged to ban local authorities from flying any flags aside from the Union Jack or the St George's Cross in councils they control. In last week's local elections, Reform UK gained control of 10 councils, two mayoralties and won more than 500 council seats. And after saying last week they want to end all diversity and equality hire roles, another policy was announced this morning by party chairman Zia Yusuf. Politics latest: Follow live updates He said on social media that Reform-controlled councils will move \"at speed\" to ensure the only flag that will be flown on public authority buildings \"will be the Union Jack and the St George's flag\". He added: \"No other flags will be permitted to be flown on flag-poles, balconies, reception desks or council-chamber walls.\" The announcement quickly drew criticism from across the political divide - including from Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Labour MPs, including Dover and Deal's Mike Tapp, said this would stop councils flying the Ukrainian flag. Mr Tapp said: \"Reform are to ban the flying of Ukrainian flags from public buildings. A gesture of solidarity we see across the whole country.\" He then branded the party: \"Putin's puppets.\" This is an attack line often used by the prime minister in Prime Minister's Questions, with Sir Keir Starmer accusing Nigel Farage of \"fawning\" over the Russian leader. During last year's election campaign, the Reform leader reiterated his belief that the West and NATO had \"provoked\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine - though said it was \"of course\" Vladimir Putin's \"fault\". In 2014, he said Mr Putin was the statesman he most admired.  Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, proceeded to mock Mr Tapp on social media, replying with a series of water drop emojis and saying \"drip, drip, drip\" - adding: \"Oh, it's the Tapp again\". However, the loudest criticism came from the Conservative ranks. Councillors and MPs attacked Reform's policy for potentially stopping regional flags like that of Kent or Yorkshire from being flown. A Reform spokesperson said: \"Reform UK will proudly fly the Union Jack, St George's Flag and County flags. Unlike the Tories and Labour, we are proud of our country and history.\" It is understood that flags with \"national heritage\" will also be allowed. Read more:Local election in maps and charts'Feasible' Farage could be next PM Among those criticising Reform was former Tory leadership hopeful Tom Tugendhat, whose constituency is in Kent. He said: \"The White Horse has been the symbol of Kent for almost two thousand years. \"The first king of Kent, Hengest, is said to have used the flag as he and his brother, Horsa, conquered their new kingdom. \"Denying our flag is denying our history.\" Dr Luke Evans, the Conservative MP for Hinckley and Bosworth, asked on social media if Reform would allow the Leicestershire county flag to fly. Similar comments were made by Tory councillors on social media, as well as some Liberal Democrats. The war of words comes after the Conservatives and Labour both suffered heavily at the hands of Reform in last week's local elections, as well as the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 As well as flags belonging to other countries, the measure will also prevent councils controlled by Reform from flying flags associated with movements, causes or anything else - for example the Pride flag. A Reform source said: \"The Tories seem more upset about Reform councils flying the union flag than their councils flying the trans flag. It sums up the state of the Tory party, the sooner they're consigned to the dustbin of history, the better.\""

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @SiobhanRobbins\n The cardinals have arrived, the finishing touches are being made; Vatican City is preparing for an election like no other. On Wednesday, the papal conclave begins and many visitors to St Peter's Square already have a clear view on what they would like the outcome to be. \"I want a liberal pope,\" says Joyce who has travelled to Rome from the US. \"My number one is Pierbattista Pizzaballa,\" says blogger Teodorita Giovannella referencing the 60-year-old Italian cardinal. Rome resident Michele Rapinesi thinks the next pope will be the Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, who was Pope Francis' number two. Although the job of selecting the next pontiff lies with 133 cardinal electors, Ms Giovannella and Mr Rapinesi are among 75,000 Italians playing an online game trying to predict who they'll pick. Fantapapa is a similar format to fantasy football, but teams are made up of prospective pontiffs. \n                  How does the Sistine Chapel prepare for conclave?\n                 \n                  When does conclave start and how does it work?\n                 \n                  Who could be the next pope?\n                 Ms Giovannella has chosen three popular Italians as her favourites: Cardinals Pizzaballa, Zuppi and Parolin. After 47 years she wants an Italian pope but believes an Asian or African would be a good \"plot twist\". Despite the growing speculation and excitement, for the cardinal electors the papal conclave is the serious and sombre process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion followers. To keep the vote secret, they are locked in the Sistine Chapel which has been swept for hidden cameras, recording equipment and bugs. The windows are covered to keep the outside world out and to stop drones from spying. Mobile phones are banned and signal jammers have been installed to help stop any information being leaked. Ballots are burned after they are cast and a plume of coloured smoke shows people if a new pope has been chosen. Read more:How Pope Francis heralded a new kind of leadership for Catholic ChurchWhen does conclave start and how does it work?How does the Sistine Chapel prepare for conclave? The cardinal who is elected will become one of the most powerful men in the world and will set the course for the Catholic Church for years to come, making decisions which will affect the lives of millions of people worldwide. Pope Francis' 12-year reign pulled the church in a more progressive direction. His fight for migrants and climate change made him a muse for Roman street artist Mauro Pallotta. He met him five times and painted more than 30 pictures of him, celebrating his life on the walls of Rome. One shows Francis with a catapult shooting out hearts. \"It depicts the strong love he had for people,\" Mr Pallotta explains. In another, he wears a cape and is depicted as a superhero. \"I hope the new pope continues the way of Pope Francis and remembers the poor people of the world,\" he says. Whether the next pontiff is another pope of the people, a progressive or conservative will soon be decided by the cardinals. Their choice will determine if the Catholic Church continues down the route set by Francis or takes a different path."

        "Content": "Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip will be intensive, with troops to remain there for an unspecified length of time. The Israeli prime minister says IDF forces will not launch raids and then abandon territory, \"but the opposite\". The plan includes distributing aid, though supplies will not be let in yet. The Israeli official said the newly approved offensive plan would move Gaza's civilian population southward and keep humanitarian aid from falling into Hamas's hands. On Sunday, the United Nations rejected what it said was a new plan for aid to be distributed in what it described as Israeli hubs. Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Olga Cherevko from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the proposal was \"in contravention of globally-established humanitarian principles\". She warned that the idea could mean \"putting people at greater risk\" and raises the chance of aid \"not getting through to the most vulnerable people\", such as those with mobility issues, who cannot make it to these proposed hubs that would be established\". \n                  Speculation and excitement grow in Rome as papal conclave prepares to choose next pope\n                 \n                  Israel's decision to occupy all of Gaza could mean there will be many more years of fighting to achieve its aims - if it ever will\n                 \n                  Trump latest: I know nothing about Pope Trump picture, says Trump\n                 Ms Chervoko rejected Israeli claims that much of the aid delivered to Gaza was being siphoned off by Hamas and warned her agency was \"rapidly running out of everything\". Asked about the situation in Gaza, she described it as \"absolutely desperate\" as \"almost every day I see people fighting over water, fighting over food\". It comes as the blockade of Gaza continues, despite international outcry and the devastating humanitarian situation inside. Israeli cabinet ministers approved plans for the new offensive on Monday morning, hours after it was announced that tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are being called up. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far failed to achieve his goal of destroying Hamas or returning all the hostages, despite more than a year of brutal war in Gaza. Officials say the plan will help with these war aims, but it would also push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis. They said the plan included the \"capturing of the strip and the holding of territories\". It would also try to prevent Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid, which Israel says strengthens the group's rule in Gaza. The UN rejected the plan, saying it would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said it \"appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic - as part of a military strategy\".

The cabinet has decided that the most likely way to succeed, is to increase the military pressure. One Israeli official explained the shift in strategy to me as away from \"clear and leave\" to one of \"clear and hold\". That is a military tactic used by Western forces in the past, by the US and British in parts of Iraq and Afghanistan for example. Much can be said in criticism of those wars, but the allied intention was never to permanently occupy either of those countries. We cannot confidently say the same in respect to Gaza. Israeli commentators today are divided in their opinion of whether the plan is to conquer and hold all of Gaza or just large swathes of it. \n                  Israeli pilots' protest letter reveals deepening rift over ongoing war in Gaza\n                 \n                  Recording reveals details about IDF arrest of Gaza paramedic after aid attack\n                 \n                  Ship carrying aid for Gaza bombed by drones, as NGO points finger at Israel\n                 Also unclear is how long the \"hold\" element will be: until the hostages are released? Until Hamas is no longer able to fight? Or permanent. Sources have told me that's yet to be defined, but the latter - a permanent Israeli occupation of Gaza - is no longer an unrealistic or unthinkable prospect.  Read more:Israeli pilots' letter reveals deepening riftSeriously ill children from Gaza allowed into UK President Trump's announcement in February that America should \"own\" and redevelop Gaza, with all Palestinians forced to leave was extraordinary but could, to some extent, be dismissed coming from a President that doesn't have the patience or time span to achieve something so complex and controversial. What it did do, however, was legitimise a dream that some in the Israeli government hold. Discussions are reportedly taking place with a number of countries to rehouse Gazans. The Israeli government says it intends to push Gazans into the south of the strip, to give it freedom to operate elsewhere. It's not too much of a stretch to envisage a situation where the population is moved into the Rafah area on the border with Egypt, Rafah would then effectively become an enclave within Gaza and the responsibility of aid distribution becomes Cairo's problem. Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement last week, that the goal of \"supreme victory\" is now the defeat of Hamas, not the return the hostages, effectively ends any hope for a permanent ceasefire in the short term. The implication is that even were Hamas to release all the remaining 59 hostages tomorrow, Israel's war in Gaza would not be over. Furthermore, if Israel is committed to the total defeat of Hamas, as opposed to a political solution that sees Hamas leaders leave Gaza and the group disarmed for example, then that is an ambition that could take many more years of fighting to realise, if ever; just imagine how many young Gazans have been radicalised as a result of the last eighteen months of war. We cannot, confidently, say where this will all go. There remains some small hope that Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar later this month will push the sides towards a new agreement but the 'day after' in Gaza has retreated over an ever-retreating horizon and the only certainty now seems to be increased fighting for many months to come."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has begun, with the process to pick the jurors who will determine his fate now under way. Combs, wearing a white shirt with a black crew-neck sweater, grey trousers and glasses, his hair and goatee now grey, hugged and shook hands with all his lawyers as he arrived at the federal courtroom in Manhattan, New York, for the start of the proceedings. The 55-year-old has been held in detention in Brooklyn since he was arrested and charged in September 2024, accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, said all his sexual relationships and encounters were consensual, and strenuously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the jury selection process is expected to last all this week, with opening statements by the lawyers set to begin next week. Unlike some other high-profile trials in the US, this one won't be broadcast live because federal courtrooms, unlike some state courtrooms, don't allow electronic recordings inside. Judge Arun Subramanian started proceedings shortly after 9am on Monday (2pm UK time), first making several rulings on what issues experts will be allowed to testify on when they take to the witness stand. He then gave an overview of the case and began the questioning of prospective jurors one by one - a process known as \"voir dire\" - with the aim of finding a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who can be fair and impartial despite heavy media coverage of the case. Read more:Diddy on trial: Everything you need to knowSean Combs: A timeline of allegations Jurors are being asked if they have any views on the prosecution or the defence, if they or someone close to them has been a victim of crime, and their beliefs on hiring sex workers, the use of illegal drugs, hip-hop artists and law enforcement. They are also being questioned on whether they have heard of names included on a list of individuals, including celebrities, who may be mentioned during the trial. The list is long, the court heard, with the judge saying it reminded him of Lord Of The Rings. What have potential jurors been asked? One prospective juror said they had heard of actors Michael B Jordan and Mike Myers, but this would not prevent them being fair and impartial should they be selected. Another said they had heard of Kanye West. The context in which Jordan, Myers, West and other people may be mentioned is not yet known. Other names that came up included Aubrey O'Day and Dawn Richard - former members of girl group Danity Kane, who were signed to Bad Boy - and singer Michelle Williams. Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports about Combs, and one prospective juror described a still image she had seen as \"damning evidence\". She was rejected from consideration. Another potential juror was excluded because she said a family member had experienced something that made them feel uncomfortable about hearing the case. At one point during proceedings, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: \"I'm sorry your honour, I'm a little nervous today.\" One potential juror said they had seen a joke on social media about baby oil authorities say they found in Combs' residences during searches in March 2024. They said they could remain impartial. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, Combs appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no, to his attorneys. What is Combs accused of? In the indictment listing the formal charges against the rapper, he is accused of a pattern of abusive behavior over two decades, allegedly with the help of people in his entourage. Prosecutors say he manipulated women into participating in drug-fuelled sexual performances with male sex workers, which he called \"Freak Offs\". Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts, including beatings, kidnapping and arson, when he didn't get his way, they allege. Lawyers for Combs say any group sex was consensual, that there was no coercion involved, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.  The Cassie video One issue likely to be featured in the trial is an incident in 2016, when a security camera recorded Combs allegedly kicking and hitting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Cassie filed a lawsuit in November 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape, but the case was settled the following day. The hotel footage emerged in May 2024. Shortly afterwards, Combs released a video apology, saying his behaviour in the video was at a time when he had \"hit rock bottom\" but nonetheless was \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"disgusted\" with himself. One of his lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, has said Combs was \"not a perfect person\" and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual. Jury selection continues today and throughout this week, with the trial expected to last about eight weeks."

        "Content": "A hard-right Eurosceptic leader in Romania has emerged as the clear winner in the first round of voting in the country's presidential election re-run. Early on Monday, George Simion was ahead with 41% of the vote, with liberal Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan trailing in second place with 21%. They will meet in a runoff vote on 18 May, where the right-wing leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) is now the heavy favourite. It comes five months after a first attempt to hold the election was cancelled because of alleged Russian interference supposedly in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu. The vote is seen as a test of the rise of Donald Trump-style nationalism within the European Union. A win for Mr Simion would expand the cohort of Eurosceptic leaders in the EU that already includes premiers in Hungary and Slovakia. \"This is not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country,\" the 38-year-old Mr Simion said. \n                  Andrew Tate checks in at police station on return to Romania\n                 \n                  Andrew Tate arrives in US after travel ban was lifted - as Trump says he knows 'nothing about that'\n                 \n                  Thieves use explosives to steal Romanian prehistoric artefacts from Dutch museum\n                 He ran in the first election, but scored only 14% and appears to have enjoyed an upswell of support from the far-right, driven by Mr Georgescu being banned from standing again. Third-place Crin Antonescu conceded defeat and said he believes it is an \"irreversible result.\" Mr Simion secured victory in 36 out of Romania's 47 electoral districts and benefited from a wave of popular anger and dissatisfaction against mainstream leaders. He opposes military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of EU leadership and has previously said he is aligned with Mr Trump's Make America Great Again movement. \"We are a Trumpist party which will govern Romania and which will make Romania a strong partner in NATO and a strong ally of the United States,\" Mr Simion told foreign media shortly before polling stations closed. He appeared alongside Mr Georgescu at a polling station in the Romanian capital on Sunday.

The 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist said: \"A difficult second round is going to follow with the isolationist candidate. It will not be a debate between individuals, it will be a debate between a pro-Western direction for Romania and an anti-Western direction for Romania. \"It is our task to convince Romanians that Romania needs the pro-Western direction and that is what our campaign will focus on, these two weeks.\""

Most of those hurt were as a result of a strike on the al Arbeean Street area, a statement from the health ministry said. Another person was injured on the main airport road, the statement added. The Houthis had initially claimed the attacks were carried out by \"US-British aggression\" but the British Ministry of Defence told Sky News UK forces were not involved. UK forces previously took part in a joint strike on \"a Houthi military target in Yemen\" on 29 April. Meanwhile, according to an Israeli official, the country's newly scaled-up offensive in Gaza could go as far as seizing the entire enclave.

The missile impact left a plume of smoke and briefly caused flights to be halted. Some international carriers cancelled flights to and from Tel Aviv for several days. Four people were said to have suffered minor injuries, according to Israel's paramedic service. The Houthi group also claimed it would impose a \"comprehensive\" aerial blockade on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports. The move came in response to Israel expanding its operations in Gaza. The Iran-aligned Houthis have targeted Israel throughout its war with Hamas, with the group saying it is fighting in solidarity with Palestinians. Most attacks from Yemen are intercepted by Israeli missile defence systems, including the Iron Dome. Gaza offensive Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu's security cabinet reportedly approved a gradual expansion of the country's offensive against Hamas in Gaza, according to Israeli broadcaster Kan. The outlet cited sources with knowledge of the decision. This move, one Israeli official said, could go as far as seizing the entire enclave and it included a new plan for aid distribution. The Israeli military has already begun issuing tens of thousands of call-up orders to its reserve forces as it looks to expand its campaign in the enclave, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said in a statement on Sunday. Since the collapse of an earlier ceasefire agreement in March, Israeli soldiers have been carving out wide buffer zones in Gaza. In the process, they have squeezed Gaza's 2.3 million population into a narrower zone in the centre of the enclave and along the coast. Alongside that, they have blocked aid going into Gaza in an effort to pressure Hamas to negotiate over the release of hostages. Aid groups have warned that the Israeli blockade risks a humanitarian disaster.

This, it was reported, would take place in the designated humanitarian zone in the southern Gaza area of Rafah."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @marthakelner\n At Sony Production studios in Culver City, an area of Los Angeles steeped in the movie business, a steady stream of cars and lorries comes and goes through the security gate. It occupies the MGM lot which dates back to 1924. Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz and Citizen Kane were shot here and, more recently, Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises. But this is no longer the beating heart of movie making. In Tinsel Town the bright lights of the film industry have been fading for some time. Production in Hollywood has fallen by 40% in the last decade, sometimes moving to other states like New Mexico, New York and Georgia, but more often outside the US entirely. A recent survey of film and TV executives indicates that Britain, Australia and Canada are now favoured locations over California when it comes to making movies. San Andreas, a blockbuster film about a California earthquake, was shot in Australia. In America, a film about an Irish family settling in New York, was shot in Canada. Trump's movie tariff could deal knock-out blow to UK film industry, union says The exodus of the film industry from Hollywood is mostly owing to economic reasons, with other countries boasting lower labour costs and more expansive tax incentives. But as productions have moved overseas, studios across Los Angeles are frequently empty and those who work behind the scenes are often out of work. \n                  iPhones sold in US will no longer come from China - as Apple reveals impact of Trump's tariffs\n                 \n                  Trump's trade war could ease the squeeze on household finances\n                 \n                  'De minimis': The rarely examined trade clause about to become a very big deal\n                 President Trump has approached this problem with a familiar reaction - sweeping tariffs, a 100% tariff on all foreign made films coming into the USA. 'It's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas' Justine Bateman is a filmmaker and sister of actor Jason Bateman. She is glad Trump is looking for solutions but does not understand how the tariffs will work. \"I will say, I'm very glad to hear that President Trump is interested in helping the film business. But part of the problem is we just don't have very much detail, do we?,\" she says. \"He's made this big announcement, but we don't have the detail to really mull over. He doesn't even say whether it's going to be films that are shown in the cinema or streaming movies, for example. \"Tariffs can be a profitable situation for when we're just talking about hard goods, but something like a film and, particularly if you've got an American film that takes place in the south of France, you want to be in a particular location. \"So it's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas and bringing them back here.\" At the Hand Prop Room in Los Angeles, they supply props for TV and film. The warehouse is brimful of virtually any prop you could imagine, from portraits of former presidents, to replica handguns to African artefacts and 18th century teapots. The walls are decorated with posters from some of the productions they've supplied, including Babylon, Oppenheimer and Ghostbusters. 'It needs to be thought through' In the past five years, the prop shop has been impacted by the COVID pandemic, by both the writers' and actors' strikes and the globalisation of the film industry. Business is at an all time low. \"It's not helping when so many productions are not just leaving the state, but also leaving the country,\" says Reynaldo Castillo, the general manager of the Hand Prop Room. \"It's Hollywood, we have the infrastructure that nobody else has and I think maybe to a certain point we took it for granted. \"I think we can all agree that we want more filming to stay in the country to help promote jobs. But you also don't want to do something to hurt it. \"How does it work? Are there exceptions for X, Y, and Z? What about independent movies that have small budgets that are shot somewhere else that would destroy their ability to make something? It needs to be thought through and make sure it's implemented the right way.\""

The president has said he will target films made elsewhere as part of his ongoing tariff war, to save what he has called the \"dying\" movie industry in the US. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said he had authorised government departments to put a 100% tariff \"on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands\", and described the issue as a \"national security threat\". Responding to his post, Philippa Childs, head of the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU), said such a move could seriously damage the UK film sector - which is \"only just recovering\" from the impact of the pandemic, when many productions were delayed or cancelled. \"The UK is a world leader in film and TV production, employing thousands of talented workers, and this is a key growth sector in the government's industrial strategy,\" she said. \"These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\" Ms Childs called on the government to \"move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest\". It is unclear how the tariff scheme would affect international productions, such as the upcoming Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, which is filmed in the US as well as other countries around the world. Much of the 2023 box office smash Barbie was filmed at the Warner Bros Leavesden studios, in Hertfordshire, as was Wonka and 2022 hit The Batman, while the vast majority of James Bond films were shot at Pinewood Studios, in Berkshire. It was also unclear whether the duties will apply to films on streaming platforms as well as those that are released in cinemas. Netflix shares were down 2.5% in early trading and Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Universal-owner Comcast (which owns Sky News) fell between 0.7% and 1.7%. The share prices of theatre operators Cinemark and IMAX were down 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, said Mr Trump was \"right to address the fact that there's a decline in the entertainment sector\" - but the issue is not foreign films taking precedence over domestic films. \"It's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places... the unions, the lower cost of labour, and buying budgets have been drastically reduced over two years, all driven by the change in viewing habits.\" She also highlighted that people aren't going to the cinema as much and that the industry is \"entirely changed\" due to the rise of social media platforms and content creators. \"The answer is not tariffs if he's trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood,\" she said. \"It's developing an ecosystem for film-making that is entirely different to what has been before. There's seismic changes in how the entertainment industry is structured needing to happen.\" A government spokesperson said talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK were ongoing - \"but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest\". The latest tariff announcement from Mr Trump is part of a wider crackdown on US imports. In a news conference outside the White House in April, he outlined a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with varying levies allocated - later increasing the tariff on Chinese goods to 145%. US film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the Hollywood strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area, as well as the pandemic. Last year, the UK government introduced the Independent Film Tax Credit, which allows productions costing up to £15m to benefit from an increased tax relief of 53%."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n They say it was impossible to escape from alive (with perhaps one famous exception). Now, Donald Trump wants to reopen Alcatraz prison and fill it with America's \"most ruthless\" criminals.  It has been decades since the last inmate was moved out of the island penitentiary, which is now a major tourist hotspot attracting more than a million visitors a year. But the president says he wants it \"substantially enlarged and rebuilt\" to serve as a \"symbol of law, order and justice\" in his America. What is Alcatraz prison and did anyone ever escape? Located on the island of Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay, just over a mile from the city, the prison dates back to the mid-19th century. It features a three-story building with four main cell blocks as well as a lighthouse that looks out over the bay. The strong currents around the island and cold waters made successful escape nearly impossible - though some did manage to survive the swim to shore. The prison claims that no inmates ever successfully escaped, presumably meaning that nobody ever survived to enjoy their liberty. In the most famous attempt, John Anglin, his brother Clarence and Frank Morris made it out of the prison and into the water. They are believed to have drowned but their bodies were never found, leading to speculation that they survived - a story told in the Hollywood film Escape From Alcatraz. What was it like inside Alcatraz prison? While it was home to some famous names like Al Capone and George 'Machine-Gun' Kelly, the majority of inmates at Alcatraz were sent there from other prisons for flouting the rules or were considered violent and dangerous or escape risks. The average population was only around 260-275 inmates - less than 1% of all those in federal prisons. Inside, prisoners were always in individual cells with a highly structured, monotonous daily routine designed to teach prisoners how to follow rules and regulations. While on the island, inmates only had four rights: food, clothing, shelter and medical care. Everything else was considered a privilege that had to be earned, from working to sending letters to family members. Despite the rigid structure, several inmates actually requested to be moved to Alcatraz, believing the living conditions were better there than elsewhere.  Read more:Trump announces 100% tariff on non-US moviesTrump posts AI image of himself as pope Why did they shut Alcatraz prison? Despite its reputation and secure facilities, Alcatraz closed in March 1963 after 29 years of operation. The reason? Cost. The prison needed an estimated $3-5 million ($31-52m in today's money) for restoration and maintenance work alone to keep the prison open. It was also hugely expensive to run, costing more than three times more per day, per prisoner, than a facility in Atlanta. Because Alcatraz prison is on an island, it had to be entirely supplied with food and fuel by boat. It didn't even have a source of fresh water, so that had to be brought in too. So... what does Trump want to do with it? The announcement came, as they often do, on President Trump's social media: \"I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\" It's the latest salvo in his drive to overhaul how and where federal prisoners and immigration detainees are locked up. Reopening the prison would likely be a hugely complex and expensive operation. But the president says Alcatraz will serve as a \"symbol of law, order and justice\" and it may be that the decision to reopen it is also more about what he thinks it represents, rather than strictly for practical reasons. A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that the agency \"will comply with all Presidential Orders\"."

        "Headline": "Jurors are being picked to hear the trial of rap star Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. The 55-year-old has pleaded not guilty and strenuously denied all allegations against him",
        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has begun, with the process to pick the jurors who will determine his fate now under way. Combs, wearing a white shirt with a black crew-neck sweater, grey trousers and glasses, his hair and goatee now grey, hugged and shook hands with all his lawyers as he arrived at the federal courtroom in Manhattan, New York, for the start of the proceedings. The 55-year-old has been held in detention in Brooklyn since he was arrested and charged in September 2024, accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, said all his sexual relationships and encounters were consensual, and strenuously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the jury selection process is expected to last all this week, with opening statements by the lawyers set to begin next week. Unlike some other high-profile trials in the US, this one won't be broadcast live because federal courtrooms, unlike some state courtrooms, don't allow electronic recordings inside. Judge Arun Subramanian started proceedings shortly after 9am on Monday (2pm UK time), first making several rulings on what issues experts will be allowed to testify on when they take to the witness stand. He then gave an overview of the case and began the questioning of prospective jurors one by one - a process known as \"voir dire\" - with the aim of finding a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who can be fair and impartial despite heavy media coverage of the case. Read more:Diddy on trial: Everything you need to knowSean Combs: A timeline of allegations Jurors are being asked if they have any views on the prosecution or the defence, if they or someone close to them has been a victim of crime, and their beliefs on hiring sex workers, the use of illegal drugs, hip-hop artists and law enforcement. They are also being questioned on whether they have heard of names included on a list of individuals, including celebrities, who may be mentioned during the trial. The list is long, the court heard, with the judge saying it reminded him of Lord Of The Rings. What have potential jurors been asked? One prospective juror said they had heard of actors Michael B Jordan and Mike Myers, but this would not prevent them being fair and impartial should they be selected. Another said they had heard of Kanye West. The context in which Jordan, Myers, West and other people may be mentioned is not yet known. Other names that came up included Aubrey O'Day and Dawn Richard - former members of girl group Danity Kane, who were signed to Bad Boy - and singer Michelle Williams. Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports about Combs, and one prospective juror described a still image she had seen as \"damning evidence\". She was rejected from consideration. Another potential juror was excluded because she said a family member had experienced something that made them feel uncomfortable about hearing the case. At one point during proceedings, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: \"I'm sorry your honour, I'm a little nervous today.\" One potential juror said they had seen a joke on social media about baby oil authorities say they found in Combs' residences during searches in March 2024. They said they could remain impartial. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, Combs appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no, to his attorneys. What is Combs accused of? In the indictment listing the formal charges against the rapper, he is accused of a pattern of abusive behavior over two decades, allegedly with the help of people in his entourage. Prosecutors say he manipulated women into participating in drug-fuelled sexual performances with male sex workers, which he called \"Freak Offs\". Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts, including beatings, kidnapping and arson, when he didn't get his way, they allege. Lawyers for Combs say any group sex was consensual, that there was no coercion involved, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.  The Cassie video One issue likely to be featured in the trial is an incident in 2016, when a security camera recorded Combs allegedly kicking and hitting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Cassie filed a lawsuit in November 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape, but the case was settled the following day. The hotel footage emerged in May 2024. Shortly afterwards, Combs released a video apology, saying his behaviour in the video was at a time when he had \"hit rock bottom\" but nonetheless was \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"disgusted\" with himself. One of his lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, has said Combs was \"not a perfect person\" and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual. Jury selection continues today and throughout this week, with the trial expected to last about eight weeks."

        "Content": "The former vice president of the United States, Mike Pence, has been handed a courage award for his January 6 actions. Mr Pence was awarded the John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Sunday for refusing to go along with President Donald Trump's attempts to stay in office after he lost the 2020 election. The former VP said the US constitution was what \"binds us all together\" and that Americans had to \"find common ground\". The award recognises Mr Pence \"for putting his life and career on the line\", the JFK Library Foundation said. During his 10-minute speech, Mr Pence said he hoped his presence at the ceremony was \"a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the constitution is the common ground on which we stand\". While he made several references to the Trump administration, he made no mention of Mr Trump himself.

On 6 January 2021, Mr Trump pressured Mr Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the result was illegitimate. Mr Pence refused and narrowly avoided a confrontation with a mob of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol building, some of whom chanted that they wanted to \"hang Mike Pence\". President Trump wrote on X at the time that Mr Pence \"didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution\". Mr Pence rejected advice from the Secret Service that he leave the Capitol and instead stayed to continue the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. In his address on Sunday, Mr Pence said what happened that day was \"tragic\", but that it became \"a triumph of freedom\".

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, is kicking off a search for its next chairman, months after it completed the biggest takeover deal in its 142-year history. Sky News has learnt that Nationwide is working with headhunters to identify a successor to Kevin Parry, who has chaired the mutual since 2022. Mr Parry has been on the building society's board since 2016, meaning he is 'timed out' under the corporate governance guidelines applied to listed companies. Although owned by its 16m members rather than listed on the public markets, Nationwide adheres to comparable governance principles. One of Britain's biggest high street financial services groups, it employs more than 18,000 people and has more than 600 branches across the UK. In September, it completed the £2.3bn acquisition of Virgin Money, the London-listed banking group. Last year, it sparked fury among its high street banking rivals by running a provocative television advertising campaign which mocked them for their approach to serving customers. \n                  WH Smith buyer 'faces 12-month ban' on mass shop closures\n                 \n                  Trump plan for tariff on non-US movies could deal knock-out blow to UK film industry, union says\n                 \n                  Hovis and Kingsmill-owners in talks about historic bread merger\n                 One of the ads was banned for wrongly implying that - unlike its peers - Nationwide was not closing any of its branches. Mr Parry, who is also a former chair of the mutual Royal London, is not expected to leave imminently, although it is possible that a succession plan could be confirmed at or before Nationwide's next annual meeting in July. It was unclear whether any of the mutual's existing non-executive directors might be in the frame to succeed him. Nationwide declined to comment on Monday."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's plan to put a 100% tariff on films made outside the US could be \"a knock-out blow\" to the sector in the UK, a broadcasting union has said. The president has said he will target films made elsewhere as part of his ongoing tariff war, to save what he has called the \"dying\" movie industry in the US. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said he had authorised government departments to put a 100% tariff \"on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands\", and described the issue as a \"national security threat\". Responding to his post, Philippa Childs, head of the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU), said such a move could seriously damage the UK film sector - which is \"only just recovering\" from the impact of the pandemic, when many productions were delayed or cancelled. \"The UK is a world leader in film and TV production, employing thousands of talented workers, and this is a key growth sector in the government's industrial strategy,\" she said. \"These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\" Ms Childs called on the government to \"move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest\". It is unclear how the tariff scheme would affect international productions, such as the upcoming Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, which is filmed in the US as well as other countries around the world. Much of the 2023 box office smash Barbie was filmed at the Warner Bros Leavesden studios, in Hertfordshire, as was Wonka and 2022 hit The Batman, while the vast majority of James Bond films were shot at Pinewood Studios, in Berkshire. It was also unclear whether the duties will apply to films on streaming platforms as well as those that are released in cinemas. Netflix shares were down 2.5% in early trading and Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Universal-owner Comcast (which owns Sky News) fell between 0.7% and 1.7%. The share prices of theatre operators Cinemark and IMAX were down 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, said Mr Trump was \"right to address the fact that there's a decline in the entertainment sector\" - but the issue is not foreign films taking precedence over domestic films. \"It's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places... the unions, the lower cost of labour, and buying budgets have been drastically reduced over two years, all driven by the change in viewing habits.\" She also highlighted that people aren't going to the cinema as much and that the industry is \"entirely changed\" due to the rise of social media platforms and content creators. \"The answer is not tariffs if he's trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood,\" she said. \"It's developing an ecosystem for film-making that is entirely different to what has been before. There's seismic changes in how the entertainment industry is structured needing to happen.\" A government spokesperson said talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK were ongoing - \"but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest\". The latest tariff announcement from Mr Trump is part of a wider crackdown on US imports. In a news conference outside the White House in April, he outlined a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with varying levies allocated - later increasing the tariff on Chinese goods to 145%. US film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the Hollywood strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area, as well as the pandemic. Last year, the UK government introduced the Independent Film Tax Credit, which allows productions costing up to £15m to benefit from an increased tax relief of 53%."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n       A row has erupted after Reform UK pledged to ban local authorities from flying any flags aside from the Union Jack or the St George's Cross in councils they control. In last week's local elections, Reform UK gained control of 10 councils, two mayoralties and won more than 500 council seats. And after saying last week they want to end all diversity and equality hire roles, another policy was announced this morning by party chairman Zia Yusuf. Politics latest: Follow live updates He said on social media that Reform-controlled councils will move \"at speed\" to ensure the only flag that will be flown on public authority buildings \"will be the Union Jack and the St George's flag\". He added: \"No other flags will be permitted to be flown on flag-poles, balconies, reception desks or council-chamber walls.\" The announcement quickly drew criticism from across the political divide - including from Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Labour MPs, including Dover and Deal's Mike Tapp, said this would stop councils flying the Ukrainian flag. Mr Tapp said: \"Reform are to ban the flying of Ukrainian flags from public buildings. A gesture of solidarity we see across the whole country.\" He then branded the party: \"Putin's puppets.\" This is an attack line often used by the prime minister in Prime Minister's Questions, with Sir Keir Starmer accusing Nigel Farage of \"fawning\" over the Russian leader. During last year's election campaign, the Reform leader reiterated his belief that the West and NATO had \"provoked\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine - though said it was \"of course\" Vladimir Putin's \"fault\". In 2014, he said Mr Putin was the statesman he most admired.  Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, proceeded to mock Mr Tapp on social media, replying with a series of water drop emojis and saying \"drip, drip, drip\" - adding: \"Oh, it's the Tapp again\". However, the loudest criticism came from the Conservative ranks. Councillors and MPs attacked Reform's policy for potentially stopping regional flags like that of Kent or Yorkshire from being flown. A Reform spokesperson said: \"Reform UK will proudly fly the Union Jack, St George's Flag and County flags. Unlike the Tories and Labour, we are proud of our country and history.\" It is understood that flags with \"national heritage\" will also be allowed.

Similar comments were made by Tory councillors on social media, as well as some Liberal Democrats. The war of words comes after the Conservatives and Labour both suffered heavily at the hands of Reform in last week's local elections, as well as the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. 👉 Click here to listen to Electoral Dysfunction on your podcast app 👈 As well as flags belonging to other countries, the measure will also prevent councils controlled by Reform from flying flags associated with movements, causes or anything else - for example the Pride flag. A Reform source said: \"The Tories seem more upset about Reform councils flying the union flag than their councils flying the trans flag. It sums up the state of the Tory party, the sooner they're consigned to the dustbin of history, the better.\""

It occupies the MGM lot which dates back to 1924. Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz and Citizen Kane were shot here and, more recently, Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises. But this is no longer the beating heart of movie making. In Tinsel Town the bright lights of the film industry have been fading for some time. Production in Hollywood has fallen by 40% in the last decade, sometimes moving to other states like New Mexico, New York and Georgia, but more often outside the US entirely. A recent survey of film and TV executives indicates that Britain, Australia and Canada are now favoured locations over California when it comes to making movies. San Andreas, a blockbuster film about a California earthquake, was shot in Australia. In America, a film about an Irish family settling in New York, was shot in Canada. Trump's movie tariff could deal knock-out blow to UK film industry, union says The exodus of the film industry from Hollywood is mostly owing to economic reasons, with other countries boasting lower labour costs and more expansive tax incentives.

'It's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas' Justine Bateman is a filmmaker and sister of actor Jason Bateman. She is glad Trump is looking for solutions but does not understand how the tariffs will work. \"I will say, I'm very glad to hear that President Trump is interested in helping the film business. But part of the problem is we just don't have very much detail, do we?,\" she says. \"He's made this big announcement, but we don't have the detail to really mull over. He doesn't even say whether it's going to be films that are shown in the cinema or streaming movies, for example. \"Tariffs can be a profitable situation for when we're just talking about hard goods, but something like a film and, particularly if you've got an American film that takes place in the south of France, you want to be in a particular location. \"So it's a different kind of situation than producing cars overseas and bringing them back here.\" At the Hand Prop Room in Los Angeles, they supply props for TV and film. The warehouse is brimful of virtually any prop you could imagine, from portraits of former presidents, to replica handguns to African artefacts and 18th century teapots.

'It needs to be thought through' In the past five years, the prop shop has been impacted by the COVID pandemic, by both the writers' and actors' strikes and the globalisation of the film industry. Business is at an all time low. \"It's not helping when so many productions are not just leaving the state, but also leaving the country,\" says Reynaldo Castillo, the general manager of the Hand Prop Room. \"It's Hollywood, we have the infrastructure that nobody else has and I think maybe to a certain point we took it for granted. \"I think we can all agree that we want more filming to stay in the country to help promote jobs. But you also don't want to do something to hurt it. \"How does it work? Are there exceptions for X, Y, and Z? What about independent movies that have small budgets that are shot somewhere else that would destroy their ability to make something? It needs to be thought through and make sure it's implemented the right way.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n The trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has begun, with the process to pick the jurors who will determine his fate now under way. Combs, wearing a white shirt with a black crew-neck sweater, grey trousers and glasses, his hair and goatee now grey, hugged and shook hands with all his lawyers as he arrived at the federal courtroom in Manhattan, New York, for the start of the proceedings. The 55-year-old has been held in detention in Brooklyn since he was arrested and charged in September 2024, accused of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy over two decades. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, said all his sexual relationships and encounters were consensual, and strenuously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the jury selection process is expected to last all this week, with opening statements by the lawyers set to begin next week. Unlike some other high-profile trials in the US, this one won't be broadcast live because federal courtrooms, unlike some state courtrooms, don't allow electronic recordings inside. Judge Arun Subramanian started proceedings shortly after 9am on Monday (2pm UK time), first making several rulings on what issues experts will be allowed to testify on when they take to the witness stand. He then gave an overview of the case and began the questioning of prospective jurors one by one - a process known as \"voir dire\" - with the aim of finding a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who can be fair and impartial despite heavy media coverage of the case. Read more:Diddy on trial: Everything you need to knowSean Combs: A timeline of allegations Jurors are being asked if they have any views on the prosecution or the defence, if they or someone close to them has been a victim of crime, and their beliefs on hiring sex workers, the use of illegal drugs, hip-hop artists and law enforcement. They are also being questioned on whether they have heard of names included on a list of individuals, including celebrities, who may be mentioned during the trial. The list is long, the court heard, with the judge saying it reminded him of Lord Of The Rings. What have potential jurors been asked? One prospective juror said they had heard of actors Michael B Jordan and Mike Myers, but this would not prevent them being fair and impartial should they be selected. Another said they had heard of Kanye West. The context in which Jordan, Myers, West and other people may be mentioned is not yet known. Other names that came up included Aubrey O'Day and Dawn Richard - former members of girl group Danity Kane, who were signed to Bad Boy - and singer Michelle Williams. Several prospective jurors indicated they had seen news reports about Combs, and one prospective juror described a still image she had seen as \"damning evidence\". She was rejected from consideration. Another potential juror was excluded because she said a family member had experienced something that made them feel uncomfortable about hearing the case. At one point during proceedings, Combs asked for a bathroom break, telling the judge: \"I'm sorry your honour, I'm a little nervous today.\" One potential juror said they had seen a joke on social media about baby oil authorities say they found in Combs' residences during searches in March 2024. They said they could remain impartial. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, Combs appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no, to his attorneys. What is Combs accused of? In the indictment listing the formal charges against the rapper, he is accused of a pattern of abusive behavior over two decades, allegedly with the help of people in his entourage. Prosecutors say he manipulated women into participating in drug-fuelled sexual performances with male sex workers, which he called \"Freak Offs\". Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts, including beatings, kidnapping and arson, when he didn't get his way, they allege. Lawyers for Combs say any group sex was consensual, that there was no coercion involved, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.  The Cassie video One issue likely to be featured in the trial is an incident in 2016, when a security camera recorded Combs allegedly kicking and hitting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Cassie filed a lawsuit in November 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape, but the case was settled the following day. The hotel footage emerged in May 2024. Shortly afterwards, Combs released a video apology, saying his behaviour in the video was at a time when he had \"hit rock bottom\" but nonetheless was \"inexcusable\" and that he was \"disgusted\" with himself. One of his lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, has said Combs was \"not a perfect person\" and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual. Jury selection continues today and throughout this week, with the trial expected to last about eight weeks."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's plan to put a 100% tariff on films made outside the US could be \"a knock-out blow\" to the sector in the UK, a broadcasting union has said. The president has said he will target films made elsewhere as part of his ongoing tariff war, to save what he has called the \"dying\" movie industry in the US. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said he had authorised government departments to put a 100% tariff \"on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands\", and described the issue as a \"national security threat\". Responding to his post, Philippa Childs, head of the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU), said such a move could seriously damage the UK film sector - which is \"only just recovering\" from the impact of the pandemic, when many productions were delayed or cancelled. \"The UK is a world leader in film and TV production, employing thousands of talented workers, and this is a key growth sector in the government's industrial strategy,\" she said. \"These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\" Ms Childs called on the government to \"move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest\". It is unclear how the tariff scheme would affect international productions, such as the upcoming Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, which is filmed in the US as well as other countries around the world. Much of the 2023 box office smash Barbie was filmed at the Warner Bros Leavesden studios, in Hertfordshire, as was Wonka and 2022 hit The Batman, while the vast majority of James Bond films were shot at Pinewood Studios, in Berkshire. It was also unclear whether the duties will apply to films on streaming platforms as well as those that are released in cinemas. Netflix shares were down 2.5% in early trading and Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Universal-owner Comcast (which owns Sky News) fell between 0.7% and 1.7%. The share prices of theatre operators Cinemark and IMAX were down 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, said Mr Trump was \"right to address the fact that there's a decline in the entertainment sector\" - but the issue is not foreign films taking precedence over domestic films. \"It's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places... the unions, the lower cost of labour, and buying budgets have been drastically reduced over two years, all driven by the change in viewing habits.\" She also highlighted that people aren't going to the cinema as much and that the industry is \"entirely changed\" due to the rise of social media platforms and content creators. \"The answer is not tariffs if he's trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood,\" she said. \"It's developing an ecosystem for film-making that is entirely different to what has been before. There's seismic changes in how the entertainment industry is structured needing to happen.\" A government spokesperson said talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK were ongoing - \"but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest\". The latest tariff announcement from Mr Trump is part of a wider crackdown on US imports. In a news conference outside the White House in April, he outlined a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with varying levies allocated - later increasing the tariff on Chinese goods to 145%. US film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the Hollywood strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area, as well as the pandemic. Last year, the UK government introduced the Independent Film Tax Credit, which allows productions costing up to £15m to benefit from an increased tax relief of 53%."
