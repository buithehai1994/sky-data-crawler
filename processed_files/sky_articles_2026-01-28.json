        "Content": "By John Sparks, international correspondent, Maz Poynter and Alicja Hagopian, Data and Forensics  In Iran, the climate of fear has been restored after the clerics who run this country successfully crushed nationwide revolt. Yet their determination to stay in power is matched by their efforts to conceal what has happened. Trump threatens Tehran - latest updates Iran's communications blackout - which began on 8 January - has eased somewhat, with sporadic internet access now possible. But it remains difficult to communicate with people inside the country, who must find both the courage and the practical means to reach out. The activist doctor Dr Yaser Rahmani-Rad wants his voice to be heard. A specialist in internal medicine at a public hospital in Tehran, he told Sky News what he saw as the regime launched its crackdown in the capital. \"Pressure was being put on nurses and doctors to clear out the emergency department. In other words, any patient who was there - whether they had clear medical indications or not - was told to be discharged. They wanted the emergency ward emptied for security forces who had been injured.\" We know members of the Iranian security forces have made incursions into clinics and hospitals. Images of one such operation inside the Imam Khomeini Hospital in western Iran have been posted online. Staff members are seen trying to stop them at the front entrance. Dr Rahmani-Rad relayed details passed to him by colleagues trying to cope with the consequences of the state crackdown. \"In some cases patients were removed from ventilators and other medical equipment. They said: 'Let them die. They have no rights. They are against the Islamic system, and they deserve to die.'\" Medical workers also told the doctor security officials targeted protesters with their weapons inside medical facilities. \"Some had been wounded by shotguns and (later) were killed in the hospital with live ammunition… (protesters) who had been shot with live bullets and were again killed inside the hospital with live ammunition.\" As a result of the state crackdown, Dr Rahmani-Rad says the security forces are now effectively in control of the hospitals. \"If they realise that someone who was injured in the protests has gone to a hospital, or even if they had gone before and managed to escape them, they will arrest that person. By checking security cameras, they track them down, raid the locations, and detain them. This is the situation we're in right now.\" Targeting doctors Reports of doctors and medical professionals being targeted have circulated online. So far, human rights organisations say they have verified six cases of medical professionals being arrested or detained for treating protesters. Among these are Ameneh Soleimani, Babak Pouramin, and Farhad Nadali, colleagues whose arrests were confirmed by Dr Rahmani-Rad. One of these doctors is Dr Alireza Golchini, who posted on Instagram earlier in January saying that he would provide treatment to protesters. In recent days, human rights organisations say security forces raided Dr Golchini's home and beat him before detaining him. Now, Dr Golchini is reportedly facing the risk of execution, according to human rights organisation Hengaw, for charges of Moharrebeh - known as waging war against god.  How many people have been killed? Iranian authorities violently shut down protests and enforced an internet blackout that was largely in place from eight to 27 January. This has obscured the true impact of the brutal crackdown and made it difficult to collect verified data on the numbers of people killed and injured during the uprising. Iran's Islamic Republic has said 3,117 people have been killed - claiming the majority of these deaths were security forces and civilians, not protesters. Human rights agencies warn numbers are much higher. The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has independently verified 6,301 deaths, with a further 17,091 cases under review, bringing the possible total up to over 23,000. Read more:Iran warns any attack will mean 'all-out war''He was bleeding for 40 minutes, gasping for life' Medical professionals also claim the authorities' figure is too low. Dr Rahmani-Rad and his network of doctors previously estimated around 20,000 to 30,000 people have been killed, and now believe it could be higher. This number is echoed by Dr Amir-Mobarez Parasta, an eye surgeon based in Germany and a supporter of Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former Shah of Iran. He claims at least 25,654 deaths have been recorded in hospitals and clinics across Iran since the protests began up to 23 January. Nearly a third of these (8,354) were in Tehran alone. Sky News has approached the Iranian embassy for confirmation of these figures, but received no response. Dr Parasta says he has collected figures on clinically reported deaths which have been linked to the protests, by speaking to medical professionals in hospitals and clinics across Iran. He says figures were verified by at least two individuals in each medical organisation. Sky News has not seen these clinical reports and is unable to independently verify the figure. Seeking care from overseas doctors Injured protesters who require medical care are faced with a terrible dilemma. By seeking treatment at a clinic or hospital in Iran, they risk arrest and detention by the authorities. Instead, some are turning to doctors who work overseas. Dr Panteha Rezaeian is a cardio-vascular expert in California who has received numerous calls from protest participants or members of their families. \"They already had been shot. They couldn't go to any hospital because they are afraid of getting killed or arrested. So what's happened? They are inside the house. They have infections, some of them are still bleeding. Some of (them) have been shot inside the belly.\" Dr Rezaeian told us about her most recent call. \"I have one very young boy that has been shot. From just a two-metre distance into both knees. And you can imagine he cannot ever walk again.\" It is an extreme form of remote health care and the specialist says she does what she can, but these are people who need urgent care. \"Many of the injured people are not going (to hospital) and then what does mean? So it means they are at the risk of potential death in the next few days or a week.\" Sky News approached Iranian officials with our findings and received no response."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n A third of international travellers say they are less likely to visit the US if proposals to scrutinise social media accounts are brought in, according to a survey. It suggests proposals to screen visitors' social media accounts and family histories - as announced last month - could cut tourism spending by $15bn (£10.8bn) and impact 157,000 jobs. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has proposed collecting five years' of social media information from travellers from selected countries - including the UK - who are eligible to visit without a visa through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The Trump administration has increased monitoring of international travellers and immigrants. The survey, commissioned by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), interviewed travellers across several of the roughly three dozen countries participating in the ESTA programme. The findings were combined with economic modelling assessing potential effects on international arrivals, visitor spending, and the wider tourism-related GDP and employment in the US. Two-thirds (66%) of more than 4,500 respondents said they were aware of the potential changes, suggesting the impact on people's travel plans could be felt quickly if the new rules are implemented. Trump defends 'safety' measure December's announcement stated that CBP would begin requesting additional information, including telephone numbers used by the visitor over the past five years, email addresses used over the past decade, and other details about family members. Asked at a White House event whether he was concerned the measure might affect US tourism, President Donald Trump disagreed. \"We want safety, we want security, we want to make sure we're not letting the wrong people come into our country,\" he said. The announcement did not specify what the administration would be looking for in social media accounts or why more extensive information was required. Change 'risks 150,000 jobs' Gloria Guevara, president and CEO of the WTTC, said: \"Security at the US border is vital, but the planned policy changes will damage job creation, which the US administration values so much. \"Our research finds that over 150,000 jobs could be lost if this policy goes ahead - about the same number usually created each quarter in the US. \"Even modest shifts in visitor behaviour, discouraged by the planned changes, will have real economic consequences for US travel and tourism, particularly in a highly competitive global market.\" Read More from Sky News:Congresswoman attacked with unknown substance Man guilty of assault after Barron Trump alerted police The increased focus on social media screening has angered immigration and free speech advocates, who are concerned about the administration's intentions and whether the measures could target critics of the government. Ms Guevara added: \"WTTC urges US policymakers to carefully assess this policy and its consequences for the economy and jobs. \"Travel and tourism is a critical driver of the American economy, job creation and international connectivity, with one in 10 jobs globally supported by the sector.\" According to the US commerce department, international visitor arrivals to the US in March 2025 totalled approximately 5.4 million, around 86.4% of the visitor volume recorded in March 2019, showing that inbound tourism remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Sky News has contacted the US embassy in London for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       More pupils suspended for bad behaviour will have to stay in school under supervision, rather than being sent home, in a bid to curb learning loss and reduce exposure to phones and social media. Ministers say the changes are designed to strengthen discipline while ensuring pupils continue learning during short-term suspensions, particularly for non-violent behaviour. Under a new national framework, schools will be encouraged to use structured internal suspensions, keeping pupils on site in a separate, supervised setting away from peers. The aim is to reinforce behavioural expectations without cutting children off from education. Suspensions were first introduced more than 40 years ago, long before smartphones and social media. Today, ministers argue, being sent home can mean unrestricted access to phones, online gaming and social networks. They say time at home on exclusion is spent doing little to address behaviour or re-engage pupils with learning. The government says the new approach will end what it describes as a contradiction, where pupils are banned from phones in classrooms but effectively handed them back all day when suspended at home. While many schools already use internal suspension, ministers say it is often informal and inconsistently applied. In some cases, pupils are isolated and set generic work that does not support learning or reintegration. Updated guidance will set clearer expectations, requiring internal suspensions to be short, structured, and purposeful, with meaningful work aligned to the curriculum and time built in for reflection. Pupils will complete the lessons they would otherwise miss, reducing pressure on teachers to recover lost learning. 'Time out of school compounds disadvantage' Education leaders have welcomed the shift, pointing to safeguarding concerns when pupils are out of school. Kiran Gill, chief executive of school leadership charity The Difference, described it as a \"really crucial direction of travel\" from the government. Gary Moore, headteacher at Regent High School Camden in north London, also backed the move, saying \"time out of school can compound disadvantage, rather than resolve it\". Grassroots group No More Exclusions was less complimentary, saying school suspensions were \"disproportionately made up by children in care, disabled children, black, gypsy, Roma and Irish traveller children\". \"This guidance is an attempt to erase those realities, create a moral panic around mobile phones, and regain control over children and young people through an increasingly authoritarian and punitive culture,\" it said. Suspensions hit one million The changes - set out in the government's upcoming schools' white paper - come as suspensions reach record levels. Nearly one million external suspensions were issued in the 2023 academic year, with disadvantaged pupils hit hardest. Children eligible for free school meals are five times more likely to be suspended. The government has also confirmed there will be 93 attendance and behaviour hubs across England made up of schools with a track record of improvement in these areas. The hubs will support other schools to identify absence early, build positive cultures, engage parents and establish clear routines. An independent evaluation of the previous behaviour hubs programme found strong evidence of lasting improvements in pupil behaviour, with changes sustained long after support ended. Read more from Sky News:Decades of abuse and racism at prestigious schoolMan blew up ULEZ camera with homemade bomb Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said suspensions had been \"devalued\" by modern home comforts like social media and gaming, leading to \"high levels of lost learning\". \"We want to restore suspensions as the serious sanction they should be, while keeping young people engaged in their education and reducing the time teachers spend helping pupils catch up,\" she added."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The King has spoken about the criticism he faced for his environmental campaigning, saying in a new documentary that he \"wasn't going to be diverted\" from his climate mission. The 90-minute film called Finding Harmony: A King's Vision, is set to be released by Amazon next week, and looks back at Charles's Harmony philosophy and lifelong commitment to green issues. The documentary, which feels like a heavy bid to bring his decades of work to a new global audience, was made in close collaboration with his charity The King's Foundation for Amazon MGM Studios. In new footage, King Charles is filmed watching some of his most passionate speeches from over the years, saying \"I just felt this was the approach that I was going to stick to. A course I set and I wasn't going to be diverted from.\" He also appears reflective about his own mortality at times, but also more restrained with his comments than he may have been in the past. After an academic comments that the world is not on the \"trajectory\" needed to limit the worst effects of climate change, Charles remarks: \"It's rapidly going backwards, I've said that for the last 40 years, but anyway, there we are… \"I can only do what I can do, which is not very much - anyway\", he said, adding: \"Maybe, by the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, there might be a little more awareness… of the need to bring things back together again.\" \n                  Australia swelters in record heatwave as temperatures soar to nearly 50C\n                 \n                  We can learn a lot from Antarctica's weird biology\n                 \n                  Is America surrendering Antarctica to its rivals?\n                 The documentary interestingly reminds us of key moments where he was accused of overstepping the mark when he was Prince of Wales. On topics like organic farming, his criticisms of architecture, or even his admission that he talked to plants - a comment that the programme voiceover by actress Kate Winslet says \"haunted him\" because of the response in the press. It feels intriguing that a programme, made in such close collaboration with one of the King's charities and the palace, would want to remind us of a time when Charles was so heavily criticised. But he also isn't questioned very heavily and there are no new interviews included with those critical of his style of leadership. It is very much his documentary, and feels like a legacy building project. With a heavy emphasis on the environmental message and the story of how the world's response to the climate crisis has changed, this isn't your classic royal documentary. Read more from Sky News:Tyson Fury announces boxing comebackUK rolls out free AI training, but will it save your job? But there are some lighter moments with more personal insights. Charles is seen collecting eggs from his chickens at their \"Cluckingham Palace\" coop on his Highgrove estate, and reveals his love of a crispy baked potato, declaring that \"red Duke of Yorks\" are the best variety for this. Throughout the documentary we are reminded that this is a man who is deeply spiritual about our connection to the natural world. And some might say he has been ahead of his time, with so many now promoting the benefits of time in nature, including his own son and daughter in law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The film, the first to receive a movie premiere at a royal residence, is also the King's first documentary with a streaming platform. A less traditional approach which shows a desire to reach a wider global audience, especially when now, as King and head of state, he is more limited in what he can publicly say."

        "Content": "A man has been jailed for life for the murder of a six-month-old baby after violently shaking the child, leaving him with a fatal brain injury and lying to cover up what happened. Bedfordshire Police said baby Archie Woodbridge was left in the sole care of Kieran Humphreys, 33, on 9 February 2024, at the home of friends Sam Wyatt and Karen Smith in Houghton Regis, near Luton.While Archie was in his care, Humphreys shook the child violently, leaving him critically injured. However, instead of immediately calling an ambulance, Humpreys instead phoned his own mother, Sharon Humphreys. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he also \"spent time online browsing Facebook, buying clothes and looking at holidays\". When Wyatt returned home, he contacted Smith, who was with Archie's mother Saskia Woodbridge. Ms Woodbridge had only met Kieran Humphreys a week earlier but had believed \"that he would care for her child\" because he \"lavished attention on them\", according to the trial judge. Archie was taken to a relative's home nearby, in Bromley Gardens, where an ambulance was finally called - around 90 minutes after the injuries occurred. \n                  Harry Whittaker: Self-styled 'science nerd' convicted after homemade explosives found in garden shed\n                 \n                  19-year-old guilty of murdering another teenager in 'brutal' knife attack in Bedford\n                 \n                  Man rushed to hospital after 'car falls' from Luton Airport car park\n                 Emergency services alerted Bedfordshire Police just before 5.30pm and the baby was taken to hospital but died later that evening. Judge Mr Justice Morris, in his sentencing remarks, said that at the time of the offence, Humphreys had been on bail over an unrelated allegation, one of the conditions of which was \"not to have unsupervised contact with a child under 16\". The CPS said Humphreys lied to paramedics when they attended, claiming Archie had been with his mother when the baby became unwell, and insisted he had not been present. Detectives discovered that all four adults lied to the police, claiming Archie had fallen ill while with his mother at Bromley Gardens and that emergency services had been called straight away. Evidence revealed Archie suffered a fatal brain injury and fractured ribs from being violently shaken. Shan Saunders, from the CPS, said: \"This is a heartbreaking case. Despite convincing Archie's mother that he cared for her little boy, Kieran Humphreys violently cut his life short. \"Humphreys will now spend a long time in prison but nothing can ever make up for the loss of Archie and our thoughts remain with his mother and family.\" Read more from Sky News:Ex-Spandau Ballet singer found guilty of rapeKing Charles speaks of backlash he suffered Humphreys was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of murdering a child under one, child cruelty, and perverting the course of justice.

Sharon Humphreys was sentenced to nine months in prison, Wyatt was jailed for 15 months and Smith was jailed for a year. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Gardner, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"Our thoughts remain with Archie's family at this time. \"This was a truly shocking and senseless act of violence against a defenceless baby.\""

        "Content": "The two agents who fired their guns during Alex Pretti's fatal shooting in Minnesota have been placed on administrative leave, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. A preliminary DHS report sent to Congress detailing Pretti's killing on Saturday said two officers fired their weapons during the struggle, but did not confirm claims from federal officials that the nurse was \"brandishing\" a gun. The two border control agents have not been named. Mr Pretti's ‍death - the second fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in a month - sparked a national ​uproar.The killing of the 37-year-old ICU nurse came weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by ICE agents in her car, less than a mile from where Mr Pretti was killed. Mr Pretti had himself attended protests in the aftermath of Ms Good's death. On Tuesday, Donald Trump appeared to distance himself from controversial remarks made by senior members of his administration about the shooting. The response from top White House officials, notably Trump adviser Stephen Miller and DHS secretary Kristi Noem, had provoked a furious backlash from Mr Pretti's family, leading Democrats, members of the public, and - increasingly - Republican politicians. \n                  ICE agents to have role at Winter Olympics - as crackdown's 'public face' to leave Minneapolis\n                 \n                  Minnesota isn't Belfast but the warning signs are there: guns beget guns\n                 \n                  'The normal rules of engagement have been thrown out - Alex Pretti was on his knees when first shot was fired'\n                 In a statement, Mr Pretti's family said the nurse, who cared for US veterans, was a \"kind-hearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends\". They criticised \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration\", calling them \"reprehensible and disgusting\". They went on to say: \"Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs\". Read more from Sky News:Congresswoman Ilhan Omar attacked with unknown substanceMan guilty of assaulting woman after Barron Trump alerted police Mr Trump has since said he wants to \"de-escalate\" the situation in Minneapolis, and, following talks with the Democratic mayor and state governor, he described the killing as \"very unfortunate\". When leaving the White House for a rally in Iowa, the president said that he did not believe Mr Pretti was a \"would-be assassin\", the description used by Mr Miller. But Mr Trump added: \"Listen, you can't walk in with guns. You can't do that, but it's just a very unfortunate incident.\" When later speaking to reporters before the rally, he repeated his view that \"certainly, [Mr Pretti] shouldn't have been carrying a gun\". However, in a sign that the White House may be shifting its stance on the shooting, a controversial US border patrol commander known for his rapid \"turn and burn\" tactics is reportedly being pulled out of Minneapolis amid outrage over the killing."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n A third of international travellers say they are less likely to visit the US if proposals to scrutinise social media accounts are brought in, according to a survey. It suggests proposals to screen visitors' social media accounts and family histories - as announced last month - could cut tourism spending by $15bn (£10.8bn) and impact 157,000 jobs. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has proposed collecting five years' of social media information from travellers from selected countries - including the UK - who are eligible to visit without a visa through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The Trump administration has increased monitoring of international travellers and immigrants. The survey, commissioned by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), interviewed travellers across several of the roughly three dozen countries participating in the ESTA programme. The findings were combined with economic modelling assessing potential effects on international arrivals, visitor spending, and the wider tourism-related GDP and employment in the US. Two-thirds (66%) of more than 4,500 respondents said they were aware of the potential changes, suggesting the impact on people's travel plans could be felt quickly if the new rules are implemented. Trump defends 'safety' measure December's announcement stated that CBP would begin requesting additional information, including telephone numbers used by the visitor over the past five years, email addresses used over the past decade, and other details about family members. Asked at a White House event whether he was concerned the measure might affect US tourism, President Donald Trump disagreed. \"We want safety, we want security, we want to make sure we're not letting the wrong people come into our country,\" he said. The announcement did not specify what the administration would be looking for in social media accounts or why more extensive information was required. Change 'risks 150,000 jobs' Gloria Guevara, president and CEO of the WTTC, said: \"Security at the US border is vital, but the planned policy changes will damage job creation, which the US administration values so much. \"Our research finds that over 150,000 jobs could be lost if this policy goes ahead - about the same number usually created each quarter in the US. \"Even modest shifts in visitor behaviour, discouraged by the planned changes, will have real economic consequences for US travel and tourism, particularly in a highly competitive global market.\" Read More from Sky News:Congresswoman attacked with unknown substance Man guilty of assault after Barron Trump alerted police The increased focus on social media screening has angered immigration and free speech advocates, who are concerned about the administration's intentions and whether the measures could target critics of the government. Ms Guevara added: \"WTTC urges US policymakers to carefully assess this policy and its consequences for the economy and jobs. \"Travel and tourism is a critical driver of the American economy, job creation and international connectivity, with one in 10 jobs globally supported by the sector.\" According to the US commerce department, international visitor arrivals to the US in March 2025 totalled approximately 5.4 million, around 86.4% of the visitor volume recorded in March 2019, showing that inbound tourism remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.

        "Content": "\n          Education reporter\n       More pupils suspended for bad behaviour will have to stay in school under supervision, rather than being sent home, in a bid to curb learning loss and reduce exposure to phones and social media. Ministers say the changes are designed to strengthen discipline while ensuring pupils continue learning during short-term suspensions, particularly for non-violent behaviour. Under a new national framework, schools will be encouraged to use structured internal suspensions, keeping pupils on site in a separate, supervised setting away from peers. The aim is to reinforce behavioural expectations without cutting children off from education. Suspensions were first introduced more than 40 years ago, long before smartphones and social media. Today, ministers argue, being sent home can mean unrestricted access to phones, online gaming and social networks. They say time at home on exclusion is spent doing little to address behaviour or re-engage pupils with learning. The government says the new approach will end what it describes as a contradiction, where pupils are banned from phones in classrooms but effectively handed them back all day when suspended at home. While many schools already use internal suspension, ministers say it is often informal and inconsistently applied. In some cases, pupils are isolated and set generic work that does not support learning or reintegration. Updated guidance will set clearer expectations, requiring internal suspensions to be short, structured, and purposeful, with meaningful work aligned to the curriculum and time built in for reflection. Pupils will complete the lessons they would otherwise miss, reducing pressure on teachers to recover lost learning. 'Time out of school compounds disadvantage' Education leaders have welcomed the shift, pointing to safeguarding concerns when pupils are out of school. Kiran Gill, chief executive of school leadership charity The Difference, described it as a \"really crucial direction of travel\" from the government. Gary Moore, headteacher at Regent High School Camden in north London, also backed the move, saying \"time out of school can compound disadvantage, rather than resolve it\". Grassroots group No More Exclusions was less complimentary, saying school suspensions were \"disproportionately made up by children in care, disabled children, black, gypsy, Roma and Irish traveller children\". \"This guidance is an attempt to erase those realities, create a moral panic around mobile phones, and regain control over children and young people through an increasingly authoritarian and punitive culture,\" it said. Suspensions hit one million The changes - set out in the government's upcoming schools' white paper - come as suspensions reach record levels. Nearly one million external suspensions were issued in the 2023 academic year, with disadvantaged pupils hit hardest. Children eligible for free school meals are five times more likely to be suspended. The government has also confirmed there will be 93 attendance and behaviour hubs across England made up of schools with a track record of improvement in these areas. The hubs will support other schools to identify absence early, build positive cultures, engage parents and establish clear routines. An independent evaluation of the previous behaviour hubs programme found strong evidence of lasting improvements in pupil behaviour, with changes sustained long after support ended. Read more from Sky News:Decades of abuse and racism at prestigious schoolMan blew up ULEZ camera with homemade bomb Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said suspensions had been \"devalued\" by modern home comforts like social media and gaming, leading to \"high levels of lost learning\". \"We want to restore suspensions as the serious sanction they should be, while keeping young people engaged in their education and reducing the time teachers spend helping pupils catch up,\" she added."

        "Content": "Former Spandau Ballet frontman Ross Davidson has been found guilty of rape and attempted rape.  Davidson, who used the stage name Ross Wild, performed as a singer for the 1980s band in 2018 and also starred in the Queen-based West End musical We Will Rock You. The 37-year-old from Finchley, north London, had pleaded not guilty to the rape of a woman in London in March 2015, and denied the attempted rape and sexual assault of another woman in Thailand in December 2019. On Wednesday, jurors at Wood Green Crown Court found him guilty of all charges after more than 11 hours of deliberation. The court heard that the Aberdeen-born performer carried out the assaults because he felt he could get \"sex on demand\". Prosecutor Richard Hearnden said Davidson had been thought of as \"a bit of a sex symbol\" but the two women said he had \"a much darker side that they did not notice, at least at first\". Mr Hearnden said that Davidson was considered \"charming and charismatic\" but \"will resort to rape and sexual assault if he is not given what he thinks he deserves\". \n                  Boy, 16, charged with arson and manslaughter after house fire killed schoolgirl\n                 \n                  Chris Brown appears in London court over alleged 'bottle attack'\n                 \n                  Nathan Tokosi jailed after man shot in head, mouth and body in drive-by attack\n                 Davidson, who met both women on the dating app Tinder, claimed the sexual activity he engaged in was consensual. The rape victim told the jury she was left feeling \"helpless\" and \"scared to react\" after Davidson attacked her while she was asleep in his bed.She also said Davidson had \"mentioned he liked the idea of having sex with a mannequin, a person in a helpless state, someone not moving\". Davidson described himself as \"sex positive\", telling the court the term meant having an \"open dialogue, open-mindedness about people's predilections, just an openness to trying different sexual appetites\".

Davidson admitted the voyeurism charge, but denied the sexual assault, saying he created the video for \"selfish reasons, for sexual gratification\" and claiming he \"had permission to touch her but not to film\". He told the jury: \"I wish I had never done it.\" The court heard Davidson had been found guilty of rape, two counts of sexual assault and voyeurism at a previous trial.He is due to be sentenced for the later convictions at a later date. A further hearing has been set for 4 February."

        "Content": "Four members of an organised crime gang have been jailed after an investigation into a multi-million-pound firearms and drugs operation.  The gang members have been jailed for a total of almost 50 years following an investigation into a Wigan-based \"industrial‑scale tablet manufacturing set-up, capable of producing tens of thousands of tablets per hour\". The court heard how between November 2021 and May 2022, an investigation was launched following evidence from a separate operation which was tackling the use of encrypted communications platforms - particularly EncroChat - by organised crime. The four members of the gang were John Eric Spiby, 80, his son John Colin Spiby, 37, Callum Dorian, 35, and Lee Ryan Drury, 45. Messages and images linked to Dorian's handle on the platforms showed the facilitation and supply of firearms, including AK47s, a Grand Power pistol, silencers, and ammunition. The messages also revealed the orchestration of the large scale production of counterfeit diazepam tablets containing etizolam. After this, the group were placed under surveillance, with several properties being identified as being used for illegal activities. \n                  Kieran Humphreys jailed for violently shaking baby to death and attempting to cover it up\n                 \n                  Retired engineer Kevin Rees convicted of blowing up ULEZ camera with homemade bomb\n                 \n                  Boy, 16, charged with arson and manslaughter after house fire killed schoolgirl\n                 The industrial-scale tablet manufacturing system was found in a cottage behind Spiby Sr's home. An industrial unit was also bought by Spiby Sr with the aim of fitting it out to expand the group's production capacity. A shipping container, rented by Drury and controlled by the group, was used to store materials and millions of the counterfeit tablets awaiting distribution. In April 2022, a hire van that was seen by officers being loaded by Dorian and Drury was intercepted. Authorities found 2.6 million counterfeit Diazepam tablets, with an estimated street value of between £1m and £5.2m. To try and remain undetected, Drury created a fake company - complete with a website advertising tablet presses, mixers, packaging machines, and powdered supplements. This allowed the group to run their \"highly profitable criminal enterprise\" while pretending to be a lawful business. Following the seizure of the van, officers carried out a number of warrants - seizing three viable firearms, ammunition, cash, industrial tablet manufacturing machinery, and significant quantities of counterfeit tablets and raw materials. The men were all arrested and remanded in custody. Officers estimated that the group produced counterfeit tablets with a bulk value of between £7.2m and £12.9m, and a potential street value ranging from £57.6m to £288m. Detective Inspector Alex Brown, from the Serious Organised Crime Group, said: \"The volume of tablets we recovered - along with the sophisticated machinery - demonstrated how deeply embedded this group was in the illicit drug supply chain. \"Alongside the drug production, this group was also linked to the supply of a range of deadly firearms, including automatic weapons and ammunition.

John Eric Spiby was jailed at Bolton Crown Court on Tuesday for 16 years and six months for conspiracy to produce and supply Class C drugs, two counts of possessing a firearm, possession of ammunition, and perverting the course of justice. His son was sentenced to nine years in prison for conspiracy to produce and supply Class C drugs. Both had denied the offences but were found guilty after a trial in November 2025. Drury pleaded guilty midway through the trial to conspiracy to produce and supply Class C drugs and was jailed for nine years and nine months. Dorian received a 12-year prison sentence in September 2024 for conspiracy to supply firearms and conspiracy to produce and supply Class C drugs. DI Brown said: \"The sentences should serve as a clear warning: organised crime will not be tolerated.\""

Bedfordshire Police said baby Archie Woodbridge was left in the sole care of Kieran Humphreys, 33, on 9 February 2024, at the home of friends Sam Wyatt and Karen Smith in Houghton Regis, near Luton.While Archie was in his care, Humphreys shook the child violently, leaving him critically injured. However, instead of immediately calling an ambulance, Humpreys instead phoned his own mother, Sharon Humphreys. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he also \"spent time online browsing Facebook, buying clothes and looking at holidays\". When Wyatt returned home, he contacted Smith, who was with Archie's mother Saskia Woodbridge. Ms Woodbridge had only met Kieran Humphreys a week earlier but had believed \"that he would care for her child\" because he \"lavished attention on them\", according to the trial judge. Archie was taken to a relative's home nearby, in Bromley Gardens, where an ambulance was finally called - around 90 minutes after the injuries occurred. \n                  Harry Whittaker: Self-styled 'science nerd' convicted after homemade explosives found in garden shed\n                 \n                  19-year-old guilty of murdering another teenager in 'brutal' knife attack in Bedford\n                 \n                  Man rushed to hospital after 'car falls' from Luton Airport car park\n                 Emergency services alerted Bedfordshire Police just before 5.30pm and the baby was taken to hospital but died later that evening. Judge Mr Justice Morris, in his sentencing remarks, said that at the time of the offence, Humphreys had been on bail over an unrelated allegation, one of the conditions of which was \"not to have unsupervised contact with a child under 16\". The CPS said Humphreys lied to paramedics when they attended, claiming Archie had been with his mother when the baby became unwell, and insisted he had not been present. Detectives discovered that all four adults lied to the police, claiming Archie had fallen ill while with his mother at Bromley Gardens and that emergency services had been called straight away. Evidence revealed Archie suffered a fatal brain injury and fractured ribs from being violently shaken. Shan Saunders, from the CPS, said: \"This is a heartbreaking case. Despite convincing Archie's mother that he cared for her little boy, Kieran Humphreys violently cut his life short. \"Humphreys will now spend a long time in prison but nothing can ever make up for the loss of Archie and our thoughts remain with his mother and family.\" Read more from Sky News:Ex-Spandau Ballet singer found guilty of rapeKing Charles speaks of backlash he suffered Humphreys was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of murdering a child under one, child cruelty, and perverting the course of justice.

Sharon Humphreys was sentenced to nine months in prison, Wyatt was jailed for 15 months and Smith was jailed for a year. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Gardner, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"Our thoughts remain with Archie's family at this time. \"This was a truly shocking and senseless act of violence against a defenceless baby.\""

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The King has spoken about the criticism he faced for his environmental campaigning, saying in a new documentary that he \"wasn't going to be diverted\" from his climate mission. The 90-minute film called Finding Harmony: A King's Vision, is set to be released by Amazon next week, and looks back at Charles's Harmony philosophy and lifelong commitment to green issues. The documentary, which feels like a heavy bid to bring his decades of work to a new global audience, was made in close collaboration with his charity The King's Foundation for Amazon MGM Studios. In new footage, King Charles is filmed watching some of his most passionate speeches from over the years, saying \"I just felt this was the approach that I was going to stick to. A course I set and I wasn't going to be diverted from.\" He also appears reflective about his own mortality at times, but also more restrained with his comments than he may have been in the past. After an academic comments that the world is not on the \"trajectory\" needed to limit the worst effects of climate change, Charles remarks: \"It's rapidly going backwards, I've said that for the last 40 years, but anyway, there we are… \"I can only do what I can do, which is not very much - anyway\", he said, adding: \"Maybe, by the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, there might be a little more awareness… of the need to bring things back together again.\" \n                  Australia swelters in record heatwave as temperatures soar to nearly 50C\n                 \n                  We can learn a lot from Antarctica's weird biology\n                 \n                  Is America surrendering Antarctica to its rivals?\n                 The documentary interestingly reminds us of key moments where he was accused of overstepping the mark when he was Prince of Wales. On topics like organic farming, his criticisms of architecture, or even his admission that he talked to plants - a comment that the programme voiceover by actress Kate Winslet says \"haunted him\" because of the response in the press. It feels intriguing that a programme, made in such close collaboration with one of the King's charities and the palace, would want to remind us of a time when Charles was so heavily criticised. But he also isn't questioned very heavily and there are no new interviews included with those critical of his style of leadership. It is very much his documentary, and feels like a legacy building project. With a heavy emphasis on the environmental message and the story of how the world's response to the climate crisis has changed, this isn't your classic royal documentary.

Charles is seen collecting eggs from his chickens at their \"Cluckingham Palace\" coop on his Highgrove estate, and reveals his love of a crispy baked potato, declaring that \"red Duke of Yorks\" are the best variety for this. Throughout the documentary we are reminded that this is a man who is deeply spiritual about our connection to the natural world. And some might say he has been ahead of his time, with so many now promoting the benefits of time in nature, including his own son and daughter in law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The film, the first to receive a movie premiere at a royal residence, is also the King's first documentary with a streaming platform. A less traditional approach which shows a desire to reach a wider global audience, especially when now, as King and head of state, he is more limited in what he can publicly say."

Dame Sarah, who is married to Eamonn Mullally and is a mother-of-two, is now officially the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury. She was named in October after her predecessor, Justin Welby, stepped down in November 2024 after an independent review found he \"could and should\" have reported decades-long abuse of men and young boys by his former friend. Cancer nurse turned cleric Dame Sarah officially took up the responsibilities of her new job on Wednesday as bewigged judges presided over a legal ceremony confirming her appointment. As the lengthy process came to a close and her election was confirmed, Dame Sarah, who was born in Woking, Surrey, stood and faced the congregation to loud applause. \"We welcome you,\" the bishops surrounding her shouted in unison.

        "Content": "A man has been found guilty of assaulting a woman after Donald Trump's youngest son told UK police that he saw her being attacked on a video call. Barron Trump, 19, was in the US when he told a 999 call handler that a woman was \"getting beat up\" in London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Prosecutors said 22-year-old Russian national Matvei Rumiantsev was jealous of her friendship with the US president's son, possibly because of his \"public profile\". He was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm between 17 and 18 January last year, and perverting the course of justice, after he wrote to the victim from prison asking her to withdraw her allegations. But Rumiantsev was cleared by the jury of rape and intentional strangulation relating to the same date when Mr Trump made his report to police, and another count of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024. The court had heard Rumiantsev answered her phone to a FaceTime call from Mr Trump and turned the screen to the woman, who was crying and screaming on the floor. In a transcript of the call he made to the City of London Police, Mr Trump said: \"Oh I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up.\" \n                  Politics latest: First meetings under way for Starmer ahead of historic Xi talks\n                 \n                  US plans to check tourists' social media 'putting people off travel'\n                 \n                  More suspended pupils to stay in school under new government behaviour rules\n                 He later told investigators in an email sent in May last year: \"What I saw was very brief indeed but indeed prevalent.\" \"I didn't expect her to pick up due to the difference in the time zone to the fact I am in the USA, the phone was answered but not by her, to my dismay,\" he said. \"The individual who picked up the phone was a shirtless man with darkish hair, although I didn't get a good look, this view lasted maybe one second and I was racing with adrenaline. \"The camera was then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying, stating something in Russian. The guy had hung up. This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\" The court heard Rumiantsev became aware of the woman's friendship with Mr Trump in October 2024. He told the jury he was \"jealous to some extent\". \"I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy,\" he said. \"I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.\""

        "Content": "By John Sparks, international correspondent, Maz Poynter and Alicja Hagopian, Data and Forensics  In Iran, the climate of fear has been restored after the clerics who run this country successfully crushed nationwide revolt. Yet their determination to stay in power is matched by their efforts to conceal what has happened. Trump threatens Tehran - latest updates Iran's communications blackout - which began on 8 January - has eased somewhat, with sporadic internet access now possible. But it remains difficult to communicate with people inside the country, who must find both the courage and the practical means to reach out. The activist doctor Dr Yaser Rahmani-Rad wants his voice to be heard. A specialist in internal medicine at a public hospital in Tehran, he told Sky News what he saw as the regime launched its crackdown in the capital. \"Pressure was being put on nurses and doctors to clear out the emergency department. In other words, any patient who was there - whether they had clear medical indications or not - was told to be discharged. They wanted the emergency ward emptied for security forces who had been injured.\" We know members of the Iranian security forces have made incursions into clinics and hospitals. Images of one such operation inside the Imam Khomeini Hospital in western Iran have been posted online. Staff members are seen trying to stop them at the front entrance. Dr Rahmani-Rad relayed details passed to him by colleagues trying to cope with the consequences of the state crackdown. \"In some cases patients were removed from ventilators and other medical equipment. They said: 'Let them die. They have no rights. They are against the Islamic system, and they deserve to die.'\" Medical workers also told the doctor security officials targeted protesters with their weapons inside medical facilities. \"Some had been wounded by shotguns and (later) were killed in the hospital with live ammunition… (protesters) who had been shot with live bullets and were again killed inside the hospital with live ammunition.\" As a result of the state crackdown, Dr Rahmani-Rad says the security forces are now effectively in control of the hospitals. \"If they realise that someone who was injured in the protests has gone to a hospital, or even if they had gone before and managed to escape them, they will arrest that person. By checking security cameras, they track them down, raid the locations, and detain them. This is the situation we're in right now.\" Targeting doctors Reports of doctors and medical professionals being targeted have circulated online. So far, human rights organisations say they have verified six cases of medical professionals being arrested or detained for treating protesters. Among these are Ameneh Soleimani, Babak Pouramin, and Farhad Nadali, colleagues whose arrests were confirmed by Dr Rahmani-Rad. One of these doctors is Dr Alireza Golchini, who posted on Instagram earlier in January saying that he would provide treatment to protesters. In recent days, human rights organisations say security forces raided Dr Golchini's home and beat him before detaining him. Now, Dr Golchini is reportedly facing the risk of execution, according to human rights organisation Hengaw, for charges of Moharrebeh - known as waging war against god.  How many people have been killed? Iranian authorities violently shut down protests and enforced an internet blackout that was largely in place from eight to 27 January. This has obscured the true impact of the brutal crackdown and made it difficult to collect verified data on the numbers of people killed and injured during the uprising. Iran's Islamic Republic has said 3,117 people have been killed - claiming the majority of these deaths were security forces and civilians, not protesters. Human rights agencies warn numbers are much higher. The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has independently verified 6,301 deaths, with a further 17,091 cases under review, bringing the possible total up to over 23,000. Read more:Iran warns any attack will mean 'all-out war''He was bleeding for 40 minutes, gasping for life' Medical professionals also claim the authorities' figure is too low. Dr Rahmani-Rad and his network of doctors previously estimated around 20,000 to 30,000 people have been killed, and now believe it could be higher. This number is echoed by Dr Amir-Mobarez Parasta, an eye surgeon based in Germany and a supporter of Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former Shah of Iran. He claims at least 25,654 deaths have been recorded in hospitals and clinics across Iran since the protests began up to 23 January. Nearly a third of these (8,354) were in Tehran alone. Sky News has approached the Iranian embassy for confirmation of these figures, but received no response. Dr Parasta says he has collected figures on clinically reported deaths which have been linked to the protests, by speaking to medical professionals in hospitals and clinics across Iran. He says figures were verified by at least two individuals in each medical organisation. Sky News has not seen these clinical reports and is unable to independently verify the figure. Seeking care from overseas doctors Injured protesters who require medical care are faced with a terrible dilemma. By seeking treatment at a clinic or hospital in Iran, they risk arrest and detention by the authorities. Instead, some are turning to doctors who work overseas. Dr Panteha Rezaeian is a cardio-vascular expert in California who has received numerous calls from protest participants or members of their families. \"They already had been shot. They couldn't go to any hospital because they are afraid of getting killed or arrested. So what's happened? They are inside the house. They have infections, some of them are still bleeding. Some of (them) have been shot inside the belly.\" Dr Rezaeian told us about her most recent call. \"I have one very young boy that has been shot. From just a two-metre distance into both knees. And you can imagine he cannot ever walk again.\" It is an extreme form of remote health care and the specialist says she does what she can, but these are people who need urgent care. \"Many of the injured people are not going (to hospital) and then what does mean? So it means they are at the risk of potential death in the next few days or a week.\" Sky News approached Iranian officials with our findings and received no response."

        "Content": "Airports across Asia have put urgent steps in place to stop the spread of a highly lethal virus. Temperature screening has been set up by authorities in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia after two cases of Nipah virus were detected in India in late December. The Indian health ministry said in a statement on 27 January that the cases in the eastern state of West Bengal have been contained but precautions in neighbouring countries as well as Nepal and Hong Kong remain in place. While there has never been a case reported in the UK, the country's Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) has released information about the disease to educate Britons planning to travel to areas where it circulates. Here's what you need to know about Nipah virus, from how it spreads, possible symptoms and whether it can be treated. What is Nipah virus? Nipah virus infection is a zoonotic illness (meaning it can be spread between animals and humans) that can cause a range of illnesses, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The virus can also spread quickly from person to person through close contact, as well as through contaminated food. It is typically carried by fruit bats, particularly a breed of megabat known as the large flying fox, but other animals, including pigs, can also carry the virus. What are the symptoms? Symptoms in humans can range from an asymptomatic infection - when you show little to no symptoms - to deadly brain-swelling known as encephalitis. Infected people are likely to develop symptoms that include: • Fever• Headaches• Muscle pain• Vomiting• Sore throat These symptoms can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis, according to WHO. Most people make a full recovery from the virus, but some cases of relapse have been reported. The fatality rate is an estimated 40-75%, WHO reports, but this can vary depending on the outbreak. Health authorities in India identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two latest cases, with all of them testing negative for the virus and none of them displaying symptoms. Can it be treated? There is currently no proven treatment for the virus. Several vaccines against it are in development, but remain in the testing phase. Treatment often involves intensive care in a hospital to help with severe respiratory or neurological conditions. Are outbreaks common? The first recognised outbreak was among pig farmers in Malaysia in 1999. Singapore was also affected. India is considered among the world's most at risk regions for Nipah ​outbreaks, while human infections have been reported almost every year in Bangladesh since it first appeared in 2001, according to WHO. The current cases are the first in West Bengal in nearly two decades, local media reported. In 2007 five people died from the virus. How are countries responding to the outbreak? Singapore's Communicable Diseases Agency said on 28 January that passengers on flights arriving from affected areas in India will be subject to temperature screening at its airport. The country's Ministry of Manpower said it is stepping up surveillance over newly arrived ​migrant workers from South Asia, and engaging primary care providers to increase vigilance. Authorities in Thailand also said passengers arriving from areas with Nipah infections must complete health declarations before clearing immigration. China's disease control authority said that while no cases have been detected in the country, there were risks of imported cases. While Nepal said it was on \"high alert\" and had also implemented tightened screening for travellers. Read more from Sky News:What is the Doomsday clock?UK rolls out free AI training, but will it save your job? How to prepare if you are travelling to at-risk countries  The UKHSA says Britons travelling to areas at risk of the virus should focus on avoiding contact with bats and sick animals, as well as ensuring to wash all fruit thoroughly with clean water and peel it before eating. Other advice to help limit potential exposure to the virus includes: • Wearing protective clothing when handling sick animals• Practice good hygiene techniques, particularly after caring for or visiting sick people• Avoid close contact to anyone infected with Nipah virus"

Mr Pawar, the deputy chief minister of India's western Maharashtra state, was on his way to campaign in a local election at the time.

He was part of Mr Modi's ruling coalition, influential in the state's sugar belt, and was known for his ability to mobilise rural voters. In a post on X, Mr Modi called Mr Pawar a \"widely respected\" and \"hardworking personality\" and shared photos of the pair of them together. \"His understanding of administrative matters and passion for empowering the poor and downtrodden were also noteworthy,\" he wrote. \"His untimely demise is very shocking and saddening.

Italy's civil protection chief Fabio Ciciliano said some residents will never be able to return to their homes due to parts of the town of about 25,000 people becoming \"uninhabitable\". \"The entire hill is collapsing onto the plain of Gela,\" he said. \n                  Italy's Meloni posts anime selfie - as Japan PM serenades her for birthday\n                 \n                  EU must cut red tape to boost growth, urge major European leaders\n                 \n                  An extraordinary day in the drive for lasting peace in the Middle East\n                 \"To be honest, there are houses located on the edge of the landslide that obviously can no longer be inhabited, so we need to work with the mayor to find a permanent relocation for these families.\" Ms Meloni viewed the landslide from a helicopter, and met with local and regional officials at the town hall. The federal government declared Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria to be in a state of emergency on Monday and set aside an initial €100m (£86.9m) in support. Sicilian regional officials estimated on Wednesday that the overall damage bill stood at €2bn euros (£1.74bn). Located 120 miles (195km) from Palermo on a ⁠plateau that authorities say is gradually collapsing toward the plain below, Niscemi is no stranger to landslides.

The latest landslide began on Sunday as Cyclone Harry battered southern Italy, and has sparked criticism that houses should not have been built in the area because of the risk of landslides. The opposition centre-left Democratic Party leader, Elly Schlein, has called for Ms Meloni's government to redirect the €1bn (£869m) earmarked for a controversial bridge from Sicily to the Italian mainland to rebuilding the storm hit region."

The 37-year-old heavyweight boxer announced his retirement a year ago in the wake of successive defeats to Oleksandr Usyk. Fury plans to fight three times this year and has been training in Thailand ahead of his return, which is set to take place in the UK on 11 April. The fight, which will be screened on Netflix, will be Fury's first contest in the UK since he overcame Derek Chisora in 2022. Fury, who has enjoyed two spells as world champion since outpointing Wladimir Klitschko in 2015, said: \"Excited to be back.

        "Content": "The wife of South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol - who was ousted over a martial law bid - has been jailed for 20 months for corruption. Former first lady Kim Keon Hee was sentenced on Wednesday for receiving luxury gifts including a Graff diamond necklace and a Chanel bag from the Unification Church in return for political favours. She was ordered to pay ‌a fine of 12.8 million won (£6,495) and the court demanded the confiscation of the necklace. Her husband faces rebellion charges that could see him jailed for life or face the death penalty. He declared martial law in December 2024 leading to his eventual impeachment. Yoon was handed a five year jail sentence earlier this month for mobilising the presidential ⁠security service to block authorities from executing an arrest warrant against him. The Seoul Central District Court found his wife \"exploited her position to seek personal gains\". \"A person who was in such a position ‌might not always be a role model, but the person must not be a bad example to the public,\" the lead judge of a three-justice bench said. The court acquitted Kim on charges of stock price manipulation and political funding law violations. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison term for all the charges. A statement from her lawyers said she \"humbly accepts the court's stern criticism\" and is \"sorry for causing public concern\". Her legal team said they would review the ‍ruling and consider an appeal to the bribery conviction. The Unification Church said it had not expected anything in return for the gifts. A court will rule on Yoon's case next month. Earlier this month he was convicted of fabricating official documents and failing to follow ​the legal process required for martial law, which must be discussed at a formal cabinet meeting. The martial law bid was reversed by parliament after six hours, and triggered protests and calls for Yoon to be ousted. Yoon has argued it was a response to the danger of the liberal-controlled parliament obstructing his agenda. 👉 Tap here to follow The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim wherever you get your podcasts 👈 He was impeached later in December over the incident, and he was removed from office by South Korea's Constitutional Court in April.During Yoon's time in office, Kim was embroiled in a slew of scandals prompting speculation within South Korea that his martial law decree was a bid to protect his wife from investigation.

Mr Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot dead by immigration enforcement agents in Minneapolis at the weekend, just weeks another officer from the controversial unit killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the same city. Minneapolis: Catch up on latest updates The response from top White House officials, notably Trump adviser Stephen Miller and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, has provoked a furious backlash from Mr Pretti's family, leading Democrats, members of the public, and - increasingly - Republican politicians. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he wants to \"de-escalate\" the situation in Minneapolis following talks with the Democratic mayor and state governor, and described the killing of Mr Pretti as \"very unfortunate\". When leaving the White House for a rally in Iowa, Mr Trump was asked whether he agreed Mr Pretti was a \"would-be assassin\" - as described by Mr Miller. \"No. Not as a - no,\" the US president said. \"Listen, you can't walk in with guns. You can't do that, but it's just a very unfortunate incident.\" Later, when speaking to reporters before a rally in Iowa, Mr Trump repeated his view that \"certainly, (Mr Pretti) shouldn't have been carrying a gun\". He added: \"Look, bottom line, everybody in this room, we view that as a very unfortunate incident. \"Everyone, unless you're a stupid person.\" Under the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, the rights of citizens to carry a gun are protected. That right has traditionally been staunchly defended by Republicans.

Ms Omar, who has faced repeated attacks from Mr Trump and his administration, and who has called for ICE to be abolished, did not appear to be injured and continued speaking after. Meanwhile, two Republican senators have broken ranks with the party and called for Ms Noem to resign in the wake of the shootings.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n It's hackneyed to frame America as divided. It's the rawness which catches me these days. Everything here feels torn in two; different sides so far apart and so alarmed at the behaviour of the other. It's genuinely frightening to wonder where this might go next. I've spent the past few days in Minneapolis as the midwestern city absorbed the killing of Alex Pretti. The voices on the streets there echo. \"Leave us alone. We don't need y'all here. We don't want y'all here.\" \"How many more people have to die?\" Drive for 250 miles in a dead straight line, south, along Interstate 35 from Minneapolis and you eventually reach Des Moines. Minnesota becomes Iowa and a blue Democrat state becomes a red Republican one. Iowa is Trump country. He's here for a rally to kick off the midterm election season. It's a good place to test the mood. Because if there is anxiety here, well that's a problem for him. Four hours before the rally's start time, a lone merch seller was braving the -15C weather outside the Horizon Event Center in the Des Moines suburbs. \"USA, USA,\" he shouted. \"The hats are $30… I take cards! Tap and pay!\" For a nation apparently gripped by a cost of living crisis, it didn't show here. His hats and beanies were flying off the cart he'd stacked full. Only the most loyal Trump fans would turn up to a rally like this on a Tuesday afternoon in temperatures so low. But I wondered if they had been moved or swayed by the weekend shooting. What did they make of the killing of an American citizen on an American street by American immigration agents? \"Huge bummer, wished it hadn't have happened, but I feel like there were a lot of choices made by some people that were not the right ones and that's just really unfortunate but what happens sometimes,\" one woman said. \"Don't bring a gun to a rally. That's just dumb,\" a man said. \"Isn't that the Second Amendment right?\" I said. \"Is it?\" he said. \"Isn't it?\" I replied, confused. \"Pick and choose your battles, right?\" he said, closing down the conversation. \"It's very unfortunate, it's just it's terribly sad… I think we have to regain control on many aspects,\" another woman said. A gulf made clear A couple of young women walked past and a few of their words were carried through the air. \"You see all those weird protesters?\" \"Yeah! I took some videos…\" \"Weird protesters\" - her tone was so telling. She couldn't comprehend their stance. It was like it had never occurred to her that there could be another way. It emphasised the gulf: two sides who can't even begin to understand the other. 'This is not America' The \"weird\" anti-Trump protesters were gathered on the crossroads a hundred metres away. I was surprised by their number, and their anger. \"I think everyone saw the video, it kind of speaks for itself. It was clearly murder,\" one man said. \"I think it's awoken a darkness that has been hiding in the shadows, and too many people are supporting him,\" a woman added. Then an elderly lady, with an emotion I hadn't anticipated: \"I'm 74 years old, and I've never seen anything like this in the history of my country. I'm appalled, I'm disgusted. I'm scared. They're being murdered in the streets for simply saying this is wrong. This is not America. That's just for the love of God. Please stop it.\" Read more:Watch: 'It's coming to your city if we don't stand up''The normal rules of engagement have been thrown out' The Trump show goes on The president's motorcade slipped in around the back. He wouldn't have seen or heard the protesters. He spoke for an hour. The only mention of the weekend events in Minneapolis? A sentence or two on crime. \"We have brought down crime very substantially. In Minnesota, we've taken out thousands of hard criminals, hardened, vicious, horrible criminals,\" he said. That's a questionable claim at best. The government's own statistics from ICE raids over the last year show that the overwhelming majority of those arrested had no criminal records at all. He'd not come to talk about Minneapolis. He'd come, reluctantly, to talk about the economy. That's what his team think he must focus on. \"We inherited the highest prices in the history of our country, and we've rapidly brought them down. And that's what we want to do…\" A couple of the protesters managed to sneak inside. There were minor interruptions. \"You know they're paid agitators right?\" the president said. Back outside, the protesters are not paid - of course not. But they are agitated. And it's growing."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n A third of international travellers say they are less likely to visit the US if proposals to scrutinise social media accounts are brought in, according to a survey. It suggests proposals to screen visitors' social media accounts and family histories - as announced last month - could cut tourism spending by $15bn (£10.8bn) and impact 157,000 jobs. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has proposed collecting five years' of social media information from travellers from selected countries - including the UK - who are eligible to visit without a visa through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The Trump administration has increased monitoring of international travellers and immigrants. The survey, commissioned by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), interviewed travellers across several of the roughly three dozen countries participating in the ESTA programme. The findings were combined with economic modelling assessing potential effects on international arrivals, visitor spending, and the wider tourism-related GDP and employment in the US. Two-thirds (66%) of more than 4,500 respondents said they were aware of the potential changes, suggesting the impact on people's travel plans could be felt quickly if the new rules are implemented. Trump defends 'safety' measure December's announcement stated that CBP would begin requesting additional information, including telephone numbers used by the visitor over the past five years, email addresses used over the past decade, and other details about family members. Asked at a White House event whether he was concerned the measure might affect US tourism, President Donald Trump disagreed. \"We want safety, we want security, we want to make sure we're not letting the wrong people come into our country,\" he said. The announcement did not specify what the administration would be looking for in social media accounts or why more extensive information was required. Change 'risks 150,000 jobs' Gloria Guevara, president and CEO of the WTTC, said: \"Security at the US border is vital, but the planned policy changes will damage job creation, which the US administration values so much. \"Our research finds that over 150,000 jobs could be lost if this policy goes ahead - about the same number usually created each quarter in the US. \"Even modest shifts in visitor behaviour, discouraged by the planned changes, will have real economic consequences for US travel and tourism, particularly in a highly competitive global market.\" Read More from Sky News:Congresswoman attacked with unknown substance Man guilty of assault after Barron Trump alerted police The increased focus on social media screening has angered immigration and free speech advocates, who are concerned about the administration's intentions and whether the measures could target critics of the government. Ms Guevara added: \"WTTC urges US policymakers to carefully assess this policy and its consequences for the economy and jobs. \"Travel and tourism is a critical driver of the American economy, job creation and international connectivity, with one in 10 jobs globally supported by the sector.\" According to the US commerce department, international visitor arrivals to the US in March 2025 totalled approximately 5.4 million, around 86.4% of the visitor volume recorded in March 2019, showing that inbound tourism remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.

In a statement, British Airways said: \"Safety and security underpins everything we do and we're supporting the authorities with their investigations.\" Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) said it was \"aware of an incident involving a British Airways aircraft that departed LAS last night and continued on to London, where it landed safely without further incident\". The tyre was retrieved from the airfield, and there were no reported injuries or damage to airport property, the spokesperson added."

Barron Trump, 19, was in the US when he told a 999 call handler that a woman was \"getting beat up\" in London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Prosecutors said 22-year-old Russian national Matvei Rumiantsev was jealous of her friendship with the US president's son, possibly because of his \"public profile\". He was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm between 17 and 18 January last year, and perverting the course of justice, after he wrote to the victim from prison asking her to withdraw her allegations. But Rumiantsev was cleared by the jury of rape and intentional strangulation relating to the same date when Mr Trump made his report to police, and another count of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024. The court had heard Rumiantsev answered her phone to a FaceTime call from Mr Trump and turned the screen to the woman, who was crying and screaming on the floor.

The guy had hung up. This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\" The court heard Rumiantsev became aware of the woman's friendship with Mr Trump in October 2024.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n There's a sense of crisis hanging over the US dollar - and it has consequences for all of us. Its roots can be traced back to last year when its value against a basket of other international currencies, including the pound, fell by 9%. We've seen that extend by more than 2% in January to date. Earlier on Tuesday, the pound was at its highest level against the dollar since July 2021. Money latest: The boom of chicken shops in UK What's behind it?  Much of the dollar weakness is being attributed to the actions and threats that have oozed from Donald Trump since he returned to power. The US president's trade war has damaged the effect the greenback (the world's reserve currency) has on the world stage. Wider foreign policy, including military action against Iran and in Venezuela too, hasn't helped. Remember the tariff threats against NATO allies over Greenland - since dropped? Other factors include market fears over the Federal Reserve's independence and huge increases in public spending which have called into question the chances of a budget deal on Capitol Hill to avert a fresh government shutdown ahead. In effect, we're seeing a crisis of confidence engulf the dollar under a weight of uncertainties, despite a healthy pace of economic growth in the world's largest economy. Consumer confidence data out this week added to the jitters of a big shift towards negative sentiment. Japan's contribution The pressures on the dollar have been compounded this week by speculation of joint US and Japanese central bank action to help stabilise the weak Yen. Its value has collapsed on the back of persistently low interest rates which have made it attractive as a source of credit to invest in higher-yielding currencies. The falling dollar, however, has eroded expectations that intervention will actually be needed. Isn't this all a problem for the president? Mr Trump described the dollar's fortunes as \"great\" on Tuesday. That triggered a further slump. There is more below on the effects, but there are pros and cons. A weaker dollar makes US exports more attractive - and imports (mostly subject to tariffs too) less attractive. There is a widely held suspicion that Mr Trump wants dollar values down as part of a push to shrink US trade deficits. The problem with that is that it risks a rush abroad to sell US treasuries - government debt - at a time of well established concerns over the sustainability of the US debt pile. That could spark a spike in government borrowing costs beyond America. What does it mean for Britain? The pound is at its highest level against the dollar since the summer of 2021, as we've said, standing above $1.38. It's fair to say that it's pretty much all down to dollar weakness than any great push for the pound. The result is good news for anyone travelling to the US, as your pound will go further. It's positive too for the cost of US goods and dollar-priced commodities when imported. It means less upwards pressure on UK inflation. Conversely, it does little to bolster competitiveness for UK exporters to the US, especially at a time of heightened US trade tariffs. The comforting element here though is that it's the same for other non-US nations, many of which have higher levels of tariffs against them. The weak dollar will hurt US earnings of UK-based companies and any US-based investment values, especially when transactions are booked in sterling. Many workplace pension schemes, for example, will have dollar-denominated assets. When you consider the extent of the dollar weakness, a fall of more than 11% in the dollar since President Trump's return will have cancelled out similar gains in an asset's value in dollar terms. When turned on its head, it makes UK market investment by Americans more attractive at a time when many US investors are searching out value and a hedge against an AI-driven stock market bubble. Dodging the 'falling chainsaw' Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist with payments company Corpay, said of the mood: \"With the 'tariff man' showing no sign of repentance and the US government headed into another shutdown, economic ‌policy uncertainty is soaring once again, leading to an intensification in the 'Sell America' trade that has dominated markets for the better part of a year. \"Positive fundamentals should eventually reassert themselves, but for now, no one is willing to catch the falling chainsaw that is the US dollar.\""

Mr Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot dead by immigration enforcement agents in Minneapolis at the weekend, just weeks another officer from the controversial unit killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the same city. Minneapolis: Catch up on latest updates The response from top White House officials, notably Trump adviser Stephen Miller and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, has provoked a furious backlash from Mr Pretti's family, leading Democrats, members of the public, and - increasingly - Republican politicians. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he wants to \"de-escalate\" the situation in Minneapolis following talks with the Democratic mayor and state governor, and described the killing of Mr Pretti as \"very unfortunate\". When leaving the White House for a rally in Iowa, Mr Trump was asked whether he agreed Mr Pretti was a \"would-be assassin\" - as described by Mr Miller. \"No. Not as a - no,\" the US president said. \"Listen, you can't walk in with guns. You can't do that, but it's just a very unfortunate incident.\" Later, when speaking to reporters before a rally in Iowa, Mr Trump repeated his view that \"certainly, (Mr Pretti) shouldn't have been carrying a gun\". He added: \"Look, bottom line, everybody in this room, we view that as a very unfortunate incident. \"Everyone, unless you're a stupid person.\" Under the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, the rights of citizens to carry a gun are protected. That right has traditionally been staunchly defended by Republicans. Local officials in Minnesota have also said Mr Pretti was carrying a handgun legally. 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  In an interview with Fox News, the US president added that he was going to \"de-escalate\" federal immigration operations in Minneapolis, but insisted this was \"not a pullback but a change\". It came ahead of an incident where a man lunged at Democratic Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar during a town hall and tried to spray her with an unknown substance. Ms Omar, who has faced repeated attacks from Mr Trump and his administration, and who has called for ICE to be abolished, did not appear to be injured and continued speaking after. Meanwhile, two Republican senators have broken ranks with the party and called for Ms Noem to resign in the wake of the shootings.

        "Headline": "Named Donald Trump's \"border tsar\" in 2024, Tom Homan is now in Minneapolis, the city at the centre of unrest over US immigration enforcement. ",
        "Content": "Donald Trump has sent his \"border tsar\" to Minneapolis as the White House seeks to ease unrest after two people were killed by federal agents. Tom Homan arrived in the midwestern city on 27 January to replace US border patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who was overseeing ICE (immigration and customs enforcement) when Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good were shot dead. The shake-up could be a sign the White House is trying to reset relations, replacing one agent who is known for robust tactics with one who is seen by some as a voice of restraint and moderation. Mr Trump said himself the administration was \"going to de-escalate a little bit\", calling the appointment of Mr Homan a \"little bit of a change\" rather than a \"pullback\". So who is Tom Homan, and how will he try to change things in Minneapolis? Four decades of experience  Having started his career as a police officer in West Carthage, New York, Mr Homan became a border patrol agent in 1984. He moved to ICE when it was created as part of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 and worked his way up to being acting director from 2017 to 2018, turning down the permanent job after being nominated by Mr Trump. Under the Obama administration, Mr Homan was a relatively low-key but influential figure. As head of the agency's enforcement and removal operations arm, he was tasked with tracking down people with outstanding deportation orders and removing them from the country. In 2013, the year Mr Homan took on the role, the US carried out the highest total of deportations since records began. He had planned to retire in 2017, just before Mr Trump began his first term in the White House, but was urged to stay at ICE by the incoming chief of staff John Kelly. In November 2024 Mr Homan was named \"border tsar\", which he said at the time was an honour. The position is directly appointed by the president and is responsible for deportation efforts across multiple agencies. Read more:What is ICE and what powers do its agents have? Advocate of Trump immigration policy Mr Homan is perhaps most widely associated with policies that separated thousands of parents from their children at the border during Mr Trump's first term. While Mr Trump defended the practice, in 2023 a federal judge ruled against the separation of families at the border after the American Civil Liberties Union successfully sued to halt it. In the build-up to Mr Trump's second term, Mr Homan vowed that immigration policy would focus on the \"worst of the worst\". \"You concentrate on the public safety threats and the national security threats first, because they're the worst of the worst,\" he told Fox News in 2024. Speaking to Sky News' US correspondent Mark Stone in September last year, Mr Homan reiterated that the administration was not out \"sweeping neighbourhoods\" but that if they \"run into a non-criminal during these operations, they absolutely are going to be taken into custody\". However, there are numerous recent examples of people with legal residency, as well as people within the asylum process - and even US citizens - being detained across the country. Unlike other top immigration officials, Mr Homan has not publicly spoken about the death of Mr Pretti, and after Ms Good's death he told CBS to \"let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation\". Backed by the White House In September, the Trump administration defended Mr Homan following reports he accepted $50,000 (£36,000) from undercover agents posing as businesspeople during an FBI operation. Mr Homan was accused of accepting the cash during a 2024 encounter with the agents who were undercover seeking government contracts that Mr Homan suggested could help them get in a second Trump term. The claims led to a bribery investigation that was ultimately shut down by the US Justice Department last year. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at the time the encounter with the undercover agents was an effort by the Biden administration to \"entrap one of the president's top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position\". 👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈  What is his plan for Minneapolis? Mr Homan's aim in Minneapolis is to move away from the broad, public neighbourhood sweeps that Mr Bovino had conducted in Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis and other cities and adopt a more traditional, targeted approach, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters. Discussions between Mr Trump and his advisers also included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, focusing the mission more narrowly on deportations, and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. On his first day in the city, Mr Homan met with Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, the city's police chief and, separately, Minnesota governor Tim Walz. Mr Frey said he had reiterated to Mr Homan his request that the enforcement action, known as Operation Metro Surge, \"come to an end as quickly as possible\", and that city leaders would remain in touch with the tsar. While Mr Walz said he had outlined the state's priorities, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and a reduction in the 3,000-strong force of federal agents deployed to the city. Read more:ICE victim wasn't a 'would-be assassin', Trump saysIt's genuinely frightening to wonder where America goes next Mr Homan said afterwards that talks were a \"productive starting point\" for additional conversations. While tensions remain high among the city's residents, Mark Amodei, the House Republican who oversees federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, said Mr Homan's deployment is \"an encouraging indicator that a pivot is happening\"."

        "Content": "\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n A third of international travellers say they are less likely to visit the US if proposals to scrutinise social media accounts are brought in, according to a survey. It suggests proposals to screen visitors' social media accounts and family histories - as announced last month - could cut tourism spending by $15bn (£10.8bn) and impact 157,000 jobs. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has proposed collecting five years' of social media information from travellers from selected countries - including the UK - who are eligible to visit without a visa through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The Trump administration has increased monitoring of international travellers and immigrants. The survey, commissioned by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), interviewed travellers across several of the roughly three dozen countries participating in the ESTA programme. The findings were combined with economic modelling assessing potential effects on international arrivals, visitor spending, and the wider tourism-related GDP and employment in the US. Two-thirds (66%) of more than 4,500 respondents said they were aware of the potential changes, suggesting the impact on people's travel plans could be felt quickly if the new rules are implemented. Trump defends 'safety' measure December's announcement stated that CBP would begin requesting additional information, including telephone numbers used by the visitor over the past five years, email addresses used over the past decade, and other details about family members. Asked at a White House event whether he was concerned the measure might affect US tourism, President Donald Trump disagreed. \"We want safety, we want security, we want to make sure we're not letting the wrong people come into our country,\" he said. The announcement did not specify what the administration would be looking for in social media accounts or why more extensive information was required. Change 'risks 150,000 jobs' Gloria Guevara, president and CEO of the WTTC, said: \"Security at the US border is vital, but the planned policy changes will damage job creation, which the US administration values so much. \"Our research finds that over 150,000 jobs could be lost if this policy goes ahead - about the same number usually created each quarter in the US. \"Even modest shifts in visitor behaviour, discouraged by the planned changes, will have real economic consequences for US travel and tourism, particularly in a highly competitive global market.\" Read More from Sky News:Congresswoman attacked with unknown substance Man guilty of assault after Barron Trump alerted police The increased focus on social media screening has angered immigration and free speech advocates, who are concerned about the administration's intentions and whether the measures could target critics of the government. Ms Guevara added: \"WTTC urges US policymakers to carefully assess this policy and its consequences for the economy and jobs. \"Travel and tourism is a critical driver of the American economy, job creation and international connectivity, with one in 10 jobs globally supported by the sector.\" According to the US commerce department, international visitor arrivals to the US in March 2025 totalled approximately 5.4 million, around 86.4% of the visitor volume recorded in March 2019, showing that inbound tourism remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.

Sky News has learnt that the discount chain, which was already on the brink of collapse when it was bought by Modella Capital last year, is expected to appoint Interpath to handle its insolvency as soon as Wednesday afternoon. TOFS, which opened its first shop in the late 1960s, trades from approximately 130 stores. Money latest: The UK's chicken shop boom Sources said that Interpath was expected to continue to trade the estate during the administration process. Modella has been holding talks with third parties about a sale of the business since filing a notice of intention to appoint administrators earlier this month, although retail experts are sceptical that a buyer for a meaningful part of TOFS will be found.

A combination of government policy, landlords' demands to take back many of TOFS' better sites and a poorly handled transition to a new logistics provider had impacted the discount chain's financial performance. Modella also owns businesses including WH Smith's historic high street estate, which it has rebranded as TG Jones, as well as Hobbycraft.

For this month's Our Verdict feature, our team of testers tried the 11 biggest movers in the market to see if any of them could give KFC a run for its money - find the results here. Here we look at what's behind the trend and asking whether KFC's place as the dominant market force is under threat. It might sound like a silly question, given the numbers clearly show it remains the UK behemoth, with 1,040 branches, a finger-licking turnover of £280.2m in 2024 and a plan, confirmed to Money, to open 500 more shops in the next decade. The company says its UK market share is 65% - but in the US, it is now behind Chick-fil-A, Popeyes and Raising Cane's for sales. All three have ambitious UK plans - and they're not alone. What's behind the explosion? \"Fast-food in the UK is undergoing a significant transformation, with chicken shops leading a rapid expansion in store numbers, a phenomenon that can be seen in high streets across the country,\" say food industry analysts Meaningful Vision. \"Our data reveals a tale of extraordinary growth, fierce competition.\" In 2024, chicken shop growth outpaced all other fast-food segments by nearly 12%, with London accounting for 21% of openings, the West Midlands 11% and the North West 12%. Industry insiders told Money the growth was driven by younger people, with market analysis showing Gen Zers visit fried chicken restaurants more than twice as often as the UK average. Find tips and deals in the Money blog Protein, late night snacks and TikTok A number of other ingredients are in the mix - one of which is consumer demand for protein-rich options. Last year we reported on Domino's expanding into fried chicken as consumer habits change. The company announced it was rolling out its Chick 'N' Dip brand to 187 of its 1,400 branches in the UK and Ireland. \"We recognise that people's diets are slightly changing,\" said chief executive Andrew Rennie. \"When you look... globally, chicken is the fastest-growing protein. So [it] seemed pretty obvious to me.\" Across the high street, McDonald's is also paying close attention. Thomas O'Neill, the company's head of menu, said last year: \"Chicken is a huge area of focus for us. A lot of our customers are looking for more options, more things to excite them, so we'll be doing a lot more with chicken. \"We've done a few different versions of the McCrispy and we're also looking at sauce, because when it comes to chicken, sauce is critical.\" Meaningful Vision chief executive Maria Vanifatova says chicken being a healthy and affordable option resonates strongly with consumers, especially those struggling with economic pressures. Other factors seem to be creating new market opportunities. In its latest trading update, KFC reported 44% sales growth in orders after 11pm. \"Late night snacking continues to be a growth opportunity,\" the company told Money. Innovative marketing has helped some of KFC's rivals exploit the public's increased appetite for fried chicken - and their strategies have provided a template for how any new restaurant can create a buzz in 2026. US import Dave's has opened five UK branches in the past two years. Jim Bitticks, its president, previously admitted social media had been a \"fundamental part of our business\". In 2017, co-founder Armen Oganesyan started posting about the fledgling restaurant. He'd tag local foodies with a plea to come have a try. Farley Elliott of Eater LA took the bait and his enthusiastic write-up prompted queues around the block. The business never looked back. While Bitticks says Instagram was the company's \"first love\", in recent years TikTok has felt like a natural home - and helped it attract the Gen Zers who are driving its market growth. The strategy has been to post unpolished content of customers enjoying its food, rather than in-house content. It didn't just work in LA, as anyone who has visited (and queued to get into) the Shaftesbury Avenue branch in central London can attest. Other chains have benefited from celebrity endorsements. Popeyes boasts about having catered for Jay Z and Beyonce's wedding in 2008, while London's community-focused Morley's counts Krept and Konan, KSI, Jesse Lingard, Mo the Comedian and Bella Hadid among its fans. Such endorsements show fried chicken is reaching beyond business, becoming a sub-culture of its own. Just look at the popularity of social media shows such as The Pengest Munch, Chicken Shop Dates and Hot Ones. Read more from Money:'We can't sell our house - and it's our neighbour's fault''Can I stop my neighbour using Ring doorbell? She's spying on me'Millions could be paying too much tax - here's what you need to know about tax codes The new contenders Popeyes, a subsidiary of Burger King's owner that is backed by private equity, has grown to more than 110 UK locations since 2021. It added 50 last year alone and told Sky News that it planned to do the same in 2026 - roughly matching KFC's new-branch rate. In a different corner of the sector is Wingstop, backed by global investors Sixth Street. It has grown to 86 locations in the UK and Ireland since 2018 and is targeting 200 within the next five years. As the name suggests, its menu is centred around wings rather than fried chicken, and its business model is focused on the younger diners we referenced above. \"From collaborations with up-and-coming DJs, partnerships with grassroot sports teams and campaigns with iconic fashion brands, Wingstop UKI differentiates itself from competitors by tapping into youth culture,\" it told the Money blog. Then there's... What about the home-grown contenders? KFC has always had rivals. While the US newcomers have entered the market in high footfall areas such as town centres and shopping centres, established British players such as Morley's, Sam's, Dixy, Miss Millie's, Favorite and Chicken Cottage have been quietly expanding in neighbourhoods across the country. Favorite, with a large concentration of its 80 stores in London, was founded in 1986. It attributes the market growth to the fact that \"customers are more value-aware than they were a few years ago\". But while the US imports have not been shy about sharing their ambitions, Favorite told Money it didn't share store targets but was aiming for \"sustainable growth\". Eighty-branch Chicken Cottage, with shops predominantly in London but also cities such as Manchester, Cambridge and Canterbury, used similar language. \"While we do have ambitions to grow our footprint, our priority is ensuring consistency, quality and long-term success for both our customers and franchise partners,\" it said. Morley's is another London-born chain that is spreading around the country, with recent openings in Nottingham, Portsmouth and Woking taking its branch tally to more than 130. Again, its ambitions seem more modest than 50 new branches a year... \"Morley's has never been about scale, it's about belonging and we are very much grounded in community. When we open new shops, it's because the brand already lives there through word of mouth, memories and shared experiences, or a desire to be a part of the culture that has grown organically through natural love for the brand.\" A lot of 'big claims': Is KFC worried? So to the headline of this feature: does KFC have something to worry about? We put the question directly to them. It pointed to 9% growth in its UK and Ireland branches in the third quarter of last year. Rob Swain, general manager from UK and Ireland, said: \"There's a lot of attention on fried chicken right now - new brands, new formats and big claims. \"But for KFC the growth in fried chicken isn't a new trend. Over the past 60 years, we've witnessed first-hand Britain falling in love with chicken, and we've been shaping the market every step of the way.\" Worried, it seems, might be a stretch - but the company's actions, rather than its words, suggest there's an acceptance it has to adapt. Its marketing team has unleashed bold advertising, from a zombie film pastiche to the folk horror-style All Hail Gravy. The imminent launch of a drinks offering called Kwench (designed to appeal to Gen Z, with hand-crafted shakes and iced coffees) and brand-new products such as rice bowls (which market newcomer Jollibee also serves) suggest executives are responding. What next? The UK's increased appetite for fried chicken shows no sign of waning. According to IGD, group-owned chicken shops will enjoy 8% growth by 2027. Retail and consumer expert Kate Hardcastle told industry magazine The Grocer that, down the line, survival would depend on restaurants being able to differentiate themselves. \"Over-clustered high streets will correct,\" she said. \"Brands with weak operations or copy-paste menus will feel it first, and the winner will balance pace with discipline - smart leases, tight unit economics and consistent quality. \"You can win on flavour (heat, profiles, sauces, proper brining), format (wings vs tenders vs sandwiches), dietary/halal assurance, speed, late-night access - and on delivery that arrives crisp, not soggy.\""

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n There's a sense of crisis hanging over the US dollar - and it has consequences for all of us. Its roots can be traced back to last year when its value against a basket of other international currencies, including the pound, fell by 9%. We've seen that extend by more than 2% in January to date. Earlier on Tuesday, the pound was at its highest level against the dollar since July 2021. Money latest: The boom of chicken shops in UK What's behind it?  Much of the dollar weakness is being attributed to the actions and threats that have oozed from Donald Trump since he returned to power. The US president's trade war has damaged the effect the greenback (the world's reserve currency) has on the world stage. Wider foreign policy, including military action against Iran and in Venezuela too, hasn't helped. Remember the tariff threats against NATO allies over Greenland - since dropped? Other factors include market fears over the Federal Reserve's independence and huge increases in public spending which have called into question the chances of a budget deal on Capitol Hill to avert a fresh government shutdown ahead. In effect, we're seeing a crisis of confidence engulf the dollar under a weight of uncertainties, despite a healthy pace of economic growth in the world's largest economy. Consumer confidence data out this week added to the jitters of a big shift towards negative sentiment. Japan's contribution The pressures on the dollar have been compounded this week by speculation of joint US and Japanese central bank action to help stabilise the weak Yen. Its value has collapsed on the back of persistently low interest rates which have made it attractive as a source of credit to invest in higher-yielding currencies. The falling dollar, however, has eroded expectations that intervention will actually be needed. Isn't this all a problem for the president? Mr Trump described the dollar's fortunes as \"great\" on Tuesday. That triggered a further slump. There is more below on the effects, but there are pros and cons. A weaker dollar makes US exports more attractive - and imports (mostly subject to tariffs too) less attractive. There is a widely held suspicion that Mr Trump wants dollar values down as part of a push to shrink US trade deficits. The problem with that is that it risks a rush abroad to sell US treasuries - government debt - at a time of well established concerns over the sustainability of the US debt pile. That could spark a spike in government borrowing costs beyond America. What does it mean for Britain? The pound is at its highest level against the dollar since the summer of 2021, as we've said, standing above $1.38. It's fair to say that it's pretty much all down to dollar weakness than any great push for the pound. The result is good news for anyone travelling to the US, as your pound will go further. It's positive too for the cost of US goods and dollar-priced commodities when imported. It means less upwards pressure on UK inflation. Conversely, it does little to bolster competitiveness for UK exporters to the US, especially at a time of heightened US trade tariffs. The comforting element here though is that it's the same for other non-US nations, many of which have higher levels of tariffs against them. The weak dollar will hurt US earnings of UK-based companies and any US-based investment values, especially when transactions are booked in sterling. Many workplace pension schemes, for example, will have dollar-denominated assets. When you consider the extent of the dollar weakness, a fall of more than 11% in the dollar since President Trump's return will have cancelled out similar gains in an asset's value in dollar terms. When turned on its head, it makes UK market investment by Americans more attractive at a time when many US investors are searching out value and a hedge against an AI-driven stock market bubble. Dodging the 'falling chainsaw' Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist with payments company Corpay, said of the mood: \"With the 'tariff man' showing no sign of repentance and the US government headed into another shutdown, economic ‌policy uncertainty is soaring once again, leading to an intensification in the 'Sell America' trade that has dominated markets for the better part of a year. \"Positive fundamentals should eventually reassert themselves, but for now, no one is willing to catch the falling chainsaw that is the US dollar.\""

Meta said it was notifying UK users over the age of 18 that they had the option to go ad-free. You get the notification when logging into your account or opening the app. It will be dismissible at first to give you time to think about your decision, but will then require you to select an option before continuing. What happens if you don't subscribe? If you decide not to sign up, you will continue to see personalised ads. You will still have the option to set your ad preferences in the settings, which allows you to influence the adverts you see and the data that's used to choose the ads that appear. Meta has made it clear it does not sell your personal data to advertisers. Why is it introducing the subscription?  The changes come after the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, published guidance for companies about ad-free subscriptions last year. Meta said it would give people a \"clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ad-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms\". The advertising model, known as \"consent or pay\", acts as a way for digital platforms to generate revenue from users who decline to be tracked across their services. Some news outlets have adopted the model, asking people to accept cookies to access their site or \"reject and pay\"."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n KKR, the American asset management behemoth, is in detailed talks about a multibillion pound deal to take a stake in the sports investment vehicle which owns stakes in Six Nations Rugby, women's professional tennis and the top flights of French and Spanish men's football. Sky News has learnt that KKR has emerged as the leading candidate to spearhead a roughly €2.75bn (£2.4bn) transaction that would see it become a shareholder in CVC Capital Partners' Global Sport Group (GSG). City sources said that KKR was in advanced negotiations about a deal, although other parties, including Ares Management, remained in the frame to participate. The alternative of a debt-only financing for GSG has also been explored in recent weeks. Money latest: The UK's chicken shop boom A deal involving KKR would underline the ambitions of GSG to become the most sophisticated global investor in elite sports teams, leagues and other related properties. KKR recently agreed to acquire Arctos Partners, a sports-focused private equity firm, for about $1bn, reinforcing burgeoning investor appetite in the sector. \n                  US plans to check tourists' social media 'putting people off travel'\n                 \n                  1,200 jobs at risk as The Original Factory Shop calls in administrators\n                 \n                  McDonald's axes nearly all vegan options | Money blog\n                 News of KKR's advanced interest in a stake in GSG comes on the same day that the CVC-backed vehicle confirmed its acquisition of Equine Network, the largest for-profit equestrian sports league in the US - which was revealed by Sky News last weekend. Announcing the deal on Wednesday, Gemma Wright, a partner in CVC's sports, media and entertainment team, said: \"The creation of Global Sport Group was driven by our conviction that premium sports leagues benefit from long-term, specialist ownership and collaboration. \"CVC's investment experience in sports spans over twenty years and, while much has changed in that time, sports IP remains a very attractive opportunity in which we continue to see significant potential for further innovation and growth.\" GSG, which is chaired by Marc Allera, the former BT Group consumer chief, also owns stakes in Premiership Rugby and international volleyball. Its new war chest is aimed at acquiring a series of other assets in sports with substantial commercial growth prospects. Once completed, the deal will enable CVC to remain invested in its sports portfolio for longer, while also paving the way for the sale of a minority stake in GSG or a future initial public offering on a major international exchange. Having made billions of dollars from its ownership of Formula One motor racing - one of the most lucrative deals in the history of sport - CVC has bought stakes in leagues and other assets spanning a spectrum of elite sporting assets over the last two decades. Its investment in the media rights to La Liga - Spain's equivalent of the Premier League - is expected to generate a handsome return for the firm, although a comparable deal in France has faced challenges amid broadcasters' financial challenges in the country. CVC's backing of global sports properties is intended to position it to maximise their commercial potential through new media and sponsorship rights deals, as well as their expansion into new formats aimed at drawing wider audiences amid rapid shifts in media consumption. Its sporting assets will continue to remain autonomous and independent of one another, despite the new umbrella holding entity. One expected benefit of the GSG approach would be the sourcing of new investment opportunities, with CVC potentially interested in the acquisition of further elite tennis tournaments. Global sports properties have become one of the hottest growth areas for private capital in recent years, with firms such as Ares, Silver Lake Partners and Bridgepoint all investing substantial sums in teams, leagues and other assets across the industry. KKR declined to comment, while CVC could not be reached for comment."

That's what we're about. \"These are policies that are firmly on the right but will appeal to the majority,\" she said. Ms Badenoch said that as leader, it was down to her to set her party's policy agenda. She was referring to Prosper UK, a centre-right movement set up by Sir Andy Street and former Tory Scottish leader Baroness Ruth Davidson, calling for the party to attract voters by occupying the centre ground. It has claimed moving to the centre ground will provide a point of difference with Reform UK. \"I want people to know the Conservative Party is sitting right on the common ground... I'm very welcoming of people having their own opinions. But I am the party leader,\" Ms Badenoch said. She said it was not about a battle of left-wing and right-wing, but about \"right and wrong\". \"We need to stop fighting the battles of the past. Most people out there want to hear about how their lives are going to be better, and we're showing that we have got a plan,\" Ms Badenoch said. She added that the Conservatives had tried to be a left-wing party in government and had \"lost our way\". \"So I'm not repeating those mistakes of the past,\" she said. In a speech delivered in central London on Wednesday morning, Ms Badenoch claimed both Reform UK and Labour had proven themselves to be \"drama queens\". She said that recent defections from her party to Reform were about personal ambition. \"This is a tantrum dressed up as politics,\" she told a room of Tory MPs and journalists. In what appeared to be a message to her former colleagues Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman, she said: \"To those who are defecting, who don't actually disagree with our policies, I will say: I'm sorry you didn't win the leadership contest. \"I'm sorry you didn't get a job in the shadow cabinet. I'm sorry you didn't get into the Lords. But you are not offering a plan to fix this country.\" She announced her party is looking for its \"next generation\" of MPs, and invited applications. \"We are building an army that is going to deliver meritocracy, dismantle the bureaucratic class, and get Britain working again,\" she said. Ms Badenoch also said that a statement saying the Conservatives had tried to look after Ms Braverman's mental health should never have gone out. After Ms Braverman defected to Reform UK on Monday, the Tories put out a statement saying: \"It was always a matter of when, not if, Suella [Braverman] would defect. The Conservatives did all we could to look after Suella's mental health, but she was clearly very unhappy.\" The party retracted the statement later that day following a backlash. Ms Badenoch told Sky News that after she discovered the statement had gone out she had it retracted immediately and the person who sent it had been \"spoken to\". \"That's not the sort of party that I'm running, and what I want people to see is that when we get things wrong, we own up, we apologise and we do something to fix it,\" she said. \"That's the difference between the Conservatives and all the other parties.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political editor\n              @BethRigby\n Be it Andy Burnham or Chinese President Xi Jinping, the prime minister was being extremely careful with his language on both the home and international front as he made his way over to Beijing for a five-day tour of China and Japan. When it came to the Chinese president, Sir Keir Starmer was a leader who knew that difficult conversations lay ahead but was at pains not to pre-empt any of that ahead of the first bilateral meeting in China between a UK prime minister and Chinese president in eight years. So when it came to questions about raising human rights issues - specifically the plight of the Uyghurs and the imprisonment of British pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai - with the Chinese leader, Starmer said on both matters he was \"not going to get ahead of himself\". He said only that there were concerns the government had raised in a number of ways, and told us he would give a readout once those meetings were had. Read more from Sky News: Who is Jimmy Lai?  It was the same on the matter of Ukraine, as the prime minister was pressed on whether he would ask Xi to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war. \"In relation to what I'll raise on this visit, obviously, I'm not going to get ahead of myself,\" he said. \"You know my practice, which is to raise issues that need to be raised. \"But I'm not going to go into specific sensitive issues on the way out.\" Burnham 'doing an excellent job' As for the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - well, the prime minister was as circumspect on that as he was when it came to the matter of dealing with the Chinese. Sir Keir insisted Burnham hadn't been told in advance that he wouldn't be accepted as the candidate for Gorton and Denton, after reports that Burnham had been warned off but persisted in the application anyway. \"I know who was talking to Andy on Saturday, and that wasn't said. That's Andy's position as well,\" said the PM. He also said he had spoken to Burnham yesterday as he heaped praise on his colleague, talking about getting \"tricky legislation\" through parliament with him in 2015 and working together in the aftermath of the horrendous synagogue attack in Manchester and on the Northern Powerhouse Rail project. \"He's doing an excellent job, he did an excellent job when he was in parliament,\" Starmer told the press pack. But when it came to the matter of whether he'd welcome Burnham back to parliament, the prime minister was more circumspect: \"As to what he wants to do when he's not mayor of Manchester any more, that's a matter for Andy, but he's doing a first class job,\" he said. That is hardly a ringing endorsement of wanting the mayor back in parliament, but it was clearly an effort by the prime minister, as he had done on Monday in the wake of Burnham being blocked for the Gorton and Denton by-election, to take the temperature back down after a fiery few days. Now, as he lands 5,000 miles away in Beijing, he trades one diplomatic minefield for another, as the prime minister on the one hand tries to drum up trade and deepen economic ties with China, while also raising a series of thorny issues when it comes to human rights, international alliances and national security. Read more:What's on the table in PM-Xi talks?Why trip carries real consequence - including at home 'I'm a pragmatist' When asked about Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's view that it was time for middle powers to unite and push back, Starmer said: \"I'm a pragmatist, a British pragmatist applying common sense.\" That means trying to navigate a path that accommodates the US and China, or to maintain ties with Washington and Brussels even when allies seem at odds. It also means trying to accommodate those in the Labour Party and his cabinet challenging his spot. Between Donald Trump's erratic behaviour and the unreconcilables back home, navigating matters with Xi doesn't, perhaps, look so bad."

        "Content": "\n          Scotland reporter\n              @Jenster13\n Scotland's health secretary has assured MSPs that he has \"no doubt\" the scandal-hit Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is \"safe\" after being repeatedly questioned during a Holyrood debate. It comes as the super hospital remains under intense scrutiny amid long-running infection concerns as the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry continues. In closing submissions earlier in January, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) admitted, on the balance of probabilities, that there was a \"causal connection between some infections suffered by patients and the hospital environment, in particular the water system\". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar tabled a motion in an attempt to have inquiry chairman Lord Brodie consider the political decision-making of the SNP government in the commissioning, construction and opening of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH). The motion also calls for the immediate full disclosure and preservation of key records held by Scottish government in connection with the hospital's contaminated water, ventilation system, the \"premature opening\" of the facility, and subsequent communications relating to the handling of infection. The motion will be voted on later on Wednesday, and looks set to be passed. Opening the debate, Mr Sarwar paid tribute to the three \"inspiring and courageous\" whistleblowers - Dr Teresa Inkster, Dr Penelope Redding and Dr Christine Peters. \n                  'It cost Molly her life': Is this one of the UK's biggest hospital scandals?\n                 \n                  'We were lied to, demeaned and smeared': Hospital inquiry families call for Glasgow health board bosses to 'face a reckoning'\n                 \n                  Call for urgent Holyrood statement after Glasgow health board's hospital infections admission\n                 He also praised the courage of the families who \"refused to stay silent\", including Kimberly Darroch, whose daughter Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the flagship hospital. Mr Sarwar said: \"I want to put on record that I recognise the extraordinary work that happens at this hospital every single day, and that many NHS staff go above and beyond. \"But that must be true for every patient and every family, and one failure is one too many. \"But this is not simply one failure. This is, without question, the biggest scandal in the history of this Scottish parliament.\" After being repeatedly asked by MSPs if the QEUH is currently safe for patients, Health Secretary Neil Gray eventually said: \"I have no doubt that the hospital is safe.\" Scotland reporter The Scottish Hospitals Inquiry has been examining the design and construction of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus in Glasgow as well as the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People and Department of Clinical Neurosciences (RHCYP/DCN) in Edinburgh. The inquiry was launched in response to concerns about patient safety in the wake of high levels of infection and deaths at the near £1bn QEUH, including that of 10-year-old Milly Main. Milly died in 2017 after contracting an infection within the Royal Hospital for Children's (RHC) cancer ward, which is within the QEUH campus. In closing submissions earlier in January, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said \"pressure was applied\" to open the hospital on time and on budget in 2015, and it is now clear it \"opened too early\" and \"was not ready\". The statement sparked a political firestorm, with the health board later issuing a clarification that the pressure to open the facility had come from within NHSGGC. NHSGGC also departed from earlier submissions and admitted, on the balance of probabilities, there was a \"causal connection between some infections suffered by patients and the hospital environment, in particular the water system\". However, it added that there was \"no definite link between infections and the water system\". The health board offered a \"sincere and unreserved apology\" to those affected by the \"historical failings\". It added: \"Comprehensive steps have been taken to address past physical defects in the building, with a significant and ongoing programme of maintenance and monitoring in place to ensure the quality and safety of the QEUH and RHC today.\" In response, families of patients affected have called for health board bosses to \"face a reckoning\" amid claims they were \"lied to\", \"demeaned and smeared\". The QEUH opened in 2015. At the time, Nicola Sturgeon was first minister, John Swinney was deputy first minister and finance secretary, and Shona Robison was health secretary. Scottish Labour have called for Lord Brodie to reopen the inquiry and question the trio. The party has also requested information from the SNP on if any emails, texts, letters, documents and other records from this time, including relevant WhatsApps and other messages, have been deleted. Read more:Is this one of the UK's biggest hospital scandals?Families call for health board bosses to 'face a reckoning' Mr Sarwar said: \"Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney and Shona Robison have not given testimony at the inquiry, and have not been cross-examined. Without that, we will never have the full picture of what happened. \"And there's a further risk, presiding officer, if political decision-making is not examined, ministers will attempt to use the final report of the inquiry as proof that the problems were contained entirely within the health board and could not have been prevented by government intervention. \"That claim cannot be allowed to stand without proper scrutiny.\" During First Minister's Questions last week, John Swinney said his government had shared all relevant evidence that addresses the terms of reference of the inquiry. However, he said he would be \"happy to release\" further documents if required, \"subject to any appropriate redactions\". Responding to the debate motion, Mr Gray said instructing the inquiry to investigate political decisions would breach the law. The health secretary said he understood the motivation behind Mr Sarwar's motion, but added: \"When something goes badly wrong in a project of this scale and significance, it is entirely reasonable to want every possible line of responsibility examined. \"However, while I recognise the concern that underpins the motion, I cannot support it because it would be incompatible with the legal framework that governs this inquiry. \"All statutory public inquiries in Scotland operate under the Inquiries Act, which was passed by this parliament. That act exists to protect the independence, integrity and credibility of inquiries. \"It gives inquiry chairs powerful legal tools, the power to compel witnesses, to require the production of documents, to take evidence on oath and to determine what evidence is relevant to their terms of reference. \"Those powers are not held by ministers, they are held by the independent inquiry chair. \"Any member seeking to support the motion's attempt to influence the action of the chair is calling for the government to act in a manner incompatible with that legislation which, of course, presiding officer, we cannot do.\""

So what are you paying for? Essentially, it's to get rid of personalised ads. Read all the latest Money news here We knew the subscription was coming after Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, announced it in September. But if you've also just received a notification, here's what you need to know when deciding whether to pay... How much is it?

Meta said it was notifying UK users over the age of 18 that they had the option to go ad-free. You get the notification when logging into your account or opening the app. It will be dismissible at first to give you time to think about your decision, but will then require you to select an option before continuing. What happens if you don't subscribe? If you decide not to sign up, you will continue to see personalised ads. You will still have the option to set your ad preferences in the settings, which allows you to influence the adverts you see and the data that's used to choose the ads that appear. Meta has made it clear it does not sell your personal data to advertisers. Why is it introducing the subscription?  The changes come after the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, published guidance for companies about ad-free subscriptions last year. Meta said it would give people a \"clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ad-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms\". The advertising model, known as \"consent or pay\", acts as a way for digital platforms to generate revenue from users who decline to be tracked across their services. Some news outlets have adopted the model, asking people to accept cookies to access their site or \"reject and pay\"."

        "Content": "US singer Chris Brown has appeared in court for a short hearing ahead of a trial over an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub. The 36-year-old spoke only to confirm his name as he attended London's Southwark Crown Court for a preliminary hearing in front of Judge Tony Baumgartner. Brown has previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm over what prosecutors ‍say was an \"unprovoked attack\" on a former friend, Abraham Diaw, at the Tape private members' club in Mayfair in February 2023. He has also denied having an offensive weapon - a bottle - in a public place, as well as a charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, at the venue's Dirty Martini club night. In court on Wednesday, the RnB singer wore a white jacket over a black shirt and smart grey trousers, and was accompanied by security guards as he entered the building. In the dock, he shook hands with his co-defendant, vocal coach Omololu Akinlolu, 39, who has also ​denied a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Lawyers in the case updated the judge on preparations for the trial during the eight-minute hearing, before bail conditions were reconfirmed. Brown, a two-time ⁠Grammy winner known for hits ‌such as Run It and With You, ‍was granted bail last year after paying a £5m security fee to the court as part of the agreement, which also allowed him to continue with a scheduled tour as he surrendered his passport on arrival in each country. Around a dozen supporters sat in the public gallery behind the pair during Wednesday's hearing, and the singer waved to them as he left. Brown was arrested at Manchester's Lowry Hotel in the early hours of 15 May last year by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. Both defendants are due to appear in court for a further pre-trial hearing in April, ahead of a trial scheduled for October."

Rhodri Talfan Davies, who led BBC Cymru Wales from 2011 to 2020, will assume the role of interim director general on 3 April.
