        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Sir Keir Starmer has boarded a nuclear-armed submarine as it returned from a lengthy patrol - in a rare showcasing of the UK's deterrent that will catch Russia's attention at a time of growing tensions. While being reminded about British nuclear strength though, Russian President Vladimir Putin will also doubtless take note of a potential weakness. HMS Vanguard was kept patrolling at sea for more than 200 days - one of the longest-ever deployments that will likely have put a huge strain on the submariners and the vessel - as issues with maintaining the ageing fleet make it harder to rotate the boats more quickly. The Royal Navy must keep one nuclear-armed submarine at sea at all times. The so-called \"continuous at-sea deterrence\" is the cornerstone of UK defence strategy and the ultimate guarantor of the nation's security. It is the first time a prime minister has visited one of the Royal Navy's four top-secret nuclear-armed submarines as it returned from a deterrent patrol - a moment known as \"Day Zero\" - in more than a decade. The last time this happened was with David Cameron in 2013. \n                  Starmer backs campaign to show Adolescence in schools\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves: 'People want to talk me down... I'll prove I can do it'\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 Video released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) showed Sir Keir, eyes pressed to pair of binoculars, and Defence Secretary John Healey sailing out to greet the ageing submarine - which had surfaced - as it re-entered UK waters off Scotland earlier in the week following what was reported to have been a 204-day patrol. The MoD declined to confirm the length of time the boat had been at sea. The longest known deployment - of 207 days - was carried out in 2021 by HMS Victorious. Patrols by one of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines - which used to last three months - have had to be extended in recent years because of prolonged periods of maintenance and repair work on the other boats. The fleet is operating well beyond its original in-service life of 25 years because of delays in the building of four replacement boats. In a show of support for what is known as the \"silent service\", the prime minister, dressed in a Royal Navy-style coat, could be seen in the footage stepping onto the topside of HMS Vanguard as it bobbed in the water. He was joined by Mr Healey as a line of submariners stood to attention, before they both clambered down a hatch into the vessel. The two men, followed by Admiral Sir Ben Key, the head of the Royal Navy, walked around inside the submarine and received what was described as a \"hot\" brief on the deployment. The official release of any information about the UK's nuclear deterrent is extremely rare. Filming of any of the boats is also highly unusual and strictly controlled. Britain's enemies will likely be scouring the images that were made public for any clues that might reveal any information about the military's most potent weapon and the ultimate guarantor of UK security. All audio was removed before release for security reasons. The decision to publish details and images about the visit appears designed to send a signal to Moscow that the UK remains a nuclear-armed power. It came as the prime minister and defence secretary prepared to visit a sprawling BAE Systems manufacturing site in Barrow, a port town in Cumbria, where the new generation of nuclear-armed submarines is finally being built to replace the Vanguard-class vessels. The whole programme to renew the UK's nuclear deterrent - the submarines, missiles and warheads - is expected to cost more than £30bn, with an additional contingency of £10bn - making it the UK's most expensive and important procurement programme. Sir Keir described Barrow as a \"blueprint\" for how defence spending can bolster security and boost economic growth by generating highly skilled jobs and opportunities. \"This week, I saw first-hand the sacrifice our submariners are making every day to keep our country safe, but I know they are only able to do that because of the support of the town of Barrow,\" he said, in remarks released in advance by the government. \"Each and every person living and working in Barrow is contributing to our nation's defence, whether that is building our world-class submarine programme, or supporting the workforce here through vital public services or proud family businesses.\" In a sign of the importance of the programme, the prime minister will lay the keel to the first Dreadnought-class boat on Thursday afternoon. In addition, the King has agreed to give the \"Royal\" title to the Port of Barrow \"in recognition of the town's unique and critical contribution to national security\", the government said. The Royal Navy has maintained one of four submarines loaded with nuclear-armed missiles permanently at sea since the first patrol was launched in 1969. But the age of the current fleet and increased requirement for repair work raise the risk of failure. Any break in the continuous at sea deterrence would be a devastating blow, undermining the UK's ability to deter the most existential of threats. As well as visiting HMS Vanguard earlier in the week, the prime minister and defence secretary also spoke with family members of the submariners who have been at sea for more than half a year. Four crew members returned to meet newborn babies."

Mr Trump also agreed to \"help locate\" additional air defence support in Europe after a request from the Ukrainian leader, a statement about the one-hour phone call said. Further talks will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the coming days, and the US will continue intelligence sharing with Ukraine, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Mr Trump also agreed to work to ensure missing Ukrainian children are returned home and both parties agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire involving attacks against energy facilities, with the US president saying the US \"could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise\", Ms Leavitt said. Secretary of state Marco Rubio also issued a statement about the call saying that \"President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. \"He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\" The White House statement added that Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy also reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely. \n                  Trump just wants a Ukraine-Russia deal - will Putin or Zelenskyy blink first?\n                 \n                  Trump's call with Putin: Ending one war, preparing for another? \n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship: From 'perfect' phone call to Oval Office clash\n                 The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the details of implementing a partial ceasefire, with discussions to include expanding any ceasefire to the Black Sea. By David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington DC The readout of the call from President Zelenskyy was conciliatory, repeatedly thanking Donald Trump for military support and for his peace efforts. In agreeing to a partial ceasefire, he held out the prospect of US investment in Ukrainian power - perhaps deeming that more of a security guarantee than the minerals deal. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" the Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz readout of Trump-Zelenskyy call said. Trump agreed to continue sharing intelligence but when Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence, he said he'd see what was available in Europe. That's a vague response from the US president as he seeks to keep both Ukraine and Putin on board. Those ambiguous words and the change in tone are both indicative of the sensitive point they've reached days before fresh negotiations in Saudi Arabia. \"We have never been closer to peace,\" Ms Leavitt added. In comments later on Wednesday, Mr Zelenskyy said that Mr Trump understands that Ukraine will not recognise occupied land as Russian, and that he would like the US president to visit Ukraine - adding that \"it would be helpful for Trump in his peace efforts\". In an earlier statement, President Zelenskyy said the two leaders had \"a positive, very substantive and frank conversation\". Mr Zelenskyy echoed much of Mr Trump's statement about what was decided, and said later that he \"felt no pressure\" from the US president.  \"We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace. We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year,\" Mr Zelenskyy said He added that Ukraine would \"continue working to make this happen\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"I stressed that Ukrainians want peace, which is why Ukraine accepted the proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" he said. \"I highlighted the importance of President Trump's concept of peace through strength.

The call marks the first time Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy have spoken since the disastrous confrontation in the White House last month. Mr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington expecting to sign a critical minerals deal but left early after he and Trump clashed in front of the world's cameras. On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin held a phone call lasting about an hour and a half in which the Russian leader rejected a full 30-day ceasefire. He agreed to not attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. The two countries also swapped 175 prisoners each earlier this morning."

        "Content": "Teenage boys in the UK are being blackmailed by Nigerian crime gangs that pose as young women online - with the National Crime Agency offering advice on what victims should do. NCA officials said boys as young as 14 have been targeted with \"sextortion\" scams on social networks including Snapchat and Instagram. Criminals trick them into sending sexual images - and then threaten to share the pictures with their family, friends and school unless they pay about £100. While most victims of child sexual exploitation are female, the NCA said 90% of online sextortion victims are boys aged 14 to 17. In some cases, those affected have taken their own lives out of fear the images will be shared. Marie Smith, a senior manager at the NCA's child exploitation and online protection command, called the abuse \"extremely disturbing\".

        "Content": " Israel says it has launched a \"limited ground operation\" to retake part of a key corridor in Gaza. The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive that shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January. As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which bisected northern Gaza from the south and had been used by Israeli forces as a military zone. It came as an international United Nations worker from Bulgaria was killed and five others, including a 51-year-old British man, were seriously wounded in a strike on a UN guesthouse in the Gaza Strip. Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the UN Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike that killed the worker in the central city of Deir al Balah but said the explosive ordnance was \"dropped or fired\" and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. The UN body, known as UNOPS, carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world. Oren Marmorstein, spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Sky News that the country carried out an initial investigation which found there was \"no connection\" between the strike and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). \n                  Fresh strikes in Gaza with at least 14 killed - as Israel army targets Hamas military site\n                 \n                  Satellite images reveal thousands of new tents near Gaza border area under Israeli evacuation order\n                 \n                  Gaza: Teen brother and sister among Palestinians killed by Israel in one of war's deadliest days\n                 Speaking to Mark Austin on the News Hour, he said: \"Of course, we express our sorrow when it comes to the death of a Bulgarian citizen, a UN worker. \"But no connection has been found. And even more so, we are now working in order to evacuate the body and the wounded will be treated in hospitals in Israel.\" Mr Marmorstein did not say who Israel believes is responsible for the strike but said it may be connected to a \"terrorist organisation\".  The IDF, which has carried out a massive series of airstrikes throughout Gaza since early on Tuesday, had earlier denied reports that it had targeted the UN compound. But Mr Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the worker was killed.  He said the agency had contacted the IDF after the first strike and confirmed that it was aware of the facility's location. The UN's secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the staff member's death and condemned attacks on UN personnel. The British man who was injured in the strike was working for the Mines Advisory Group (Mag), the demining charity said. Darren Cormack, the chief executive of the charity, said: \"Our colleague, who is 51 and British, was conducting an explosive hazards assessment at a Unops building when the incident happened this morning \"He was transferred to hospital in Gaza for treatment and has now been evacuated to a hospital in Israel. His condition is not known.\" The war in Gaza has been among the deadliest conflicts ever for humanitarian workers, according to the UN. At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes, the Gaza health ministry said. Mr Marmorstein insisted on Sky News that the figures are \"anything but accurate\". The IDF claims it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Gaza's health ministry records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it had overnight attacked a Hamas military site from which the militant group planned to launch strikes into Israel. The IDF targeted the site in northern Gaza as it was where \"preparations were being made to fire projectiles at Israeli territory\", the military said in a statement. Read more:Teen brother and sister among Palestinians killed by IsraelWhat happened to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire The Israeli navy also struck several vessels in the coastal area of Gaza as they were intended to be used for \"terrorist activities\", the IDF claimed. Israel issued fresh evacuation orders on Wednesday for different areas across the Gaza Strip and told people to move to known shelters in Khan Younis and western Gaza City. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the resumption of Israeli military action in Gaza, as Downing Street urged both sides to respect international law. Middle East correspondent Israel is facing increasing international opposition to its new assault on Gaza, and from some of its close allies including Britain and France whose leaders have both voiced concerns today. But in actions, and words, the Israeli government is defying those calling for it to stop the attacks.\n The Israel Defense Forces has announced what it describes as “limited” ground operations in central and southern Gaza, but limited for how long?\n Israel's defence minister has warned of \"total devastation\" if Hamas doesn’t surrender. Beyond the threats, it's not clear what Israel's strategy is.  The government failed to achieve its two war aims - to eliminate Hamas and return the hostages - during fifteen and a half months of brutal fighting, so how will it have more success now?\n One answer might be Netanyahu's belief that President Trump won't try to rein him in as Joe Biden did.  But for how long will the White House support a new phase of the war in Gaza? Trump is an impatient man, and he wants a Gaza peace deal as part of his wider ambitions to resolve the world's conflicts. \n If Netanyahu's new offensive doesn't deliver quick results, the White House might not remain so supportive.  The latest strikes come weeks after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages for prisoners and were set to negotiate an extension to the truce that was meant to bring about an eventual end to the war. But those negotiations never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war. During the ceasefire period, 33 hostages were released, along with nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. There are 59 hostages still in captivity, of whom Israel believes 35 are dead. More than one million people risked being left without food parcels in March if aid was not allowed into Gaza, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the Food Security Sector as saying. The war, sparked by Hamas' 7 October 2023 killing of 1,200 people and capture of 250 more in southern Israel, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in the Strip, Gazan health officials say."

The Kurdish troops have guarded these camps packed with ISIS wives and relatives for more than six years.

Kane Ahmed, the commander of Syrian Democratic Forces' (SDF) troops for al Hol camp, told us: \"The threat of ISIS has increased both inside and outside the camp... especially after the fall of the Syrian regime, it's gone up a lot and we see attempts by them to escape on almost a daily basis.\" He shows us the perimeter fence which has been reinforced several times in places. \"It's not secure enough,\" he says. The troops watch these camps through three round-the-clock CCTV rooms and often mount raids after receiving intelligence about IS operations. \"We know they are receiving help from outside IS cells who smuggle weapons inside and help smuggle people out,\" the commander says. Delivery trucks have been used to smuggle detainees out in hollowed out seats. Waterways have been turned into routes to sneak the children out. \"They are recruited by ISIS as the next cubs of the caliphate,\" the commander warns. The camp managers have long warned about the lack of rehabilitation facilities and psychological help for these children to de-radicalise the young.

        "Content": " A teenager who was planning a mass shooting at his old primary school has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 49 years for murdering his family. Nicholas Prosper, from Luton, pleaded guilty to the murder of his mother, Juliana Falcon, 48, and his siblings, Kyle Prosper, 16, and 13-year-old Giselle Prosper at Luton Crown Court in February. In sentencing, the judge said the words \"heartless and brutal\" were insufficient to describe the horror of the last moments suffered by his victims. Their bodies were found at their flat in the town in September last year. Read more:How mother of triple killer foiled her son's school shooting plot  The 19-year-old planned to carry out a mass shooting at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, where Prosper and his siblings had been pupils, he admitted to police. The court heard his aim was to be known as \"the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century\". Police believe he killed his family when his mother found a shotgun he had bought using a fake certificate and confronted him. His scheme was eventually foiled by officers who spotted him in the street immediately after the murders and arrested him. The loaded shotgun was found hidden in bushes nearby, along with more than 30 cartridges. As his sentencing started on Tuesday, the court heard that \"his planning was cold, deliberate and without sympathy or emotion towards the actual victims or potential victims\". Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the details of Prosper's case were \"chilling\", and that he had wanted to emulate and outdo the US school massacres at Sandy Hook in 2012 and Virginia Tech in 2007. His \"main wish\", according to the prosecution, was notoriety, telling a prison nurse \"I wish I had killed more\".  Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Prosper had not hated his mother or siblings and had \"had a good life with them\", but that his intention had been to kill them in their sleep and rape his sister. \"Each victim suffered the anguish of anticipating or being aware of the deaths of others,\" she said. In explaining why she had opted not to impose a whole-life sentence, the judge said: \"A minimum term does not in any way equate to the value of the life of a murder victim, still less three such victims.\" She acknowledged that Prosper had autism spectrum disorder, but said she was satisfied that it did not affect his decision-making enough to be the primary reason why he carried out the killings. \"A murder spree with the sole aim of glorifying the name of the perpetrator in the history of mass killers is what you intended,\" she said. \"You have also expressed no remorse and no sorrow. Indeed, when asked by the psychiatrist if you would try to commit another massacre, you replied: 'Well, that's their job to stop me getting the weapons if I get released'.\" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb added: \"Your plans were intelligent, calculated and unselfish. Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century. \"Words such as heartless and brutal are insufficient to describe the horror of those last moments of the people who were closest to you.\"  Read more from Sky News:Parents of man suspected of killing wife arrestedIstanbul mayor and main rival to Erdogan arrested A statement from the family of the victims was read outside the court.

Julie was a strong, loving mother to her four children, who were her absolute world. \"Kyle was a kind and funny young man who loved football and boxing. He was a big talent with massive potential. Giselle was a beautiful soul and caring young girl with an infectious smile. She was also an exceptional pupil at school and was loved dearly by her friends.\""

        "Content": "\n          Security and Defence Editor\n              @haynesdeborah\n  Sir Keir Starmer has boarded a nuclear-armed submarine as it returned from a lengthy patrol - in a rare showcasing of the UK's deterrent that will catch Russia's attention at a time of growing tensions. While being reminded about British nuclear strength though, Russian President Vladimir Putin will also doubtless take note of a potential weakness. HMS Vanguard was kept patrolling at sea for more than 200 days - one of the longest-ever deployments that will likely have put a huge strain on the submariners and the vessel - as issues with maintaining the ageing fleet make it harder to rotate the boats more quickly. The Royal Navy must keep one nuclear-armed submarine at sea at all times. The so-called \"continuous at-sea deterrence\" is the cornerstone of UK defence strategy and the ultimate guarantor of the nation's security. It is the first time a prime minister has visited one of the Royal Navy's four top-secret nuclear-armed submarines as it returned from a deterrent patrol - a moment known as \"Day Zero\" - in more than a decade. The last time this happened was with David Cameron in 2013. \n                  Starmer backs campaign to show Adolescence in schools\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves: 'People want to talk me down... I'll prove I can do it'\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 Video released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) showed Sir Keir, eyes pressed to pair of binoculars, and Defence Secretary John Healey sailing out to greet the ageing submarine - which had surfaced - as it re-entered UK waters off Scotland earlier in the week following what was reported to have been a 204-day patrol. The MoD declined to confirm the length of time the boat had been at sea. The longest known deployment - of 207 days - was carried out in 2021 by HMS Victorious. Patrols by one of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines - which used to last three months - have had to be extended in recent years because of prolonged periods of maintenance and repair work on the other boats. The fleet is operating well beyond its original in-service life of 25 years because of delays in the building of four replacement boats. In a show of support for what is known as the \"silent service\", the prime minister, dressed in a Royal Navy-style coat, could be seen in the footage stepping onto the topside of HMS Vanguard as it bobbed in the water. He was joined by Mr Healey as a line of submariners stood to attention, before they both clambered down a hatch into the vessel. The two men, followed by Admiral Sir Ben Key, the head of the Royal Navy, walked around inside the submarine and received what was described as a \"hot\" brief on the deployment. The official release of any information about the UK's nuclear deterrent is extremely rare. Filming of any of the boats is also highly unusual and strictly controlled. Britain's enemies will likely be scouring the images that were made public for any clues that might reveal any information about the military's most potent weapon and the ultimate guarantor of UK security. All audio was removed before release for security reasons. The decision to publish details and images about the visit appears designed to send a signal to Moscow that the UK remains a nuclear-armed power. It came as the prime minister and defence secretary prepared to visit a sprawling BAE Systems manufacturing site in Barrow, a port town in Cumbria, where the new generation of nuclear-armed submarines is finally being built to replace the Vanguard-class vessels. The whole programme to renew the UK's nuclear deterrent - the submarines, missiles and warheads - is expected to cost more than £30bn, with an additional contingency of £10bn - making it the UK's most expensive and important procurement programme. Sir Keir described Barrow as a \"blueprint\" for how defence spending can bolster security and boost economic growth by generating highly skilled jobs and opportunities. \"This week, I saw first-hand the sacrifice our submariners are making every day to keep our country safe, but I know they are only able to do that because of the support of the town of Barrow,\" he said, in remarks released in advance by the government. \"Each and every person living and working in Barrow is contributing to our nation's defence, whether that is building our world-class submarine programme, or supporting the workforce here through vital public services or proud family businesses.\" In a sign of the importance of the programme, the prime minister will lay the keel to the first Dreadnought-class boat on Thursday afternoon. In addition, the King has agreed to give the \"Royal\" title to the Port of Barrow \"in recognition of the town's unique and critical contribution to national security\", the government said. The Royal Navy has maintained one of four submarines loaded with nuclear-armed missiles permanently at sea since the first patrol was launched in 1969. But the age of the current fleet and increased requirement for repair work raise the risk of failure. Any break in the continuous at sea deterrence would be a devastating blow, undermining the UK's ability to deter the most existential of threats. As well as visiting HMS Vanguard earlier in the week, the prime minister and defence secretary also spoke with family members of the submariners who have been at sea for more than half a year. Four crew members returned to meet newborn babies."

        "Content": "Teenage boys in the UK are being blackmailed by Nigerian crime gangs that pose as young women online - with the National Crime Agency offering advice on what victims should do. NCA officials said boys as young as 14 have been targeted with \"sextortion\" scams on social networks including Snapchat and Instagram. Criminals trick them into sending sexual images - and then threaten to share the pictures with their family, friends and school unless they pay about £100. While most victims of child sexual exploitation are female, the NCA said 90% of online sextortion victims are boys aged 14 to 17. In some cases, those affected have taken their own lives out of fear the images will be shared. Marie Smith, a senior manager at the NCA's child exploitation and online protection command, called the abuse \"extremely disturbing\". As part of an NCA awareness campaign, she urged victims: \"Do not pay - stay calm. We can help. If you pay once, they will just demand more.\" \n                  Paedophile who spent 27 years on the run guilty of dozens of child sexual abuse offences\n                 \n                  Abolished indefinite prison sentences still in place - despite prisoner numbers approaching pre-release scheme levels\n                 \n                  More than 23,000 dogs stolen in UK in 10 years, figures show\n                 Sextortion 'unimaginably cruel' Most of the offences are committed by people from West African countries, including Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. \"Nothing is off the cards and we hope to hold these criminals accountable,\" Ms Smith said. NCA director of threat leadership Alex Murray said: \"Sextortion is unimaginably cruel and can have devastating consequences for victims. \"This campaign will help empower young boys, giving them the knowledge to spot the dangers posed by this crime type and how to report it. \"It supports them to understand that if it does happen, it is never their fault. It will also take the advantage away from the criminals responsible, whose only motivation is financial gain. \"Sadly, teenagers in the UK and around the world have taken their own lives because of 'sextortion', which has been a major factor behind launching this campaign.\" Read more:Investigation under way after girl, 8, targeted in sextortion plotHow parents and teenagers can tackle 'sextortion' Last year alone, the NCA's CEOP safety centre received 380 sextortion reports.

        "Content": " The public inquiry into Lucy Letby's crimes will not be halted, its chairwoman has ruled, despite requests from hospital executives to do so. On Wednesday, Lady Justice Thirlwall refused the application from the senior hospital managers to pause the inquiry, pending the outcome of Letby's latest challenge to her multiple convictions for murder and attempted murder. Since September, the Thirlwall Inquiry has been examining how the former neonatal nurse was able to murder or attack 14 babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Evidence was completed last month and the final report is due to be published in November. In closing submissions on Tuesday, Kate Blackwell QC, representing former chief executive Tony Chambers, former medical director Ian Harvey, former director of nursing Alison Kelly and former HR director Sue Hodkinson, said there was a \"real possibility\" that Letby's convictions may be overturned, and to continue the report work would be unfair to her clients. The former senior managers have also made a parallel request to the health secretary, Wes Streeting, to suspend the inquiry on similar grounds. Richard Baker KC, representing the families of Letby's victims, said the applications to stop the inquiry were motivated by a desire from the UK's most prolific child serial killer to \"attempt to control the narrative\" and for the executives \"to avoid criticism\". \n                  Families of Lucy Letby victims hit out at calls to suspend public inquiry\n                 \n                  Lucy Letby's lawyers call for baby deaths inquiry to be suspended\n                 \n                  Lucy Letby: Police investigation into hospital widened to include gross negligence manslaughter\n                 Letby's latest legal challenge to her multiple convictions is based on recent medical evidence presented by an international panel of neonatologists and paediatric specialists, working pro bono for Letby's defence team, which found that bad medical care and natural causes were the reasons for the collapses and deaths attributed to the 35-year-old nurse. Those findings will be passed to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, and Letby's legal team hopes her case will eventually be referred back to the Court of Appeal after two failed bids. Sitting at Liverpool Town Hall, Lady Justice Thirlwall said: \"I'm not satisfied that there is any unfairness in the current situation. I am satisfied that the process has been fair. \"As I have said before, it is not the actions of Lucy Letby that I am scrutinising, it is the actions of all those who were in the hospital... and what they did at the time, in the light of what they knew at the time and in the light of what they should have known at the time.\" Read more:Why are there calls to suspend Letby inquiry?Hospital chief 'concerned about wrongful Letby conviction'Senior Tory MP calls for Letby retrial She continued: \"There are already large numbers of concessions about what was not done and what should have been done. Those significant concessions come from the organisations and the hospital including the doctors and the managers. \"Perhaps principle, and most obvious, among the concessions made by just about everyone is the acknowledgement that there was a total failure of safeguarding at every level, and that will not change. \"It is a matter which has been debated at some length in the course of the inquiry and one that it seems to me will inevitably feature in any report.\" Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. Letby's barrister Mark McDonald said today's decision was \"a great shame\". \"Sadly, despite the millions of pounds that have been spent, any report and recommendations will one day be seen as unreliable and redundant. \"I will continue to represent Ms Letby without fear or favour and ensure the many flaws in the case are put before the Court of Appeal. If the numerous experts who have come forward are right, a young innocent woman is in prison for crimes she has not committed.\""

        "Content": "A wanted man suspected of killing his wife before her body was found in a car boot has been charged with her murder. Pankaj Lamba, who is the subject of an international manhunt following Harshita Brella's death last year, has also been charged with two counts of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour. Ms Brella, 24, was found in the boot of a silver Vauxhall Corsa in Brisbane Road, Ilford, east London, on 14 November. A post-mortem examination found she died from strangulation. Police had previously named Lamba, who lived with Ms Brella in Corby, Northamptonshire, as the main suspect in the case. They believe the 23-year-old fled the UK after his wife's death. Samantha Shallow, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said on Wednesday that charges have been brought after it reviewed a \"file of evidence\" submitted by Northamptonshire Police. \n                  PM makes rare visit to nuclear-armed submarine to show UK's strength - but Putin will notice a potential weakness\n                 \n                  Foreign donations to UK political parties set to be restricted, amid rumours Elon Musk is planning to give £80m to Reform\n                 \n                  Teen boys blackmailed by gangs in 'sextortion' scams - as victims given new advice on what to do\n                 Lamba has been charged in his absence, and the charges were laid at Northampton Magistrates' Court. The development comes after police in India arrested Lamba's parents, mother Sunil Devi and father Darshan Singh, on 14 March. Police in Delhi, whose investigation is separate to the one being carried out in the UK, have registered the case under the offence of dowry death. This refers to when a woman is murdered or driven to suicide over a dispute about dowry - property or money given by a bride to her husband when they get married. Under the Indian penal code, dowry deaths involve the fatality of a woman \"caused by burns or bodily injury... within seven years of her marriage, if she was subjected to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, a dowry demand\". Surendra Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police in Delhi, said the force is now trying to trace Lamba's sister. He said: \"Lamba's sister Uma is currently absconding and raids are on to nab her as well.\" Sonia Dabas, sister of Ms Brella, told Sky News: \"This is a good development in the case that the parents have been arrested and criminal investigations begun. \"The police have so far been sleeping and non-active on this case. Now that Delhi High Court has asked for a status report next week from the Delhi police, the federal home and foreign ministry they have got their act together. It's the pressure from the courts.\" Read more from Sky News:Mother of triple killer died foiling school shooting plotPM backs campaign to show Adolescence in schoolsMan admits killing mum and daughter in motorway crash Ms Brella's family believe Lamba was on a flight to Delhi that arrived on 12 November and Ms Dabas suggested \"he may be somewhere in Haryana or near Chandigarh\", states in northern India. The village of Dharoli in Haryana is where Lamba's family is from and his father, mother and sister still live there. When news of the manhunt for Lamba initially broke, the village of about 2,000 people closed ranks and stopped outsiders from entering for fear of the disgrace the case brought to the community. Lamba lived in the village until he finished primary school, before going on to pursue higher education while living with his uncle and aunt in Gurugram, south of Delhi. Lamba and Ms Brella entered into an arranged marriage, with a legal wedding held in August 2023, before the couple moved to the UK in April 2024. Following the charges that were brought in the UK on Wednesday, Detective Chief Inspector Johnny Campbell from Northamptonshire Police said: \"We are committed to securing justice for Harshita and her family and continue to offer our support at this difficult time. \"This remains an active investigation and as such, there continue to be aspects of the case that we are unable to comment on at this time. We would urge all parties to respect the judicial process to ensure the integrity of the proceedings.\""

Mr Trump also agreed to \"help locate\" additional air defence support in Europe after a request from the Ukrainian leader, a statement about the one-hour phone call said. Further talks will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the coming days, and the US will continue intelligence sharing with Ukraine, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Mr Trump also agreed to work to ensure missing Ukrainian children are returned home and both parties agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire involving attacks against energy facilities, with the US president saying the US \"could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise\", Ms Leavitt said. Secretary of state Marco Rubio also issued a statement about the call saying that \"President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. \"He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\" The White House statement added that Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy also reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely. \n                  Trump just wants a Ukraine-Russia deal - will Putin or Zelenskyy blink first?\n                 \n                  Trump's call with Putin: Ending one war, preparing for another? \n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship: From 'perfect' phone call to Oval Office clash\n                 The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the details of implementing a partial ceasefire, with discussions to include expanding any ceasefire to the Black Sea. By David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington DC The readout of the call from President Zelenskyy was conciliatory, repeatedly thanking Donald Trump for military support and for his peace efforts. In agreeing to a partial ceasefire, he held out the prospect of US investment in Ukrainian power - perhaps deeming that more of a security guarantee than the minerals deal. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" the Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz readout of Trump-Zelenskyy call said. Trump agreed to continue sharing intelligence but when Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence, he said he'd see what was available in Europe. That's a vague response from the US president as he seeks to keep both Ukraine and Putin on board. Those ambiguous words and the change in tone are both indicative of the sensitive point they've reached days before fresh negotiations in Saudi Arabia. \"We have never been closer to peace,\" Ms Leavitt added. In comments later on Wednesday, Mr Zelenskyy said that Mr Trump understands that Ukraine will not recognise occupied land as Russian, and that he would like the US president to visit Ukraine - adding that \"it would be helpful for Trump in his peace efforts\". In an earlier statement, President Zelenskyy said the two leaders had \"a positive, very substantive and frank conversation\". Mr Zelenskyy echoed much of Mr Trump's statement about what was decided, and said later that he \"felt no pressure\" from the US president.  \"We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace. We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year,\" Mr Zelenskyy said He added that Ukraine would \"continue working to make this happen\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"I stressed that Ukrainians want peace, which is why Ukraine accepted the proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" he said. \"I highlighted the importance of President Trump's concept of peace through strength.

The call marks the first time Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy have spoken since the disastrous confrontation in the White House last month. Mr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington expecting to sign a critical minerals deal but left early after he and Trump clashed in front of the world's cameras. On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin held a phone call lasting about an hour and a half in which the Russian leader rejected a full 30-day ceasefire. He agreed to not attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. The two countries also swapped 175 prisoners each earlier this morning."

        "Content": " Israel says it has launched a \"limited ground operation\" to retake part of a key corridor in Gaza. The move appeared to deepen a renewed Israeli offensive that shattered a ceasefire with Hamas that had begun in January. As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which bisected northern Gaza from the south and had been used by Israeli forces as a military zone. It came as an international United Nations worker from Bulgaria was killed and five others, including a 51-year-old British man, were seriously wounded in a strike on a UN guesthouse in the Gaza Strip. Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the UN Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike that killed the worker in the central city of Deir al Balah but said the explosive ordnance was \"dropped or fired\" and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. The UN body, known as UNOPS, carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world. Oren Marmorstein, spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Sky News that the country carried out an initial investigation which found there was \"no connection\" between the strike and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). \n                  Fresh strikes in Gaza with at least 14 killed - as Israel army targets Hamas military site\n                 \n                  Satellite images reveal thousands of new tents near Gaza border area under Israeli evacuation order\n                 \n                  Gaza: Teen brother and sister among Palestinians killed by Israel in one of war's deadliest days\n                 Speaking to Mark Austin on the News Hour, he said: \"Of course, we express our sorrow when it comes to the death of a Bulgarian citizen, a UN worker. \"But no connection has been found. And even more so, we are now working in order to evacuate the body and the wounded will be treated in hospitals in Israel.\" Mr Marmorstein did not say who Israel believes is responsible for the strike but said it may be connected to a \"terrorist organisation\".  The IDF, which has carried out a massive series of airstrikes throughout Gaza since early on Tuesday, had earlier denied reports that it had targeted the UN compound. But Mr Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the worker was killed.  He said the agency had contacted the IDF after the first strike and confirmed that it was aware of the facility's location. The UN's secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the staff member's death and condemned attacks on UN personnel. The British man who was injured in the strike was working for the Mines Advisory Group (Mag), the demining charity said. Darren Cormack, the chief executive of the charity, said: \"Our colleague, who is 51 and British, was conducting an explosive hazards assessment at a Unops building when the incident happened this morning \"He was transferred to hospital in Gaza for treatment and has now been evacuated to a hospital in Israel. His condition is not known.\" The war in Gaza has been among the deadliest conflicts ever for humanitarian workers, according to the UN. At least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the fresh wave of strikes, the Gaza health ministry said. Mr Marmorstein insisted on Sky News that the figures are \"anything but accurate\". The IDF claims it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Gaza's health ministry records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it had overnight attacked a Hamas military site from which the militant group planned to launch strikes into Israel. The IDF targeted the site in northern Gaza as it was where \"preparations were being made to fire projectiles at Israeli territory\", the military said in a statement. Read more:Teen brother and sister among Palestinians killed by IsraelWhat happened to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire The Israeli navy also struck several vessels in the coastal area of Gaza as they were intended to be used for \"terrorist activities\", the IDF claimed. Israel issued fresh evacuation orders on Wednesday for different areas across the Gaza Strip and told people to move to known shelters in Khan Younis and western Gaza City. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the resumption of Israeli military action in Gaza, as Downing Street urged both sides to respect international law. Middle East correspondent Israel is facing increasing international opposition to its new assault on Gaza, and from some of its close allies including Britain and France whose leaders have both voiced concerns today. But in actions, and words, the Israeli government is defying those calling for it to stop the attacks.\n The Israel Defense Forces has announced what it describes as “limited” ground operations in central and southern Gaza, but limited for how long?\n Israel's defence minister has warned of \"total devastation\" if Hamas doesn’t surrender. Beyond the threats, it's not clear what Israel's strategy is.  The government failed to achieve its two war aims - to eliminate Hamas and return the hostages - during fifteen and a half months of brutal fighting, so how will it have more success now?\n One answer might be Netanyahu's belief that President Trump won't try to rein him in as Joe Biden did.  But for how long will the White House support a new phase of the war in Gaza? Trump is an impatient man, and he wants a Gaza peace deal as part of his wider ambitions to resolve the world's conflicts. \n If Netanyahu's new offensive doesn't deliver quick results, the White House might not remain so supportive.  The latest strikes come weeks after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, during which Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages for prisoners and were set to negotiate an extension to the truce that was meant to bring about an eventual end to the war. But those negotiations never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war. During the ceasefire period, 33 hostages were released, along with nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. There are 59 hostages still in captivity, of whom Israel believes 35 are dead. More than one million people risked being left without food parcels in March if aid was not allowed into Gaza, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the Food Security Sector as saying. The war, sparked by Hamas' 7 October 2023 killing of 1,200 people and capture of 250 more in southern Israel, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in the Strip, Gazan health officials say."

President Trump is wholly transactional. His desire for give and take far outweighs any ideological instincts. He has no particular alignment to Ukraine or, for that matter, to Russia. He just wants a deal. Peace would stop the killing as he has said repeatedly. It would also allow for deals which can benefit America: recouping the taxpayer money spent on Ukraine and reconnecting the American economy with Russia.  But trumping all that is his legacy and his image. He wants to be seen as the peacemaker president. Since the Oval Office moment, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy seems now to have recognised all that. Ukraine's approach towards Trump has changed. Zelenskyy is now playing his game: transactionalism. The minerals deal hasn't dissolved.

That's what he tried to tell President Trump in the Oval Office. The performance that day proved to him that Trump is inclined to trust Putin. Zelenskyy must use transactionalism to draw an impatient Trump in. President Trump is in a hurry for a deal. He's inclined to accept wholly disingenuous commitments from Russia, or as one source put it to me: \"Trump has a high tolerance for bullsh*t…\" That's the jeopardy for Zelenskyy."

The soldiers we're with face far worse. Knifings and bombings feature regularly from the ISIS families detained in sprawling detention camps in northeast Syria. The Kurdish troops have guarded these camps packed with ISIS wives and relatives for more than six years. But since the toppling of the Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, attacks in and around the camps have more than doubled. Kane Ahmed, the commander of Syrian Democratic Forces' (SDF) troops for al Hol camp, told us: \"The threat of ISIS has increased both inside and outside the camp... especially after the fall of the Syrian regime, it's gone up a lot and we see attempts by them to escape on almost a daily basis.\" He shows us the perimeter fence which has been reinforced several times in places. \"It's not secure enough,\" he says. The troops watch these camps through three round-the-clock CCTV rooms and often mount raids after receiving intelligence about IS operations. \"We know they are receiving help from outside IS cells who smuggle weapons inside and help smuggle people out,\" the commander says. Delivery trucks have been used to smuggle detainees out in hollowed out seats. Waterways have been turned into routes to sneak the children out. \"They are recruited by ISIS as the next cubs of the caliphate,\" the commander warns. The camp managers have long warned about the lack of rehabilitation facilities and psychological help for these children to de-radicalise the young. More than 60% of those at al Hol are children - 22,000 of them. Many have been born here and know nothing beyond their caged existence.

Raids on the tents frequently turn up homemade bombs, guns, grenades and knives. The troops wave their guns at the hordes of children who immediately gather round us as they taunt their guards. \"We will behead you,\" they say. \"One day we will be in charge. ISIS is coming back.\" One burqa-clad woman at the camp tells us: \"We love the Islamic State. We were free with them.

        "Content": "The blobfish, described as the world's ugliest animal, has been voted fish of the year in New Zealand. The creature, which grows to about 12 inches (30cm) long, is known affectionately as Mr Blobby and is the official mascot of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society. It has a bulbous head, and loose, flabby skin, and lives in the deep sea, mainly off the southeastern coast of mainland Australia, the Australian island of Tasmania, and New Zealand. The blobfish topped the annual poll by the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust, an environmental non-profit group, winning almost 1,300 out of more than 5,500 votes. The animal, which has a gelatinous, tadpole-like body, benefitted from a late surge in support to overtake the endangered orange roughy, another deep sea dweller, by nearly 300 votes. In their natural habitat, on the seabed at depths of about 2,000ft to 4,000ft (600m-1,200m), blobfish resemble any other fish. But when brought to the surface, where the water pressure isn't high enough to maintain their shape, blobfish morph into mushy creatures with an unfortunate appearance. \n                  New Zealand fires UK envoy for questioning Trump's grasp of history\n                 \n                  New Zealand volcano owners' conviction over deadly eruption overturned\n                 \n                  New Zealand tourism campaign criticised as country battles record emigration \n                 The trust's co-director, Kim Jones, described the competition as \"a battle of two quirky deep sea critters, with the blobfish's unconventional beauty helping get voters over the line\". The winner's late run benefitted from the backing of two New Zealand radio hosts, Sarah Gandy and Paul Flynn, who encouraged their listeners to vote blobfish. \"We and the people of New Zealand had had enough of other fish getting all the headlines,\" the broadcasters said.

The longfin eel, the whale shark and the great white shark were among the other fish in the top 10."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @laurenvrussell\n The relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been complex over the years. Relations between the two presidents extend as far back as 2019, the year the Ukrainian leader took office. It has since weathered the start of the war in Ukraine, Mr Trump's reelection and last month's heated exchange in the Oval Office, in which Mr Zelenskyy was accused of being \"disrespectful\" to his country's most powerful ally. Ukraine war latest: Follow live updates  Here we look back at the key moments that have helped shape the pair's relationship and how it has changed over the years. One of the first times Mr Zelenskyy spoke with Mr Trump was in July 2019, months after he became president of Ukraine. During a 30-minute phone call, the US leader suggested that in exchange for future military support for Ukraine, Mr Zelenskyy should help launch an investigation into Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump allies alleged Mr Biden had lobbied Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor to obstruct a probe into energy fIrm Burisma, which had Hunter Biden as one of its board members. Mr Trumo's request coincided with him appearing to want to weaken Mr Biden as he competed to become the Democratic nominee for the presidential election. It was this call that formed the basis for Mr Trump's first impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges. Mr Trump denied wrongdoing at the time and referred to his exchange with Mr Zelenskyy as a \"perfect\" phone call. He was later acquitted by the Senate. Mr Zelenskyy later admitted, during his first face-to-face meeting with Mr Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019, that there was \"no blackmail\" involved in the exchange. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since the Second World War. At the time, the Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Ukraine a centrepiece of US foreign policy, which included huge sums of military assistance. Mr Trump condemned the war as \"appalling\", saying at the time that he was praying for Ukrainians. He even extended praise to Mr Zelenskyy, calling him \"brave\" for staying in the capital, Kyiv. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed he would be able to stop the war in 24 hours, adding that he would be able to \"get it settled\" before even entering the White House. Doubting the claims, Mr Zelenskyy invited Mr Trump to Ukraine during an interview with Sky News' US partner network, NBC News, in November 2023. \"If he can come here, I will need 24 minutes - yes, 24 minutes. Not more. Yes. Not more - 24 minutes to explain [to] President Trump that he can't manage this war [in that time frame],\" Mr Zelenskyy told Meet The Press presenter Kristen Welker. He added at the time that he was unsure if Mr Trump would have Ukraine's back if he were to re-enter the White House. A month before Mr Trump won the US election, Mr Zelenskyy visited him in Trump Tower, New York. The trip, which took place in September, came after Mr Zelenskyy told the New Yorker magazine that he thought Mr Trump \"doesn't really know how to stop the war\". He added, \"many leaders have thought they could, but have been unable to do so\". While in New York, the pair discussed ending the war, with Mr Trump telling Fox News after the meeting that Mr Zelenskyy wants fighting in his country to stop. Mr Zelenskyy also reissued the invite for Mr Trump to visit Ukraine, to which he said he would accept. Work seemingly began on a ceasefire deal soon after Mr Trump was sworn into office. Mr Zelenskyy said in February that he was working with a team from the Trump administration, describing the US as the \"power that has the ability to not only stop the war but also help ensure the reliability of peace afterwards\". But relations quickly seemed to turn sour when the US administration held talks with Russian officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia without Ukraine.  The four-and-a-half hour meeting was condemned by Kyiv, who said talks should not be held behind Ukraine's back. Mr Zelenskyy also postponed a visit to Saudi Arabia, reportedly as a way to avoid giving the US-Russian meeting \"legitimacy\". The US-Russian meetings appeared to work as a catalyst of dwindling relations between the two presidents, with Mr Trump then suggesting that Ukraine was responsible for starting the war, adding that Mr Zelenskyy had \"better move fast\" or he would have no country left. Her later called Mr Zelenskyy a \"dictator without elections\" - a dig at him remaining in office after Ukraine's general election was delayed due to Russia's invasion. He also repeated the claim that the Ukrainian president has low approval ratings - which had already been dismissed by Mr Zelenskyy as Russian disinformation - and claimed American aid money had been misused. Despite prior crosswords, relations between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy appeared to be back on track near the end of February, when Ukraine said it wanted to sign a minerals deal with the US, giving them the right to $500bn (£394bn) in potential revenue from the resources. The deal had planned to be signed during an in-person meeting in the Oval Office, but Mr Zelenskyy's visit was cut short due to a clash in front of the world's media.  The last 10 minutes of the almost 45-minute meeting descended into a tense back-and-forth, which began with vice president JD Vance telling Mr Zelenksyy: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. \"You should be thanking the President [Trump] for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\" As the Ukrainian president tried to object, Mr Trump raised his voice and told him: \"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\" Read more:What could be the future of Ukraine?Sky's correspondents react to Trump-Putin phone call Addressing Congress a few days after the meeting in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he had received an \"important letter\" from Mr Zelenskyy in which he said he would work under his leadership to reach a peace deal. The letter appeared to echo what Mr Zelenskyy had said in a statement on social media hours after the US reported it was pausing military aid to Kyiv. Mr Zelenskyy described the Oval Office meeting as \"regrettable\", adding that it \"did not go the way it was supposed to be\" and it was \"time to make things right\". He also added that he was \"ready to sign\" the mineral deal, which had remained a sticking point between the two countries. The pair did not have any direct contact until Wednesday, when they had an hour-long phone call. Mr Trump described the conversation as \"very good\" adding that he and Mr Zelenskyy are \"very much on track\". He said most of the call was based on what he discussed with Russian President Vladimir Putin the day before."

Mr Trump also agreed to \"help locate\" additional air defence support in Europe after a request from the Ukrainian leader, a statement about the one-hour phone call said. Further talks will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the coming days, and the US will continue intelligence sharing with Ukraine, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Mr Trump also agreed to work to ensure missing Ukrainian children are returned home and both parties agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire involving attacks against energy facilities, with the US president saying the US \"could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise\", Ms Leavitt said. Secretary of state Marco Rubio also issued a statement about the call saying that \"President Trump also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. \"He said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\" The White House statement added that Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy also reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely. \n                  Trump just wants a Ukraine-Russia deal - will Putin or Zelenskyy blink first?\n                 \n                  Trump's call with Putin: Ending one war, preparing for another? \n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship: From 'perfect' phone call to Oval Office clash\n                 The presidents instructed their teams to move ahead with the details of implementing a partial ceasefire, with discussions to include expanding any ceasefire to the Black Sea. By David Blevins, Sky correspondent, in Washington DC The readout of the call from President Zelenskyy was conciliatory, repeatedly thanking Donald Trump for military support and for his peace efforts. In agreeing to a partial ceasefire, he held out the prospect of US investment in Ukrainian power - perhaps deeming that more of a security guarantee than the minerals deal. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" the Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz readout of Trump-Zelenskyy call said. Trump agreed to continue sharing intelligence but when Zelenskyy asked for additional air defence, he said he'd see what was available in Europe. That's a vague response from the US president as he seeks to keep both Ukraine and Putin on board. Those ambiguous words and the change in tone are both indicative of the sensitive point they've reached days before fresh negotiations in Saudi Arabia. \"We have never been closer to peace,\" Ms Leavitt added. In comments later on Wednesday, Mr Zelenskyy said that Mr Trump understands that Ukraine will not recognise occupied land as Russian, and that he would like the US president to visit Ukraine - adding that \"it would be helpful for Trump in his peace efforts\". In an earlier statement, President Zelenskyy said the two leaders had \"a positive, very substantive and frank conversation\". Mr Zelenskyy echoed much of Mr Trump's statement about what was decided, and said later that he \"felt no pressure\" from the US president.  \"We agreed that Ukraine and the United States should continue working together to achieve a real end to the war and lasting peace. We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year,\" Mr Zelenskyy said He added that Ukraine would \"continue working to make this happen\". 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"I stressed that Ukrainians want peace, which is why Ukraine accepted the proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" he said. \"I highlighted the importance of President Trump's concept of peace through strength.

The call marks the first time Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy have spoken since the disastrous confrontation in the White House last month. Mr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington expecting to sign a critical minerals deal but left early after he and Trump clashed in front of the world's cameras. On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin held a phone call lasting about an hour and a half in which the Russian leader rejected a full 30-day ceasefire. He agreed to not attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. The two countries also swapped 175 prisoners each earlier this morning."

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @Stone_SkyNews\n The tone has changed totally. It's a remarkable turnaround from the Oval Office meltdown to the perfect phone call. President Trump is wholly transactional. His desire for give and take far outweighs any ideological instincts. He has no particular alignment to Ukraine or, for that matter, to Russia. He just wants a deal. Peace would stop the killing as he has said repeatedly. It would also allow for deals which can benefit America: recouping the taxpayer money spent on Ukraine and reconnecting the American economy with Russia.  But trumping all that is his legacy and his image. He wants to be seen as the peacemaker president. Since the Oval Office moment, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy seems now to have recognised all that. Ukraine's approach towards Trump has changed. Zelenskyy is now playing his game: transactionalism. The minerals deal hasn't dissolved. The indications I am getting is that it's essentially been upgraded and broadened to a wider scope: fuller economic cooperation. \n                  Donald Trump has 'very good' call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which he discusses US ownership of Ukrainian energy plants\n                 \n                  Trump's call with Putin: Ending one war, preparing for another? \n                 \n                  Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship: From 'perfect' phone call to Oval Office clash\n                 Zelenskyy needs to encourage America deep into his country economically. Has he bought into the idea that a US economic footprint amounts to a key part of a security guarantee? Read more:A timeline of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationshipWhat could be the future of Ukraine?Sky's correspondents react to Trump-Putin phone call The old adage is: \"If you are not at the table, you are on the menu.\" That's too true with President Trump. Zelenskyy now feels like he's at the table and I am told he doesn't feel coerced. The challenges remain huge though: he doesn't trust Putin. That's what he tried to tell President Trump in the Oval Office. The performance that day proved to him that Trump is inclined to trust Putin. Zelenskyy must use transactionalism to draw an impatient Trump in. President Trump is in a hurry for a deal. He's inclined to accept wholly disingenuous commitments from Russia, or as one source put it to me: \"Trump has a high tolerance for bullsh*t…\" That's the jeopardy for Zelenskyy."

        "Content": "\n          Foreign news reporter\n              @MikeRDrummond\n The 30-day pause in airstrikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure that Donald Trump got Vladimir Putin to agree to lasted perhaps a few hours.  The White House had claimed \"we've never been closer to a peace deal\" before the phone call between the two leaders yesterday. Instead, Mr Trump appears to have achieved little in his conversation with Mr Putin, whose 'red lines' seem very much intact as his troops continue to hammer the Ukrainian frontlines and with Volodymyr Zelenskyy accusing him of hitting Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight It's been a whirlwind first couple of months of the second Trump administration, both stateside and abroad. As the fallout from the latest development in the Ukraine war continues, let's look at how the dealmaker-in-chief has fared in his various international interactions. Cutting Ukraine out of negotiations Mr Trump famously promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of being sworn in as commander in chief for a second time (he now says he was being sarcastic), but certainly, a swift peace is firmly on his wishlist. \n                  Trump just wants a Ukraine-Russia deal - will Putin or Zelenskyy blink first?\n                 \n                  Donald Trump has 'very good' call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which he discusses US ownership of Ukrainian energy plants\n                 \n                  Trump's call with Putin: Ending one war, preparing for another? \n                 In the last few weeks he has cut off and resumed military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy in public and started peace negotiations with Russia without Kyiv's involvement. Now the 30-day pause on attacks on energy facilities that Mr Putin agreed to on the phone appears to have been abandoned the same day, with drone strikes launched against Ukraine overnight. What is clear, however, is that Mr Trump's comments (and those of his associates) around NATO allies not spending enough appear to have galvanised Europe. Countries including the UK have pledged to boost defence spending and shoulder more of the security burden - though potentially pivoting away from lucrative American arms sales at the same time. Trade war with Canada Mr Trump's signature economic policy - tariffs on imports - have opened up what essentially amounts to a trade war with America's biggest trade partner: Canada. His comments on making the Great White North into the \"51st state\" have not helped, with new Canadian PM Mark Carney vowing his country will \"never ever be part of the US\". The American president has slapped 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products from 2 April. Canada, which is the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on those metals along with computers, sports equipment and other products worth $20bn in total. That's on top of tariffs imposed on 4 March worth a similar amount on US goods in response to broader tariffs by Mr Trump. Read more:What are Donald Trump's tariffs?Sky News correspondents react to Trump-Putin call Impact of tariffs elsewhere Canada is far from the only nation to be hit with sweeping trade tariffs by the Trump administration. Mr Trump also imposed tariffs on Mexico - a key US trade partner - due to the fentanyl crisis in the US and illegal immigration. Mexico, along with Canada, hit back with retaliatory tariffs. Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to appease Mr Trump, including by sending 10,000 national guard soldiers to the border with the US - a win for Mr Trump, though it only amounts to an extra five guards per mile of the border. The EU's Ursula von der Leyen criticised new US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and the bloc pledged to raise its tariffs on American products. China, which has been hit by a 20% tariff by Mr Trump, said it was \"ready\" for \"any type of war\" with the US. The trade escalation between the two countries also spooked markets, contributing to a widespread stock market sell-off. What's more, there's a possibility that China could benefit from the global tariffs regime in the long run. End of the Gaza ceasefire? Despite it being signed during the final days of US President Joe Biden's time in office, Mr Trump took a great deal of credit for the ceasefire deal signed between Israel and Hamas back in January. It seems that his impending inauguration served to spur things on and help get the deal over the line. In December, he made a public demand for the release of the hostages, threatening \"ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East\", while his envoy put pressure on Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. The eventual deal did bring some success - around 30 hostages were released along with more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. But Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza this week, bringing the fragile ceasefire to an end without moving to phase two, which would have seen conversations around a permanent ceasefire.  Greenland and Panama Mr Trump has also spoken repeatedly about his desire to annex Greenland, despite protests from Denmark and Greenlanders themselves. \"I think that will happen,\" he said earlier this month when asked about the US taking over the territory - something around 85% of Greenlanders oppose. He said the US already has a military presence in Greenland and added: \"Maybe you'll see more and more soldiers going there.\" The row has caused tensions between America and Denmark, which is a US ally and a member of NATO. Mr Trump has also promised to take over the Panama Canal, a key trade route for international shipping. He expressed a desire for America to \"take back\" the crucial waterway from alleged Chinese control. Earlier this month, a Hong Kong firm sold two major ports on the Panama Canal to a US firm. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings said the move was \"wholly unrelated to recent political news\" but the development was nonetheless welcomed by Mr Trump."

        "Content": "\n          Science correspondent\n              @SkyNewsThomas\n  Perhaps it was just an accident of scheduling that meant Butch and Suni were brought back to Earth on a SpaceX capsule called Freedom. The test pilots were supposed to have just a brief stopover on the International Space Station (ISS) but ended up staying for nine months. Christmas, birthdays, and those big family moments - all missed as they whizzed around the planet at 17,500mph.  But the choice of capsule - there are several in the Crew Dragon fleet - could also have been deliberate. Donald Trump has described this - falsely - as a \"rescue\" mission of two astronauts \"virtually abandoned\" by the Biden administration. So selecting the Freedom capsule could fit that narrative. You wouldn't put it past the White House First Buddy and SpaceX chief Elon Musk joining his boss in having another dig. As it happened: 'Wonderful' reunion ahead for astronauts  In fact, this was a routine crew changeover. The capsule the astronauts returned in has been parked up at the ISS for the last six months. But this is the political maelstrom that Butch and Suni have been caught up in. A space mission that seems to have collided at times with an alternative universe. For 25 years the ISS has risen above Earthly politics. Russians have lived and worked alongside crew from the US, Europe, Canada and Japan - collaborating in space even when tensions have been high down below. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?What can being in space do to your health? In a recent news conference from the space station, Butch and Suni appeared alongside their commander beneath a string of flags of all the nations that have made the ISS possible. A symbol of unity. But it's domestic American politics that has jolted the crew. They'll want their mission to be remembered for the science they did in orbit, the spacewalks by Suni and their engagement with schools that might inspire astronauts of the future. But there are bigger forces at play. Musk wants the space station to crash and burn in the atmosphere earlier than planned, and the president has appointed Janet Petro to be the NASA chief. Add in Trump's vitriol of the Biden administration, and Butch and Suni may not get to tell the story of their mission their way."

        "Content": "More than 60 years since former US President John F Kennedy was shot dead in 1963, unredacted documents related to the assassination in Dallas, Texas, have been released.  Around 2,200 files consisting of more than 63,000 pages were posted on the US National Archives and Records Administration's website on Tuesday evening. The release was prompted after President Donald Trump signed an executive order back in January calling for unredacted files in the case to be made public. \"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,\" Mr Trump said on Monday, claiming that 80,000 pages would be made available to the public - a slight overestimate on the actual amount that was released. It is the second time the US leader has ordered the release of Kennedy papers, doing so during his first time in office in 2017, where he ended up holding some back because of what he said was potential harm to national security.  While files continued to be released during Joe Biden's administration, some remained unseen. Before Tuesday, researchers had estimated that 3,000 to 3,500 files were still unreleased, either wholly or partially. This is on top of 2,400 newly discovered records by the FBI last month. Researchers and conspiracy theorists have had an intense interest in the case for years, so here is everything we know so far from the newly released files. No new blockbuster details In short, no major new details about the assassination have been found so far. What has been learnt are some details concerning 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who was believed to have carried out the assassination. Two days after Kennedy was killed, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer. The former Marine from Texas, who defected to the Soviet Union, is believed to have fired multiple shots from the Texas School Book Depository building as a motorcade carrying Mr Kennedy and former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy made its way through the crowd-lined street on 22 November 1963. A year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which was established to investigate the event, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that a singular bullet had struck the former president from behind before exiting from the front of his throat and hitting Texas governor John Connally Jr (this would become known as the 'magic bullet theory'). The newly released files contains one memo from the CIA that describe how a KGB official had reviewed \"five thick volumes\" of files on Oswald and was \"confident\" that he was at \"no time an agent controlled by the KGB\". It added that the KGB official had said Oswald was \"watched closely and constantly while in the USSR\" and that he was a poor shot when he tried target firing in the Soviet Union. Another memo, dated the day after Kennedy's assassination, says that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald communicated with a KGB officer while at the Soviet Embassy that September. The releases have also contributed to the understanding of the period during the Cold War, researchers said. One document released from January 1962 reveals details of a top-secret project called 'Operation Mongoose' or simply 'the Cuban Project' which was a CIA-led campaign of covert operations and sabotage against Cuba, authorised by Mr Kennedy in 1961, aimed at removing the regime led by Fidel Castro. Historians remain optimistic So far, the files provide no further information to debunk or prove the main JFK assassination conspiracy theories, which include everything from pointing the finger directly at the US government to more than one gunman being involved. But as historians carefully review every document - a process that is expected to take a serious length of time - they remain cautiously optimistic that more information will crop up. 👉 Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app 👈 \"We should prepare to be surprised,\" Fredrik Logevall, a historian at Harvard University, told the New York Times, while Jefferson Morely, vice president of charity the Mary Ferrell Foundation, added it was an \"encouraging start\". Historian Alice L George said American's curiosity about assassinations and questions about government transparency add \"to a sense that there must be important evidence hidden away in these files\".

She said government records were unlikely to resolve questions people still have, but expects more record releases. \"I seriously doubt that any will include great revelations.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n The US central bank has slashed its expectations for economic growth this year as it eyes challenges on several fronts amid Donald Trump's escalating trade war. The Federal Reserve announced, as was widely expected, that it would keep its main interest rate at its current target range level of 4.25%-4.5% following the latest meeting of its Federal Open Markets Committee. The statement that accompanied that decision showed slightly elevated expectations for inflation but also a forecast that the annual rate of economic growth this year had been cut from 2.1% to 1.7%. Money latest: 'I've created something the world's biggest drinks companies are fighting over' The reduction partly reflected weaker consumer spending, the Fed said, adding that could be partly explained by the threat of rising prices due to the tariff agenda. The central bank admitted rising uncertainty over its dual mandate which covers employment as well as inflation. At a news conference to accompany the decision, Fed chair Jay Powell said: \"The economy is strong overall\", adding that labour market conditions were \"solid\". \n                  Trump tariffs: UK steel bosses fear dumping and cancelled orders\n                 \n                  UK and global economic growth forecasts cut - as Trump tariffs blamed\n                 \n                  Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada will 'never ever be part of US' and talk of nation becoming 51st state is 'crazy'\n                 But on the question of rising goods inflation he said: \"A good part of it is coming from tariffs\", adding that it was too soon to split non-tariff and tariff-related inflation in the data. The core message was that it was too early to predict the impact overall. Policymakers said risks had increased, with a near unanimous sentiment in saying the outlook for the year was muddled but it stopped short of directly blaming the protectionist policies being pursed by the Trump White House. The Fed revealed its hand less than 24 hours before the Bank of England was expected to follow suit by also holding off on any fresh rate cut amid risks of surging prices due to the growing trade war uncertainty. The Fed meeting took place against a backdrop of mounting concern among financial markets and economists that the trade war could lead the world's largest economy into recession. Stock market values are well down on where they started the year, with the broad-based S&P 500 losing $4trn in the space of less than a month at one stage as the tariff threats intensified.  The dollar remains around five cents down against both the pound and euro while US government borrowing costs also remain elevated. Stocks rebounded somewhat on the Fed's update as it signalled no immediate pressure for a policy shift, with the statement signalling that two rate cuts remained on the cards over the remainder of 2025. But US economists are particularly worried about the trade war involving the country's nearest neighbours Mexico and Canada - yet to get into full swing as had been threatened due to several suspensions by the Trump administration. Read more: UK steel bosses fret over tariff impactUK and global growth forecasts cut by OECD The main domestic concern is that tit-for-tat tariffs will hammer cross-border supply chains and wider trade, leaving US businesses drowning under a mountain of red tape and higher costs, the latter being widely tipped to be passed on down supply chains and ultimately hitting consumers. Trade war hostilities between the three are set to ramp up from 2 April - a day after the EU retaliates to US steel and aluminium tariffs with duties being applied to US goods worth €26bn. Mr Trump has already threatened to respond with 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports including wine and spirits."

Court documents allege David Stever was being removed from his post by Unilever because he was too outspoken on social issues. Last month the ice cream company, which had launched a flavour in support of Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, accused Unilever of demanding it stop any public criticism of Donald Trump. Money latest: 'I've created something the world's biggest drinks companies are fighting over' Ben and Jerry's, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978, was bought by the consumer goods giant in 2000. As part of the merger deal, an independent board was set up to protect the ice cream brand's mission and strong stance on social issues. Unilever said that under the arrangement it \"reserved primary responsibility for financial and operational decisions\". \n                  Trump trade war: US central bank cuts growth outlook\n                 \n                  Former sub-postmaster Lee Castleton becomes first individual to sue Post Office and Fujitsu after uncovering 'fraud'\n                 \n                  Nearly 100 Santander UK branches to close - with 750 jobs at risk\n                 A series of disputes have followed. The most high-profile spat came in 2021 when the US brand took the decision not to sell ice cream in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories on the grounds that sales would be \"inconsistent\" with its values. Unilever responded by selling the business to its licensee in Israel. Ben & Jerry's alleged in its filing to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that Unilever had wanted to stop Mr Stever - its boss of almost two years - from making political statements. \"Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission,\" the filing said. \"On March 3 2025, Unilever informed the independent board that they were removing and replacing Mr Stever as Ben & Jerry's CEO.\" Unilever has been contacted for comment. Mr Stever - a veteran of the ice cream brand who started out as a company tour guide in 1988 - remains listed as the chief executive on the Ben & Jerry's website. There is a possibility that the frostiness between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever will thaw under the parent's firm's plans to spin off its ice cream interests into a separate company. That division, which also comprises brands such as Magnum and Wall's, is set to be based in the Netherlands with a primary stock market listing in Amsterdam."

The core message was that it was too early to predict the impact overall. Policymakers said risks had increased, with a near unanimous sentiment in saying the outlook for the year was muddled but it stopped short of directly blaming the protectionist policies being pursed by the Trump White House. The Fed revealed its hand less than 24 hours before the Bank of England was expected to follow suit by also holding off on any fresh rate cut amid risks of surging prices due to the growing trade war uncertainty. The Fed meeting took place against a backdrop of mounting concern among financial markets and economists that the trade war could lead the world's largest economy into recession. Stock market values are well down on where they started the year, with the broad-based S&P 500 losing $4trn in the space of less than a month at one stage as the tariff threats intensified.  The dollar remains around five cents down against both the pound and euro while US government borrowing costs also remain elevated. Stocks rebounded somewhat on the Fed's update as it signalled no immediate pressure for a policy shift, with the statement signalling that two rate cuts remained on the cards over the remainder of 2025. But US economists are particularly worried about the trade war involving the country's nearest neighbours Mexico and Canada - yet to get into full swing as had been threatened due to several suspensions by the Trump administration.

Trade war hostilities between the three are set to ramp up from 2 April - a day after the EU retaliates to US steel and aluminium tariffs with duties being applied to US goods worth €26bn. Mr Trump has already threatened to respond with 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports including wine and spirits."

Court documents allege David Stever was being removed from his post by Unilever because he was too outspoken on social issues. Last month the ice cream company, which had launched a flavour in support of Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, accused Unilever of demanding it stop any public criticism of Donald Trump. Money latest: 'I've created something the world's biggest drinks companies are fighting over' Ben and Jerry's, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978, was bought by the consumer goods giant in 2000. As part of the merger deal, an independent board was set up to protect the ice cream brand's mission and strong stance on social issues. Unilever said that under the arrangement it \"reserved primary responsibility for financial and operational decisions\". \n                  Trump trade war: US central bank cuts growth outlook\n                 \n                  Former sub-postmaster Lee Castleton becomes first individual to sue Post Office and Fujitsu after uncovering 'fraud'\n                 \n                  Nearly 100 Santander UK branches to close - with 750 jobs at risk\n                 A series of disputes have followed. The most high-profile spat came in 2021 when the US brand took the decision not to sell ice cream in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories on the grounds that sales would be \"inconsistent\" with its values. Unilever responded by selling the business to its licensee in Israel. Ben & Jerry's alleged in its filing to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that Unilever had wanted to stop Mr Stever - its boss of almost two years - from making political statements. \"Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission,\" the filing said. \"On March 3 2025, Unilever informed the independent board that they were removing and replacing Mr Stever as Ben & Jerry's CEO.\" Unilever has been contacted for comment. Mr Stever - a veteran of the ice cream brand who started out as a company tour guide in 1988 - remains listed as the chief executive on the Ben & Jerry's website. There is a possibility that the frostiness between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever will thaw under the parent's firm's plans to spin off its ice cream interests into a separate company. That division, which also comprises brands such as Magnum and Wall's, is set to be based in the Netherlands with a primary stock market listing in Amsterdam."

While being reminded about British nuclear strength though, Russian President Vladimir Putin will also doubtless take note of a potential weakness. HMS Vanguard was kept patrolling at sea for more than 200 days - one of the longest-ever deployments that will likely have put a huge strain on the submariners and the vessel - as issues with maintaining the ageing fleet make it harder to rotate the boats more quickly. The Royal Navy must keep one nuclear-armed submarine at sea at all times. The so-called \"continuous at-sea deterrence\" is the cornerstone of UK defence strategy and the ultimate guarantor of the nation's security. It is the first time a prime minister has visited one of the Royal Navy's four top-secret nuclear-armed submarines as it returned from a deterrent patrol - a moment known as \"Day Zero\" - in more than a decade. The last time this happened was with David Cameron in 2013. \n                  Starmer backs campaign to show Adolescence in schools\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves: 'People want to talk me down... I'll prove I can do it'\n                 \n                  A UK-conducted fatal drone strike confirmed for first time since Starmer became PM\n                 Video released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) showed Sir Keir, eyes pressed to pair of binoculars, and Defence Secretary John Healey sailing out to greet the ageing submarine - which had surfaced - as it re-entered UK waters off Scotland earlier in the week following what was reported to have been a 204-day patrol. The MoD declined to confirm the length of time the boat had been at sea. The longest known deployment - of 207 days - was carried out in 2021 by HMS Victorious. Patrols by one of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines - which used to last three months - have had to be extended in recent years because of prolonged periods of maintenance and repair work on the other boats. The fleet is operating well beyond its original in-service life of 25 years because of delays in the building of four replacement boats. In a show of support for what is known as the \"silent service\", the prime minister, dressed in a Royal Navy-style coat, could be seen in the footage stepping onto the topside of HMS Vanguard as it bobbed in the water. He was joined by Mr Healey as a line of submariners stood to attention, before they both clambered down a hatch into the vessel. The two men, followed by Admiral Sir Ben Key, the head of the Royal Navy, walked around inside the submarine and received what was described as a \"hot\" brief on the deployment. The official release of any information about the UK's nuclear deterrent is extremely rare. Filming of any of the boats is also highly unusual and strictly controlled. Britain's enemies will likely be scouring the images that were made public for any clues that might reveal any information about the military's most potent weapon and the ultimate guarantor of UK security. All audio was removed before release for security reasons. The decision to publish details and images about the visit appears designed to send a signal to Moscow that the UK remains a nuclear-armed power. It came as the prime minister and defence secretary prepared to visit a sprawling BAE Systems manufacturing site in Barrow, a port town in Cumbria, where the new generation of nuclear-armed submarines is finally being built to replace the Vanguard-class vessels. The whole programme to renew the UK's nuclear deterrent - the submarines, missiles and warheads - is expected to cost more than £30bn, with an additional contingency of £10bn - making it the UK's most expensive and important procurement programme. Sir Keir described Barrow as a \"blueprint\" for how defence spending can bolster security and boost economic growth by generating highly skilled jobs and opportunities. \"This week, I saw first-hand the sacrifice our submariners are making every day to keep our country safe, but I know they are only able to do that because of the support of the town of Barrow,\" he said, in remarks released in advance by the government. \"Each and every person living and working in Barrow is contributing to our nation's defence, whether that is building our world-class submarine programme, or supporting the workforce here through vital public services or proud family businesses.\" In a sign of the importance of the programme, the prime minister will lay the keel to the first Dreadnought-class boat on Thursday afternoon. In addition, the King has agreed to give the \"Royal\" title to the Port of Barrow \"in recognition of the town's unique and critical contribution to national security\", the government said. The Royal Navy has maintained one of four submarines loaded with nuclear-armed missiles permanently at sea since the first patrol was launched in 1969. But the age of the current fleet and increased requirement for repair work raise the risk of failure. Any break in the continuous at sea deterrence would be a devastating blow, undermining the UK's ability to deter the most existential of threats. As well as visiting HMS Vanguard earlier in the week, the prime minister and defence secretary also spoke with family members of the submariners who have been at sea for more than half a year. Four crew members returned to meet newborn babies."

Chris Webb, the newly elected MP for Blackpool South, said the measures announced by the work and pensions secretary on Tuesday were \"not what any of us stood on in the manifesto\". Politics live: Has shine come off Labour? He told Sky News the government had \"forgotten\" coastal communities like Blackpool, which has the lowest male life expectancy in Britain and where nearly half of children live in poverty. Mr Webb, who is the first of Labour's new 2024 MPs to publicly criticise the reforms, said he was concerned they had been \"rushed\" to coincide with the timing of next week's spring statement - echoing criticism from Tory shadow chancellor Mel Stride. And he warned Liz Kendall's welfare changes - in particular the tightening of the eligibility criteria for one of the main types of benefit, personal independence payments (PIP) - could push more children below the breadline. \"This is a devastating blow for people already using food banks, already waiting for mental health support,\" he said. \"And in places like these coastal towns that have been forgotten these past 14 years, there just isn't the jobs to get these people back into work.\"  Claimants in limbo until spring statement Addressing MPs in the Commons yesterday, Ms Kendall said the government would not freeze PIP, as reports had previously suggested, but would tighten the eligibility criteria. It's unclear how many people will be impacted, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's full costings report not due until the spring statement on 26 March. Ministers have said as well as providing much-needed savings, there is a moral case for cuts, as one in eight young people are not in education, training, or employment. But Mr Webb said without the necessary mental health support, it would be difficult for young people to find the employment they are being encouraged to take up - with waiting lists reaching between 18 months and two years. He also argued jobs had been prioritised in the South East and Manchester, with \"nothing for coastal communities\". Read more:How is PIP changing?All the welfare reforms explainedThe town where a third are not in work  'This will make people worse off' While Mr Webb said he understood the need to make savings, he believed this could be done via other means. He suggested a wealth tax, and following Germany in approving a change to constitutional borrowing rules to allow much more defence spending. \"If you're saying a young person needs to get to work, I don't see a plan where that mental support will increase in time,\" he said. \"These changes aren't going to be enacted until 2028/29, so there may be a plan alongside this to do it - but at the minute, I'm not convinced by that, and this will make people in my constituency worse off. \"If I'm to support these measures, I need to see a clear strategy so that I can tell my constituents, my friends, my neighbours, and family - there is something coming.\""

Ms Siddiq denies all wrongdoing, and says she has not been approached by the investigating authorities in Bangladesh. More politics news:Teens exposed to 'horrific' contentMinister shown awkward old tweet 'Allegations have no merit' Sky News previously reported that UK-based investigators were considering ways to help the Bangladeshi authorities. The agency concerned, the International Anti-Corruption Co-ordination Centre (IACCC), is currently hosted by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and principally funded by the UK government. In the seven-page letter sent by Ms Siddiq's legal team, seen by Sky News, it is claimed the ACC \"does not appear to be taking matters seriously\". It goes on: \"If it was, it would have been obvious to it that the allegations made against our client have no merit at all.\" What are some of the claims? Ms Siddiq is the niece of the ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina, and it's those familial links that were used as evidence in the claims against her. Among the allegations disputed by Ms Siddiq are claims she illegally benefitted from a deal between Bangladesh and Russia for a nuclear power station. Ms Siddiq's lawyers say this is \"absurd and cannot be true\", as the claims revolve around a property given to the Labour MP by a close family friend 10 years before the power station deal. The letter also rejects claims Ms Siddiq committed fraud in Bangladesh over where she owned a home. 👉Listen to Politics At Sam And Anne's on your podcast app👈 Ms Siddiq's team has told the ACC it must \"immediately stop manufacturing false and vexatious allegations\", adding the agency's methods \"are an unacceptable attempt to interfere in UK politics\". The letter goes on to request any further claims are put to them directly, instead of being publicised in the media. In response, a defiant ACC said Ms Siddiq \"has benefitted from the systemic corruption\" of her aunt's old party. It said the MP has \"spent most of her adult life residing in homes owned by cronies\" of the party, the Awami League, and been \"benefitted by corrupt property deals that her mother undertook\". It said it would be in touch with her office \"in due course\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  Sir Keir Starmer has revealed he is watching Netflix's Adolescence with his family and supports a campaign for it to be shown in parliament and schools. The drama, starring Stephen Graham, depicts the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl - as a 13-year-old boy from her school is arrested for her murder. Politics live: PM challenged over tax rises  Graham and co-writer Jack Thorne have said they want it to be a show that \"causes discussion and makes change\", after it was hailed by critics and topped Netflix's charts around the world. Asked by Labour MP Anneliese Midgley if he backs the creators' calls for it to be aired in parliament and schools, Sir Keir said he does. He told PMQs: \"At home we are watching Adolescence. I've got a 16-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, and it's a very good drama to watch. \"This violence carried out by young men, influenced by what they see online, is a real problem. \"It's abhorrent, and we have to tackle it.\" MPs want tougher action on online safety Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy also told Sky News that the issues raised in Adolescence were ones the government should be \"acutely aware of\". She said said that although ministers were not considering a ban on smartphones for those under 16, Peter Kyle, the science secretary,\" is pressing ahead with the Online Harms Act to make sure that we keep people safe online\". Sir Keir's commitment came as Sky News learned around 25 Labour MPs who want tougher action on online safety have formed an informal group and are due to meet next week. It could pressure the government to take more radical steps, after a private member's bill to raise the age of social media consent from 13 to 16 was watered down because ministers didn't support the measure.  The changes were criticised by Thorne in a recent interview with Sky News, accusing the government of being \"frightened of big tech\". Johnathan Brash is among the MPs who backs showing Adolescence in parliament and schools, telling Sky News he found it \"so powerful and distressing I immediately went upstairs and gave my son a hug\". The Labour MP for Hartlepool, whose son is eight, said elements of the show could be shown in primary school \"with discretion\" so children understand the dangers before they are using social media. He said he will raise the issue with officials at the Department for Education to ensure Sir Keir's \"extremely supportive\" words are followed through on. Mr Brash said the government must \"protect children from an environment that is increasing hostile and dangerous\". It comes after Sky News revealed teenagers are regularly being served up \"horrific\" content on social media apps, including violent and sexually explicit material. Read more:Should social media be restricted for teens?  Government 'alert' to 'toxic influencers' Speaking after PMQs, Sir Keir's spokesman called Adolescence \"an incredibly powerful programme that shows the threat of young men carrying out violence from seeing things online\". \"Insidious misogyny taking root will be tackled,\" he added, though he did not say how. He also said the government is \"alert to and taking on\" issues raised by Sir Gareth Southgate, after the ex-England manager hit out at \"manipulative and toxic influencers\" who trick young men into thinking women are against them. The Online Safety Act, which is being implemented this year, is intended to protect young people from illegal and harmful content with fines for platforms who break the rules coming in this summer. However, MPs from across the political spectrum want further action to tackle the amount of time children spend on their smartphones. The Tories want the government to force teachers to ban smartphones from schools, with shadow education secretary Laura Trott revealing she is so concerned she won't allow her children to have one until they are 16. The government has resisted the measure, saying teachers already have the power to ban phones."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n  A minister has denied misleading Labour voters with a £5bn package of benefit cuts that was not in the party's manifesto. Stephen Timms told Sky News Breakfast with Wilfred Frost that Labour pledged to \"fix the broken system\" during the election campaign and said it would reform or replace the work capability assessment (WCA). Politics live: PM defends welfare cuts Scrapping the WCA was one of a series of measures announced on Tuesday, along with narrowing the criteria to qualify for some health and disability benefits. Labour's manifesto said: \"We believe the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced, alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work.\" However, it did not explicitly mention cuts. Asked if Labour had misled people, social security minister Mr Timms said: \"No.\" There's always a tweet… It was put to him that his boss Liz Kendall previously tweeted against benefit cuts being considered by former Tory chancellor George Osborne under his austerity programme. In 2016, the now work and pensions secretary retweeted a colleague who accused Mr Osborne of introducing the cuts \"to give handouts to the rich\", alongside a petition campaigning against the measure. Mr Timms said the Tories \"made lots of changes which did a great deal of damage\", including reforms to universal credit which put more people on the higher rate and meant they were \"no longer supported into work\". \"We opposed damaging changes the previous government made,\" he said. \"We're bringing forward a package which we think will do the job that's needed, support people back into work and make the system sustainable financially.\" Read more:All Labour's welfare reforms explained  What measures have been announced? The most significant measure announced yesterday was making it harder to qualify for personal independence payments (PIP), which is money for people who have extra care or mobility needs as a result of a disability. The new PIP test will go on to replace the WCA, which currently decides whether people are fit to work or not. There will also be a consultation on delaying access to the health top-up on universal credit until someone is 22. The announcement was met with criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who called for the cuts to be reversed and warned it would push more sick and disabled people into poverty. However, it is unclear how many people could lose benefits as a result as the impact assessment will not be released until the spring statement next week.  Reforms 'rushed through' The spring statement will see Chancellor Rachel Reeves make further spending cuts to account for the loss of around £9bn in fiscal headroom due to a poor economy and global instability. The government has denied this is the reason for the welfare package, with Ms Kendall telling Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby she would have announced these measures regardless - as she refused to rule out further cuts. But Tory shadow chancellor Mel Stride told Sky News the reforms were \"rushed\" through because Ms Reeves \"killed the economy\" with her October budget. \"That doesn't make for good policy, particularly in the area of welfare where you do need to take your time and to be thoughtful about it,\" he added. PM: Benefits bill 'devastating' Sir Keir Starmer has defended the measures, writing in The Times that the 2.8 million working age people out of work due to long-term sickness is a \"damning indictment of the Conservative record\" on welfare. He added: \"The result is devastating for the public finances. By 2030 we are projected to spend £70bn a year on working-age incapacity and disability benefits alone.\""

        "Content": "Conservationists picked up hundreds of thousands of pieces of rubbish from British beaches last year, according to a charity.  The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said more than 15,000 volunteers picked up three-quarters of a million pieces of litter during beach cleans in 2024, averaging 170 items per 100 metres of coastline surveyed. The number of plastic items - which take hundreds of years to break down and can choke sea life - had jumped by almost a tenth on the year before. It comes after experts warned that small plastic pellets washed up on beaches in the east of England, \"likely\" to have come from a collision the week before between an oil tanker and a cargo ship. The latest annual State of our Beaches report shows that plastic pollution \"remains a huge problem for our marine environment\", the charity said. Its volunteers combed stretches of beach for all items of rubbish, which were collected, bagged and recorded in detail. MCS said plastic fragments were the most commonly found rubbish on UK beaches, followed by single-use plastic packaging like crisp packets and sweet and sandwich wrappers. Bottle caps and lids, and string and cord, were also common.  The charity said it was unclear why plastic litter had increased by so much year, but that it fits the growing trend of plastic clogging up beaches over the 31 years it has been running the survey. Lizzie Price, beach watch manager at the MCS, said: \"Thanks to over 15,000 volunteers last year, the data from our beach cleans is clear: plastic pollution remains a huge problem for our marine environment. \"We urgently need more policies to reduce single-use plastics and ensure better waste management. \"Everyone has a role to play in protecting our oceans, and we urge the public to support stronger action against plastic waste, as well as cut down plastic from their everyday use.\" A spokesperson from the government's environment department said: \"For too long plastic waste has littered our streets, polluted Britain's waterways and threatened our wildlife. \"This Government is committed to cleaning up the nation and cracking down on plastic waste as we move towards a circular economy.\" That includes delivering a delayed return scheme for plastic bottles from 2027 - first promised under the Conservatives in 2018 and originally due to start in 2023."

The test pilots were supposed to have just a brief stopover on the International Space Station (ISS) but ended up staying for nine months. Christmas, birthdays, and those big family moments - all missed as they whizzed around the planet at 17,500mph.  But the choice of capsule - there are several in the Crew Dragon fleet - could also have been deliberate. Donald Trump has described this - falsely - as a \"rescue\" mission of two astronauts \"virtually abandoned\" by the Biden administration. So selecting the Freedom capsule could fit that narrative. You wouldn't put it past the White House First Buddy and SpaceX chief Elon Musk joining his boss in having another dig. As it happened: 'Wonderful' reunion ahead for astronauts  In fact, this was a routine crew changeover. The capsule the astronauts returned in has been parked up at the ISS for the last six months. But this is the political maelstrom that Butch and Suni have been caught up in. A space mission that seems to have collided at times with an alternative universe. For 25 years the ISS has risen above Earthly politics. Russians have lived and worked alongside crew from the US, Europe, Canada and Japan - collaborating in space even when tensions have been high down below. Read more:What else has gone wrong in space?What can being in space do to your health? In a recent news conference from the space station, Butch and Suni appeared alongside their commander beneath a string of flags of all the nations that have made the ISS possible. A symbol of unity. But it's domestic American politics that has jolted the crew. They'll want their mission to be remembered for the science they did in orbit, the spacewalks by Suni and their engagement with schools that might inspire astronauts of the future. But there are bigger forces at play. Musk wants the space station to crash and burn in the atmosphere earlier than planned, and the president has appointed Janet Petro to be the NASA chief. Add in Trump's vitriol of the Biden administration, and Butch and Suni may not get to tell the story of their mission their way."

        "Content": "The blobfish, described as the world's ugliest animal, has been voted fish of the year in New Zealand. The creature, which grows to about 12 inches (30cm) long, is known affectionately as Mr Blobby and is the official mascot of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society. It has a bulbous head, and loose, flabby skin, and lives in the deep sea, mainly off the southeastern coast of mainland Australia, the Australian island of Tasmania, and New Zealand. The blobfish topped the annual poll by the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust, an environmental non-profit group, winning almost 1,300 out of more than 5,500 votes. The animal, which has a gelatinous, tadpole-like body, benefitted from a late surge in support to overtake the endangered orange roughy, another deep sea dweller, by nearly 300 votes. In their natural habitat, on the seabed at depths of about 2,000ft to 4,000ft (600m-1,200m), blobfish resemble any other fish.

The longfin eel, the whale shark and the great white shark were among the other fish in the top 10."
