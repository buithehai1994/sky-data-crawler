        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n  Prince William has said \"change is on my agenda\" when he becomes king, in his most open and personal explanation to date about how he sees his future role and the future of the monarchy.  The revelations come during a discussion with Hollywood actor Eugene Levy as they were filming at Windsor Castle for Levy's travel series The Reluctant Traveller. When asked if the monarchy will be shifting in a slightly different direction when he becomes king, William says: \"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda. \"Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don't fear it, that's the bit that excites me - the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical change, but changes that I think need to happen.\" What could be described as William's manifesto for the monarchy comes out in an unexpectedly candid interview with the Schitt's Creek star. The Prince of Wales also opens up about being \"overwhelmed\" by family problems last year - as both Kate and the King were diagnosed with cancer - and his desire to try to \"make sure you don't do the same mistakes as your parents\". Describing how he is driven by both his passion to protect his family and his desire to ensure everything is in place when Prince George one day becomes king, he says: \"I want to create a world in which my son is proud of what we do, in a world and a job that actually does impact people's lives for the better. \n                  Prince William tells Eugene Levy he misses late Queen and Prince Philip\n                 \n                  Prince of Wales says 2024 was 'hardest year' of his life\n                 \n                  Prince William praises 'remarkable legacies' of Southport victims' parents\n                 \"That is caveated with, I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation.\" On being monarch one day, he says: \"It's not something I wake up in the morning and think about.\" But in an earlier part of the programme, he does talk more about his desire to potentially shake things up, albeit with a caveat. He says: \"I think it's very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this, but there's also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today?\" In an incredibly open admission about sometimes feeling overwhelmed, especially last year - \"the hardest year\" - he also appears to reveal a man now more at peace with the role that lies ahead for him. Speaking in St George's Hall inside the castle, he says: \"Stuff to do with family overwhelms me, quite a bit. \"You know, worry or stress around the family side of things, that does overwhelm me quite a bit. But in terms of doing the job and things like that, I don't feel too overwhelmed by that. Not now anyway.\" His own childhood, and how that has impacted his thoughts on the media, also come across clearly, at times appearing to echo his brother Prince Harry's thoughts on the press and drive to protect his own family from what they went through as children. As he talks to Levy in a pub in Windsor, William says: \"Growing up, I saw that with my parents ... the media were so insatiable back then. \"And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.\" Those close to the prince believe the interview is the most publicly vulnerable they've ever seen him on camera. The special episode of The Reluctant Traveller With Eugene Levy on Apple TV+ with William airs from today."

The significant search, which began at the start of July, is being led by Devon and Cornwall Police and relates to an ongoing murder investigation. Other police forces, including West Mercia and the City of London, have also been drafted in to help. The search is taking place in Paramoor Woods, on the outskirts of the village of Sticker near St Austell. Four large tents have been set up by police as a base, with a temporary road and bridge built to access the search area. At the start of October, Sky News witnessed forensic officers entering the woodland with tripods to take pictures. Privacy screens and flood lights are placed around the woodland. Officers were also seen digging and sifting through soil deep in the woodland, using specialist equipment. A man has been charged with murder in relation to the investigation, he is next due in court in November."

The peer has faced calls to stand down from MPs across the political spectrum, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier this week agreed with Baroness Mone's contention that the government was pursuing a \"vendetta\" in trying to recover improper Covid funding. \"Too right we are,\" she said in comments at the Labour Party conference. Money blog: Ryanair CEO warns 100,000 passengers could have flight cancelled  In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone has accused Ms Reeves of endangering her and her family with her comments, citing the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess as evidence of the risks facing parliamentarians. She also alleged ministerial interference in the civil and ongoing criminal investigations of PPE Medpro, and has called for an investigation into whether ministers have \"improperly influenced\" the Crown Prosecution Service and the National Crime Agency. In the letter, sent from the private office of Baroness Mone OBE and seen by Sky News, she addresses the prime minister directly, writing in a personal capacity \"first as a wife, second as a mother, and lastly as a Baroness.\" \n                  Baroness Mone should resign from Lords, senior Tory says, after order to pay back £122m over COVID PPE\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 \n                  Tory peer Michelle Mone accuses government of 'scapegoating' over PPE scandal in online tirade\n                  Referring to Ms Reeves' comments, she writes: \"The chancellor's deliberate use of the term \"vendetta\", a word connoting vengeance, feud and blood feud, is incendiary and has directly increased the risks to my personal safety.... My family and I now live with a heightened and genuine fear of appearing in public.\" She goes on to accuse Reeves and health secretary Wes Streeting of \"falsehoods\" in demanding that she hand back £122m, pointing out that she was never a director of PPE Medpro and \"never received a penny from it personally.\" While the company was founded by her husband Doug Barrowman, a High Court judgement this week confirmed that Baroness Mone introduced it to the government's VIP fast lane for PPE providers, and lobbied on its behalf in negotiations. She has previously admitted that £29m of profit from the PPE contract was passed to a family trust of which she and her children are beneficiaries. The peer has also accused the Prime Minister of \"a total lie\" when \"you stated in Parliament that my children had received £29m into their bank accounts.\" Baroness Mone said that following these comments, she had received threatening and abusive communications, and cited the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who took her own life, as showing \"the fatal consequences of personalised public vilification\". \"Your cabinet members, by repeating this knowingly false claim, are inciting hostility and inflaming public hatred against me.\" She has also accused the home secretary of influencing the NCA and Director of Public Prosecutions in unspecified meetings to discuss \"high-profile cases\". \"That political influence is being brought to bear is, therefore, undeniable,\" she said.

PPE Medpro was put into administration the day before the judgment, with assets of just £666,000. Asked if Baroness Mone would step down from the Lords, a spokesman said: \"Those calling for Baroness Mone's resignation from the House of Lords would be well advised to read the open letter sent this morning to the prime minister, which sets out how this has now become a personal attack and vendetta, politically motivated with loss of all balance and objectivity.\" Sky News has asked Number 10 and the Treasury for a response to the allegations made by Baroness Mone."

        "Content": "\n          Money live reporter\n              @JournoJess97\n Ryanair's chief executive has warned that 100,000 passengers could see their flights disrupted next week due to an air traffic control union strike in France. Michael O'Leary told the Money blog the industrial action would cost Ryanair around £20m. While the company could afford to swallow the cost, he said, it would ultimately be customers who will be worse off, and they should complain. Members of the SNCTA will go on strike from Tuesday 7 October until the morning of Friday 10 October over a dispute about pay and working conditions. While it will obviously affect flights heading to France, it will also affect those that use French airspace to reach their final destination - these are called overflights. This includes flights to and from lots of places including Spain, Italy and Greece. O'Leary called for overflights to be protected from strike action, saying disrupting them is an abuse of the free single market. \n                  Bonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 \n                  Ryanair raises fares after profits hit by lower ticket prices\n                 On the first two days of the strikes, he said Ryanair was expecting to be asked to cancel about 600 flights - with almost all of them overflights. \"That's about 100,000 passengers who will have their flights cancelled needlessly next Wednesday and Thursday,\" he said. \"On any given day at the moment, we operate about 3,500 flights and about 900 of those flights cross over French airspace and about two thirds of those, around 600 flights, are cancelled every day there's an air traffic control strike. \"The UK is the country whose flights get cancelled most because of the geographic proximity to France.\" Read more:Flight delayed or cancelled? These are your rightsBonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage While he accepted the rights of French workers to strike, he said Eurocontrol, a civil-military organisation that supports air traffic management across Europe, could step in to look after the airspace and keep flights operating. \"It wouldn't stop the French striking, they have the right to strike and we accept that but they should be cancelling local French fights, not flights from the UK to Spain or from Italy to Ireland. This is a fundamental breach of the single market,\" he said. He called on the government to \"put pressure\" on the EU Commission and the French government to protect overflights during industrial action. \"We bloody well demand that our overflights are protected. If British citizens today going to Italy, or we have Spanish visitors wanting to come to London, they should not have their flights disrupted or cancelled,\" he said. He claimed: \"They [the government] don't care about the travelling public and they won't get off their arses and demand that their overflights be protected.\" Read all the latest Money news here A Department of Transport spokesperson said: \"Airspace is sovereign, and it is for each state to decide how best to manage their own. \"We know strikes can cause disruption for passengers and airlines and airports have robust resilience plans in place to minimise their impact.\" O'Leary encouraged affected passengers to complain about any disruptions to transport ministers and the European Commission using the airline's dedicated ATCruinedourholiday.com website. Several other European airlines, such as EasyJet, British Airways, Vueling and Lufthansa, could also face disruptions. The full impact of the strikes next week is still unknown, as airlines tend to avoid cancellations this early before the action begins. EasyJet told Money it was still waiting for information from the authorities to understand the impact of the strikes. \"We will update customers directly and continue to monitor the situation,\" it said. If you are due to travel during the strike, it's worth keeping an eye on the status of your flight on the airline's website or app."

        "Content": "The twin brother of a woman who died after being \"influenced\" into not having chemotherapy by their mother, has called inquest findings \"a failure of the state\". Paloma Shemirani collapsed on 19 July last year and died in hospital five days later. She had earlier declined treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and instead followed an \"alternative\" treatment plan, including daily coffee enemas advised by her conspiracy theorist parents. Her brothers were hoping coroner Catherine Wood would find Paloma's death an \"unlawful killing\" after concluding that she \"could and should\" have survived with conventional treatment. However, despite ruling her mother had \"adversely influenced\" Paloma, 23, through \"incomprehensible\" actions - and that both she and her husband had \"more than minimally\" contributed to her death - the inquest did not rule it was \"unlawful\". Her mother, Kay \"Kate\" Shemirani, a prominent online conspiracy theorist, and her father, Dr Faramarz Shemirani, who is \"sympathetic\" to his ex-wife's views, had tried to blame medical staff for their daughter's death. Outside Kent and Medway Coroner's Court, Gabriel Shemirani said: \"It pains me to say that this is a failure by the state I have unfortunately been expecting. \n                  Manchester synagogue attack: Suspect named as police make three arrests\n                 \n                  Phones turned off during Yom Kippur, worshippers leaving synagogue hear news of attack\n                 \n                  Manchester synagogue attack is 'tragic result of Jew hatred', chief rabbi says \n                 \"My sister wasn't just failed by Kay Shemirani, she was failed by a state that showed no care for the people it promises to protect - by social services who played a blind eye to the abuse it should have exposed, by a police force that acted indifferent to a crime it should have investigated and by a coroner that cowered away from a murder it was meant to uncover.\" An osteopath who saw Paloma on the morning she collapsed said he had \"never seen\" a lymphoid mass like hers in 43 years of practice. The inquest was told Ms Shemirani had questioned medical staff to the extent that the coroner found it \"highly likely that she seeded some form of doubt in Paloma's mind as to her diagnosis\". Read more from Sky News:Synagogue attack declared terrorismNicola Sturgeon's letter 'signed in blood' Ms Shemirani was struck off as a nurse in 2021, and a Nursing and Midwifery Council committee found she had spread COVID-19 misinformation that \"put the public at a significant risk of harm\". After graduating from the University of Cambridge, Paloma was working and living in a flat with a housemate and was \"estranged\" from her mother until her cancer diagnosis. Ms Shemirani encouraged her to come back to the family home and took a leading role in Paloma's alternative \"treatment programme\", the inquest heard. At the time of her diagnosis, doctors at Maidstone Hospital told Paloma she had an 80% chance of recovery through chemotherapy. The coroner said: \"It seems that if Paloma had been supported and encouraged to accept her diagnosis and considered chemotherapy with an open mind she probably would have followed that course.\" She later added: \"If approached with an open mind, Paloma would have chosen the chance to survive, and if she had undergone chemotherapy she probably would have survived.\" The coroner found it \"incredible\" Ms Shemirani was claiming her daughter was \"well\" in July, and it was \"egregious and incomprehensible\" that she did not seek further medical advice as Paloma's condition worsened. Abusive \"The influence that was brought to bear on Paloma did contribute more than minimally to her death,\" said Ms Wood. Gabriel Shemirani told the inquest, \"I blame my mother entirely for my sister's death\", by \"obstructing\" his sister from receiving treatment. Mr Shemirani alleged he and his siblings \"felt unsafe\" around their mother and that she had been \"emotionally distant\" and physically abusive to them as children. He further alleged during his evidence that his father was also physically abusive to him and his brother. It was noted in Paloma's initial hospital admittance in autumn 2023 that she had \"recently moved out of her mother's house due to emotional and physical abuse including food restrictions\" by doctors at Maidstone Hospital. Texts and voice notes from her parents during her stay in December 2023 showed them advising her insistently to \"discharge herself\". Family dysfunction In April 2024, Gabriel Shemirani brought a High Court case to assess his sister's ability to exercise her capacity to make medical decisions. The case made slow progress, and while Paloma gave a witness statement saying she was making her own choices, she had said in a text that she was being \"kept out\" of the proceedings, the court heard. The coroner noted the \"striking\" family dysfunction which had been \"on display very publicly\" during the inquest. \"The dynamics within the immediate family were complicated and dysfunctional at the time of Paloma's death,\" she said. Ms Wood added that their behaviour in court had been \"reprehensible\" as they sought to blame medical professionals for their daughter's death. Paloma's brothers were not told about their sister's collapse until after her death."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The UK's most popular supermarket has said it is to introduce \"strong deals\" over the next three months as it prepares for Christmas. It's being done as Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy said he expected people to spread Christmas spending over a wider period to be more manageable and affordable. Money blog: Ryanair CEO's flights warning The supermarket price war, spurred by grocers competing to lower costs and win customers, \"could be even more intensive\" over the next months, Mr Murphy said. Tesco, which is the UK's number one supermarket by market share, has been successful in this fight, saying it was \"continuing to win with customers\". Defending higher profits As a result, it said on Thursday that it expected annual profit to be higher than first thought, in the region of £2.9bn to £3.1bn. It's attracted criticism from the union Unite, whose general secretary Sharon Graham said Tesco \"has profited from the cost-of-living crisis, making a fortune through unfairly inflating grocery prices\".  But Tesco's chief financial officer Imran Nawaz defended the company's profits, saying its investment to bring costs down \"worked better than we thought\". \"When you sell more, you make more.\" This was the biggest contributor to the higher profit outlook, he added. 'Enough is enough' A lot of the overall price rises in the UK, however, are due to policy measures, Mr Murphy said, referring to a new plastic packaging tax and higher employers' national insurance contributions. When asked what the chain hoped to see in the upcoming 26 November budget, Mr Murphy said he didn't want it to be \"harder for the industry to deliver great value for customers\". After last year's budget delivered \"substantial additional operating costs\", he said, \"enough is enough\". The CEO said he had made \"no decision\" and \"can't speculate\" on whether Tesco would close shops if its larger stores are not made exempt from paying business rates. The company pays more than £700m a year in tax on premises, he added. Consumer trends  The supermarket chain has also benefited from the trend it observed of people cooking at home and eating in more, it said. There's been an uptick in sales of fresh food and a \"meaningful increase\" in cooking from scratch. Read more:Finances feeling tight? New figures help explain whyLiving standards stall with signals flashing red for the PM This could be a hangover from the COVID-19 era, maybe due to the growth of streaming services, or potentially a money-saving exercise, Mr Murphy said. \"It's hard to put your finger on the single reason, but it's definitely a trend\".

        "Content": "The next Archbishop of Canterbury is set to be unveiled on Friday, with two women among the frontrunners for the first time in the role's 1,400-year history. The announcement will come nearly a year after Justin Welby resigned from the role due to a damning review into the Church of England's (CoE) handling of a sexual abuse scandal. The process for choosing the new archbishop is incredibly secretive, being led by a former MI5 spy. Here's what you need to know. Who are the favourites? There is no official list of candidates, but bookmakers suggest leading contenders include two female diocesan bishops, Rachel Treweek and Guli Francis-Dehqani. Revd Treweek became the CoE's first female diocesan bishop in 2015 as the 41st Bishop of Gloucester, having started her life in ordained ministry in 1994. During her time as bishop, she has launched two campaigns: #Liedentity, aimed at raising awareness of body image anxiety in young people and Fighting for Women's Justice, aimed at improving the justice system for women. Another potential candidate is Iranian-born Bishop Guli Francis-Dehqani, who came to the UK aged 13 as a refugee with her parents following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Dr Francis-Dehqani is currently lead bishop for housing and is chair of the board of the Church Army. The Bishop of Leicester, Reverend Martyn Snow, is also a favourite, having served there since 2016. He was previously the lead bishop for \"living in love and faith\", which required him to lead the CoE's contentious process to bless same-sex couples, but he stepped down earlier this year, saying he could not unite the Church. Pete Wilcox, Bishop of Sheffield, has reportedly emerged as another frontrunner, having been ordained for more than 30 years. He is also the author of three books and a former senior lecturer in creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University. A female archbishop wouldn't be entirely popular  It's the first time women are eligible for the role, as female bishops weren't consecrated by the CoE when the last archbishop was chosen in 2013. A decade on from when women started being consecrated, they now make up close to a third of all bishops in England. But there are concerns that some conservative Christians would struggle to accept a woman as the symbolic figurehead for 85 million Anglicans worldwide. The conservative Global Anglican Future Conference, which says it represents the majority of Anglicans worldwide, believes only men should be consecrated as bishops. In June, the Diocese of Canterbury published a so-called 'statement of needs' setting out a long list of requirements for the 106th archbishop. They said the next archbishop would need to be: • A person with \"theological depth\" who is a strong communicator with people of all ages and backgrounds.\n • Someone of the \"utmost integrity who is able to speak honestly\" about issues and injustices in the church.\n • A \"servant leader who shows compassion towards the disadvantaged and marginalised\". •  \"Unapologetic about offering a Christian perspective to local, national, and international dialogue\". • Someone with a willingness to ordain and consecrate both men and women, support the ministry of both, and may themselves be male or female. • Someone who previously \"worked, and will continue to work constructively\" around ongoing discussions around blessing services for same-sex couples, but also someone who can \"embrace\" both those who support and oppose same-sex marriage in the church.\n How is the archbishop chosen? The archbishop is chosen by the Crown Nominations Commission, a committee chaired by Jonathan Evans, a former director-general of the MI5 security service. The commission is made up of 17 voting members, including five representatives from the global Anglican Communion, three from Canterbury, and six from the CoE's governing body. After the group reaches a two-thirds majority on two preferred candidates, the nominations are presented to the prime minister, who selects one to be formally appointed by the King. Candidates must be aged at least 30 and generally younger than 70, and historically they have been people already holding senior leadership roles in the Church or elsewhere in the Anglican Communion. Mr Evans previously said he wanted to avoid a list of candidates where all were \"white, Oxbridge, male and come from the southeast of England\". What does the Archbishop of Canterbury do? The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior leader of the Church of England, below the King, who is its supreme governor. They preside over the church and its work in the southern two-thirds of England, while the Archbishop of York leads in the north. Along with all bishops, the archbishops determine the direction of the church and make decisions on its role in society. They also chair the General Synod, which is the church's ruling committee - made up of bishops, clergy, and laity - that meets twice a year to discuss church law and matters of public interest. The Archbishop of Canterbury sits in the House of Lords as a 'Lord Spiritual', acts as patron for various organisations and charities, and is in charge of the Anglican chaplains for each of the British Armed Forces."

        "Content": " The terrorist who killed two men outside a synagogue on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar is believed to be a British citizen of Syrian descent. Greater Manchester Police have named the suspect as Jihad al Shamie, a 35-year-old who is understood to have entered the UK as a young child. He was granted British citizenship in 2006. Three people - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - have been arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Follow the latest updates Al Shamie allegedly drove a car towards the gates of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and then began attacking people with a knife. He was stopped from getting inside by security staff and members of the congregation. Police shot him dead minutes later, fearing that he was wearing a suicide device. Three men remain in a serious condition in hospital. One suffered a stab wound, a second was hurt after being hit by the car, and the third has an injury possibly \"sustained as officers stopped the attacker\". Detectives were still at two locations linked to the arrests on last night: White House Avenue in Crumpsall, and Langley Crescent in Prestwich. The attack happened on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, and police patrols are now being stepped up near synagogues around the country. \"The second he got out of the car, he started stabbing anyone near him,\" witness Chava Lewin said. \"He went for the security guard and tried to break into the synagogue.\" Police said it appeared al Shamie hadn't been flagged up via the Prevent anti-terror and de-radicalisation programme. The prime minister condemned the \"horrific incident\" and apologised to Jewish people \"on behalf of the nation\". The first calls were received at 9.31am and minutes later \"Plato\" was declared - the codeword used by emergency services for a \"marauding terror attack\".  'He's trying to press a button'    Video showed police pointing guns at the attacker as another person lies bloodied and motionless near the synagogue's gates. \"He's trying to press a button,\" says the man filming. \"Shoot him!\" As the attacker tries to get to his feet, a single shot is heard. Police said he was killed seven minutes after the first emergency call. Bomb disposal experts later probed the body and a SAS helicopter flew nearby - but the object worn by the attacker was judged to be \"not viable\".  Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson said there were a lot of people inside the synagogue when the attacker struck. \"Thanks to the immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,\" he said. Read more:Witnesses describe how attack unfoldedWhat we know about synagogue attackWhen ripples from overseas conflicts wash up on UK shores - analysis    Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who returned early from a meeting in Denmark, said Britain must defeat rising anti-Jewish hate.  \"I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears,\" said Sir Keir. \"Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\" Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a solemn day of observance and atonement, and marks the peak of the High Holidays. It comes after Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, with both occasions bookmarking the Ten Days of Repentance. Jews observe Yom Kippur by prayer and fasting from sunset the day before to the sunset of the day itself.  No work is permitted, and for some, the day is spent at a synagogue. The occasion falls on the 10th day of Tishrei - a Hebrew month between late September and early October. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood visited the area, and said the government would do \"whatever is required to keep our Jewish community safe\". Members of the Royal Family also reacted to the attack. The King said he and the Queen were \"deeply shocked and saddened\". \"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services,\" said the monarch.    The Prince and Princess of Wales said their thoughts were \"with the victims and the families\".             "

But people are accustomed to seeing security here. Both paid and volunteer security staff, in their hi-vis jackets, are a permanent fixture outside every synagogue. It's to help protect a community that, even before this attack, has felt under threat. \"The security is not the solution,\" one man tells me as he heads home from prayers. \"Those who really want to do [something like this], they will do it with lots of security, it doesn't matter.\" Among everyone we spoke to, there was a sense of shock at what had happened, but perhaps not necessarily surprise amid rising acts of antisemitism in the UK. David Yehudi and the rabbi he studied with said it had felt like a long time coming. \"As a grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, I feel as if this is before 1935 again,\" he says. \"That's the overwhelming feeling all over the world.\" The rabbi adds: \"The United Nations was set up with the intention of 'never again', and where is the United Nations? In terms of the global support against antisemitism. It's just not there anymore. We are as unsafe as we were before the war.\" It is a shocking thing to hear, on this, the most solemn of days."

When asked if the monarchy will be shifting in a slightly different direction when he becomes king, William says: \"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda. \"Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don't fear it, that's the bit that excites me - the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical change, but changes that I think need to happen.\" What could be described as William's manifesto for the monarchy comes out in an unexpectedly candid interview with the Schitt's Creek star. The Prince of Wales also opens up about being \"overwhelmed\" by family problems last year - as both Kate and the King were diagnosed with cancer - and his desire to try to \"make sure you don't do the same mistakes as your parents\". Describing how he is driven by both his passion to protect his family and his desire to ensure everything is in place when Prince George one day becomes king, he says: \"I want to create a world in which my son is proud of what we do, in a world and a job that actually does impact people's lives for the better. \n                  Prince William tells Eugene Levy he misses late Queen and Prince Philip\n                 \n                  Prince of Wales says 2024 was 'hardest year' of his life\n                 \n                  Prince William praises 'remarkable legacies' of Southport victims' parents\n                 \"That is caveated with, I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation.\" On being monarch one day, he says: \"It's not something I wake up in the morning and think about.\" But in an earlier part of the programme, he does talk more about his desire to potentially shake things up, albeit with a caveat. He says: \"I think it's very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this, but there's also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today?\" In an incredibly open admission about sometimes feeling overwhelmed, especially last year - \"the hardest year\" - he also appears to reveal a man now more at peace with the role that lies ahead for him. Speaking in St George's Hall inside the castle, he says: \"Stuff to do with family overwhelms me, quite a bit. \"You know, worry or stress around the family side of things, that does overwhelm me quite a bit. But in terms of doing the job and things like that, I don't feel too overwhelmed by that. Not now anyway.\" His own childhood, and how that has impacted his thoughts on the media, also come across clearly, at times appearing to echo his brother Prince Harry's thoughts on the press and drive to protect his own family from what they went through as children. As he talks to Levy in a pub in Windsor, William says: \"Growing up, I saw that with my parents ... the media were so insatiable back then. \"And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.\" Those close to the prince believe the interview is the most publicly vulnerable they've ever seen him on camera. The special episode of The Reluctant Traveller With Eugene Levy on Apple TV+ with William airs from today."

The peer has faced calls to stand down from MPs across the political spectrum, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier this week agreed with Baroness Mone's contention that the government was pursuing a \"vendetta\" in trying to recover improper Covid funding. \"Too right we are,\" she said in comments at the Labour Party conference. Money blog: Ryanair CEO warns 100,000 passengers could have flight cancelled  In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone has accused Ms Reeves of endangering her and her family with her comments, citing the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess as evidence of the risks facing parliamentarians. She also alleged ministerial interference in the civil and ongoing criminal investigations of PPE Medpro, and has called for an investigation into whether ministers have \"improperly influenced\" the Crown Prosecution Service and the National Crime Agency.

My family and I now live with a heightened and genuine fear of appearing in public.\" She goes on to accuse Reeves and health secretary Wes Streeting of \"falsehoods\" in demanding that she hand back £122m, pointing out that she was never a director of PPE Medpro and \"never received a penny from it personally.\" While the company was founded by her husband Doug Barrowman, a High Court judgement this week confirmed that Baroness Mone introduced it to the government's VIP fast lane for PPE providers, and lobbied on its behalf in negotiations. She has previously admitted that £29m of profit from the PPE contract was passed to a family trust of which she and her children are beneficiaries. The peer has also accused the Prime Minister of \"a total lie\" when \"you stated in Parliament that my children had received £29m into their bank accounts.\" Baroness Mone said that following these comments, she had received threatening and abusive communications, and cited the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who took her own life, as showing \"the fatal consequences of personalised public vilification\". \"Your cabinet members, by repeating this knowingly false claim, are inciting hostility and inflaming public hatred against me.\" She has also accused the home secretary of influencing the NCA and Director of Public Prosecutions in unspecified meetings to discuss \"high-profile cases\". \"That political influence is being brought to bear is, therefore, undeniable,\" she said.

Three other people remain in hospital having been seriously injured. Here's everything we know so far. How did the attack happen?  Police started receiving calls from members of the public at 9.31am on Thursday, saying a security guard at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall had been attacked with a knife. They also said several others were attacked, with a car driven at members of the public. The synagogue is on Middleton Road in Crumpsall - a neighbourhood about three miles north of Manchester's city centre.

Police initially said four people were injured after the attack and were being treated for injuries \"caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds\". They later confirmed two victims died at the scene, and said four other members of the public were in a serious condition. How have members of the community reacted? Some members of the Jewish community in Crumpsall told Sky News they were \"shocked\" and \"terrified\" by what had happened at the synagogue. \"One man told me several of his friends and family were still inside - though he knows they are safe,\" Sky News' North of England correspondent Katie Barnfield said. \"Another said this is an extremely tolerant community, where people of many faiths, including Jews and Muslims, have lived side by side for years, and he is stunned by what has taken place.\"  Raphi Bloom, a member of the synagogue and director of Fed, a Jewish social care charity, told Sky News he was on the way to the synagogue this morning when he got a call from a friend to warn him about the attack. He said the Jewish community had been \"fearing\" an attack such as this for two years, and that it had been facing a \"tsunami of Jew hatred\" since the war in Gaza began. \"I never thought it would happen at my synagogue, to my friends, to my rabbi, in my city,\" he said. \"But it's something that we feared would come because there has been such an inaction to tackle this wave of hatred targeting the Jewish community in the UK.\" \"Mancunian Jews have played a huge part in making our city the great city it is for 150 years,\" Mr Bloom added. \"We're not going anywhere. We're proud Jews. We're going to stay here. But we need help, and we need this intolerance and this racism, and this Jew hatred stamped out by wider society without fail and immediately.\" What has the national response been? Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"appalled\" and \"absolutely shocked\" by the attack. He has flown home early from a meeting of European leaders in Denmark to chair an emergency COBRA meeting - the cabinet committee that handles matters of national emergency or major disruption.  \"I'm already able to say that additional police assets are being deployed to synagogues across the country, and we will do everything to keep our Jewish community safe,\" he said. The King has also responded to the attack, saying in a statement: \"My wife and I have been deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services.\" Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was \"horrified\" by the attack in a post on social media. \"My first thoughts are with the victims, our brave police and emergency services,\" she wrote, adding that she was being constantly updated by Greater Manchester Police. \"I urge people to follow the advice of the emergency services.\""

        "Content": "An \"utterly abhorrent\" terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue has left two people dead and three others injured.  Images captured before and after the attack have shocked the world. After reports came in on Thursday morning of a man ramming a car and stabbing worshippers at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, police arrived to find a man wearing \"a thick vest\" with items hanging from it. Army personnel were called in, with a bomb disposal robot. Follow live updates from Manchester Photos and videos showed armed police confronting, then shooting, the suspected attacker.  It was one of many vivid photographs from a day that has rocked the community of Crumpsall. Explainer: What we know about the attack Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer cut short an overseas trip to return to the UK to chair an emergency COBRA meeting discussing next steps for security.  One of the Special Air Service's \"Blue Thunder\" helicopters was deployed. The SAS uses the helicopters in the UK for domestic counter-terrorism duties and military exercises. Clearance to deploy it comes only from top government officials.  The British Muslim Trust has joined with a chorus of voices condemning the attack, and described it as \"sickening\" and \"utterly abhorrent\". A regular worshipper at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue told Sky News it was the \"culmination of something the Jewish community has been fearing for two years\". Raphi Bloom, director at a Jewish social care charity in Greater Manchester, said there has been inaction to tackle \"the wave of hatred targeting the Jewish community in the UK\", notably since 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen launched an attack on Israel, and Israel subsequently launched its military operation in Gaza. The 7 October attack in Israel saw 1,200 people killed, most of them civilians, and around 250 people taken hostage. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed since, according to the Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which says more than half of them are women and children. The figure does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Sir Keir Starmer has said \"additional police assets\" will be deployed at synagogues across the country following the attack."

        "Content": "\n          Chief correspondent\n        The screams from the women and children pierce the air as the battering ram smashes through the front door of their home. There's shouting and all-round chaos as police officers - machine guns and pistols held out in front of them - pile inside. Doors are kicked in, curtains ripped down, drawers are opened in bedrooms, and boxes and tables are overturned. \"There's children here!\" the women shout, as they all drop to the floor. We are on a drugs raid in Guayaquil in Ecuador, and the police say they have good intelligence that this is the home of a drug dealer. I have done dozens of embeds during my career covering Latin America's drugs gangs, and it's always deeply upsetting to see children caught up in it. These are homes, and these are women and children, but their rights are trumped by their circumstances - they are poor, live in a rough area, and the likelihood is that one of their family members is part of a gang. The police coming through their door is a fact of life for them. What has changed here, though, is that the raids have increased, and will continue to. Why? Because US President Donald Trump has launched a war against drug cartels - and is demanding that countries on his list of troublesome nations tow the line and join him, or face punishing sanctions or worse. Ecuador doesn't produce drugs, but it is used as a transit country by drug cartels in this region. Its ports are the gateway to sea routes north to the United States and west to Asia and the South Pacific. It is for this reason that Ecuador is on Trump's list. But Ecuador wants help combatting these criminal networks and has been co-operating with the US. Trump has been sending resources and military muscle to Ecuador, and the US is planning to open a military base there. In exchange, Ecuador's security forces are raising their game to assure America that they are on the same page. We witnessed this effort in real time, guided through multiple raids by a police officer with the call sign \"Lynx\". He's a former special forces officer now affiliated with the drugs squad, and he is something of a phenomenon. \"The United States [is] giving us money, guns, technology, and we are so happy about that,\" he told me. \"It's very important for the war.\" You could say that Lynx is in many ways the poster boy of the Ecuadorian police - he's extremely confident, highly rated by his superiors and adored by his team. Among his repertoire of skills, he is an expert drone pilot. Read more from Sky News:Hamas's first reaction to Trump's peace plan is tellingSouth African ambassador found dead outside high-rise hotel I joined him in the car park of the police headquarters as he put up his drone and started spotting drug deals on the streets a kilometre or so away. We watched the screen on the controller as two transactions took place. The multibillion-dollar drugs business is a vast global network, and by taking out the \"small guys\" as Lynx calls them, they hope to disrupt the chain higher up. \"We always grab the small guys, and they talk ... give me that guy, he's a bigger guy, and then we go, go, go,\" is how Lynx describes taking out the chain. They hope that any intelligence they can gather from the lower links will ultimately be valuable information they can pass on to the US to catch more important figures. Lynx briefs his boss, and then we jump in our vehicles as the police try to track down the dealers. They find them - and the drugs they were selling - the next day. The same day, we head to a notoriously dangerous hilltop neighbourhood with Lynx and the rest of the officers. They are looking for more drugs and dealers who will talk. They arrest one man they say is a lookout - and as they search through piles of rubbish for drugs, they find bags of cocaine. Lynx thinks we are being watched, so he sends his drone up again, this time to see what's happening in the streets above us. \"Many people [are] up on the hill, like radars looking for us, and what we are doing, and they have an advantage because they're higher up,\" he says. \"We will take the evidence, and that guy is not the owner, he is just a lookout,\" he says, pointing to the man in handcuffs on the floor. \"And then I'm going to take you next to where a big drug dealer is, a strong dealer.\" I ask Lynx if he thinks people who do drugs in London, New York, or Los Angeles - or anywhere really - think about him and his officers on the streets every single day. \"I think no, because they're in the countries more powerful, smarter, if they really [knew] I think they would think no, it's bad, because people are killing in poor countries for the drugs, for the drugs [they] are consuming,\" he replied. \"Maybe they'll think, oh I don't have to do that.\" The haul of drugs, weapons, ammunition and money from the raids we joined is pretty impressive. Bags of marijuana, kilo packets of cocaine cut for sale, alongside a kilo of pure cocaine paste. There's also money, weapons and ammunition. It's something of a Latin American tradition to display the results of these raids. Behind the table, also on display, are the alleged gang members. Who they know is worth more than all the drugs in front of them, which is what the Americans want."

        "Content": "By Vauldi Carelse, Africa producer  Doomsday cult preacher Paul Mackenzie contacted his followers while in jail and convinced them to starve themselves to death in a fasting ritual, preliminary police investigations indicate. More than 450 graves were discovered in the Shakahola Forest, Malindi, in 2023, for members of Mackenzie's church. Police are currently investigating the deaths of a further 34 people. A total of 102 different body parts were also found during the exhumations, with the bodies buried in graves less than a foot deep. Police were called to the site of the graves in the Kwa Binzaro forest, less than 19 miles from the Shakahola Forest, in July this year. Autopsies have been conducted on all the bodies, six of them children. Two adults were found to have died from blows to the head, but the cause of the other deaths could not be determined due to severe decomposition. In an affidavit before court, Kenyan investigators have alleged how Mackenzie, who previously led the outlawed Good News International Ministries, employed radical and extremist teachings to maintain control over his former followers. This manipulation is said to have been aimed at preventing those who had not been charged in connection with the 2023 Shakahola deaths from testifying against him in related criminal cases. According to the affidavit, Mackenzie delivered \"radical extremism, end-time and/or cultic teachings to them through calls... culminating in their being escorted by his associates to a homestead in Binzaro village and directed to fast inside rooms that were locked and guarded from the outside\". Police filed this affidavit to secure a search warrant for Mackenzie's cell at Shimo La Tewa high security prison, in an effort to find the mobile phone he allegedly used to continue preaching to his followers. Testimonies previously released by police say Mackenzie told his followers \"the fast would count only if they gathered together, and offered them his farm as a fasting venue\". \"They were not to mingle with anyone from the 'outside' world if they wanted to go to heaven and were to destroy all documents given by the government, including national IDs and birth certificates,\" police said. Officials also said Mackenzie hired criminals armed with weapons to kill followers who changed their minds about fasting and wanted to leave, along with those who took too long to die. He has been in custody since 2023 and faces a host of charges, including terrorism, child cruelty and murder. He has previously pleaded not guilty to manslaughter. Four people, believed to have been in contact with Mackenzie, are currently in custody over the Binzaro village deaths. Sharleen Temba Anido, Kahindi Kazungu Garama, Thomas Mukonwe, and James Kazungu are said to have organised a \"holy safari to see Jesus\". They escaped from Shakahola forest but are now accused of reviving Mackenzie's radical teachings."

        "Content": "\n          Money live reporter\n              @JournoJess97\n Ryanair's chief executive has warned that 100,000 passengers could see their flights disrupted next week due to an air traffic control union strike in France. Michael O'Leary told the Money blog the industrial action would cost Ryanair around £20m. While the company could afford to swallow the cost, he said, it would ultimately be customers who will be worse off, and they should complain. Members of the SNCTA will go on strike from Tuesday 7 October until the morning of Friday 10 October over a dispute about pay and working conditions. While it will obviously affect flights heading to France, it will also affect those that use French airspace to reach their final destination - these are called overflights. This includes flights to and from lots of places including Spain, Italy and Greece. O'Leary called for overflights to be protected from strike action, saying disrupting them is an abuse of the free single market. \n                  Bonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 \n                  Ryanair raises fares after profits hit by lower ticket prices\n                 On the first two days of the strikes, he said Ryanair was expecting to be asked to cancel about 600 flights - with almost all of them overflights. \"That's about 100,000 passengers who will have their flights cancelled needlessly next Wednesday and Thursday,\" he said. \"On any given day at the moment, we operate about 3,500 flights and about 900 of those flights cross over French airspace and about two thirds of those, around 600 flights, are cancelled every day there's an air traffic control strike. \"The UK is the country whose flights get cancelled most because of the geographic proximity to France.\" Read more:Flight delayed or cancelled? These are your rightsBonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage While he accepted the rights of French workers to strike, he said Eurocontrol, a civil-military organisation that supports air traffic management across Europe, could step in to look after the airspace and keep flights operating. \"It wouldn't stop the French striking, they have the right to strike and we accept that but they should be cancelling local French fights, not flights from the UK to Spain or from Italy to Ireland. This is a fundamental breach of the single market,\" he said. He called on the government to \"put pressure\" on the EU Commission and the French government to protect overflights during industrial action. \"We bloody well demand that our overflights are protected. If British citizens today going to Italy, or we have Spanish visitors wanting to come to London, they should not have their flights disrupted or cancelled,\" he said.

Several other European airlines, such as EasyJet, British Airways, Vueling and Lufthansa, could also face disruptions. The full impact of the strikes next week is still unknown, as airlines tend to avoid cancellations this early before the action begins. EasyJet told Money it was still waiting for information from the authorities to understand the impact of the strikes. \"We will update customers directly and continue to monitor the situation,\" it said. If you are due to travel during the strike, it's worth keeping an eye on the status of your flight on the airline's website or app."

        "Content": "\n          Europe correspondent\n              @AliBunkallSKY\n  The head of a leading counter-drone manufacturer has warned that Europe lacks the defences to protect itself against Russia and will need thousands of systems to build a proposed \"drone wall\" across the continent. Sky News visited the factory in the northern Danish city of Aalborg, one of the cities targeted by suspected Russian drones last week, which caused airspace to close for several hours. \"The number of installations that you need to have in order to protect is high and today, what is already installed is very, very low,\" explained Dan Hermansen, chief executive of MyDefence. \"It depends on how long you need to make the 'wall', but take a typical airport, you'll need an installation of say 10 [detection systems] to cover it, then you can have jamming equipment on top of that, so you're into the many thousands [of devices needed].\" Their counter-drone technology is already being used by Ukrainian troops on the frontline to defend against Russian drones. The equipment can track incoming drones, hijack the signal, and forcibly divert them back to their origin. They can also detect the make and model of the drone and triangulate the location of the controller. In recent days, foreign governments have enquired about buying the sensors. \n                  Trump's declared war on drug cartels.

Nobody has really cared about it for years, so it has not been a high-value thing to invest in, and suddenly you have airports that are super vulnerable to this threat, and now everybody is scrambling to get stuff to happen,\" Mr Hermansen told us. \"Everybody needs to wake up and say okay, this has to be a sustainable way of protecting critical infrastructure going forward.\"  The warning comes as European leaders gather in the Danish capital Copenhagen to discuss a response to numerous recent Russian incursions into European airspace. \"When I look at Europe today, I think we are in the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the Second World War, not the Cold War anymore,\" Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on the eve of the meeting. \"I hope that everybody recognizes now that there is a hybrid war, and one day it's Poland, the other day it's Denmark, and next week it will probably be somewhere else that we see sabotage or we see drones flying. \"There are many different kinds of episodes. So I see this from a European perspective. There is only one country that is willing to threaten us, and it is Russia, and therefore we need a very strong answer back.\" Although Danish security officials haven't publicly blamed Russia, some European countries have already pointed the finger at Moscow, as the incidents happened shortly after Russian drones were flown into Polish and Romanian airspace. There were further sightings of drones flying near and over military bases in northern Germany last week too, and Sky News has learned that more potential incursions have been detected and averted since new counter-drone equipment was installed in Copenhagen in recent days. Police and intelligence agencies are now working on a theory that the drones could have been launched and controlled from a Russian ship disguised as a cargo vessel in the waters close by.

Security is tight in Copenhagen as the meeting gets under way - drones are banned from flying nationwide, Danish warships are patrolling off the coast, and counter-drone technology can be seen at the country's main international airport. A number of NATO militaries have flown in equipment to help protect the gathering. There is a sense that NATO countries are playing catch-up somewhat - responding to new Russian threats, as and when they happen. Right now, its drone incursions. But Moscow will almost certainly adapt, change tactics, and find a new way to test Europe's defences."

        "Content": "\n          Chief correspondent\n        The screams from the women and children pierce the air as the battering ram smashes through the front door of their home. There's shouting and all-round chaos as police officers - machine guns and pistols held out in front of them - pile inside. Doors are kicked in, curtains ripped down, drawers are opened in bedrooms, and boxes and tables are overturned. \"There's children here!\" the women shout, as they all drop to the floor. We are on a drugs raid in Guayaquil in Ecuador, and the police say they have good intelligence that this is the home of a drug dealer. I have done dozens of embeds during my career covering Latin America's drugs gangs, and it's always deeply upsetting to see children caught up in it. These are homes, and these are women and children, but their rights are trumped by their circumstances - they are poor, live in a rough area, and the likelihood is that one of their family members is part of a gang. The police coming through their door is a fact of life for them. What has changed here, though, is that the raids have increased, and will continue to. Why? Because US President Donald Trump has launched a war against drug cartels - and is demanding that countries on his list of troublesome nations tow the line and join him, or face punishing sanctions or worse. Ecuador doesn't produce drugs, but it is used as a transit country by drug cartels in this region. Its ports are the gateway to sea routes north to the United States and west to Asia and the South Pacific. It is for this reason that Ecuador is on Trump's list. But Ecuador wants help combatting these criminal networks and has been co-operating with the US. Trump has been sending resources and military muscle to Ecuador, and the US is planning to open a military base there. In exchange, Ecuador's security forces are raising their game to assure America that they are on the same page. We witnessed this effort in real time, guided through multiple raids by a police officer with the call sign \"Lynx\". He's a former special forces officer now affiliated with the drugs squad, and he is something of a phenomenon. \"The United States [is] giving us money, guns, technology, and we are so happy about that,\" he told me. \"It's very important for the war.\" You could say that Lynx is in many ways the poster boy of the Ecuadorian police - he's extremely confident, highly rated by his superiors and adored by his team. Among his repertoire of skills, he is an expert drone pilot. Read more from Sky News:Hamas's first reaction to Trump's peace plan is tellingSouth African ambassador found dead outside high-rise hotel I joined him in the car park of the police headquarters as he put up his drone and started spotting drug deals on the streets a kilometre or so away. We watched the screen on the controller as two transactions took place. The multibillion-dollar drugs business is a vast global network, and by taking out the \"small guys\" as Lynx calls them, they hope to disrupt the chain higher up. \"We always grab the small guys, and they talk ... give me that guy, he's a bigger guy, and then we go, go, go,\" is how Lynx describes taking out the chain. They hope that any intelligence they can gather from the lower links will ultimately be valuable information they can pass on to the US to catch more important figures. Lynx briefs his boss, and then we jump in our vehicles as the police try to track down the dealers. They find them - and the drugs they were selling - the next day. The same day, we head to a notoriously dangerous hilltop neighbourhood with Lynx and the rest of the officers. They are looking for more drugs and dealers who will talk. They arrest one man they say is a lookout - and as they search through piles of rubbish for drugs, they find bags of cocaine. Lynx thinks we are being watched, so he sends his drone up again, this time to see what's happening in the streets above us. \"Many people [are] up on the hill, like radars looking for us, and what we are doing, and they have an advantage because they're higher up,\" he says. \"We will take the evidence, and that guy is not the owner, he is just a lookout,\" he says, pointing to the man in handcuffs on the floor. \"And then I'm going to take you next to where a big drug dealer is, a strong dealer.\" I ask Lynx if he thinks people who do drugs in London, New York, or Los Angeles - or anywhere really - think about him and his officers on the streets every single day. \"I think no, because they're in the countries more powerful, smarter, if they really [knew] I think they would think no, it's bad, because people are killing in poor countries for the drugs, for the drugs [they] are consuming,\" he replied. \"Maybe they'll think, oh I don't have to do that.\" The haul of drugs, weapons, ammunition and money from the raids we joined is pretty impressive. Bags of marijuana, kilo packets of cocaine cut for sale, alongside a kilo of pure cocaine paste. There's also money, weapons and ammunition. It's something of a Latin American tradition to display the results of these raids. Behind the table, also on display, are the alleged gang members. Who they know is worth more than all the drugs in front of them, which is what the Americans want."

        "Content": " Two people have been arrested over suspected immigration offences as a self-styled African tribe was evicted from a Scottish forest. The group, who have named themselves the Kingdom of Kubala, have been living in woods in Jedburgh, near the border of England, since May. After they were served with an eviction notice in August, as they were on private land, the trio last month moved their campsite over a fence to a neighbouring plot of land owned by the Scottish Borders Council. At Selkirk Sheriff Court on Wednesday, Sheriff Peter Paterson ruled that the trio would not be able to return to the original plot of land they were evicted from. Officers from Immigration Enforcement and Police Scotland went to the site on Thursday. It is understood that a Ghanaian man and an American woman were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"It would not be appropriate to comment while an investigation is ongoing.\" Councillor Scott Hamilton, deputy leader of the local authority, said police, sheriff officers and other agencies went to the camp and evicted the trio. He told Sky News: \"So, this group obviously arrived in Jedburgh a number of months ago. They set up camp here. \"They were originally on Scottish Borders Council land, and they set up camp and claimed they were a Kingdom of Kubala. And this, quite frankly, was ludicrous. \"It broke laws. It broke the rules. And as landowners we took action, as well as private landowners, to ensure this outcome today.\" Mr Hamilton said you \"could never guess\" the group's next move, with the trio refusing to engage with the council, Police Scotland and adult protective services. He added that \"all they wanted was publicity\". The group is made up of Kofi Offeh, 36, who calls himself King Atehene, his wife Jean Gasho, 43, who calls herself Queen Nandi, and \"handmaiden\" Kaura Taylor, 21, who goes by the name of Asnat. The members of the self-proclaimed \"kingdom\" have said they are reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago. Mr Hamilton branded their claim \"ludicrous\", adding: \"We're working with the police, the Home Office etc, so we'll continue to have that liaison as this case progresses. \"But people of Jedburgh can take some relief today that action has been taken.\" The site is now being cleared by the council.

        "Content": "\n          Scotland correspondent\n              @ConnorGillies\n  A Texas woman has told Sky News an African \"cult\" brainwashed, lured and coerced her daughter to move 4,000 miles away to a Scottish forest by preying on her vulnerabilities. Aspiring lawyer Kaura Taylor, 21, was reported missing from Dallas in May 2025. Her family then spotted an online image of her living as a \"handmaiden\" in the so-called Kingdom of Kubala in Jedburgh, Scotland. Sky News can reveal Scottish authorities are assessing a report involving welfare and safety concerns. Speaking exclusively in her first on-camera interview from Texas, Kaura's mother, Melba Whitehead, pleaded for authorities to urgently deport her daughter to the US so they can be reunited. In a separate development, Councillor Scott Hamilton, deputy leader of the local authority, said police, sheriff officers and other agencies went to the camp on Thursday morning and evicted the trio. He told Sky News: \"So, this group obviously arrived in Jedburgh a number of months ago. They set up camp here. \"They were originally on Scottish Borders Council land, and they set up camp and claimed they were a Kingdom of Kubala. And this, quite frankly, was ludicrous. \"It broke laws. It broke the rules. And as landowners we took action, as well as private landowners, to ensure this outcome today.\" The group, dressed head to toe in traditional African attire, is run by Kofi Offeh - who refers to himself as \"The King\" - and his partner Jean Gasho, who goes by \"The Queen\". Both lived a troubled existence in Stockton-on-Tees, in northeast England, prior to camping in the Scottish borders. A video online shows Mr Offeh claiming ownership of Kaura and boasting \"I bought you at a price\" before she swears allegiance to her \"masters\". The camp, on the edge of an industrial estate, is at the centre of a legal battle after eviction notices were served to remove them from private and council land. 'Under a spell' Ms Whitehead alleges she became embroiled in a family dispute following the COVID pandemic. She said the \"cult\" groomed her daughter, who was 19 at the time, on social media, before buying a one-way ticket to the UK for a new life in the woods. The 45-year-old told Sky News: \"They utilised the fact that she was angry. To encourage her to get away. They used the fact she was penniless. \"They utilised the funds that they had at their disposal to send for her. They made that happen.\" Asked if she believes Kaura was coerced into leaving the US, Melba Whitehead said: \"I know so. She's totally brainwashed. This is a cult. \"The first thing a cult is known to do is separate you from those that love you.\" She continued: \"This isn't just another young adult rebelling. This isn't just another young adult who's mad at the world. The difference is she's under someone else's spell in another country.\" 'I can run away if I wish' Sky News has interviewed Kaura Taylor on her own, away from the so-called Kingdom of Kubala. She denied being coerced and insisted: \"Others are not my concern. People who care about my best interests know why I am here.\" The 21-year-old said \"the only things that matter are the camp, the trees and the creepy crawlies\" - as she denied being in a cult and dismissed her family's concerns. When pressed on how she got to the UK as a cash-strapped teenager, she said she had fled a \"rough background\" and arrived via a \"divine form of transport\". Ms Taylor said she had the ability to \"run\" away if she wanted, but had no intention of doing so. Police Scotland told Sky News that officers were looking to \"engage with the individual concerned\" after a report was made raising concerns. \"I don't know why Scotland is allowing this foolishness,\" said Melba Whitehead. \"I believe that Jean and Kofi are opportunistic. I believe there are leeches and vultures for my daughter.\" 'Washed by righteousness' Jean Gasho and Kofi Offeh denied the allegations when Sky News returned to the woods seeking a response. When asked if he was operating a cult that was brainwashing Kaura, Mr Offeh replied: \"This is the Kingdom ... brainwashing is the best thing ever to happen to man if it is coming from the right source. For everyone's brain needs to be washed by righteousness.\" He was questioned on whether he had coerced the 21-year-old but repeatedly dodged giving a direct answer. He said: \"I am the King of Kubala, and all nations belong to me. Everyone you see bows before me because I am the chosen one. They are not coerced, they are called.\" Jean Gasho refused to answer around a dozen questions unless she was referred to as a queen. \"When you address me as the Queen then I will answer your question,\" she said. She then starting singing a traditional African song in an attempt to drown out further questions.

The Surviving Universal UK founder has become an expert after she was groomed in a church-based cult in the British capital from age 13. Ms Reign told Sky News the Kingdom of Kubala has all the hallmarks of a cult, but it was difficult to help someone who doesn't recognise they need support. She said: \"I believe it to be a cult. She had particular vulnerabilities, and she was searching for a sense of community and purpose, and that is how cults target people. \"It is completely normalised. That is her reality, and any kind of critique or grievances is seen as a personal attack on her identity and her community. But she is at risk, she's been isolated, and she needs to be safeguarded.\" Ms Reign added: \"There has to be greater understanding around coercive control in relation to cults. \"Currently coercive control is only recognised within domestic settings, which means that victims of coercive control outside of domestic settings fall completely under the radar. There has to be some recognition in terms of legislation.\" The Home Office has been approached for comment."

        "Content": "A lawsuit against Nirvana - filed by a man who claimed his depiction as a naked four-month-old baby on their album cover was child pornography - has been dismissed for the second time. A photo of Spencer Elden swimming towards a dollar bill on a fishhook had appeared on the cover of the rock band's iconic album Nevermind in 1991. But Judge Fernando Olguin threw out the case after ruling that no reasonable jury would consider the image pornographic, likening it instead to a \"family photo of a nude child bathing\". \"Other than the fact that plaintiff was nude on the album cover, nothing comes close to bringing the image within the ambit of the child pornography statute,\" he said. Elden's legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nirvana's lawyer Bert Deixler said they were \"delighted that the court has ended this meritless case and freed our creative clients of the stigma of false allegations\". The defendants included surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, late lead singer Kurt Cobain's widow Courtney Love, and photographer Kirk Weddle. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs admits 'past wrongs' in letter to judge - hours before his sentencing \n                 \n                  Why emergency Eurovision vote on Israel might not stop a broadcast boycott\n                 \n                  Hunter S Thompson's death to be reviewed after widow's request, Colorado officials say\n                 The photo was taken at the Pasadena Aquatic Centre in California.

Judge Olguin initially dismissed the case in 2022 on the grounds that Elden's claims were time barred, without addressing the substance of the allegations. However, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in 2023. In a 2003 Rolling Stone interview when he was 12, Elden acknowledged the photo and said he was \"probably gonna get some money from it\". However, in his August 2021 lawsuit, Elden argued that his injuries - including emotional distress, lost earning potential, and diminished enjoyment of life - extended into adulthood, allowing him to meet the statute of limitations. The judge dismissed this claim, stating it would effectively allow Elden to sue Nirvana indefinitely. Nevermind, which features the hit song Smells Like Teen Spirit, has sold over 30 million copies."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n A member of cyber attack-hit Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain has told Sky News the government must act to safeguard the sector as it has seen no financial relief to date. Mike Beese, who owns Walsall-based Genex UK, was speaking as an industry body complained that support revealed by the government last week was failing to reach suppliers. While unveiling a £1.5bn loan guarantee for JLR last Saturday, Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said it would \"help support the supply chain and protect skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside and throughout the UK\". Money latest: Energy giant handing out £2,000 grants - if you apply Many interpreted the liquidity offer as a bailout, of sorts, that JLR would draw down on and distribute to ease pressure on both direct and indirect suppliers - companies that employ around 200,000 people. Businesses affected by the production shutdown are now arguing they need the support they thought they were being promised by Mr Kyle. It is unclear how his department and the chancellor saw the loan guarantee working in practice. \n                  Tinned tuna-owner Princes to unveil £1.5bn London float\n                 \n                  Michelle Mone says she won't step down as Tory peer - and accuses chancellor of 'endangering' her \n                 \n                  Money latest: Virgin Media increases annual price hike by 14%\n                 For its part, JLR is understood to have not seen a need to finalise or draw on any such arrangement to date, as its direct suppliers - the companies it deals with - have continued to be paid through existing funds. It expects that money to trickle down to lower tiers of that supply chain. However, as the production shutdown enters its second month, there is no visibility on when JLR factories will get back to full speed. Mr Beese said it was for this reason that the government had to intervene, potentially through a loan scheme for suppliers. \"We need certainty,\" he declared. He said of his own customers: \"We need that money to come in so we can pay our suppliers.\" Mr Beese added: \"That money needs to cascade down the tiers [but] it's not going to be enough and you've got to make that up at some point.\" Mr Breese, who employs 17 people and provides parts for several major JLR suppliers, said he attached no blame to JLR, which has been losing at least £50m a week since the attack in late August. He also laid no fault at the door of the companies he supplied. \"Only the government\" could bring the relief the industry needed, he argued, while explaining that terms from lenders were out of reach given the scale of the uncertainty. Commenting on the toll the crisis was taking, Mr Beese said: \"It's very stressful... people in the same boat are ringing me to be paid. \"My staff all need certainty as well... these people aren't just a number, they have families.\"  The president of the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), Stephen Morley, said: \"We need to find a way to get money quickly to where it is needed most, to prevent the supply chain from completely collapsing and that could be an additional type of loan. \"JLR is rightly focused on getting payments through to their first-tier suppliers, and it's best we allow them to complete that process. \"Our focus now must be on ensuring that second-tier and smaller suppliers in the chain are supported, so the whole framework is in place when production restarts.\" JLR revealed earlier this week that it planned to resume limited production \"in the coming days\" as it continues efforts to restart key IT systems. No firm date has since been announced. A spokesperson for JLR said: \"As the controlled, phased restart of our operations continues, we are delivering solutions to support our suppliers through the period of disruption caused by the cyber incident. \"This includes establishing a supplier help desk with additional resources, putting in place a manual payment system to clear down outstanding invoices, and working to re-establish the automated supplier payment systems. \"We would like to thank everyone connected with JLR for their continued patience, understanding and support. We know there is much more to do but the foundational work of our recovery is firmly underway, and we will continue to provide updates as we progress.\" A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We acted swiftly to protect JLR, recognising the importance of the tens of thousands of people they employ directly and indirectly and to provide the company with liquidity at a key time. \"We continue to work with JLR and suppliers directly to understand the impact of the cyber attack - including on tier 2 and tier 3 suppliers - and how the support put in place is helping them.\""

City sources said a statement was likely to be issued on Friday morning. Money latest: Energy giant handing out £2,000 grants - if you apply It will come more than four months after Sky News revealed that Newlat, which only acquired the Princes portfolio last year, had appointed a syndicate of investment banks to pave the way for the listing.

Princes was bought from Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation amid competition from private equity bidders. \"A potential IPO may provide a tangible opportunity to fully drive the growth potential of the food & drinks business, while also enabling the business to secure additional financial resources to accelerate its external growth strategy,\" Newlat said in May. If successfully completed, a listing of New Princes would deliver a fillip to the London Stock Exchange, which has been starved of prominent new listings in the last couple of years. Sky News revealed several weeks ago that Shawbrook Group, the bank, was in talks with institutional investors about a potential autumn float. New Princes has been contacted for comment."

The peer has faced calls to stand down from MPs across the political spectrum, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier this week agreed with Baroness Mone's contention that the government was pursuing a \"vendetta\" in trying to recover improper Covid funding. \"Too right we are,\" she said in comments at the Labour Party conference. Money blog: Ryanair CEO warns 100,000 passengers could have flight cancelled  In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone has accused Ms Reeves of endangering her and her family with her comments, citing the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess as evidence of the risks facing parliamentarians. She also alleged ministerial interference in the civil and ongoing criminal investigations of PPE Medpro, and has called for an investigation into whether ministers have \"improperly influenced\" the Crown Prosecution Service and the National Crime Agency.

My family and I now live with a heightened and genuine fear of appearing in public.\" She goes on to accuse Reeves and health secretary Wes Streeting of \"falsehoods\" in demanding that she hand back £122m, pointing out that she was never a director of PPE Medpro and \"never received a penny from it personally.\" While the company was founded by her husband Doug Barrowman, a High Court judgement this week confirmed that Baroness Mone introduced it to the government's VIP fast lane for PPE providers, and lobbied on its behalf in negotiations. She has previously admitted that £29m of profit from the PPE contract was passed to a family trust of which she and her children are beneficiaries. The peer has also accused the Prime Minister of \"a total lie\" when \"you stated in Parliament that my children had received £29m into their bank accounts.\" Baroness Mone said that following these comments, she had received threatening and abusive communications, and cited the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who took her own life, as showing \"the fatal consequences of personalised public vilification\". \"Your cabinet members, by repeating this knowingly false claim, are inciting hostility and inflaming public hatred against me.\" She has also accused the home secretary of influencing the NCA and Director of Public Prosecutions in unspecified meetings to discuss \"high-profile cases\". \"That political influence is being brought to bear is, therefore, undeniable,\" she said.

It's being done as Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy said he expected people to spread Christmas spending over a wider period to be more manageable and affordable. Money blog: Ryanair CEO's flights warning The supermarket price war, spurred by grocers competing to lower costs and win customers, \"could be even more intensive\" over the next months, Mr Murphy said. Tesco, which is the UK's number one supermarket by market share, has been successful in this fight, saying it was \"continuing to win with customers\". Defending higher profits As a result, it said on Thursday that it expected annual profit to be higher than first thought, in the region of £2.9bn to £3.1bn. It's attracted criticism from the union Unite, whose general secretary Sharon Graham said Tesco \"has profited from the cost-of-living crisis, making a fortune through unfairly inflating grocery prices\".  But Tesco's chief financial officer Imran Nawaz defended the company's profits, saying its investment to bring costs down \"worked better than we thought\". \"When you sell more, you make more.\" This was the biggest contributor to the higher profit outlook, he added. 'Enough is enough' A lot of the overall price rises in the UK, however, are due to policy measures, Mr Murphy said, referring to a new plastic packaging tax and higher employers' national insurance contributions. When asked what the chain hoped to see in the upcoming 26 November budget, Mr Murphy said he didn't want it to be \"harder for the industry to deliver great value for customers\". After last year's budget delivered \"substantial additional operating costs\", he said, \"enough is enough\". The CEO said he had made \"no decision\" and \"can't speculate\" on whether Tesco would close shops if its larger stores are not made exempt from paying business rates. The company pays more than £700m a year in tax on premises, he added. Consumer trends  The supermarket chain has also benefited from the trend it observed of people cooking at home and eating in more, it said. There's been an uptick in sales of fresh food and a \"meaningful increase\" in cooking from scratch. Read more:Finances feeling tight?

Similarly, Tesco's luxury own-brand line continued to grow in popularity with double-digit sales growth for the third year in a row."

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n  Monthly disposable income fell by £40 per person between Boris Johnson's election victory in December 2019 and Rishi Sunak's defeat in July 2024. It is the first time in recorded British history that disposable income has been lower at the end of a parliamentary term than it was at the start, Sky News Data x Forensics analysis reveals. Disposable income is the money people have left over after paying taxes and receiving benefits (including pensions). Essential expenses like rent or mortgage payments, council tax, food and energy bills all need to be paid from disposable income. Previously published figures showed a slight improvement between December 2019 and June 2024, but those were updated by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. There has been an uplift in the last year, although we're poorer now than we were at the start of the year, and today we only have £1 more on average to spend or save each month than we did at the end of 2019. That represents \"an unmitigated disaster for living standards\", according to Lalitha Try, economist at independent living standards thinktank the Resolution Foundation. Have things gotten better under Labour? Disposable income has increased by £41 per person per month since Labour took office in July 2024. However, that masks a significant deterioration in recent months: it is lower now than it was at the start of 2025. In the first six months of Labour's tenure, disposable income rose by £55, a larger increase than under any other government in the same period. In part, this was down to the pay rises for public sector workers that had been agreed under the previous Conservative administration. But the rise also represents a continuation of the trajectory from the final six months of the outgoing government. Between December 2023 and June 2024, monthly disposable income rose by £46. That trajectory reversed in the first part of this year, and the average person now has £14 less to spend or save each month than they did at the start of 2025. Jeremy Hunt, Conservative chancellor from October 2022 until the July 2024 election defeat, told Sky News: \"The big picture is that it was the pandemic rather than actions of a government that caused it [the fall in disposable income]. \"I clawed some back through (I know I would say this) hard work, and Labour tried to buy an instant boost through massive pay rises. The curious thing is why they have not fed through to the numbers.\" The £40 drop between Mr Johnson's electoral victory in 2019 and Mr Sunak's loss in 2024 is roughly the same as the average person spends on food and drink per week. By comparison, since 1955, when the data dates back to, living standards have improved by an average of £115 per month between parliamentary terms. Vital services, things like energy, food and housing, that all need to be paid for out of disposable income, have all increased in price at a faster rate than overall inflation since 2019 as well. This means that the impact on savings and discretionary spending is likely to be more severe for most people, and especially so for lower earners who spend a larger proportion of their money on essentials. Responding to our analysis, the Resolution Foundation's Lalitha Try said: “Average household incomes fell marginally during the last parliament - an unmitigated disaster for living standards, as families were hit first by the pandemic and then the highest inflation in a generation. \"We desperately need a catch-up boost to household incomes in the second half of the 2020s, and to achieve that we'll need a return to wider economic growth.\" Analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also takes into account housing costs, says that disposable income is projected to be £45 a month lower by September 2029 than it was when Labour took office.

        "Content": "\n          Money live reporter\n              @JournoJess97\n Ryanair's chief executive has warned that 100,000 passengers could see their flights disrupted next week due to an air traffic control union strike in France. Michael O'Leary told the Money blog the industrial action would cost Ryanair around £20m. While the company could afford to swallow the cost, he said, it would ultimately be customers who will be worse off, and they should complain. Members of the SNCTA will go on strike from Tuesday 7 October until the morning of Friday 10 October over a dispute about pay and working conditions. While it will obviously affect flights heading to France, it will also affect those that use French airspace to reach their final destination - these are called overflights. This includes flights to and from lots of places including Spain, Italy and Greece. O'Leary called for overflights to be protected from strike action, saying disrupting them is an abuse of the free single market. \n                  Bonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage\n                 \n                  Ryanair to increase size of underseat free bag by 20% following EU proposals\n                 \n                  Ryanair raises fares after profits hit by lower ticket prices\n                 On the first two days of the strikes, he said Ryanair was expecting to be asked to cancel about 600 flights - with almost all of them overflights. \"That's about 100,000 passengers who will have their flights cancelled needlessly next Wednesday and Thursday,\" he said. \"On any given day at the moment, we operate about 3,500 flights and about 900 of those flights cross over French airspace and about two thirds of those, around 600 flights, are cancelled every day there's an air traffic control strike. \"The UK is the country whose flights get cancelled most because of the geographic proximity to France.\" Read more:Flight delayed or cancelled? These are your rightsBonuses to rise for Ryanair staff spotting oversized baggage While he accepted the rights of French workers to strike, he said Eurocontrol, a civil-military organisation that supports air traffic management across Europe, could step in to look after the airspace and keep flights operating. \"It wouldn't stop the French striking, they have the right to strike and we accept that but they should be cancelling local French fights, not flights from the UK to Spain or from Italy to Ireland. This is a fundamental breach of the single market,\" he said. He called on the government to \"put pressure\" on the EU Commission and the French government to protect overflights during industrial action. \"We bloody well demand that our overflights are protected. If British citizens today going to Italy, or we have Spanish visitors wanting to come to London, they should not have their flights disrupted or cancelled,\" he said. He claimed: \"They [the government] don't care about the travelling public and they won't get off their arses and demand that their overflights be protected.\" Read all the latest Money news here A Department of Transport spokesperson said: \"Airspace is sovereign, and it is for each state to decide how best to manage their own. \"We know strikes can cause disruption for passengers and airlines and airports have robust resilience plans in place to minimise their impact.\" O'Leary encouraged affected passengers to complain about any disruptions to transport ministers and the European Commission using the airline's dedicated ATCruinedourholiday.com website. Several other European airlines, such as EasyJet, British Airways, Vueling and Lufthansa, could also face disruptions. The full impact of the strikes next week is still unknown, as airlines tend to avoid cancellations this early before the action begins. EasyJet told Money it was still waiting for information from the authorities to understand the impact of the strikes. \"We will update customers directly and continue to monitor the situation,\" it said. If you are due to travel during the strike, it's worth keeping an eye on the status of your flight on the airline's website or app."

Sky News understands that Seat Unique, which has raised tens of millions of pounds in a bid to consolidate the 'experience economy', has signed a deal to acquire Circuit Hospitality for about £12m. The deal is understood to have been agreed this week. Seat Unique, which is run by co-founder Robin Sherry, has been involved in ticketing for recent events such as last week's Evening with President Obama at The O2 and this summer's Oasis tour. It is understood to view the Circuit Hospitality deal as a step towards gaining market share in the traditional corporate hospitality arena, with a stronger foothold in Premier League football by virtue of agreements with Arsenal and Everton football clubs one immediate benefit. Earlier this year, the company raised an additional £10m in funding from existing investors, led by Nickleby Capital, which has backed a string of technology unicorns.

A large Series B fundraising for the company is said to be planned for next year. Seat Unique is chaired by Richard Flint, the former SkyBet chief who also runs the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. It markets original ticketing inventory, unlike secondary platforms, which have come under growing political pressure for their treatment of consumers. Seat Unique declined to comment."

The peer has faced calls to stand down from MPs across the political spectrum, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who earlier this week agreed with Baroness Mone's contention that the government was pursuing a \"vendetta\" in trying to recover improper Covid funding. \"Too right we are,\" she said in comments at the Labour Party conference. Money blog: Ryanair CEO warns 100,000 passengers could have flight cancelled  In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone has accused Ms Reeves of endangering her and her family with her comments, citing the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess as evidence of the risks facing parliamentarians. She also alleged ministerial interference in the civil and ongoing criminal investigations of PPE Medpro, and has called for an investigation into whether ministers have \"improperly influenced\" the Crown Prosecution Service and the National Crime Agency. In the letter, sent from the private office of Baroness Mone OBE and seen by Sky News, she addresses the prime minister directly, writing in a personal capacity \"first as a wife, second as a mother, and lastly as a Baroness.\" \n                  Baroness Mone should resign from Lords, senior Tory says, after order to pay back £122m over COVID PPE\n                 \n                  Firm linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone breached £122m PPE contract, judge rules\n                 \n                  Tory peer Michelle Mone accuses government of 'scapegoating' over PPE scandal in online tirade\n                  Referring to Ms Reeves' comments, she writes: \"The chancellor's deliberate use of the term \"vendetta\", a word connoting vengeance, feud and blood feud, is incendiary and has directly increased the risks to my personal safety.... My family and I now live with a heightened and genuine fear of appearing in public.\" She goes on to accuse Reeves and health secretary Wes Streeting of \"falsehoods\" in demanding that she hand back £122m, pointing out that she was never a director of PPE Medpro and \"never received a penny from it personally.\" While the company was founded by her husband Doug Barrowman, a High Court judgement this week confirmed that Baroness Mone introduced it to the government's VIP fast lane for PPE providers, and lobbied on its behalf in negotiations. She has previously admitted that £29m of profit from the PPE contract was passed to a family trust of which she and her children are beneficiaries. The peer has also accused the Prime Minister of \"a total lie\" when \"you stated in Parliament that my children had received £29m into their bank accounts.\" Baroness Mone said that following these comments, she had received threatening and abusive communications, and cited the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who took her own life, as showing \"the fatal consequences of personalised public vilification\". \"Your cabinet members, by repeating this knowingly false claim, are inciting hostility and inflaming public hatred against me.\" She has also accused the home secretary of influencing the NCA and Director of Public Prosecutions in unspecified meetings to discuss \"high-profile cases\". \"That political influence is being brought to bear is, therefore, undeniable,\" she said.

PPE Medpro was put into administration the day before the judgment, with assets of just £666,000. Asked if Baroness Mone would step down from the Lords, a spokesman said: \"Those calling for Baroness Mone's resignation from the House of Lords would be well advised to read the open letter sent this morning to the prime minister, which sets out how this has now become a personal attack and vendetta, politically motivated with loss of all balance and objectivity.\" Sky News has asked Number 10 and the Treasury for a response to the allegations made by Baroness Mone."

        "Content": "\n          Senior data journalist\n              @danieljdunford\n  Monthly disposable income fell by £40 per person between Boris Johnson's election victory in December 2019 and Rishi Sunak's defeat in July 2024. It is the first time in recorded British history that disposable income has been lower at the end of a parliamentary term than it was at the start, Sky News Data x Forensics analysis reveals. Disposable income is the money people have left over after paying taxes and receiving benefits (including pensions). Essential expenses like rent or mortgage payments, council tax, food and energy bills all need to be paid from disposable income. Previously published figures showed a slight improvement between December 2019 and June 2024, but those were updated by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. There has been an uplift in the last year, although we're poorer now than we were at the start of the year, and today we only have £1 more on average to spend or save each month than we did at the end of 2019. That represents \"an unmitigated disaster for living standards\", according to Lalitha Try, economist at independent living standards thinktank the Resolution Foundation. Have things gotten better under Labour? Disposable income has increased by £41 per person per month since Labour took office in July 2024. However, that masks a significant deterioration in recent months: it is lower now than it was at the start of 2025. In the first six months of Labour's tenure, disposable income rose by £55, a larger increase than under any other government in the same period. In part, this was down to the pay rises for public sector workers that had been agreed under the previous Conservative administration. But the rise also represents a continuation of the trajectory from the final six months of the outgoing government. Between December 2023 and June 2024, monthly disposable income rose by £46. That trajectory reversed in the first part of this year, and the average person now has £14 less to spend or save each month than they did at the start of 2025. Jeremy Hunt, Conservative chancellor from October 2022 until the July 2024 election defeat, told Sky News: \"The big picture is that it was the pandemic rather than actions of a government that caused it [the fall in disposable income]. \"I clawed some back through (I know I would say this) hard work, and Labour tried to buy an instant boost through massive pay rises. The curious thing is why they have not fed through to the numbers.\" The £40 drop between Mr Johnson's electoral victory in 2019 and Mr Sunak's loss in 2024 is roughly the same as the average person spends on food and drink per week. By comparison, since 1955, when the data dates back to, living standards have improved by an average of £115 per month between parliamentary terms. Vital services, things like energy, food and housing, that all need to be paid for out of disposable income, have all increased in price at a faster rate than overall inflation since 2019 as well. This means that the impact on savings and discretionary spending is likely to be more severe for most people, and especially so for lower earners who spend a larger proportion of their money on essentials. Responding to our analysis, the Resolution Foundation's Lalitha Try said: “Average household incomes fell marginally during the last parliament - an unmitigated disaster for living standards, as families were hit first by the pandemic and then the highest inflation in a generation. \"We desperately need a catch-up boost to household incomes in the second half of the 2020s, and to achieve that we'll need a return to wider economic growth.\" Analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also takes into account housing costs, says that disposable income is projected to be £45 a month lower by September 2029 than it was when Labour took office.

We have broken down some that have been repeated most consistently and started tracking them. They have been split into two groups - things that relate to specific policy areas, and things that relate to money. Every time the data is updated, our charts will update. How we are measuring progress Illegal migration: Labour's promise - \"smash\" people smuggling gangs and reduce Channel crossing numbers This is one of the easier ones to track as the Home Office publishes daily updates on the number of people arriving in the UK on small boats. Historically, the numbers have tended to be highest in the summer and lower again at times when the weather is not so good. We are showing a cumulative annual total so you can compare where we are in the current year against where we were at the same point in previous years. Healthcare: Labour's promise - no more than 8% of patients will wait longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment This target only refers to England, because healthcare is a devolved power that the national governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for delivering in their countries. NHS England publishes monthly data on waits for elective care, dating back almost 20 years. There was a period in the 2010s when this target was met consistently. But following that, wait times grew gradually but steadily for several years, and then rapidly following the COVID pandemic. Despite what looks like limited movement on the chart so far, the Health Foundation say the government are currently on track with delivering this ambitious target. They add that serious effort will need to be sustained to get it over the line. Housebuilding: Labour's promise - build 1.5 million homes by the time of the next election This target also only applies to England. It's equivalent to an average of 300,000 per year, although Labour have always said that delivery will not be linear and they expect to make up a shortfall in their last couple of years in power. The official data for the number of new homes added - taking into account any that have been demolished or are no longer habitable, and any converted (for example from commercial to residential) - is only published once a year, usually in about November, referring to the previous financial year. There is data published more regularly, however, on the number of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) granted. Because each new home needs to be issued an EPC, the number of EPCs granted and houses built usually match each other quite closely. In our chart, we use EPCs as a representative measure to forecast how many homes have been built, which is replaced by official data when that becomes available. According to that, about 200,000 houses were added during Labour’s first year in power. That means they will need to average 325,000 for the remaining four years to deliver on their target. Clean power: Labour's promise - at least 95% of energy from low carbon sources by 2030 We are measuring this pledge using data from the National Energy System Operator, an independent public body that plans and manages the energy network. It tells us what proportion of energy used in Great Britain comes from various sources, including low-carbon options like wind, solar and nuclear. The government say that when it judges whether it has achieved its target, it will adjust for the weather, meaning the threshold may actually be slightly higher or lower than 95% depending on how sunny or windy it is at the time. It has not confirmed exactly how it is going to do that, however, so we are just publishing the raw figures, consolidating data published every half-hour into a monthly average. The Climate Change Committee, an independent body that advises government on tackling climate change, say the target is possible but will be difficult to achieve, and there is \"little room for error\". Violent crime: Labour's promise - halve serious violent crime, including knife crime and violence against women and girls (VAWG), within 10 years This is the least well fleshed out of the policy targets. The government has said a few times that it intends to halve knife crime and VAWG within a decade, but there are a few different ways of measuring each of these and more than a year after coming to power, the government has still not confirmed which it is going to use. We do know that the pledge refers only to England and Wales, because the justice system in Scotland and Northern Ireland is devolved. At the moment, we are using \"police recorded crime\" data published by the Home Office. We add together all crimes categorised as \"violence against the person\", ranging from common assault to murder, plus sexual offences and robbery. The Crime Survey of England and Wales is another source that measures people's experience of crime, published by the ONS. The ONS say that there is no single definition of what constitutes \"violent crime\", though. They are working with the Home Office to come up with one, so we may switch to using that measure when it has worked it out. Disposable income: Labour's promise - raise living standards in every part of the United Kingdom This is the least ambitious of Labour's targets. Other than the recent Conservative government of 2019-2024, which had to adapt to a global pandemic and Britain's exit from the EU, every parliament in recorded British history has overseen an improvement in living standards. We measure this by looking at real household disposable income per person - how much each of us has to spend each month after paying taxes. The figures published by the ONS are adjusted for inflation and seasonal fluctuations. Our methodology is similar to what thinktanks like the Institute for Fiscal Studies or the Resolution Foundation use, taking the figure closest in date to each election and seeing how things change from there. Given that the target itself is unambitious, we wanted to be able to benchmark the improvements under this government with others at the same point in their parliamentary terms, so that's what our chart does. Personal tax: Labour's promise - we will not increase taxes on working people More specifically, the government has said it will not raise the current rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT, despite economists warning that taxes will have to rise to bring down government borrowing. Even if these personal tax rates do stay the same, they do not tell the whole story by themselves. The thresholds at which we start paying tax, and then start paying higher-rate tax, are set to be frozen until April 2028. They have already been frozen since April 2021. That means that, as inflation leads to wage increases, we end up paying more tax on a higher proportion of our earnings. This process is known as fiscal drag. Read more: What key budget terms mean What that all means is that the effective tax rate - the percentage of your wages that are paid in tax - is set to rise over the next few years, almost by stealth. That's what we are tracking. We are looking at what average wages in the UK are each month, and working out how much someone earning that amount would need to pay in income tax and national insurance. Keep inflation low: Labour's promise - bring down food prices and the cost of energy and continue to target stable inflation of 2% This one is a bit more straightforward again. The ONS publishes monthly figures on inflation, which explain how prices have risen over the previous 12 months across a huge range of goods and services that are relevant to our lives. These figures are the best way of quantifying the cost of living crisis. They soared to their highest rates in more than 40 years in October 2022, before falling again - close to the 2% Bank of England target - under the final months of the previous government. Our tracker allows you to see exactly what's happened under Starmer's premiership, in detail, and also includes the historical rates for context. Controlling the tax burden: Labour's promise - we will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible We have already spoken about tax on earnings. But that does not take into account things like VAT and stamp duty, as well as things like corporation tax, which we do not pay directly. The best measure for this is the tax burden, which measures all the revenue received by the government in a given year and benchmarks it against GDP - the total value of all goods and services produced in the UK. This means the tax burden is a measure of how much of the country's economic output is being taken in tax, which makes it the best way to make international and historical comparisons. Labour's 2024 manifesto accused the Conservatives of raising the tax burden to a 70-year high. We use figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility to see whether Labour improve on that or takes it higher still. Economic growth: Labour's promise - secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 The G7 is a group of seven countries - the UK, the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada (as well as the EU) - that co-ordinate on global economic policy and international challenges. Economic growth refers to the change in GDP from one period to the next. Labour have claimed they have already achieved this target, but that's based only on the first six months of this year. We are looking at figures over a rolling one-year period, so each time you come back to this page, it will have the latest annual numbers. Other than a period during the COVID recovery, the last time the UK led on this metric for a sustained period was in 2014. The US and Canada have exchanged the lead since 2023. Our figures come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of mostly advanced economies that collects and standardises international data.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\n A member of cyber attack-hit Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain has told Sky News the government must act to safeguard the sector as it has seen no financial relief to date. Mike Beese, who owns Walsall-based Genex UK, was speaking as an industry body complained that support revealed by the government last week was failing to reach suppliers. While unveiling a £1.5bn loan guarantee for JLR last Saturday, Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said it would \"help support the supply chain and protect skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside and throughout the UK\". Money latest: Energy giant handing out £2,000 grants - if you apply Many interpreted the liquidity offer as a bailout, of sorts, that JLR would draw down on and distribute to ease pressure on both direct and indirect suppliers - companies that employ around 200,000 people. Businesses affected by the production shutdown are now arguing they need the support they thought they were being promised by Mr Kyle. It is unclear how his department and the chancellor saw the loan guarantee working in practice. \n                  Tinned tuna-owner Princes to unveil £1.5bn London float\n                 \n                  Michelle Mone says she won't step down as Tory peer - and accuses chancellor of 'endangering' her \n                 \n                  Money latest: Virgin Media increases annual price hike by 14%\n                 For its part, JLR is understood to have not seen a need to finalise or draw on any such arrangement to date, as its direct suppliers - the companies it deals with - have continued to be paid through existing funds. It expects that money to trickle down to lower tiers of that supply chain. However, as the production shutdown enters its second month, there is no visibility on when JLR factories will get back to full speed. Mr Beese said it was for this reason that the government had to intervene, potentially through a loan scheme for suppliers. \"We need certainty,\" he declared. He said of his own customers: \"We need that money to come in so we can pay our suppliers.\" Mr Beese added: \"That money needs to cascade down the tiers [but] it's not going to be enough and you've got to make that up at some point.\" Mr Breese, who employs 17 people and provides parts for several major JLR suppliers, said he attached no blame to JLR, which has been losing at least £50m a week since the attack in late August. He also laid no fault at the door of the companies he supplied. \"Only the government\" could bring the relief the industry needed, he argued, while explaining that terms from lenders were out of reach given the scale of the uncertainty. Commenting on the toll the crisis was taking, Mr Beese said: \"It's very stressful... people in the same boat are ringing me to be paid. \"My staff all need certainty as well... these people aren't just a number, they have families.\"  The president of the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), Stephen Morley, said: \"We need to find a way to get money quickly to where it is needed most, to prevent the supply chain from completely collapsing and that could be an additional type of loan. \"JLR is rightly focused on getting payments through to their first-tier suppliers, and it's best we allow them to complete that process. \"Our focus now must be on ensuring that second-tier and smaller suppliers in the chain are supported, so the whole framework is in place when production restarts.\" JLR revealed earlier this week that it planned to resume limited production \"in the coming days\" as it continues efforts to restart key IT systems. No firm date has since been announced. A spokesperson for JLR said: \"As the controlled, phased restart of our operations continues, we are delivering solutions to support our suppliers through the period of disruption caused by the cyber incident. \"This includes establishing a supplier help desk with additional resources, putting in place a manual payment system to clear down outstanding invoices, and working to re-establish the automated supplier payment systems. \"We would like to thank everyone connected with JLR for their continued patience, understanding and support. We know there is much more to do but the foundational work of our recovery is firmly underway, and we will continue to provide updates as we progress.\" A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We acted swiftly to protect JLR, recognising the importance of the tens of thousands of people they employ directly and indirectly and to provide the company with liquidity at a key time. \"We continue to work with JLR and suppliers directly to understand the impact of the cyber attack - including on tier 2 and tier 3 suppliers - and how the support put in place is helping them.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n The Conservatives have pledged to scrap Britain's landmark climate change law that limits pollution, and replace it with a plan for \"cheap and reliable\" energy. Party leader Kemi Badenoch said scrapping the Climate Change Act - brought in by Labour in 2008 and later strengthened by Tory PM Theresa May - would benefit cheap energy, economic growth and Britain's declining industrial sector. \"Climate change is real.

The Climate Change Act requires the UK to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and to produce five-yearly budgets to keep the country on track. Net zero means cutting emissions as much as possible and offsetting the rest. United Nations scientists warn reaching it by 2050 is necessary to avoid climate damages like droughts and floods and ecosystem collapse that would be very difficult to cope with. But political support has been wavering: Ms Badenoch says achieving it is impossible and Reform leader Nigel Farage claims scrapping net zero targets would save £30bn a year. The Conservatives said the Act had forced governments to bring in \"burdensome rules and regulations that have increased energy bills for families and businesses, eaten away at Britain's manufacturing sector, and contributed to a worsening in economic growth\".  They pointed to the controversial Drax energy plant, which is publicly subsidised to burn wood instead of coal to generate electricity, support for which is already wavering. The party also cited costly legal challenges to developments and lengthy planning processes, something Labour also admits is a problem. Claire Coutinho MP, shadow energy secretary, said the act is \"forcing ministers to adopt policies which are making energy more expensive\". \"That is deindustrialising Britain, causing hardship for families, and perversely it makes it harder for people to adopt electric products that can reduce emissions.\" But it is not clear how their plans to maximise oil and gas projects in the North Sea would lower bills or boost jobs, as the fuels are sold on international markets, and reserves are dwindling. Nor did it detail whether scrapping pollution rules for industry would boost it enough to compensate for other losses to the economy if clean investors pulled out. How have others reacted? Energy UK's chief executive Dhara Vyas said the Act is the \"legal bedrock that underpins billions of pounds of international investment in the UK\", including places like Humber and Teesside. She said treating it as a \"political football is a surefire way to scare off investors.\" Simon Francis from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition of NGOs said there is \"no way to lower bills or energy security by prolonging our dependence on gas\", while Friends of the Earth chief executive Asad Rehman said the Party \"[turning] its back on the science\" was \"political suicide\". The Conservative Party said its environmental focus instead will be on enhancing and preserving the natural world. Professor Myles Allen from Oxford University said the act may need updating, like the NHS does. \"But you wouldn't announce you were going to scrap the NHS without explaining what you were going to replace it.\" Ms Badenoch further announced today that her shadow cabinet will on Friday agree a policy of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, which she also says is holding Britain back."

A photo of Spencer Elden swimming towards a dollar bill on a fishhook had appeared on the cover of the rock band's iconic album Nevermind in 1991. But Judge Fernando Olguin threw out the case after ruling that no reasonable jury would consider the image pornographic, likening it instead to a \"family photo of a nude child bathing\". \"Other than the fact that plaintiff was nude on the album cover, nothing comes close to bringing the image within the ambit of the child pornography statute,\" he said. Elden's legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nirvana's lawyer Bert Deixler said they were \"delighted that the court has ended this meritless case and freed our creative clients of the stigma of false allegations\". The defendants included surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, late lead singer Kurt Cobain's widow Courtney Love, and photographer Kirk Weddle. \n                  Sean 'Diddy' Combs admits 'past wrongs' in letter to judge - hours before his sentencing \n                 \n                  Why emergency Eurovision vote on Israel might not stop a broadcast boycott\n                 \n                  Hunter S Thompson's death to be reviewed after widow's request, Colorado officials say\n                 The photo was taken at the Pasadena Aquatic Centre in California. Read more from Sky News:Broadway stars ready to strikeJK Rowling hits out at Emma Watson in fresh clash Mr Elden first sued the band and its label Universal Music Group in 2021, accusing them of sexually exploiting him through the image and causing ongoing personal harm. Judge Olguin initially dismissed the case in 2022 on the grounds that Elden's claims were time barred, without addressing the substance of the allegations. However, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in 2023. In a 2003 Rolling Stone interview when he was 12, Elden acknowledged the photo and said he was \"probably gonna get some money from it\". However, in his August 2021 lawsuit, Elden argued that his injuries - including emotional distress, lost earning potential, and diminished enjoyment of life - extended into adulthood, allowing him to meet the statute of limitations. The judge dismissed this claim, stating it would effectively allow Elden to sue Nirvana indefinitely. Nevermind, which features the hit song Smells Like Teen Spirit, has sold over 30 million copies."
