        "Content": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials have been blocked from attending September's annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has revoked the US visas of delegates from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and denied others from applying for one. It is the latest step by Donald Trump's administration to target Palestinians with visa restrictions, and follows the suspension of a programme to allow injured children from Gaza to receive treatment in the US. \"It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,\" a statement from the US State Department said. It added that, to be considered partners for peace, both groups \"must consistently repudiate terrorism, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by US law and as promised by the PLO\". Offensive will cause 'intolerable deaths' Several US allies, including France, Malta, and Australia have announced plans to recognise Palestine as a state at September's United Nations General Assembly. Canada and the UK will too, unless Israel meets certain conditions. \n                  Israel-Hamas war: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says conflict in Gaza is 'greater than war of extermination'\n                 \n                  Mahmoud Abbas: Trump's Jerusalem recognition 'slap of the century'\n                 \n                  Donald Trump: I'll get deal done on Middle East peace\n                 Israel declared Gaza's largest city a dangerous combat zone on Friday. The army launched a planned offensive that has drawn international condemnation.  Foreign ministers from Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia and Spain released a joint statement saying the military operations in Gaza City will cause \"intolerable deaths of innocent Palestinian civilians\". Gaza latest: Israel's Gaza City offensive condemned Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in Gaza City while enduring famine. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations (UN), Riyad Mansour, said Mr Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the general assembly at the general debate, which begins on 23 September. He was also expected to attend a high-level meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on 22 September about a two-state solution, a broad idea involving Israel coexisting with an independent Palestinian state. The State of Palestine is an observer member of the UN, meaning it can speak at meetings but not vote on resolutions. US decision 'contravenes international law' The Palestinian Authority \"expressed its deep regret and astonishment\" at the visa decision, calling it \"a violation of US commitments\" as the host of the UN, and claiming it \"contravenes international law\". UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body would be seeking clarification in the \"hope that this will be resolved\". The State Department said that the Palestinian Authority's mission to the UN, comprising officials who are permanently based there, would not be included in the restrictions. Under a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons.

It also reported five more malnutrition-related deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number during the war to 322, with 121 of them children. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage."

        "Content": "Donald Trump's tariffs are unconstitutional, but they can remain in place for now, the US Court of Appeals has said. The court ruled that the US president was not legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country, as it mostly upheld a decision by a specialised federal trade court. However, the court struck down a portion of the previous ruling that would have immediately cancelled the tariffs, allowing the Trump administration time to appeal to the US Supreme Court. \"ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that the \"highly partisan\" court had \"incorrectly said that our tariffs should be removed\". The decision could limit the speed and severity with which Mr Trump could act, despite having alternative laws for imposing import taxes. Mr Trump's tariffs, which reversed decades of US trade policy, increased fears of higher prices and slower economic growth after they shook the global markets. However, they also alienated US trading partners and allies, as Mr Trump used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan, and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals. \n                  Redundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plant after government rejects bailout\n                 \n                  US and China extend tariffs deadline again\n                 \n                  US trade war: The state of play as Trump's country-specific tariffs take effect\n                 \"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court ruling. \"A ruling against the tariffs would represent not just a legal defeat, but a serious blow to the administration's coercive trade diplomacy model.\"  Read more from Sky News:US blocks Palestinian resident from UN meetingTrump revokes Secret Service protection for Harris As a result, the US government might have to refund some of the import taxes it has collected, which would deliver a financial blow to its Treasury, which collected $142bn in tariff revenue by July - more than double at the same point a year before. In its legal filing this month, the Justice Department warned that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the US. \"If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong,\" Mr Trump added on Truth Social after the ruling."

Lord Justice David Bean, 71, is a former treasurer of the Society of Labour Lawyers and chaired the left-leaning Fabian Society, which is affiliated to the Labour Party, in 1989 and 1990. Politics latest: Home Office says Epping asylum hotel appeal win in court 'avoids chaos' He was also - with Sir Tony Blair's barrister wife Cherie - a founder member in 2000 of the left-wing Matrix Chambers, whose members include the current attorney general, Lord Hermer. On its website, the Society of Labour Lawyers describes itself as \"a thinktank and affiliated socialist society which provides legal and policy advice to the Labour Party\". Founded in 1948 by a future Labour lord chancellor Gerald Gardiner, it declares: \"Our objectives are to contribute legal expertise to the Labour Party and uphold the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and the rule of law in the UK and around the world. \"We advise Labour MPs and the House of Lords; develop and scrutinise policy and legislation; contribute to debate within the Labour movement by hosting events and discussions; and mentor future members of the legal profession. \n                  Appeals court overturns injunction that blocked asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  Lib Dems eye Labour-held cities as they target 'seats not votes'\n                 \n                  Richard Tice defends Reform ban on local newspaper in free speech row\n                 \"We are open to Labour Party members who are also practising or retired lawyers, law students or graduates, academics, and members of the judiciary.\" The Fabian Society describes itself as \"a democratically governed socialist society, a Labour affiliate and one of the party's original founders\". But Lord Justice Bean isn't the only judge at the centre of the legal battle over The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, who has a political background and affiliation.  Sir Stephen Eyre, the High Court judge who ruled in favour of Epping Forest District Council earlier this month, was a Conservative parliamentary candidate four times. His most high-profile bid to become an MP came in the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, won by current Labour MP and former minister Liam Byrne. Appointed a High Court judge by then Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab in 2021, Sir Stephen was a Tory candidate while working as a barrister. His first attempt came in 1987, when he stood in Hodge Hill in that year's general election, coming second behind Labour's Terry Davis. Then in 1992, the year of Sir John Major's 21-seat election victory, he stood for the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the unionist stronghold of Strangford.

In 2001, he stood in Stourbridge, where he again came second, this time to Labour's Debra Shipley, when he cut her majority from nearly 6,000 to under 4,000. And in the 2004 by-election, he came a distant third as Mr Byrne scraped in by just 460 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who benefited from an Iraq war backlash."

Strategists see an opportunity in younger people who, over the course of this parliament, may be priced out of cities and into commuter belt areas as they seek to get on the housing ladder or start a family. Insiders say the plan is to focus more on the cost of living to shift the party's appeal beyond the traditional southern heartlands. \"There's a key opportunity to target people who were 30 at the last election who over the next five years might find themselves moving out of London, to areas like Surrey, Guildford,\" a senior party source told Sky News. \"We also need to be better at making a case for a liberal voice in urban areas. We have not told enough of a story on the cost of living. \"We need a liberal voice back in the cities - areas like Liverpool, where there is strong support at a council level that we can use as a base to build on.\" Liverpool is a traditional Labour heartland but in January lost its first local authority by-election there in 27 years to the Lib Dems. \n                  Sir Ed Davey to boycott Donald Trump state dinner with King Charles in Gaza protest\n                 \n                  Farage accused of wanting to 'take UK backwards' - as Brexit blamed for small boats crisis\n                 \n                  Scotland, Wales and N Ireland party leaders unite to criticise Starmer over Israel-Gaza stance\n                 Carl Cashman, the leader of the Lib Dems on the city council, says it's a result that shows the potential to make gains in areas where the party came third and fourth at the general election. \"One of the cases I have been making to the national party is that Liverpool should be a number one target. \"We are almost at the end of the road when it comes to the Conservatives, so we need to start looking at areas like Liverpool,\" he said, adding that Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle could also be ripe for the taking. However, the party faces a challenge of making a case for liberalism against the rising tide of populism. Sir Ed Davey, the party leader, is trying to position himself as the only politician who is not afraid of holding Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to account. He has recently unveiled a plan to cut energy bills by changing how renewable projects are paid for and says he will boycott Donald Trump's state dinner. It is these green, internationalist policies that insiders hope can hoover up support of remaining Tory moderates unhappy with the direction of Kemi Badenoch's party and progressive voters who think Labour is more of the same. However, strategists admit it is difficult to cut through on these issues in a changing media landscape, \"when you're either viral or you're not\". 'Silly stunts' here to stay Farage has no such problem, which Davey has blamed on a national media weighted too heavily in favour of the Reform UK leader, given the size of his party (he has just four MPs compared to the Liberal Democrats' 72). But the two parties have very different media strategies. This week, on the same day Farage held a Trump-style press conference to announce his immigration deportation plans, with a Q&A for journalists after, the Liberal Democrat leader went to pick strawberries in Somerset to highlight the plight of farmers facing increased inheritance tax. Some Lib Dems have questioned whether the \"silly stunts\" that proved successful during the general election are past their shelf life, but strategists say there will be no fundamental change to that, insisting Sir Ed is the \"genuine nice guy\" he comes across as and that offers something different. The Lib Dems ultimately see their strength as lying not in the \"airwaves war\" but the \"ground war\" - building support on the doorstep at a local level and then turning that into seats. \"Our strategy is seats, not votes. Theirs is votes, not seats,\" said the party source, suggesting Farage's divisiveness might backfire under a first past the post system where people typically vote against the party they disklike the most. \"The next election won't be about who is saying the meanest things.\" 'Don't underestimate us' There is broad support within the party behind that strategy. Cllr Cashman said a greater use of social media could help attract a younger demographic, along with putting forward \"really fundamental, powerful liberal ideas\" on issues such as housing. But he said Davey is \"never going to do the controversial things Farage does\". \"The way we reach people, the traditional campaigning, is what makes us strong. Just because we are not always on the airwaves, do not underestimate us.\" For Liberal Democrat peer and pollster Dr Mark Pack, there are reasons to be confident. On Friday, the party won a local council by-election in Camden, north London - \"Sir Keir Starmer's backyard\" - with a swing from Labour to the Lib Dems of 19%. It is these statistics that the party is far more focused on than national vote share - with Labour's misfortunes opening an opportunity to strategically target areas where voters are more likely to switch. \"One of the lessons we have learned from the past is that riding high in opinion polls doesn't translate into seats. \"We are really focused on winning seats with the system in front of us. There is a route to success by concentrating on and expanding on what we have been good at.\""

        "Content": "An investigation is being urged into MP James McMurdock over his \"use of social media to apparently facilitate racial abuse\" against Sky News political correspondent Mhari Aurora. Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty has written to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Daniel Greenberg, over the matter. Mr McMurdock was previously a Reform UK MP, but suspended himself from Nigel Farage's party after allegations emerged over COVID loans he claimed. There was controversy over his selection as a Reform candidate after it emerged he was jailed in 2006 for assaulting his then-girlfriend. Politics latest: Home Office says Epping asylum hotel appeal win in court 'avoids chaos' In his letter shared on social media, Mr Obese-Jecty outlined how Mr McMurdock posted the single letter \"N\" under an X post that was critical of Aurora. Mr Obese-Jecty explains the concept of an \"N-Tower\", saying it \"is a means of using a racial slur against an individual on an online platform whilst circumventing moderation that would remove racially abusive content\". \"The practice involves spelling out a racial slur vertically with each individual posting a single letter of the word in order to spell it vertically.\" In this case, the slur was the n-word, with the letters appearing in subsequent posts under Mr McMurdock's first on X over roughly 30 minutes. Mr McMurdock later appears to have deleted his post, Mr Obese-Jecty says. Read more:Court overturns injunction blocking asylum seekers from hotelWhat to watch out for this political season Mr McMurdock appeared to deny he made the post, sharing a screenshot of X's AI assistant Grok claiming he never posted the letter N, based on a screenshot of the N-Tower. Grok is a large language model, which is known to be inaccurate. He added that Mr Obese-Jecty's \"complaint regarding the alleged posting of a single letter is beyond ridiculous\". Mr McMurdock then claimed he believed the Conservative MP had broken the law by \"writing the N-word in full\" - saying this was \"offensive, indecent and obscene\". In his letter, Mr Obese-Jecty tells the commissioner he believes what happens breaches the Commons code - specifically that \"members shall never undertake any action which would cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, or of its members generally\". He also says the actions \"reflect a lack of adherence\" to the seven principles of public life. Mr Obese-Jecty says by \"deleting the post without challenging the subsequent spelling\" that was started by him, Mr McMurdock showed a \"failure to challenge poor behaviour\" and \"absence of moral courage\". He calls on the commissioner to ask Mr McMurdock to clarify what his intentions were with the original post, and to share his archive of social media posts. Mr Obese-Jecty adds: \"Having repeatedly experienced this specific type of online racial abuse myself I am horrified that a fellow member of parliament would apparently see this as a legitimate means of challenging a Westminster lobby journalist in a public forum. \"I sincerely hope that there is a coherent and believable explanation for this horrendous action.\" The Conservative MP posted the letter on social media, saying: \"There should be no place in Parliament for those who use their position to target, and attempt to intimidate, a free press. \"I welcome a clear and credible explanation from James McMurdock that illustrates how his apparent part in this unacceptable abuse was a misunderstanding and would encourage him to condemn this type of abuse in the strongest possible terms.\""

        "Content": "A fraudster on the run from Britain will lose his £90m property empire and his Ferrari, a judge has ruled. Arif Patel, 57, from Preston, Lancashire, led a gang convicted in 2023 of one of the UK's biggest carousel tax frauds. The sock manufacturer, who now lives in Dubai, funded his empire with his crimes and must now pay back £90,503,211 with the sale of his properties in Preston, London and overseas. The homes and business premises he owned will be taken off him after a confiscation order was granted by a judge at Chester Crown Court on Thursday. Carousel fraud involves chains of fake business transactions used to steal VAT repayments. Goods are moved between different companies in a circular pattern. This creates false export and import records used by criminals to claim back large sums from tax authorities. Patel's Ferrari 575 Superamerica will also be sold at an auction. His operation stole millions through VAT repayment claims on false exports of mobile phones and textiles. They also imported and sold counterfeit clothes. These would have been worth £50m had they been genuine. Patel also owned properties in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. His restrained property assets will be sold and the money put back into the public coffers under the order. During a 14-week trial, Patel and his co-accused, Mohamed Jaffer Ali, 61, of Dubai, were both found guilty in their absence of fraud and money laundering offences. 'Patel lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority' Richard Las, director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said: \"Arif Patel lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority, but he will now lose the property empire he amassed from the proceeds of crime. \"Our work never stops at conviction. For the last two years, we've worked with police and CPS partners to secure one of the biggest criminal confiscations we've ever recovered.\" Mark Winstanley, Assistant Chief Constable, Lancashire Constabulary, said: \"Arif Patel was the head of a Preston-based organised crime group responsible for causing millions of pounds worth of losses to multiple companies. \"His actions, motivated by greed, directly impacted on the taxpayer.\" Read more from Sky News:Ex-prisoner found guilty of murdering guardThai prime minister sacked after leaked phone call Patel ran his illegal scheme using Preston-based import/export company Faisaltex Ltd. He travelled to Dubai in July 2011 and failed to return. He was tried in his absence at Chester Crown Court, where he was found guilty of all charges. Together, Patel and Ali were sentenced in their absence to a total of 31 years in prison. The UK has a formal extradition treaty with Dubai."

The 78-year-old retired teacher says she \"doesn't laud\" the Reform MP, whose grinning likeness is a permanent fixture in her West Yorkshire conservatory, but he \"says what I believe\". \"Everybody talks about migration, but our country's ruined,\" Dinah adds. \"They've ruined it.\" The \"they\" in her mind? People who have crossed into the UK on small boats. We have seen asylum hotel protests intensify over the summer and wanted to speak to the people who've joined them. Over the coming weeks, we'll speak with counter-protesters too, but today, we meet Dinah, a grandmother of two who has joined those calling on asylum hotels to close. She was, like many of the protesters we met, initially sceptical to speak to a journalist. \n                  Women and children will be detained under Farage deportation plans \n                 \n                  Is it time for a different approach to stop the people smugglers?\n                 \n                  Fast-track asylum appeals process to be introduced - as average time for decisions is more than one year\n                 Dinah says she \"doesn't watch mainstream news\" because of \"media lies\" over Brexit. Instead, she says she gets her news from social media. It was on social media that Dinah learnt about a protest being organised outside a hotel in Wakefield, which has housed asylum seekers for several years. It was the first migration-related protest she had ever attended. \"We've put up with so much for so long and I think ordinary people now, they've decided it's no good sitting, doing nothing,\" Dinah says. After reading about a male asylum seeker being charged with a sexual assault in Epping, she says she is \"fearful\" for her granddaughters' safety. \"They're undocumented,\" she says, referring to those who have arrived in the UK on small boats. \"We know nothing about them. We don't know where they are wandering the streets. It's not right, is it?\" She's also angry about the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels. I ask Dinah what she thinks about the government plan to close asylum hotels, stop illegal crossings and deport people who do not have a legal right to remain. \"It's all talk, all talk\", she says. \"I don't believe them.\" \"I would be happy if the Navy went into the Channel, we're an island for God's sake, and stopped the boats. \"That would make me over the moon.\" Dinah tells us people used to be \"afraid\" of saying what they really thought about migration. No more, she says. The 'migrant watch' group On the other side of Wakefield, we meet 47-year-old James Crashley. He's also been to the local asylum hotel protests. An army veteran and former policeman, James says he does not think asylum seekers should be housed in hotels or houses of multiple occupancy. \"I've served in Kosovo and in Iraq, within the British Army,\" he says. \"And if I can be housed in a tent for six months, then they can too.\" The prime minister has pledged to end the \"costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers in this parliament\" - which would be 2029, if not earlier. James has, by his own admission, become somewhat notorious in his local area for trying to set up what he's called a \"community watch\". He says the police are \"very good at dealing with serious crime\" but believes \"they seem to forget that day-to-day crime exists\". Called \"5 Town Migrant Watch\" and advertised by him on social media, James says the volunteer group will support the Wakefield hotel protests and act as a \"gentle presence\" in public areas to tackle \"all anti-social behaviour\". But it will focus on \"illegal migrant men\" who James describes as having \"conflicting traditions and cultures\". \"They come from cultures that aren't as civilised as ours,\" he says. \"They don't seem to adhere to our laws. \"And because of the cultural differences, as in the sexual assaults on children and women, they believe that's fine in their cultures. Well, it's not here.\" I say to James that no culture accepts sexual assaults on women and children are \"fine\", a point he says he \"accepts\". But he claims that, by definition, people have already \"broken the law\" when they arrive on small boats in the first place.  Read more:Government struggling to reduce migrant hotel useAsylum seekers in hotels rise by 8% under LabourWhere are the UK's asylum seekers from? James' group has attracted hundreds of supporters online, but also criticism from people who believe the group - and James himself - is not only divisive but dangerous. James admits he has previously had a police caution for a public order offence, not related to the community watch, but stresses this group \"isn't vigilantism\". \"It's a peaceful movement,\" he says. \"But if needs be, we'll stand our ground and will prevent crime. We're not allowed to commit crime.\" 'People are angry' A few days later, we meet Dinah again outside the Cedar Court Hotel in Wakefield. Protesters line the road, waving Union and St George's flags. Some are shouting \"send them back\" and \"stop the boats\". Groups of counter-protesters are there too, chanting \"Nazi scum\" over the police barricade. I ask Dinah how that feels. \"I think it's hilarious,\" she says. \"I know what I am, I don't value their opinion, so I couldn't care less what they call me.\" But standing next to Dinah, also waving a Union flag, is Sharon. She says she's \"a little bit frightened being here\" and feels it's unfair to be put in that position just \"to try and get the government to listen to you\". She added: \"I'm a 60-year-old mum. I work 40 hours a week. And nobody gives me anything free. You just want fairness.\" In the crowd, we find James. I ask him what he thinks about the government plan to appeal a court ruling to shut the asylum hotel in Epping. \"Of course they were going to try and block it,\" he tells me. \"The smiles here and the good attitude and the positivity is masking the anger of what's happened to the English. \"People are angry. People know that once they're out of here,\" he says, gesturing at the hotel behind us, \"they're going to be put in the community\". \"What happens then, who knows?\" Dinah and James are among thousands of protesters who share a sense of being ignored by the government - leaving an overwhelming sense of pressure and uncertainty about what will happen next."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n  The Appeal Court judge who ruled in favour of Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in the Epping migrant hotel case is a long-standing Labour supporter. Lord Justice David Bean, 71, is a former treasurer of the Society of Labour Lawyers and chaired the left-leaning Fabian Society, which is affiliated to the Labour Party, in 1989 and 1990. Politics latest: Home Office says Epping asylum hotel appeal win in court 'avoids chaos' He was also - with Sir Tony Blair's barrister wife Cherie - a founder member in 2000 of the left-wing Matrix Chambers, whose members include the current attorney general, Lord Hermer. On its website, the Society of Labour Lawyers describes itself as \"a thinktank and affiliated socialist society which provides legal and policy advice to the Labour Party\". Founded in 1948 by a future Labour lord chancellor Gerald Gardiner, it declares: \"Our objectives are to contribute legal expertise to the Labour Party and uphold the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and the rule of law in the UK and around the world. \"We advise Labour MPs and the House of Lords; develop and scrutinise policy and legislation; contribute to debate within the Labour movement by hosting events and discussions; and mentor future members of the legal profession. \n                  Appeals court overturns injunction that blocked asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  Lib Dems eye Labour-held cities as they target 'seats not votes'\n                 \n                  Richard Tice defends Reform ban on local newspaper in free speech row\n                 \"We are open to Labour Party members who are also practising or retired lawyers, law students or graduates, academics, and members of the judiciary.\" The Fabian Society describes itself as \"a democratically governed socialist society, a Labour affiliate and one of the party's original founders\". But Lord Justice Bean isn't the only judge at the centre of the legal battle over The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, who has a political background and affiliation.  Sir Stephen Eyre, the High Court judge who ruled in favour of Epping Forest District Council earlier this month, was a Conservative parliamentary candidate four times. His most high-profile bid to become an MP came in the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, won by current Labour MP and former minister Liam Byrne. Appointed a High Court judge by then Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab in 2021, Sir Stephen was a Tory candidate while working as a barrister. His first attempt came in 1987, when he stood in Hodge Hill in that year's general election, coming second behind Labour's Terry Davis. Then in 1992, the year of Sir John Major's 21-seat election victory, he stood for the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the unionist stronghold of Strangford. Read more:Protesters on why they oppose asylum hotelsGovernment struggling to reduce migrant hotel use Mr Eyre, as he then was, came fourth behind the official Unionists' John Taylor, with current Democratic Unionist MP for Antrim East Sammy Wilson in second place. In 2001, he stood in Stourbridge, where he again came second, this time to Labour's Debra Shipley, when he cut her majority from nearly 6,000 to under 4,000. And in the 2004 by-election, he came a distant third as Mr Byrne scraped in by just 460 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who benefited from an Iraq war backlash."

        "Headline": "Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton banned its Reform councillors, who hold 41 of 66 seats, from speaking to journalists from the Nottingham Post.",
        "Content": "By Miriam Kuepper, news reporter   Reform UK's deputy leader has defended a ban on a local newspaper handed down by a council leader in a free speech row. Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton banned its Reform councillors, who hold 41 of 66 seats, from speaking to journalists from the Nottingham Post, its digital site Nottinghamshire Live and its local democracy reporters on Tuesday. This came after the newspaper published an article reporting on two Reform councillors allegedly saying they could face suspension if they did not back Mr Barton's preferred structure for the reorganisation of the council. Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, has defended the ban, telling Sky News' presenter Jonathan Samuels that Nottinghamshire Live \"distorts and completely acts in an irresponsible way\" and therefore councillors were \"entitled to say 'we're going to talk to other parts of the media, not yourselves'\". When challenged that this was going against the principle of democracy, Reform UK's deputy leader replied: \"That's the whole point of a democracy. You pick and choose who you speak to, and sometimes you speak to friends, sometimes you don't. \"But it is equally that a media organisation does have a responsibility also to present some things in a sensible way, presenting both sides of a debate or an argument. And that was the issue.\" Natalie Fahy, senior editor at Nottinghamshire Live, told Sky News she was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" by Mr Tice's comments, as he \"knows absolutely nothing about what the Nottingham Post publishes day in day out\". \n                  Is political chaos fuelled by the media? \n                 \n                  After six months of planning, Reform's immigration policy is as clear as mud\n                 \n                  Farage rows back on including women and children in deportation plans\n                 She said: \"As a newspaper regulated by IPSO (Independent Press Standards Organisation), we are actually allowed to be biased if we want to be, but we try to maintain an overall balance on our coverage (...) We've not distorted any facts whatsoever.\" Mr Tice was asked whether he only wanted to be held to account by people that he likes and agrees with. He replied: \"I want to be held to account by people who are going to be rational, sensible and not completely distorted and biased.\" \"That's not a democratic society, that's not free press. Sometimes there is going to be negative stuff, and sometimes we will be going to have to criticise stuff. It's very dangerous what he (Mr Tice) said - you can't just have a positive, unquestioning press,\" Ms Fahy warned. She added that the Nottingham Post was not an anti-Reform publication and that its journalists appreciate that many of their readers vote for Reform. \"We just want to find out on behalf of our readers what they voted for,\" Ms Fahy said. 'Rehearsal for Nigel Farage's government' Ms Fahy, who alerted Mr Tice to the ban before he spoke to Sky News on Friday, urged Nigel Farage to get involved. \"This is a rehearsal for Nigel Farage's government - he needs to step in and say that this is not acceptable behaviour if he wants to be taken seriously,\" the senior editor warned. But Mr Tice indicated that Mr Farage would not wade into the row, saying: \"It's a local row and I'm sure they'll sort it out.\" The ban might not end with the Nottingham Post, as Mr Barton, the Nottinghamshire County Council leader, warned his party would also \"not be engaging with any other media outlet we consider to be consistently misrepresenting our politics, actions, or intentions\". As part of the ban, the authority will also stop sending press releases to the outlet and won't invite them to council events, although it cannot prevent them from attending public meetings. Ms Fahy published an opinion piece after the ban was announced, telling readers: \"Reform UK makes huge noises about respecting free speech, transparency, honesty and being straight-talking. This boycott flies in the face of all of that. When the press is not welcome, you know democracy itself is in danger. \"If we're heading for a Reform government, you'll see this echoed on the national stage. And maybe at some point, people will look back and wonder where it all started. If we don't fight back against this authoritarian edict, we're heading down a very dark and dangerous path for everyone in this country. \"Grow up Mick Barton, and start accepting a free press is there to hold you and your councillors to account. You've got my number and I am waiting for your call.\" 'Not just press being shut out' The leader of the opposition at Nottinghamshire County Council, Conservative councillor Sam Smith, said on X: \"The free press play a key role in keeping residents informed of actions being taken by decision makers and in return the press express the views of residents to the politicians and public in publishing balanced articles. \"As a leader of the county council, I welcomed that scrutiny. Sometimes it was tough reading, but it helped ensure my team and I were always focused on delivering on the priorities of local residents. \"It's not just the press Reform are shutting out in Nottinghamshire. It's the voice and views of residents.\" Mr Barton said the decision had not been made \"lightly\", adding: \"It is not about silencing journalism, it is about upholding the principle that freedom of speech must be paired with responsibility and honesty.\""

        "Content": " A former inmate at a Liverpool jail has been found guilty of murdering an ex-prison officer after he exposed an affair between the convict and a female guard. Elias Morgan shot father-of-three Lenny Scott six times at close range outside a gym in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, in February 2024. The 33-year-old later died in hospital. Anthony Cleary, 29, a friend of Morgan's who had been accused of helping to plan the shooting, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter at Preston Crown Court today. The revenge killing took place four years after Scott, who was working as a prison officer at HMP Altcourse at the time, had revealed an affair between Morgan, a convict in the jail, and a female prison guard, the jury was told. Scott had found a phone in Morgan's cell, which revealed details of the relationship. Morgan, 35, initially tried to bribe Scott to not report the affair, and later began threatening the prison officer when he refused, a jury was told. A recording of a 101 call made by Scott just days after he found the phone in 2020 reveals he was scared for the safety of his family after the threats. In the recording, Scott says: \"Hi, I'm an officer at HMP Altcourse, I've just been informed that there's been a car sat outside my house all weekend, by a prisoner.\" After the operator asked Scott who was threatening him, he replied: \"Elias Morgan, he's described my family and me to a tee. Described my house... Just in fear for my family's life, that's all.\" CCTV footage has captured the moment Scott was gunned down four years later, while Morgan was on bail for having the phone in his cell. Morgan, from Edge Hill in Liverpool, handed himself in at a police station two weeks after the shooting. He was found guilty of murder on Friday after a trial which began on 24 June. Scott wanted to 'make a difference' Detectives said shortly after the shooting that the suspect fled the scene on a bike, possibly an e-bike or scrambler bike, and was thought to have been wearing black clothes and an orange high-vis jacket. Scott's father, Neil, and his mother, Paula, spoke ahead of the verdict. Paul said: \"While he was a prison officer, he wasn't worried about what they were in prison for, he was doing a job and he wanted to make a difference. \"I think that he most probably felt that he was making that difference. \"Once he got those threats, it brought it back into real life for him - that actually this could affect his family and did affect his family.\" Detective Chief Inspector Lee Wilson from Lancashire Police said: \"To kill a man, to take a man's life - a man who clearly had the utmost standards of integrity. \"(Scott was) doing his job, simply doing his job to keep people safe in the community. \"To wait that length of time and then act upon that and take Lenny's life in that cold, calculating and callous way, discharging a firearm regardless of who else was around at the time, beggars belief actually.\" Morgan is due to be sentenced on Tuesday."

        "Content": "A fraudster on the run from Britain will lose his £90m property empire and his Ferrari, a judge has ruled. Arif Patel, 57, from Preston, Lancashire, led a gang convicted in 2023 of one of the UK's biggest carousel tax frauds. The sock manufacturer, who now lives in Dubai, funded his empire with his crimes and must now pay back £90,503,211 with the sale of his properties in Preston, London and overseas. The homes and business premises he owned will be taken off him after a confiscation order was granted by a judge at Chester Crown Court on Thursday. Carousel fraud involves chains of fake business transactions used to steal VAT repayments. Goods are moved between different companies in a circular pattern. This creates false export and import records used by criminals to claim back large sums from tax authorities. Patel's Ferrari 575 Superamerica will also be sold at an auction. His operation stole millions through VAT repayment claims on false exports of mobile phones and textiles. They also imported and sold counterfeit clothes. These would have been worth £50m had they been genuine. Patel also owned properties in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. His restrained property assets will be sold and the money put back into the public coffers under the order. During a 14-week trial, Patel and his co-accused, Mohamed Jaffer Ali, 61, of Dubai, were both found guilty in their absence of fraud and money laundering offences. 'Patel lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority' Richard Las, director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said: \"Arif Patel lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the law-abiding majority, but he will now lose the property empire he amassed from the proceeds of crime. \"Our work never stops at conviction. For the last two years, we've worked with police and CPS partners to secure one of the biggest criminal confiscations we've ever recovered.\" Mark Winstanley, Assistant Chief Constable, Lancashire Constabulary, said: \"Arif Patel was the head of a Preston-based organised crime group responsible for causing millions of pounds worth of losses to multiple companies. \"His actions, motivated by greed, directly impacted on the taxpayer.\" Read more from Sky News:Ex-prisoner found guilty of murdering guardThai prime minister sacked after leaked phone call Patel ran his illegal scheme using Preston-based import/export company Faisaltex Ltd.

El Shafee Elsheikh, known as \"Jihadi Ringo\", grew up in west London before he left the UK for Syria in 2012 to fight for the Islamic State (ISIS). The former mechanic and three other men, who all grew up in the UK, were members of a terror cell that was nicknamed \"The Beatles\" because of their British accents. Elsheikh has been serving eight life sentences in a US jail for his involvement in a hostage-taking scheme which involved torturing, beating and executing prisoners. However three years after he was jailed, the daughter of British aid worker David Haines - who was murdered by the ISIS cell in 2014 - has told The Sun she has received a notice saying Elsheikh has applied to be transferred to a UK jail. Bethany Haines told the newspaper: \"I beg the UK government to act to make sure he never sets foot on these shores again.\" The notice, seen by the paper, refers to Elsheikh as a UK national but the Home Office has confirmed to Sky News that he was stripped of his British citizenship following his arrest by Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces in 2018. Ministry of Justice guidance says non-British nationals, such as Elsheikh, must hold valid leave to enter and remain in the UK in order to be considered for transfer. The Ministry of Justice said in a statement: \"Our sympathies remain with the friends and families of the victims of these appalling crimes. \"We have not received any application for Mr Elsheikh's transfer from the US authorities but we have the right to refuse any request and prisoners who are transferred to the UK will serve the rest of their sentence here.\" Read more:Suspected ISIS 'Beatles' member jailedBrother of David Haines 'forgives' ISIS 'Beatle' Who were the ISIS 'Beatles'?

The cell also caused outrage around the world after releasing videos of the executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Footage of Mr Haines's murder was also posted online and his remains have never been discovered. Elsheikh, who moved to the UK from Sudan aged five, was handed eight concurrent life sentences by a US court in 2022, alongside fellow cell member Alexanda Kotey. A third \"Beatles\" member, Mohammed Emwazi, who was dubbed \"Jihadi John\", was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Meanwhile Muslim-convert Aine Davis, who was suspected of also being part of the terror cell, was jailed for eight years in 2023."

US secretary of state Marco Rubio has revoked the US visas of delegates from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and denied others from applying for one. It is the latest step by Donald Trump's administration to target Palestinians with visa restrictions, and follows the suspension of a programme to allow injured children from Gaza to receive treatment in the US. \"It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,\" a statement from the US State Department said.

Gaza latest: Israel's Gaza City offensive condemned Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in Gaza City while enduring famine. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations (UN), Riyad Mansour, said Mr Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the general assembly at the general debate, which begins on 23 September. He was also expected to attend a high-level meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on 22 September about a two-state solution, a broad idea involving Israel coexisting with an independent Palestinian state. The State of Palestine is an observer member of the UN, meaning it can speak at meetings but not vote on resolutions. US decision 'contravenes international law' The Palestinian Authority \"expressed its deep regret and astonishment\" at the visa decision, calling it \"a violation of US commitments\" as the host of the UN, and claiming it \"contravenes international law\". UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body would be seeking clarification in the \"hope that this will be resolved\". The State Department said that the Palestinian Authority's mission to the UN, comprising officials who are permanently based there, would not be included in the restrictions. Under a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York.

In an interview with Sky News, Ana Toni, chief executive of the COP30 climate summit in November, admitted some companies were having \"second thoughts\" about the global switch to green economies because policymakers were creating uncertainty. The US President Donald Trump has been attacking wind farms and waging tariff wars that could slow the transition to green energy. Banks including HSBC and Barclays have ditched a net zero alliance set up just four years ago by Mark Carney, now the Canadian Prime Minister. But even before Trump took office, tech companies were quietly dropping climate targets to prioritise energy-hungry AI, and other businesses were \"greenhushing\" their climate initiatives for fear of backlash. In this environment, there are fears fewer business leaders will attend the annual talks, which are also being hosted in a city on the edge of the Amazon that hasn't enough hotel rooms. On Friday, the COP30 team wrote to business leaders urging them to \"step forward, not back\" and travel to Belem, despite \"logistical challenges\" and the \"background of systemic uncertainty\". \n                  Brazil calls out world 'preoccupied' by defence, as it prepares to host global climate summit COP30\n                 Ana Toni told Sky News: \"We are very concerned that the enabling conditions must be there so that the private sector can also deliver where they do best, which is bringing in technology, bringing innovation and accelerating the process of decarbonisation.\" In August the share price of Danish wind farm developer plummeted after the US halted its Rhode Island wind farm, while the British Tories and Reform parties are also attacking net zero. But Ms Toni there is \"nothing to panic [about], because we can see that the transition is inevitable,\" citing major progress in China, India and Europe and Brazil. Referring to the US's withdrawal from the COP process, she said: \"198 countries minus one is not zero. And we will put all our efforts of working with the 197 countries that want to go forward and want to protect their population.\" \"Climate action is not only [still] cool, it is necessary,\" Ms Toni said. \"We all need to face reality. We are going through a huge climate crisis... If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Companies understand that.\""

The court ruled that the US president was not legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country, as it mostly upheld a decision by a specialised federal trade court. However, the court struck down a portion of the previous ruling that would have immediately cancelled the tariffs, allowing the Trump administration time to appeal to the US Supreme Court. \"ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that the \"highly partisan\" court had \"incorrectly said that our tariffs should be removed\". The decision could limit the speed and severity with which Mr Trump could act, despite having alternative laws for imposing import taxes. Mr Trump's tariffs, which reversed decades of US trade policy, increased fears of higher prices and slower economic growth after they shook the global markets. However, they also alienated US trading partners and allies, as Mr Trump used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan, and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals. \n                  Redundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plant after government rejects bailout\n                 \n                  US and China extend tariffs deadline again\n                 \n                  US trade war: The state of play as Trump's country-specific tariffs take effect\n                 \"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court ruling. \"A ruling against the tariffs would represent not just a legal defeat, but a serious blow to the administration's coercive trade diplomacy model.\"  Read more from Sky News:US blocks Palestinian resident from UN meetingTrump revokes Secret Service protection for Harris As a result, the US government might have to refund some of the import taxes it has collected, which would deliver a financial blow to its Treasury, which collected $142bn in tariff revenue by July - more than double at the same point a year before. In its legal filing this month, the Justice Department warned that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the US. \"If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country.

Typically, vice presidents receive a six-month security detail from the Secret Service after they leave office, although it had been extended to 18 months for Ms Harris, according to officials. Initially, then-president Joe Biden extended her security arrangements to one year, or January 2026, according to reports.

Former US presidents receive Secret Service protection for life. Read more from Sky News:Ed Davey has written to King to explain Trump dinner boycottThai prime minister sacked for ethics violation US correspondent We don't know why the former vice president's Secret Service protection has been revoked – the White House gave no explanation. We do know why former president Joe Biden extended it from the usual six months to 18 months before he left office. Such decisions tend to be based on advice from the Department of Homeland Security, determined by the perceived threat level. Kamala Harris isn't just a former vice president of the United States. She was the first woman and first African American to hold that office. In addition to that, she was the Democratic candidate in last year's election - the battle against Donald Trump raising her profile even higher. By early 2025, she had plans for a book tour. Her memoir, 107 Days, marking the short period of her candidature, is due out next month. Extending federal protection would have bolstered Ms Harris' safety during extensive public appearances. In short, the extension reflected heightened security needs – her symbolic status and increased visibility from upcoming public engagements. But the White House has pulled her Secret Service security detail, a move that will be deemed malicious by the president's critics. Ms Harris, who lost the 2024 presidential election to Mr Trump, is due to start a book tour for her memoir, 107 Days, shortly. She was the Democratic nominee for 107 days after Mr Biden exited the race in the weeks following a challenging debate against Mr Trump. Mr Trump has also ended federal security protection for others, including former national security adviser John Bolton. Last week, FBI agents raided Mr Bolton's Maryland home. In March, the president ended protection for Mr Biden's children, Hunter and Ashley Biden. Ms Harris has not ruled out a possible presidential run in 2028. She announced in July that she would not run for governor of California in 2026."

        "Content": "Thailand's prime minister has been sacked after a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian politician caused outrage. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was Thailand's youngest PM, has been dismissed from office by the country's Constitutional Court after only a year in power. The court found Ms Shinawatra, 39, violated ethics in a leaked June telephone call, during which she appeared to kowtow to Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen as the bordering countries were on the verge of an armed conflict. She also criticised a Thai army commander - a taboo move in a country where the military is extremely influential. Fighting erupted weeks later and lasted five days. At least 35 people were killed and more than 260,000 were displaced. Ms Shinawatra, who was new to politics when she took office in August last year, apologised over the call and said she was trying to avert a war. She was suspended in July. She is now the fifth Thai PM from, or backed by, the billionaire Shinawatra family to be removed by the military or the judiciary in 17 years, amid a battle for power between the country's warring elites. The ruling thrusts Thailand into more political uncertainty at a time of public unease over stalled reforms and a stuttering economy. Asia correspondent This is a damning verdict for the Thai prime minister.  Paetongtarn Shinawatra said she \"acted with the purest of intentions\" and that she hoped for political unity. But with one phone call, she has pushed Thailand to the brink of a political crisis. It was a naive and explosive mistake. And it couldn’t have happened at a worse time. Right now, the kingdom is facing massive insecurity.  Border tensions with Cambodia could erupt again at any point and it is just weeks since the two sides were exchanging fire. Thailand needs strong and definite leadership. Instead, it now has months of jeopardy. Paetongtarn is now the fifth leader to be removed from office by the constitutional court in just 17 years.  But her particular ouster is part of a much bigger story – the decline of Thailand's most powerful political dynasty. Last week, her father Thaksin was cleared of insulting the monarchy.  But he faces more court cases and the misstep by his daughter threatens to severely weaken their political domination as a family. Pateongtarn crossed a red line for Thais – insulting the all-important military. She clearly trusted \"uncle\" Hun Sen. She shouldn’t have.  His revenge leak has unseated her and her nation. Now comes a messy grappling to fill the power vacuum she leaves behind.  Speaking after the court's decision, the exiting PM said \"all sides\" in Thai politics now \"have to work together to build political stability and to ensure that there won't be another turning point again\". The focus will now shift to who will replace Ms Shinawatra. Her influential, billionaire father, Thaksin Shinawatra, who also once served as Thailand's PM, is expected to be at the heart of a flurry of bargaining to keep the ruling Pheu Thai party in power.

        "Content": "The Italian prime minister has been left outraged after an adult website posted unauthorised and altered images of women including herself. Giorgia Meloni - Italy's first female PM - said on Friday that she is \"disgusted by what's happened\". She was quoted by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera as saying: \"I want to express my solidarity and closeness to all the women who have been offended, insulted, and violated in their intimacy by the administrators of this forum and its 'users'.\" The images were posted on phica.eu, an adult site with a name that plays on a vulgar Italian slang term for female genitalia. It hosted thousands of manipulated images and videos of female public figures, often accompanied by violent and obscene commentary. The website had been running since 2005 and had more than 200,000 registered members. It was taken down on Thursday amid widespread condemnation and legal complaints. \"It is disheartening to see that in 2025, there are still those who consider it normal and legitimate to trample on a woman's dignity and make her the object of sexist and vulgar insults, hiding behind anonymity or a keyboard,\" Ms Meloni said. As well as the Italian PM, the site published images of public figures including EU lawmaker Alessandra Moretti, who filed a criminal complaint and said such websites \"incite rape and violence\", and influencer Chiara Ferragni. It is far from the first time high-profile women have been targeted by people using technology to create fake but often realistic explicit images. Taylor Swift fell victim to deepfake sexual pictures being circulated on X last year, with a spokesperson for then-president Joe Biden describing the situation as \"very alarming\".

Tom Phillips vanished with his daughters Jayda and Ember, now aged 12 and nine, and son Maverick, 10, in December 2021. There have been just a handful of confirmed sightings of them in the years since. But police investigating a burglary on New Zealand's North Island believe footage from the incident shows Phillips and one of his children. The CCTV, captured at around 2am on Wednesday, shows a masked man with a child examining a storefront in the small town of Piopio, before appearing to break in with a power tool. New Zealand Police said: \"We believe the pair in this footage are Tom and one of his children. \"They were in the area for 13 minutes, having travelled in and out on a quad bike.\" The pair left the shop with a number of grocery items, they said. Police say the store is one Phillips is believed to have targeted, unsuccessfully, in November 2023. Police are appealing for information from anyone who may have seen the quad bike between Piopio and the coastal village of Marokopa. \"At the heart of this are three children who have been away from their home for four years.

Phillips' family recently appealed for him to return home, with his mother saying in a letter shared publicly: \"Tom, I feel really sad that you thought you had to do this, not considering how much we love you and could support you.\" Police believe his actions could be linked to a custody battle."

US secretary of state Marco Rubio has revoked the US visas of delegates from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and denied others from applying for one. It is the latest step by Donald Trump's administration to target Palestinians with visa restrictions, and follows the suspension of a programme to allow injured children from Gaza to receive treatment in the US. \"It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,\" a statement from the US State Department said.

Gaza latest: Israel's Gaza City offensive condemned Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering in Gaza City while enduring famine. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations (UN), Riyad Mansour, said Mr Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the general assembly at the general debate, which begins on 23 September. He was also expected to attend a high-level meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on 22 September about a two-state solution, a broad idea involving Israel coexisting with an independent Palestinian state. The State of Palestine is an observer member of the UN, meaning it can speak at meetings but not vote on resolutions. US decision 'contravenes international law' The Palestinian Authority \"expressed its deep regret and astonishment\" at the visa decision, calling it \"a violation of US commitments\" as the host of the UN, and claiming it \"contravenes international law\". UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body would be seeking clarification in the \"hope that this will be resolved\". The State Department said that the Palestinian Authority's mission to the UN, comprising officials who are permanently based there, would not be included in the restrictions. Under a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York.

The court ruled that the US president was not legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country, as it mostly upheld a decision by a specialised federal trade court. However, the court struck down a portion of the previous ruling that would have immediately cancelled the tariffs, allowing the Trump administration time to appeal to the US Supreme Court. \"ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that the \"highly partisan\" court had \"incorrectly said that our tariffs should be removed\". The decision could limit the speed and severity with which Mr Trump could act, despite having alternative laws for imposing import taxes. Mr Trump's tariffs, which reversed decades of US trade policy, increased fears of higher prices and slower economic growth after they shook the global markets.

In its legal filing this month, the Justice Department warned that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the US. \"If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong,\" Mr Trump added on Truth Social after the ruling."

El Shafee Elsheikh, known as \"Jihadi Ringo\", grew up in west London before he left the UK for Syria in 2012 to fight for the Islamic State (ISIS). The former mechanic and three other men, who all grew up in the UK, were members of a terror cell that was nicknamed \"The Beatles\" because of their British accents. Elsheikh has been serving eight life sentences in a US jail for his involvement in a hostage-taking scheme which involved torturing, beating and executing prisoners. However three years after he was jailed, the daughter of British aid worker David Haines - who was murdered by the ISIS cell in 2014 - has told The Sun she has received a notice saying Elsheikh has applied to be transferred to a UK jail. Bethany Haines told the newspaper: \"I beg the UK government to act to make sure he never sets foot on these shores again.\" The notice, seen by the paper, refers to Elsheikh as a UK national but the Home Office has confirmed to Sky News that he was stripped of his British citizenship following his arrest by Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces in 2018. Ministry of Justice guidance says non-British nationals, such as Elsheikh, must hold valid leave to enter and remain in the UK in order to be considered for transfer. The Ministry of Justice said in a statement: \"Our sympathies remain with the friends and families of the victims of these appalling crimes. \"We have not received any application for Mr Elsheikh's transfer from the US authorities but we have the right to refuse any request and prisoners who are transferred to the UK will serve the rest of their sentence here.\" Read more:Suspected ISIS 'Beatles' member jailedBrother of David Haines 'forgives' ISIS 'Beatle' Who were the ISIS 'Beatles'? The former ISIS fighters are believed to be responsible for beheading more than 27 hostages. This includes Mr Haines and fellow British aid worker Alan Henning as well as American aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. The cell also caused outrage around the world after releasing videos of the executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Footage of Mr Haines's murder was also posted online and his remains have never been discovered. Elsheikh, who moved to the UK from Sudan aged five, was handed eight concurrent life sentences by a US court in 2022, alongside fellow cell member Alexanda Kotey. A third \"Beatles\" member, Mohammed Emwazi, who was dubbed \"Jihadi John\", was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Meanwhile Muslim-convert Aine Davis, who was suspected of also being part of the terror cell, was jailed for eight years in 2023."

        "Content": "Shares in UK banks have fallen sharply on the back of a report which urges the chancellor to place their profits in her sights in the coming budget. As Rachel Reeves stares down a growing deficit - estimated at between £20bn-£40bn heading into the autumn - the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said there was an opportunity for a windfall by closing a loophole. It recommended a new levy on the interest UK lenders receive from the Bank of England, amounting to £22bn a year, on reserves held as a result of the Bank's historic quantitative easing, or bond-buying, programme. Money latest: Ryanair changes cabin bag sizing It was first introduced at the height of the financial crisis, in 2009. The left-leaning think-tank said the money received by banks amounted to a subsidy and suggested £8bn could be taken from them annually to pay for public services. It argued that the loss-making scheme - a consequence of rising interest rates since 2021 - had left taxpayers footing the bill unfairly, as the Treasury has to cover any loss. \n                  Surprise good news as government borrowing less than forecast\n                 \n                  Something for everyone in UK's latest GDP data\n                 \n                  Rachel Reeves is celebrating the Bank of England's interest cut – but behind the scenes she has little to cheer \n                  The Bank recently estimated the total hit would amount to £115bn over the course of its lifetime. The publication of the report coincided with a story in the Financial Times, which spoke of growing fears within the banking sector that it was firmly in the chancellor's sights. Her first budget, in late October last year, put businesses on the hook for the bulk of its tax-raising measures. Ms Reeves is under pressure to find more money from somewhere, as she has ruled out breaking her own fiscal rules to help secure the cash she needs through heightened borrowing.  Other measures understood to be under consideration include a wealth tax, new property tax, and a shake-up that could lead to a replacement for council tax. Analysts at Exane told clients in a note: \"In the last couple of years, the chancellor has been protective of the banks and has avoided raising taxes. \"However, public finances may require additional cash and pressures for a bank tax from within the Labour party seem to be rising,\" it concluded. Bank stocks have enjoyed a strong 2025 to date. But Friday's investor flight saw shares in Lloyds and NatWest plunge by more than 5%. Those for Barclays were more than 4% lower at one stage. A spokesperson for the Treasury said the best way to strengthen public finances was to speed up economic growth. \"Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms,\" they added."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n The man dubbed \"Britain's most hated boss\" for his controversial policy of sacking hundreds of seafarers and replacing them with cheaper agency staff is to quit. Sky News can exclusively reveal that Peter Hebblethwaite, the chief executive of P&O Ferries, is leaving the company. Sources said he had decided to resign for personal reasons. Money latest: The exact time to book train ticket at bargain price Mr Hebblethwaite joined the ranks of Britain's most notorious corporate figures in 2022 when P&O Ferries - a subsidiary of the giant Dubai-based ports operator DP World - said it was sacking 800 staff with immediate effect - some of whom learned their fate via a video message. The policy, which Mr Hebblethwaite defended to MPs during subsequent select committee hearings, erupted into a national scandal, prompting changes in the law to give workers greater protection. Under the new legislation, the government plans to tighten collective redundancy requirements for operators of foreign vessels. \n                  Bank shares take fright as budget tax hike is floated\n                 \n                  How the US trade war is now targeting you from today\n                 \n                  Money latest: Ryanair changes cabin bag sizing; two-Michelin star restaurant closes\n                  In a statement issued in response to a request from Sky News, a P&O Ferries spokesperson said: \"Peter Hebblethwaite has communicated his intention to resign from his position as chief executive officer to dedicate more time to family matters. \"P&O Ferries extends its gratitude to Peter Hebblethwaite for his contributions as CEO over the past four years. \"During his tenure the company navigated the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, initiated a path towards financial stability, and introduced the world's first large double-ended hybrid ferries on the Dover-Calais route, thereby enhancing sustainability. \"We extend our best wishes to him for his future endeavours.\" A source close to the company said it anticipated making an announcement on Mr Hebblethwaite's successor in the near term. A former executive at J Sainsbury, Greene King and Alliance Unichem, Mr Hebblethwaite joined P&O Ferries in 2019, before taking over as chief executive in November 2021. Insiders claimed on Friday that he had \"transformed\" the business following the bitter blows dealt to its finances by the COVID-19 pandemic and - to some degree - by the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union. P&O Ferries carries 4.5 million passengers annually on routes between the UK and continental European ports including Calais and Rotterdam. It also operates a route between Northern Ireland and Scotland, and is a major freight carrier. The company's losses soared during the pandemic, with DP World - its sole shareholder - supporting it through hundreds of millions of pounds in loans. Its most recent accounts, which were significantly delayed, showed a significant reduction in losses in 2023 to just over £90m. The reduction from the previous year's figure of almost £250m was partly attributed to cost reduction exercises. The accounts also showed that Mr Hebblethwaite received a pay package of £683,000, including a bonus of £183,000. \"I reflected on accepting that payment, but ultimately I did decide to accept it,\" he told MPs. \"I do recognise it is not a decision that everybody would have made.\" The row over his pay was especially acute because of his admission that P&O Ferries' lowest-paid seafarers received hourly pay of just £4.87. Mr Hebblethwaite had argued since the mass sackings of 2022 that the company would have gone bust without the drastic cost-cutting that it entailed. The company insisted at the time that those affected by the redundancies had been offered \"enhanced\" packages to leave. Last October, the then transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: \"The mass sacking by P&O Ferries was a national scandal which can never be allowed to happen again,\" adding that measures to protect seafarers from \"rogue employers\" would prevent a repetition. \"This issue has been ignored for over 2 years, but this new government is moving fast and bringing forward measures within 100 days,\" Ms Haigh added. \"We are closing the legal loophole that P&O Ferries exploited when they sacked almost 800 dedicated seafarers and replaced them with low-paid agency workers and we are requiring operators to pay the equivalent of National Minimum Wage in UK waters. \"Make no mistake - this is good for workers and good for business.\" The minister's description of P&O Ferries as \"rogue\", and suggestion that consumers should boycott the company, sparked a row which threatened to overshadow the government's International Investment Summit last October. Sky News's business and economics correspondent, Paul Kelso, revealed that DP World had withdrawn from participating in the event, and paused a £1bn investment announcement. The company relented after Sir Keir Starmer publicly distanced the government from Ms Haigh's characterisation of DP World."

Strategists see an opportunity in younger people who, over the course of this parliament, may be priced out of cities and into commuter belt areas as they seek to get on the housing ladder or start a family. Insiders say the plan is to focus more on the cost of living to shift the party's appeal beyond the traditional southern heartlands. \"There's a key opportunity to target people who were 30 at the last election who over the next five years might find themselves moving out of London, to areas like Surrey, Guildford,\" a senior party source told Sky News. \"We also need to be better at making a case for a liberal voice in urban areas. We have not told enough of a story on the cost of living. \"We need a liberal voice back in the cities - areas like Liverpool, where there is strong support at a council level that we can use as a base to build on.\" Liverpool is a traditional Labour heartland but in January lost its first local authority by-election there in 27 years to the Lib Dems. \n                  Sir Ed Davey to boycott Donald Trump state dinner with King Charles in Gaza protest\n                 \n                  Farage accused of wanting to 'take UK backwards' - as Brexit blamed for small boats crisis\n                 \n                  Scotland, Wales and N Ireland party leaders unite to criticise Starmer over Israel-Gaza stance\n                 Carl Cashman, the leader of the Lib Dems on the city council, says it's a result that shows the potential to make gains in areas where the party came third and fourth at the general election. \"One of the cases I have been making to the national party is that Liverpool should be a number one target. \"We are almost at the end of the road when it comes to the Conservatives, so we need to start looking at areas like Liverpool,\" he said, adding that Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle could also be ripe for the taking. However, the party faces a challenge of making a case for liberalism against the rising tide of populism. Sir Ed Davey, the party leader, is trying to position himself as the only politician who is not afraid of holding Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to account. He has recently unveiled a plan to cut energy bills by changing how renewable projects are paid for and says he will boycott Donald Trump's state dinner. It is these green, internationalist policies that insiders hope can hoover up support of remaining Tory moderates unhappy with the direction of Kemi Badenoch's party and progressive voters who think Labour is more of the same. However, strategists admit it is difficult to cut through on these issues in a changing media landscape, \"when you're either viral or you're not\". 'Silly stunts' here to stay Farage has no such problem, which Davey has blamed on a national media weighted too heavily in favour of the Reform UK leader, given the size of his party (he has just four MPs compared to the Liberal Democrats' 72). But the two parties have very different media strategies. This week, on the same day Farage held a Trump-style press conference to announce his immigration deportation plans, with a Q&A for journalists after, the Liberal Democrat leader went to pick strawberries in Somerset to highlight the plight of farmers facing increased inheritance tax. Some Lib Dems have questioned whether the \"silly stunts\" that proved successful during the general election are past their shelf life, but strategists say there will be no fundamental change to that, insisting Sir Ed is the \"genuine nice guy\" he comes across as and that offers something different. The Lib Dems ultimately see their strength as lying not in the \"airwaves war\" but the \"ground war\" - building support on the doorstep at a local level and then turning that into seats. \"Our strategy is seats, not votes. Theirs is votes, not seats,\" said the party source, suggesting Farage's divisiveness might backfire under a first past the post system where people typically vote against the party they disklike the most. \"The next election won't be about who is saying the meanest things.\" 'Don't underestimate us' There is broad support within the party behind that strategy. Cllr Cashman said a greater use of social media could help attract a younger demographic, along with putting forward \"really fundamental, powerful liberal ideas\" on issues such as housing. But he said Davey is \"never going to do the controversial things Farage does\". \"The way we reach people, the traditional campaigning, is what makes us strong. Just because we are not always on the airwaves, do not underestimate us.\" For Liberal Democrat peer and pollster Dr Mark Pack, there are reasons to be confident. On Friday, the party won a local council by-election in Camden, north London - \"Sir Keir Starmer's backyard\" - with a swing from Labour to the Lib Dems of 19%. It is these statistics that the party is far more focused on than national vote share - with Labour's misfortunes opening an opportunity to strategically target areas where voters are more likely to switch. \"One of the lessons we have learned from the past is that riding high in opinion polls doesn't translate into seats. \"We are really focused on winning seats with the system in front of us. There is a route to success by concentrating on and expanding on what we have been good at.\""

        "Headline": "Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton banned its Reform councillors, who hold 41 of 66 seats, from speaking to journalists from the Nottingham Post.",
        "Content": "By Miriam Kuepper, news reporter   Reform UK's deputy leader has defended a ban on a local newspaper handed down by a council leader in a free speech row. Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton banned its Reform councillors, who hold 41 of 66 seats, from speaking to journalists from the Nottingham Post, its digital site Nottinghamshire Live and its local democracy reporters on Tuesday. This came after the newspaper published an article reporting on two Reform councillors allegedly saying they could face suspension if they did not back Mr Barton's preferred structure for the reorganisation of the council. Richard Tice, Reform's deputy leader, has defended the ban, telling Sky News' presenter Jonathan Samuels that Nottinghamshire Live \"distorts and completely acts in an irresponsible way\" and therefore councillors were \"entitled to say 'we're going to talk to other parts of the media, not yourselves'\". When challenged that this was going against the principle of democracy, Reform UK's deputy leader replied: \"That's the whole point of a democracy. You pick and choose who you speak to, and sometimes you speak to friends, sometimes you don't. \"But it is equally that a media organisation does have a responsibility also to present some things in a sensible way, presenting both sides of a debate or an argument. And that was the issue.\" Natalie Fahy, senior editor at Nottinghamshire Live, told Sky News she was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" by Mr Tice's comments, as he \"knows absolutely nothing about what the Nottingham Post publishes day in day out\". \n                  Is political chaos fuelled by the media? \n                 \n                  After six months of planning, Reform's immigration policy is as clear as mud\n                 \n                  Farage rows back on including women and children in deportation plans\n                 She said: \"As a newspaper regulated by IPSO (Independent Press Standards Organisation), we are actually allowed to be biased if we want to be, but we try to maintain an overall balance on our coverage (...) We've not distorted any facts whatsoever.\" Mr Tice was asked whether he only wanted to be held to account by people that he likes and agrees with. He replied: \"I want to be held to account by people who are going to be rational, sensible and not completely distorted and biased.\" \"That's not a democratic society, that's not free press. Sometimes there is going to be negative stuff, and sometimes we will be going to have to criticise stuff. It's very dangerous what he (Mr Tice) said - you can't just have a positive, unquestioning press,\" Ms Fahy warned. She added that the Nottingham Post was not an anti-Reform publication and that its journalists appreciate that many of their readers vote for Reform. \"We just want to find out on behalf of our readers what they voted for,\" Ms Fahy said. 'Rehearsal for Nigel Farage's government' Ms Fahy, who alerted Mr Tice to the ban before he spoke to Sky News on Friday, urged Nigel Farage to get involved. \"This is a rehearsal for Nigel Farage's government - he needs to step in and say that this is not acceptable behaviour if he wants to be taken seriously,\" the senior editor warned. But Mr Tice indicated that Mr Farage would not wade into the row, saying: \"It's a local row and I'm sure they'll sort it out.\" The ban might not end with the Nottingham Post, as Mr Barton, the Nottinghamshire County Council leader, warned his party would also \"not be engaging with any other media outlet we consider to be consistently misrepresenting our politics, actions, or intentions\". As part of the ban, the authority will also stop sending press releases to the outlet and won't invite them to council events, although it cannot prevent them from attending public meetings. Ms Fahy published an opinion piece after the ban was announced, telling readers: \"Reform UK makes huge noises about respecting free speech, transparency, honesty and being straight-talking. This boycott flies in the face of all of that. When the press is not welcome, you know democracy itself is in danger. \"If we're heading for a Reform government, you'll see this echoed on the national stage. And maybe at some point, people will look back and wonder where it all started. If we don't fight back against this authoritarian edict, we're heading down a very dark and dangerous path for everyone in this country. \"Grow up Mick Barton, and start accepting a free press is there to hold you and your councillors to account. You've got my number and I am waiting for your call.\" 'Not just press being shut out' The leader of the opposition at Nottinghamshire County Council, Conservative councillor Sam Smith, said on X: \"The free press play a key role in keeping residents informed of actions being taken by decision makers and in return the press express the views of residents to the politicians and public in publishing balanced articles. \"As a leader of the county council, I welcomed that scrutiny. Sometimes it was tough reading, but it helped ensure my team and I were always focused on delivering on the priorities of local residents. \"It's not just the press Reform are shutting out in Nottinghamshire. It's the voice and views of residents.\" Mr Barton said the decision had not been made \"lightly\", adding: \"It is not about silencing journalism, it is about upholding the principle that freedom of speech must be paired with responsibility and honesty.\""

        "Content": "An investigation is being urged into MP James McMurdock over his \"use of social media to apparently facilitate racial abuse\" against Sky News political correspondent Mhari Aurora. Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty has written to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Daniel Greenberg, over the matter. Mr McMurdock was previously a Reform UK MP, but suspended himself from Nigel Farage's party after allegations emerged over COVID loans he claimed. There was controversy over his selection as a Reform candidate after it emerged he was jailed in 2006 for assaulting his then-girlfriend. Politics latest: Home Office says Epping asylum hotel appeal win in court 'avoids chaos' In his letter shared on social media, Mr Obese-Jecty outlined how Mr McMurdock posted the single letter \"N\" under an X post that was critical of Aurora. Mr Obese-Jecty explains the concept of an \"N-Tower\", saying it \"is a means of using a racial slur against an individual on an online platform whilst circumventing moderation that would remove racially abusive content\". \"The practice involves spelling out a racial slur vertically with each individual posting a single letter of the word in order to spell it vertically.\" In this case, the slur was the n-word, with the letters appearing in subsequent posts under Mr McMurdock's first on X over roughly 30 minutes. Mr McMurdock later appears to have deleted his post, Mr Obese-Jecty says.

Grok is a large language model, which is known to be inaccurate. He added that Mr Obese-Jecty's \"complaint regarding the alleged posting of a single letter is beyond ridiculous\". Mr McMurdock then claimed he believed the Conservative MP had broken the law by \"writing the N-word in full\" - saying this was \"offensive, indecent and obscene\". In his letter, Mr Obese-Jecty tells the commissioner he believes what happens breaches the Commons code - specifically that \"members shall never undertake any action which would cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, or of its members generally\". He also says the actions \"reflect a lack of adherence\" to the seven principles of public life. Mr Obese-Jecty says by \"deleting the post without challenging the subsequent spelling\" that was started by him, Mr McMurdock showed a \"failure to challenge poor behaviour\" and \"absence of moral courage\". He calls on the commissioner to ask Mr McMurdock to clarify what his intentions were with the original post, and to share his archive of social media posts. Mr Obese-Jecty adds: \"Having repeatedly experienced this specific type of online racial abuse myself I am horrified that a fellow member of parliament would apparently see this as a legitimate means of challenging a Westminster lobby journalist in a public forum. \"I sincerely hope that there is a coherent and believable explanation for this horrendous action.\" The Conservative MP posted the letter on social media, saying: \"There should be no place in Parliament for those who use their position to target, and attempt to intimidate, a free press. \"I welcome a clear and credible explanation from James McMurdock that illustrates how his apparent part in this unacceptable abuse was a misunderstanding and would encourage him to condemn this type of abuse in the strongest possible terms.\""

Founded in 1948 by a future Labour lord chancellor Gerald Gardiner, it declares: \"Our objectives are to contribute legal expertise to the Labour Party and uphold the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and the rule of law in the UK and around the world. \"We advise Labour MPs and the House of Lords; develop and scrutinise policy and legislation; contribute to debate within the Labour movement by hosting events and discussions; and mentor future members of the legal profession. \n                  Appeals court overturns injunction that blocked asylum seekers from Epping hotel\n                 \n                  Lib Dems eye Labour-held cities as they target 'seats not votes'\n                 \n                  Richard Tice defends Reform ban on local newspaper in free speech row\n                 \"We are open to Labour Party members who are also practising or retired lawyers, law students or graduates, academics, and members of the judiciary.\" The Fabian Society describes itself as \"a democratically governed socialist society, a Labour affiliate and one of the party's original founders\". But Lord Justice Bean isn't the only judge at the centre of the legal battle over The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, who has a political background and affiliation.  Sir Stephen Eyre, the High Court judge who ruled in favour of Epping Forest District Council earlier this month, was a Conservative parliamentary candidate four times. His most high-profile bid to become an MP came in the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, won by current Labour MP and former minister Liam Byrne. Appointed a High Court judge by then Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab in 2021, Sir Stephen was a Tory candidate while working as a barrister. His first attempt came in 1987, when he stood in Hodge Hill in that year's general election, coming second behind Labour's Terry Davis. Then in 1992, the year of Sir John Major's 21-seat election victory, he stood for the Northern Ireland Conservatives in the unionist stronghold of Strangford.

In 2001, he stood in Stourbridge, where he again came second, this time to Labour's Debra Shipley, when he cut her majority from nearly 6,000 to under 4,000. And in the 2004 by-election, he came a distant third as Mr Byrne scraped in by just 460 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who benefited from an Iraq war backlash."

        "Content": "Former prime minister David Cameron once described himself as a \"modern, compassionate Conservative\". That was in 2011, in an interview during the party's annual conference in Manchester, the early years of the coalition. \"Cameronism\" - or \"Cameroonism\", you take your pick - became the self-defined lens of conservatism that Cameron used during his six years in Number 10. Austerity, combined with policy to appeal to social liberals, such as equal marriage, and environmental \"responsibility - to the next generation\". Fourteen years on from that interview, \"Badenochism\" has yet to truly define itself, but it's fair to say that the Conservatives of 2010 are different to those of 2025. The party has shifted further to the right in recent years, with some jumping ship to join Reform UK. Both parties are now fighting for the soul of the British right. This got Electoral Dysfunction listener Sean thinking - he sent in a question about whether defectors would be welcomed back to the Conservatives in the future. Co-host Ruth Davidson, who previously was leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, had plenty of thoughts. The kind of conservatism that I represent, I think, is very far from Reform. \n                  Is Trump now 'dictator'-in-chief?\n                 \n                  Will this be Starmer's toughest term yet?\n                 \n                  Is political chaos fuelled by the media? \n                 There are some people within the Conservative Party that see almost the Conservative-Reform spectrum as a continuum, and that actually one bleeds into the other, and there may even be a bit of crossover in it. I don't see it like that. I find what's alarming [is] the journey from a Conservative Party Conference where you had David Cameron as leader, you had Justine Greening, you had Greg Clarke, you had Dominic Grieve, William Hague, you had all of these people, you had a really broad tent. You had people like Liam Fox that were representing the right of the party. The idea that we've gone from such a broad church to now fighting on such a small patch of ground over immigration. The attack that Kemi's getting from within the party, he would say that he's trying to be supportive, but in terms of the challenge she's getting within from Robert Jenrick, it's all on this really narrow patch of land. If you look at the broad swathes of policy that's out there that affects people in economics, in business, in social care, in public services, in education, in opportunities for young people, we could fight on any ground and the fights that we're choosing to have right now are on this really, really narrow path of ground. We're being outflanked on the right and we're drifting ever further towards there. It makes me sad as somebody that believes in \"big tent\" conservatism. I think when your party is under threat, and I think this happens to all parties, when you're reducing rather than expanding, you talk to your base to try to generate your base to come out for you. You don't then talk to try to convert others who have previously voted for other parties at different elections. You've all of these groups that exist that are populated by people who are still of the more centre-right views rather than right views - like the Conservative Environment Network, LGBT+ Conservatives - but the difficulty they have is that they have that same sort of confliction that we saw a lot of parliamentarians under Jeremy Corbyn had - like Jess Phillips, like Wes Streeting. They want to be loyal to the party, they want to support the leader, but they struggle with the fact that what the vehicle is espousing is not their beliefs.

In an interview with Sky News, Ana Toni, chief executive of the COP30 climate summit in November, admitted some companies were having \"second thoughts\" about the global switch to green economies because policymakers were creating uncertainty. The US President Donald Trump has been attacking wind farms and waging tariff wars that could slow the transition to green energy. Banks including HSBC and Barclays have ditched a net zero alliance set up just four years ago by Mark Carney, now the Canadian Prime Minister. But even before Trump took office, tech companies were quietly dropping climate targets to prioritise energy-hungry AI, and other businesses were \"greenhushing\" their climate initiatives for fear of backlash. In this environment, there are fears fewer business leaders will attend the annual talks, which are also being hosted in a city on the edge of the Amazon that hasn't enough hotel rooms. On Friday, the COP30 team wrote to business leaders urging them to \"step forward, not back\" and travel to Belem, despite \"logistical challenges\" and the \"background of systemic uncertainty\". \n                  Brazil calls out world 'preoccupied' by defence, as it prepares to host global climate summit COP30\n                 Ana Toni told Sky News: \"We are very concerned that the enabling conditions must be there so that the private sector can also deliver where they do best, which is bringing in technology, bringing innovation and accelerating the process of decarbonisation.\" In August the share price of Danish wind farm developer plummeted after the US halted its Rhode Island wind farm, while the British Tories and Reform parties are also attacking net zero. But Ms Toni there is \"nothing to panic [about], because we can see that the transition is inevitable,\" citing major progress in China, India and Europe and Brazil. Referring to the US's withdrawal from the COP process, she said: \"198 countries minus one is not zero. And we will put all our efforts of working with the 197 countries that want to go forward and want to protect their population.\" \"Climate action is not only [still] cool, it is necessary,\" Ms Toni said. \"We all need to face reality. We are going through a huge climate crisis... If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Companies understand that.\""

        "Content": "\n          Climate reporter\n              @SeabrookClimate\n Campaigners are calling for more expensive parking charges for SUV drivers, akin to those introduced in Paris. The proportion of large cars in England's cities is now 10 times higher than 20 years ago, driving greater emissions, congestion and danger, researchers said. In London, the number of SUVs now takes up the equivalent amount of space as the entire borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Clean Cities found. It wants cities to introduce Paris-style parking charges for big cars as a way to put off drivers and free up space. Last year, the French capital tripled parking costs for SUVs, from €6 (£5.20) to €18 (£15.60) an hour in the city centre, which local reports say is already denting their numbers. Oliver Lord, UK Head of Clean Cities, called it \"only fair that those vehicles that do more damage pay a fair share of the cost that society has to pick up\". \"Drivers are struggling to park because of 'car spreading', while people walking and cycling are more at risk,\" he told Sky News. \n                  Brazil implores businesses to attend major climate summit, despite 'second thoughts' amid Trump backlash\n                 \n                  Spain deploys another 500 soldiers to tackle wildfires - as part of Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route closed\n                 \n                  Thousands evacuated as deadly wildfires sweep Europe\n                 \"If we want cities that are safer for children and allow us all to move around easier, we need to take action.\" In recent years, cars have become heavier, taller, and more powerful, often making their passengers safer in an accident, but those on the outside are more at risk. The chance of a pedestrian or cyclist dying from being hit by a car is 30% higher for vehicles with bonnets 90cm tall than those of 80cm, according to the Vias Institute.  While many SUVs are electric, larger vehicles drain more energy and resources than passenger cars. In England, SUVs now account for 30% of new car sales, a tenfold increase since 2002/03, Clean Cities found, with many too big for old parking spaces. Ian Taylor, spokesperson for the Alliance of British Drivers, called it \"perfectly ok and justifiable for a lot of people to have bigger vehicles\", pointing to the fact that other vehicles, such as for commercial uses, have also grown in size. He added: \"It is not fair to make life more expensive and unpleasant for people who operate such vehicles.\" A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"This year, the Mayor will be refreshing his Vision Zero Action Plan to restate his commitment to reducing road danger and responding to new and emerging risks on our roads.\" Sky News has contacted the government's transport department with a request to comment."

        "Content": "From eight weeks until 14 years old, the NHS recommends a number of vaccines for children and teenagers. The health service says immunisations are the best defence against potentially serious illnesses, and it is important they are given at the correct time. Here are all the vaccinations children are recommended to have, at what age and what they protect against. At eight weeks, babies are recommended to have the following jabs: • 6-in-1 vaccine• Rotavirus vaccine• MenB vaccine The 6-in-1 vaccine protects against the following illnesses: • Diphtheria - a contagious infection that affects the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin;• Hepatitis B - a liver infection that is spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids;• Haemophilus influenzae type b (known as Hib) - a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections;• Polio - a virus that spreads easily from person to person and can cause symptoms that affect the brain and nervous system;• Tetanus - a life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into a wound;• Whooping cough - an infection of the lungs and breathing tubes that spreads easily. The rotavirus vaccine helps protect against rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting that can be very common in children and young babies. The MenB vaccine can protect against a bacteria known as meningococcal group B that can cause serious illnesses, including meningitis and sepsis. A second dose of all three of the above is administered again at 12 weeks old. When a baby reaches 16 weeks, the NHS recommends a third dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine, as well as the Pneumococcal vaccine. This helps protect against serious illnesses like: • Meningitis - an infection in the brain and spinal cord;• Sepsis - a life-threatening reaction to an infection;• Pneumonia - an infection in the lungs. At one year, the NHS recommends babies have their first MMR vaccine. This gives long-term protection against: • Measles - an infection that causes a rash and flu-like symptoms;• Mumps - an infection that causes painful swelling on the cheeks and neck;• Rubella - often referred to as German measles, and can cause a rash over the body. As of January 2026, babies aged between 12 and 18 months will also get the varicella vaccine, which protects against chickenpox. The varicella vaccination will be combined with the MMR vaccine, making it the MMRV. The vaccine provides around 98% protection in children and about 75% protection in adults after two doses, and is expected to protect around 500,000 babies every year when rolled out by the NHS. The health service also recommends children having the following vaccines at the age of one:• A second dose of the Pneumococcal vaccine;• A third dose of the MenB vaccine. For babies born before 30 June 2024, the NHS recommends a Hib/MenC vaccine at the age of one. This protects against hib and meningitis C. Due to the Hib/MenC vaccine being discontinued, when babies born after 1 July 2024 reach 18 months old, they are offered:• A fourth dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine;• A second MMR vaccine. Like babies and children of a certain age, those aged 65 and over are also recommended vaccinations. The NHS offers the flu vaccine every year to those over 65. The shingles vaccine is also offered to those who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023, and to those aged 70-79. For 75 to 79 -year-olds, the RSV vaccine is recommended. This helps protect against respiratory syncytial virus, which can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis in older or younger people. People aged 75 and over are also offered the COVID-19 vaccine. Typically, vaccines against coronavirus are offered in the spring and winter. At the age of two, the NHS recommends: • A flu vaccine. It says flu can spread easily among children, and vaccinating them helps protect others who are at higher risk of getting seriously ill. It is offered again to:• Children aged three;• School children from reception to year 11;• From the age of six months to 17 years to those with certain long-term health conditions. At three years and four months old, a second dose of MMR is recommended for children born on or before 30 June 2024. The 4-in-1 school booster vaccine is also offered. This helps protect against diphtheria, polio, whooping cough and tetanus and is given to children before they start school. From 12 to 13, teenagers are offered the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against human papillomavirus, a common virus that's spread through skin contact. Girls under 25 and boys born after 1 September 2006 who missed having the vaccine at school can also get the vaccine through their GP. The NHS recommends the following to those who are pregnant:\n\n\n • A flu vaccine during flu season (October to March in the UK)\n • A whooping cough vaccine at 20 weeks pregnant • An RSV vaccine at 28 weeks pregnant At 14 years old, the NHS recommends the following:• Td/IPV vaccine (3-in-1 teenage booster) - this helps protect against tetanus, diphtheria and polio. It's recommended for children in year nine at school, and those at higher risk of the illnesses;• MenACWY vaccine - this helps protect against meningitis and sepsis. While babies are given the MenB vaccine to help protect against a common type of bacteria that causes meningitis, the MenACWY vaccine helps protect against four other types of bacteria linked to the virus. Read more:Child vaccine rates lowest in more than a decadeMMR uptake hits 15-year low The NHS says to contact your GP if you think you or your child has missed any vaccinations. Most immunisations can be taken after the recommended age. Some babies and children may also require further vaccines if they are at risk of a particular illness or have an underlying health condition. Those that have had a serious allergic reaction to any vaccination or are allergic to any of the ingredients will not receive it."

In a video posted on Instagram, she's now told fans: \"Unfortunately, I have to have a second surgery, nothing too serious, but it has to be done before the end of the year and unfortunately, that falls right in the middle of a tour that I had booked.\" The UK and Europe dates have been postponed until April next year while the US tour has been cancelled. \"So that is what it is, and I'm sorry,\" the performer said. \"I feel frustrated and sad, but also it is what it is, and I need to be better. \"I need to be healed, and I know this is the right decision to make. So I'm postponing the tour till next year.\" The star has asked fans to \"please bear with us for the US tour\", adding that it's \"something that I want to do, but when the time is right\". \"You guys know how much I want to do all of it, but I just can't,\" she said. \"And I have to be realistic.\" Read more:Top Boy actor in courtBanksy artwork put in protective storage Jessie J has battled numerous health issues, including being diagnosed with a heart condition when she was eight years old and suffering a minor stroke aged 18.
