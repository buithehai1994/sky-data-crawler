        "Content": "Donald Trump has said everyone is \"very happy\" after claiming a deal is in the works over the future of Greenland - and scrapping a threat to impose tariffs on European allies.  An emergency EU leaders summit is set to go ahead today despite the US president's announcement in Davos on Wednesday. Trump's climbdown as it happened Mr Trump said he won't impose the 10% tariffs threatened on eight European nations, including the UK, over their opposition to his proposed takeover of the Arctic territory, following a \"very productive\" meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte. Posting on Truth Social, Mr Trump said they had formed the framework of a future deal with regard to Greenland and the \"entire Arctic region\", saying the \"solution\" will be great for the US and all NATO countries. The US president said \"everybody's very happy\" with the \"ultimate long-term deal\" - and it \"gives us everything we needed to get\". He added he had spoken with other European leaders about it, but nothing had yet been signed and details have not been forthcoming. He also declared the US \"won't use force\" to take Greenland, but added his military would be \"unstoppable\" in that scenario. US correspondent The expansive ambitions for Greenland that put Trump in conflict with NATO allies, politically at least, disappeared following a meeting with the man who calls him \"Daddy\". Did NATO chief Rutte crack the code?  If he turned him round in a meeting over nibbles on the sidelines at Davos, he truly is the \"Trump Whisperer\". An alternative theory would be Trump came to realise he needed an off-ramp on Greenland, that his territorial ambitions provoked a resistance amongst old allies that he hadn't foreseen and couldn't fight. NATO countries had complied with Trump on increasing their contributions to the alliance. They have bent the knee to the unpredictable, erratic president but on Greenland, they made it clear they would bend no further. He was staring down the barrel of an economic trade war and a hostility previously unseen. The temperature has warmed, for now. For how long is the next question for the mercurial president. How did we get here? The US president had said on Sunday he will charge a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent from some countries - including the UK and European allies - to the US. It came after his threats to take Greenland prompted a furious response from leaders on the continent and in London, even uniting Sir Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage in their opposition. Speaking ahead of Mr Trump's U-turn, Sir Keir said at PMQs he would \"not yield\" in his stance over Greenland, the future of which is a matter for Denmark and Greenlanders. He will host the Danish prime minister in Downing Street later today. Read more from Sky News:Is new world 'without rules' emerging?Why is Ryanair fighting with Elon Musk? Mr Trump's threats appeared on the verge of rupturing NATO, which was founded by leading European nations, the US, and Canada to counter the Soviet Union. The alliance's other members were steadfast in saying Greenland is not for sale and cannot be wrested from Denmark, while angrily rejecting Mr Trump's promised tariffs. Thursday's EU summit, which is being held ​in Brussels, was organised prior to Mr Trump's climbdown and would have seen leaders discuss possible retaliation to the now cancelled tariffs. Mr Trump himself is still in Davos this morning, where he will attend a signing ceremony for his Board of Peace, which aims to resolve global conflicts, proposed last September when he announced his plan to end the Gaza war. He will then meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war in Ukraine, as drone and missile attacks on Kyiv continue."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @TimJ_B\n The House of Lords has backed a ban on under-16s using social media. Peers passed an amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which is currently making its way through parliament. Lords debate as it happened - politics latest The amendment says within 12 months of the act passing, social media sites must be required to use \"highly effective\" age checks to make sure no under-16s can become users. With peers having backed the ban, the government will have the chance to overturn it in the Commons - but that's looking increasingly tricky. The prime minister was initially opposed to such an outright ban, but pressure from opposition parties and his own backbenchers has softened his government's position. One Labour MP told Sky's political reporter Faye Brown there was \"no way\" the government could whip the Parliamentary Labour Party against it, which could trigger another welfare-style rebellion. Earlier this week, the government announced it was consulting on a ban for under-16s, with the block imposed by Australia potentially acting as inspiration. Since that ban came into force in December, it has felt like the UK government has been moving to a similar policy. But waiting for the three-month consultation to conclude may not be an option after Wednesday night's vote. Peer after peer - and parent after parent - spoke of the risks and harms they felt were implicit in children using social media. Some shared tips on how they limit their children's usage, others cited studies regarding the health impact.

It will be a test of parliamentary management for the prime minister - who has already been portrayed as weak to his backbenchers following that welfare rebellion - if he takes them on and loses. But it seems almost certain a ban will be coming in some shape or form. A government spokesperson said: \"We will take action to give children a healthier relationship with mobile phones and social media. \"It is important we get this right, which is why we have launched a consultation and will work with experts, parents and young people to ensure we take the best approach, based on evidence.\""

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Prince Harry became emotional as he finished an intense day of evidence against the publisher of the Daily Mail - telling the High Court his wife Meghan's life had been made an \"absolute misery\". The Duke of Sussex spent about two hours being cross-examined by Associated Newspapers Limited's lawyer, at times appearing visibly frustrated with the line of questioning. He told the court the idea that he has no right to privacy is \"disgusting\" and it was \"fundamentally wrong to put us through this again when all we wanted was an apology and accountability\". Harry, 41, has brought legal action against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over alleged unlawful information gathering between 1993 and 2011, alongside fellow claimants Baroness Doreen Lawrence, politician Sir Simon Hughes, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley, and Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish. ANL strongly denies the claims and also says they have been brought too late. After two days of opening statements from the lawyers for both parties, Harry became the first witness to give evidence on Wednesday. He told the court: \"I have never believed that my life is open season to be commercialised by these people.\" It was right at the end of his evidence, as he mentioned Meghan, that he became emotional. \"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife's life an absolute misery, my Lord,\" he said, his voice faltering. The Duchess of Sussex sued ANL and won in 2021 after The Mail on Sunday published parts of a \"personal and private\" letter to her father, Thomas Markle. In Harry's written witness statement, which was released on Tuesday, he told of the \"uneasy relationship\" he had had with the press ever since the death of his mother, Diana, when he was just 12 years old. He said that when his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, he started to become \"increasingly troubled by the approach of not taking action against the press\" in the wake of \"vicious, persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles\". Harry is relying on 14 articles in his case against ANL. During his exchanges in court with Anthony White, the lawyer representing ANL, it was clear Harry was frustrated with some of the points being made and told the court he wanted to get his point across. A couple of times during the hearing, Judge Nicklin politely reminded the duke he did not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today\", but simply had to answer questions put to him; however, Harry told him he had had a \"bad experience\" previously. During his questioning, he denied having \"leaky\" social circles and said his life had been \"commercialised\" since he was a teenager, with the press\"delving into every aspect of my private life\". Read more:The latest updates from courtAnalysis: Harry's biggest case against the press He also told the court he could not have complained about what he felt was press intrusion when he was an active member of the Royal Family, due to the \"institution\" he was in, and also because there were \"thousands\" of articles written about him. \"If you complain, they double down on you, in my experience,\" he said. In a statement shared after the hearing, Prince Harry said: \"Today we reminded the Mail Group who is on trial and why.\" In court on Tuesday, Mr White described the case as \"threadbare\" and said that journalists would show how they sourced articles legitimately. In written submissions, the lawyer said the publisher \"strongly denies\" that there was any unlawful information gathering, including voicemail interception, directed at the duke. The trial continues - with Hurley expected to give evidence tomorrow."

        "Content": "\n          North of England correspondent\n              @kvittozzi\n It's a brutal crime that's haunted the streets of Merseyside for decades.  In 1986, Diane Sindall, 21, was raped and murdered by a killer dubbed the \"Beast of Birkenhead\". The florist had just finished working a late shift at a pub. It was a part-time job that she had only taken on to make some money ahead of her upcoming wedding. But on her way home, Diane's blue Fiat minivan ran out of petrol. She got out and started to walk. Then, she was raped and savagely beaten to death. Her body was found in an alleyway the next day. For decades, investigators from Merseyside Police thought they had caught her killer: a local man called Peter Sullivan, then aged 30. Mr Sullivan had always maintained his innocence. But last year, Mr Sullivan, now 68, was released after new tests showed his DNA was not present in semen samples collected at the scene. By the point that his conviction was overturned, Mr Sullivan had spent 38 years in prison. It is the longest miscarriage of justice in UK history. Why there's renewed hope of a breakthrough Now, Merseyside Police are searching once more for the person who killed Diane and working with Crimestoppers to offer a £20,000 reward for any information that would lead to an arrest and conviction. \"Back in 1986, a sample was recovered from Diane at the crime scene,\" explains Detective Superintendent Rachel Wilson from Merseyside Police. \"Now we've got the benefit of the enhancements in the DNA work, and we've identified a profile of a man from that sample.\" DSI Wilson says this has become the \"key line of inquiry\" for the force. \"We need to identify who this DNA profile belongs to,\" she says.

        "Content": "The use of medication to treat Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has risen sharply in the UK, largely due to growing prescription rates among adults - particularly women. New research shows the proportion of people taking ADHD drugs has tripled over the past decade, increasing from 0.12% in 2010 to 0.39% in 2023. The increase was most striking among people over 25, rising from just 0.01% in 2010 to around 0.2% in 2023. Academics from the University of Oxford said this amounts to more than a 20-fold increase among women and a 15-fold rise among men in this age group. Researchers analysed ADHD prescription rates in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK - using data from nearly 200,000 people, including more than 31,000 in the UK. The authors wrote in The Lancet journal: \"We observed a dramatic rise in ADHD medication use among adults, especially among females. \"Among adults aged over 18, there was a two to 15-fold increase in prevalence of use during the study period, with the most pronounced increases observed in females, especially in the UK. \"The increase in both prevalence and incidence use among adults reflects the increased awareness of adult ADHD, especially among females.\" Read more from Sky News:Why are more adults being diagnosed with ADHD?Soaring demand for mental health, ADHD to be reviewed The authors also found that in the UK and Spain, over 70% of people over 25 had previously used antidepressants. The researchers said the UK recorded the largest relative rise among the countries examined, with growth also seen among children aged three to 11 and teenagers. Methylphenidate - sold under brand names including Ritalin, Concerta, Delmosart, Equasym and Medikinet - was the most widely prescribed ADHD medication across all five countries. The researchers also highlighted a worldwide shortage of ADHD meds since September 2023, noting that better insight into prescribing trends could help forecast demand, enable faster responses, and reduce the risk of shortages. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said last December he had commissioned an independent review into the growing demand for mental health, ADHD and autism services, which will examine diagnosis rates and the support available to patients."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was billed as an emergency meeting of Tory MPs after a trio of defections to Reform UK, but judging by the noise that greeted Kemi Badenoch it could have been a victory rally. When the Tory leader entered parliament's committee room 14 for what could have been an awkward showdown with her backbenchers, the loud banging of desks and cheering lasted 25 seconds. Cynics will say that the ritual of banging desks for Tory leaders at 1922 Committee meetings is purely for the benefit of journalists in the corridor. And if that's true, the whips had done their job. But her MPs liked what they heard in her speech. The Conservative Party would not be moving to the left after the defections and would always be a party of the right, she declared. The tone of her speech, coming after the defections of Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell, was clearly designed to reassure those Conservative MPs who backed Mr Jenrick in the Tory leadership election. And speaking to Sky News as she left the meeting, she re-opened her battle with Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, insisting: \"He's right on Greenland and wrong on Chagos.\" And attacking Nigel Farage's backing in Davos for \"a strong America in Greenland\", she told Sky News: \"People can see the difference between populism and Conservatism.\" An olive branch to Jenrick supporters? Earlier, one of the first to arrive at the '22 meeting had been the new Tory peer Sharron Davies, the Olympic swimming silver medallist and women's campaigner, who only took her seat in the Lords the previous day. And as Ms Badenoch rose to speak, she immediately dived into Mr Jenrick's defection, admitting it had left a big gap in the shadow cabinet and acknowledging he did a \"fabulous job\" as shadow justice secretary. Despite describing sacking him ahead of his defection last week as \"spring cleaning\", here was a Tory leader now clearly accepting that her defeated leadership rival had strong support among MPs on the right of the party. She claimed, not surprisingly, that Mr Jenrick's resignation was based \"not on ideology, but personal ambition\", something that all her MPs would undoubtedly agree with. Read more from Sky News:All ex-Tory MPs who've joined Reform 'Britain not broken beyond repair' But the Tory leader also claimed an \"unholy alliance of Reform and some of the left of our party are undermining what we want to do\". And she told her MPs: \"We are not moving leftwards, we are the party of the right and will always be a party of the right.\" She said the Conservative Party \"remains the best vehicle to deliver proper Conservatism\" and defended her claim that Britain is not broken, on which she clashed with Mr Jenrick before his defection. \"There is a lot to fix in this country,\" she said. \"A lot of stuff isn't working, a lot is broken, but the whole country isn't broken beyond repair.\" This emergency meeting was called as the Tory leader fired off a defiant letter to her MPs on Monday following the latest defection to Reform UK, by Mr Rosindell. \"Differences of opinion are part of a healthy party,\" she wrote. \"But there is a clear line between disagreement and trying to damage the party from within. \"Those who cannot be part of a Conservative Party that is changing in this way are free to make other choices. \"Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly. \"There will be no hard feelings about that as they will create space for those who share our values and purpose.\" In other words, if you're going to defect, go now. But on the evidence of the noisy show of support at this meeting, the bulk of her MPs are backing her. For now, anyway."

        "Content": "US troops have transferred 150 Islamic State (IS) prisoners from Syria to Iraq under plans that could see 7,000 detainees moved across the border. The new Syrian government under President Ahmed al Sharaa has been trying to reassert its control over the whole country, leading to clashes with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia which held the nation's northeast. But the withdrawal of SDF troops has sparked uncertainty over the security of roughly a dozen prisons and detention camps they were guarding, with IS prisoners among those detained. American officials said on Tuesday that roughly 200 low-level IS fighters escaped Syria's Shaddadi prison, but government forces had recaptured many ​of them.  More than 10,000 IS members are being held in Syrian prisons, along with thousands more women and children with ties to the group. Now US forces have moved 150 prisoners held at a detention facility ‍in Hasakah, Syria, to a secure location in Iraq, the US military said in a statement. Up to 7,000 IS detainees could ultimately be transferred from Syria to Iraqi-controlled facilities, the statement ‌added. The head of US forces in the ​Middle East, Admiral Brad Cooper, said the scheme had been worked out in agreement with the Iraqi government. \"We are closely coordinating with regional partners, including the Iraqi government, and we sincerely appreciate their role ‌in ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS,\" he said. Later on Monday, US Central Command said Mr Cooper had spoken with the Syrian president. In the call, he told Mr Sharaa of his \"expectations for Syrian forces as well as all other forces to avoid any actions that could interfere\". On Tuesday, the Syrian government announced a ceasefire with the SDF after seizing swathes of its territory in the northeast. It gave the SDF four ‌days to agree to integrate into the Syrian state - a deal which the US urged it to accept. The SDF long enjoyed the backing of the US as a bulwark against IS forces in Syria, but that support appears to have fallen away with the rise of a new Syrian government.

She also had washing up liquid squirted down her throat, bleach splashed on her face, and her head repeatedly shaved against her will.  Trapped in a 'prison cell' The home in the Priors Park area was overcrowded and dirty, with plaster hanging off the mouldy walls, and rubbish strewn across the back garden. The woman lived off scraps, and despite the grim conditions, was not allowed to leave, nor even to wash, doing so secretly at night. Police said the woman's benefits had also been paid into Wixon's bank account from the late 1990s, with her receiving a \"considerable sum\" of money over the years. Officers were tipped off about the woman's situation by one of Wixon's sons, and went to the house in March 2021. They described the woman's bedroom as looking like a \"prison cell\", with the other bedrooms also untidy and dirty. She told police: \"I don't want to be here. I don't feel safe. Mandy hits me all the time. I don't like it. \"I haven't washed for years. She doesn't let me.\" 'All skin and bone' Like others in the house, including her tormentor, the woman had lost many of her teeth due to poor dental hygiene. Her lips and face were scarred, and she had large calluses on her feet and ankles from time spent on her hands and knees cleaning floors. One former neighbour, Kiran Atwal, remembered seeing the victim as a child, but had not seen her for 10 years, and was unaware she still lived there. Another described the woman as \"looking like something out of a concentration camp\", while a third neighbour said she was all \"skin and bone\" with a shaved head. Disappeared into a 'black hole' Sam Jones, prosecuting, told Gloucester Crown Court: \"She was kept in and prevented from leaving the address. \"She was assaulted and hit many, many times and forced to work with threats of violence. \"She had been denied food and the ability to wash over many years.\" Social services were involved with the family in the late 1990s, the jury heard, but there were no records of any contact since. There were no medical or dental records for the woman, and she had not seen a doctor in two decades. \"The fact remains that nothing was done by social services,\" Mr Jones said. \"The lack of records from the hospital, the doctor and the dentist, or any involvement with social services for 20 years provides further support of her never being allowed to leave the house.\" \"By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole. Not a single meeting that left a record or a single sighting of her outside the house,\" he added. Wixon denied a charge of false imprisonment, two of requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, and four of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A jury acquitted her of one assault charge but found her guilty of the others. Abuse or neglect Wixon blamed an estranged son for suggesting things to the woman. Edward Hollingsworth, defending, said the case against his client was a \"tale of fantasy and lies\" and called the woman's allegations a \"child-like fantasy\". Read more:More British people than ever trapped in modern slaveryModern slavery helpline receives record number of calls He said the defendant's life was \"much more complicated and nuanced\" than alleged, and the case was one of neglect rather than abuse. He argued the whole family lived in squalor and that the bedrooms of Wixon's own children were equally as bad. \"Her other children were not vaccinated, not attending school, and had rotting teeth and head lice,\" he said. Judge Ian Lawrie KC said there was a \"Dickensian quality\" to the story after the victim left her own \"dysfunctional family\". The victim now lives with a foster family, attends college and has been on holidays abroad. But her ordeal has left her with nightmares, and a compulsion to clean constantly. Wixon was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 March."

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Prince Harry became emotional as he finished an intense day of evidence against the publisher of the Daily Mail - telling the High Court his wife Meghan's life had been made an \"absolute misery\". The Duke of Sussex spent about two hours being cross-examined by Associated Newspapers Limited's lawyer, at times appearing visibly frustrated with the line of questioning. He told the court the idea that he has no right to privacy is \"disgusting\" and it was \"fundamentally wrong to put us through this again when all we wanted was an apology and accountability\". Harry, 41, has brought legal action against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over alleged unlawful information gathering between 1993 and 2011, alongside fellow claimants Baroness Doreen Lawrence, politician Sir Simon Hughes, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley, and Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish. ANL strongly denies the claims and also says they have been brought too late. After two days of opening statements from the lawyers for both parties, Harry became the first witness to give evidence on Wednesday. He told the court: \"I have never believed that my life is open season to be commercialised by these people.\" It was right at the end of his evidence, as he mentioned Meghan, that he became emotional. \"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife's life an absolute misery, my Lord,\" he said, his voice faltering. The Duchess of Sussex sued ANL and won in 2021 after The Mail on Sunday published parts of a \"personal and private\" letter to her father, Thomas Markle. In Harry's written witness statement, which was released on Tuesday, he told of the \"uneasy relationship\" he had had with the press ever since the death of his mother, Diana, when he was just 12 years old. He said that when his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, he started to become \"increasingly troubled by the approach of not taking action against the press\" in the wake of \"vicious, persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles\". Harry is relying on 14 articles in his case against ANL. During his exchanges in court with Anthony White, the lawyer representing ANL, it was clear Harry was frustrated with some of the points being made and told the court he wanted to get his point across. A couple of times during the hearing, Judge Nicklin politely reminded the duke he did not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today\", but simply had to answer questions put to him; however, Harry told him he had had a \"bad experience\" previously. During his questioning, he denied having \"leaky\" social circles and said his life had been \"commercialised\" since he was a teenager, with the press\"delving into every aspect of my private life\". Read more:The latest updates from courtAnalysis: Harry's biggest case against the press He also told the court he could not have complained about what he felt was press intrusion when he was an active member of the Royal Family, due to the \"institution\" he was in, and also because there were \"thousands\" of articles written about him. \"If you complain, they double down on you, in my experience,\" he said. In a statement shared after the hearing, Prince Harry said: \"Today we reminded the Mail Group who is on trial and why.\" In court on Tuesday, Mr White described the case as \"threadbare\" and said that journalists would show how they sourced articles legitimately. In written submissions, the lawyer said the publisher \"strongly denies\" that there was any unlawful information gathering, including voicemail interception, directed at the duke. The trial continues - with Hurley expected to give evidence tomorrow."

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n This was billed as a huge day for Prince Harry, the emotional enormity of it all immediately clear as he gave his evidence, from his visible frustration to his audible final moment of upset. Since he left the Royal Family we've heard a lot from him about his feelings about the press and, importantly, his personal crusade to hold the tabloids to account. But this was finally his time to confront in court the publishers of the Daily Mail, \"the most influential newspaper\" as he described them in his witness statement. In the end, we were all surprised to see that he was only questioned for two and a half hours, a fraction of the time he was in the witness box for his case against the Mirror group, when he faced more than a day of questioning. The barrister for Associated Newspapers only asked him about two of the 14 articles that make up the case, both aimed at landing their point that the sources of the stories were his own friends, legitimate sources or from within the palace. They are adamant that unlawful methods weren't used.

Clearly getting annoyed that he wasn't allowed to land the points he wanted to make, he tried to steer proceedings on to the emotional toll it has taken on him and the other claimants, only for the judge to gently steer him back to answering the questions put to him, saying his barrister would do the rest of the work in the coming weeks. There was also his written statement, including a more detailed explanation of how he was unable to fight this before because of the \"never complain, never explain\" mentality of palace life. It also contained a wider explanation of why he feels it is his duty to pursue this. A 'public duty' to take action Describing the \"social element\" of his fight, he says it is \"of national concern that these organisations believe they own people's privacy. That they've turned what should be none of their business into very much their business\". He said it was \"part of the concept of public duty, which I genuinely believe is one of the most important roles that I have to perform, and something which my mother instilled in me\". In the final moments, his voice cracked as he said: \"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife's life a misery\".

        "Content": "The use of medication to treat Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has risen sharply in the UK, largely due to growing prescription rates among adults - particularly women. New research shows the proportion of people taking ADHD drugs has tripled over the past decade, increasing from 0.12% in 2010 to 0.39% in 2023. The increase was most striking among people over 25, rising from just 0.01% in 2010 to around 0.2% in 2023. Academics from the University of Oxford said this amounts to more than a 20-fold increase among women and a 15-fold rise among men in this age group. Researchers analysed ADHD prescription rates in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK - using data from nearly 200,000 people, including more than 31,000 in the UK. The authors wrote in The Lancet journal: \"We observed a dramatic rise in ADHD medication use among adults, especially among females. \"Among adults aged over 18, there was a two to 15-fold increase in prevalence of use during the study period, with the most pronounced increases observed in females, especially in the UK. \"The increase in both prevalence and incidence use among adults reflects the increased awareness of adult ADHD, especially among females.\" Read more from Sky News:Why are more adults being diagnosed with ADHD?Soaring demand for mental health, ADHD to be reviewed The authors also found that in the UK and Spain, over 70% of people over 25 had previously used antidepressants. The researchers said the UK recorded the largest relative rise among the countries examined, with growth also seen among children aged three to 11 and teenagers. Methylphenidate - sold under brand names including Ritalin, Concerta, Delmosart, Equasym and Medikinet - was the most widely prescribed ADHD medication across all five countries. The researchers also highlighted a worldwide shortage of ADHD meds since September 2023, noting that better insight into prescribing trends could help forecast demand, enable faster responses, and reduce the risk of shortages. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said last December he had commissioned an independent review into the growing demand for mental health, ADHD and autism services, which will examine diagnosis rates and the support available to patients."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @TimJ_B\n The House of Lords has backed a ban on under-16s using social media. Peers passed an amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which is currently making its way through parliament. Lords debate as it happened - politics latest The amendment says within 12 months of the act passing, social media sites must be required to use \"highly effective\" age checks to make sure no under-16s can become users. With peers having backed the ban, the government will have the chance to overturn it in the Commons - but that's looking increasingly tricky. The prime minister was initially opposed to such an outright ban, but pressure from opposition parties and his own backbenchers has softened his government's position. One Labour MP told Sky's political reporter Faye Brown there was \"no way\" the government could whip the Parliamentary Labour Party against it, which could trigger another welfare-style rebellion. Earlier this week, the government announced it was consulting on a ban for under-16s, with the block imposed by Australia potentially acting as inspiration. Since that ban came into force in December, it has felt like the UK government has been moving to a similar policy. But waiting for the three-month consultation to conclude may not be an option after Wednesday night's vote. Peer after peer - and parent after parent - spoke of the risks and harms they felt were implicit in children using social media. Some shared tips on how they limit their children's usage, others cited studies regarding the health impact.

It will be a test of parliamentary management for the prime minister - who has already been portrayed as weak to his backbenchers following that welfare rebellion - if he takes them on and loses. But it seems almost certain a ban will be coming in some shape or form. A government spokesperson said: \"We will take action to give children a healthier relationship with mobile phones and social media. \"It is important we get this right, which is why we have launched a consultation and will work with experts, parents and young people to ensure we take the best approach, based on evidence.\""

The florist had just finished working a late shift at a pub. It was a part-time job that she had only taken on to make some money ahead of her upcoming wedding. But on her way home, Diane's blue Fiat minivan ran out of petrol. She got out and started to walk. Then, she was raped and savagely beaten to death. Her body was found in an alleyway the next day. For decades, investigators from Merseyside Police thought they had caught her killer: a local man called Peter Sullivan, then aged 30. Mr Sullivan had always maintained his innocence. But last year, Mr Sullivan, now 68, was released after new tests showed his DNA was not present in semen samples collected at the scene. By the point that his conviction was overturned, Mr Sullivan had spent 38 years in prison. It is the longest miscarriage of justice in UK history. Why there's renewed hope of a breakthrough Now, Merseyside Police are searching once more for the person who killed Diane and working with Crimestoppers to offer a £20,000 reward for any information that would lead to an arrest and conviction. \"Back in 1986, a sample was recovered from Diane at the crime scene,\" explains Detective Superintendent Rachel Wilson from Merseyside Police. \"Now we've got the benefit of the enhancements in the DNA work, and we've identified a profile of a man from that sample.\" DSI Wilson says this has become the \"key line of inquiry\" for the force. \"We need to identify who this DNA profile belongs to,\" she says.

        "Content": "The death of a baby girl has prompted a warning over the use of doulas during births after one had \"negatively impacted\" midwives. Henry Charles, assistant coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton, issued a prevention of future deaths report after an inquest last month into the death of Matilda Pomfret-Thomas. Her parents had chosen to hire a doula as part of plans for a home birth, having previously experienced a traumatic hospital delivery with their first child. Doulas are non-medical support workers who are not regulated, and are employed by some families to provide emotional and practical help during pregnancy and labour.  Their role remains controversial, with supporters saying doulas offer valuable support to women, while critics - including some medical professionals - warn they may increase risks for mothers and babies. In this case, Matilda died on 13 November 2023 at 15 days old after suffering neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), a form of brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen before or during birth. Mr Charles said Matilda developed HIE over a period of hours during labour at home and the presence of the doula did \"negatively impact\" midwives being able to provide advice to the mother and usual care. He said meconium - a baby’s first bowel movement that can indicate distress - had been detected. Midwives attending the home birth also noted decelerations, which are drops in the baby’s heart rate. \"An initial and appropriate offer at 7.19am of transfer to hospital upon meconium being found was not accepted, thereafter the implications of a deteriorating situation involving decelerations against a background of the presence of meconium - including further clear signs of it at 10am, requiring hospital transfer, was not communicated in such a way as to lead to a transfer to hospital,\" said Mr Charles. Despite these warning signs, the mother was not transferred to hospital until 12.13pm, where the baby was eventually delivered. \"The background is of a traumatic first birth that impacted upon decision making for this second pregnancy and birth,\" Mr Charles wrote in his report. \"Matilda's parents had seen a home birth as the best way forward.\" He added: \"An element of what occurred is that the presence and work of a doula did on this occasion negatively impact upon the effective provision of midwifery services in terms of building a rapport conducive to effective advice and care being given.\" Read more from Sky News:Five charged with murder after petrol station crashEmotional Harry tells court press made wife's life a 'misery' The coroner said Doula UK \"is the largest representative body for doulas, but it is not a regulatory body, it does not represent all doulas, indeed many doulas are not members of Doula UK.\" Mr Charles said doulas \"have been increasingly used and increasingly offer services - as here - on a paid basis\". The Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (MNSI) body, which examines safety incidents in NHS maternity care, said there were problems in how doulas and midwives work together. The coroner said MNSI identified 12 cases where \"doulas worked outside of the defined boundaries of their role and in which the care or advice provided by the doula was considered to have potentially had an influence on the poor outcome for the family\". In his report sent to the Department of Health, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, Doula UK and others, he said concerns over doula registration, regulation and training should be reviewed. A spokesperson for Doula UK has said: \"We take the implications of the coroner's report extremely seriously. \"We have policies and practices in place to protect members and the families they support to ensure doulas remain within the scope of their practice and, in light of the report, we will be taking steps to review and strengthen our policies.\""

Officers were tipped off about the woman's situation by one of Wixon's sons, and went to the house in March 2021.

There were no medical or dental records for the woman, and she had not seen a doctor in two decades. \"The fact remains that nothing was done by social services,\" Mr Jones said. \"The lack of records from the hospital, the doctor and the dentist, or any involvement with social services for 20 years provides further support of her never being allowed to leave the house.\" \"By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole.

Wixon denied a charge of false imprisonment, two of requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, and four of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. A jury acquitted her of one assault charge but found her guilty of the others. Abuse or neglect Wixon blamed an estranged son for suggesting things to the woman. Edward Hollingsworth, defending, said the case against his client was a \"tale of fantasy and lies\" and called the woman's allegations a \"child-like fantasy\". Read more:More British people than ever trapped in modern slaveryModern slavery helpline receives record number of calls He said the defendant's life was \"much more complicated and nuanced\" than alleged, and the case was one of neglect rather than abuse. He argued the whole family lived in squalor and that the bedrooms of Wixon's own children were equally as bad. \"Her other children were not vaccinated, not attending school, and had rotting teeth and head lice,\" he said. Judge Ian Lawrie KC said there was a \"Dickensian quality\" to the story after the victim left her own \"dysfunctional family\". The victim now lives with a foster family, attends college and has been on holidays abroad. But her ordeal has left her with nightmares, and a compulsion to clean constantly. Wixon was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 March."

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was billed as an emergency meeting of Tory MPs after a trio of defections to Reform UK, but judging by the noise that greeted Kemi Badenoch it could have been a victory rally. When the Tory leader entered parliament's committee room 14 for what could have been an awkward showdown with her backbenchers, the loud banging of desks and cheering lasted 25 seconds. Cynics will say that the ritual of banging desks for Tory leaders at 1922 Committee meetings is purely for the benefit of journalists in the corridor. And if that's true, the whips had done their job. But her MPs liked what they heard in her speech. The Conservative Party would not be moving to the left after the defections and would always be a party of the right, she declared. The tone of her speech, coming after the defections of Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell, was clearly designed to reassure those Conservative MPs who backed Mr Jenrick in the Tory leadership election. And speaking to Sky News as she left the meeting, she re-opened her battle with Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, insisting: \"He's right on Greenland and wrong on Chagos.\" And attacking Nigel Farage's backing in Davos for \"a strong America in Greenland\", she told Sky News: \"People can see the difference between populism and Conservatism.\" An olive branch to Jenrick supporters? Earlier, one of the first to arrive at the '22 meeting had been the new Tory peer Sharron Davies, the Olympic swimming silver medallist and women's campaigner, who only took her seat in the Lords the previous day. And as Ms Badenoch rose to speak, she immediately dived into Mr Jenrick's defection, admitting it had left a big gap in the shadow cabinet and acknowledging he did a \"fabulous job\" as shadow justice secretary. Despite describing sacking him ahead of his defection last week as \"spring cleaning\", here was a Tory leader now clearly accepting that her defeated leadership rival had strong support among MPs on the right of the party. She claimed, not surprisingly, that Mr Jenrick's resignation was based \"not on ideology, but personal ambition\", something that all her MPs would undoubtedly agree with. Read more from Sky News:All ex-Tory MPs who've joined Reform 'Britain not broken beyond repair' But the Tory leader also claimed an \"unholy alliance of Reform and some of the left of our party are undermining what we want to do\". And she told her MPs: \"We are not moving leftwards, we are the party of the right and will always be a party of the right.\" She said the Conservative Party \"remains the best vehicle to deliver proper Conservatism\" and defended her claim that Britain is not broken, on which she clashed with Mr Jenrick before his defection. \"There is a lot to fix in this country,\" she said. \"A lot of stuff isn't working, a lot is broken, but the whole country isn't broken beyond repair.\" This emergency meeting was called as the Tory leader fired off a defiant letter to her MPs on Monday following the latest defection to Reform UK, by Mr Rosindell. \"Differences of opinion are part of a healthy party,\" she wrote. \"But there is a clear line between disagreement and trying to damage the party from within. \"Those who cannot be part of a Conservative Party that is changing in this way are free to make other choices. \"Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly. \"There will be no hard feelings about that as they will create space for those who share our values and purpose.\" In other words, if you're going to defect, go now. But on the evidence of the noisy show of support at this meeting, the bulk of her MPs are backing her. For now, anyway."

Trump's climbdown as it happened Mr Trump said he won't impose the 10% tariffs threatened on eight European nations, including the UK, over their opposition to his proposed takeover of the Arctic territory, following a \"very productive\" meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte. Posting on Truth Social, Mr Trump said they had formed the framework of a future deal with regard to Greenland and the \"entire Arctic region\", saying the \"solution\" will be great for the US and all NATO countries. The US president said \"everybody's very happy\" with the \"ultimate long-term deal\" - and it \"gives us everything we needed to get\". He added he had spoken with other European leaders about it, but nothing had yet been signed and details have not been forthcoming. He also declared the US \"won't use force\" to take Greenland, but added his military would be \"unstoppable\" in that scenario. US correspondent The expansive ambitions for Greenland that put Trump in conflict with NATO allies, politically at least, disappeared following a meeting with the man who calls him \"Daddy\". Did NATO chief Rutte crack the code?  If he turned him round in a meeting over nibbles on the sidelines at Davos, he truly is the \"Trump Whisperer\". An alternative theory would be Trump came to realise he needed an off-ramp on Greenland, that his territorial ambitions provoked a resistance amongst old allies that he hadn't foreseen and couldn't fight. NATO countries had complied with Trump on increasing their contributions to the alliance. They have bent the knee to the unpredictable, erratic president but on Greenland, they made it clear they would bend no further. He was staring down the barrel of an economic trade war and a hostility previously unseen. The temperature has warmed, for now. For how long is the next question for the mercurial president. How did we get here? The US president had said on Sunday he will charge a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent from some countries - including the UK and European allies - to the US. It came after his threats to take Greenland prompted a furious response from leaders on the continent and in London, even uniting Sir Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage in their opposition. Speaking ahead of Mr Trump's U-turn, Sir Keir said at PMQs he would \"not yield\" in his stance over Greenland, the future of which is a matter for Denmark and Greenlanders. He will host the Danish prime minister in Downing Street later today. Read more from Sky News:Is new world 'without rules' emerging?Why is Ryanair fighting with Elon Musk? Mr Trump's threats appeared on the verge of rupturing NATO, which was founded by leading European nations, the US, and Canada to counter the Soviet Union. The alliance's other members were steadfast in saying Greenland is not for sale and cannot be wrested from Denmark, while angrily rejecting Mr Trump's promised tariffs. Thursday's EU summit, which is being held ​in Brussels, was organised prior to Mr Trump's climbdown and would have seen leaders discuss possible retaliation to the now cancelled tariffs. Mr Trump himself is still in Davos this morning, where he will attend a signing ceremony for his Board of Peace, which aims to resolve global conflicts, proposed last September when he announced his plan to end the Gaza war. He will then meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war in Ukraine, as drone and missile attacks on Kyiv continue."

        "Content": "US troops have transferred 150 Islamic State (IS) prisoners from Syria to Iraq under plans that could see 7,000 detainees moved across the border. The new Syrian government under President Ahmed al Sharaa has been trying to reassert its control over the whole country, leading to clashes with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia which held the nation's northeast. But the withdrawal of SDF troops has sparked uncertainty over the security of roughly a dozen prisons and detention camps they were guarding, with IS prisoners among those detained. American officials said on Tuesday that roughly 200 low-level IS fighters escaped Syria's Shaddadi prison, but government forces had recaptured many ​of them.  More than 10,000 IS members are being held in Syrian prisons, along with thousands more women and children with ties to the group. Now US forces have moved 150 prisoners held at a detention facility ‍in Hasakah, Syria, to a secure location in Iraq, the US military said in a statement. Up to 7,000 IS detainees could ultimately be transferred from Syria to Iraqi-controlled facilities, the statement ‌added. The head of US forces in the ​Middle East, Admiral Brad Cooper, said the scheme had been worked out in agreement with the Iraqi government. \"We are closely coordinating with regional partners, including the Iraqi government, and we sincerely appreciate their role ‌in ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS,\" he said. Later on Monday, US Central Command said Mr Cooper had spoken with the Syrian president. In the call, he told Mr Sharaa of his \"expectations for Syrian forces as well as all other forces to avoid any actions that could interfere\". On Tuesday, the Syrian government announced a ceasefire with the SDF after seizing swathes of its territory in the northeast. It gave the SDF four ‌days to agree to integrate into the Syrian state - a deal which the US urged it to accept. The SDF long enjoyed the backing of the US as a bulwark against IS forces in Syria, but that support appears to have fallen away with the rise of a new Syrian government.

He added: \"Recent developments show the US actively facilitating this transition, rather than prolonging a separate SDF role.\" The new Syrian government was formed after the dictatorial regime of Bashar al Assad was ousted by rebels 13 months ago."

        "Content": "The world order is in the \"midst of a rupture\", leaders have warned - telling how international law is being \"trampled underfoot\" and \"imperial ambitions are resurfacing\". The row over US President Donald Trump's desire to annex Greenland, and his ongoing rhetoric, along with his threats to impose tariffs, is dominating the agenda at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. There is also concern across Latin America with Trump's efforts to seize Venezuela's oil. In Davos, the American leader said: \"I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it's not heading in the right direction.\" And in reference to Greenland, he said: \"This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America. That's our territory.\" But world leaders believe \"rules-based order is fading\" and there's a shift to a new era \"without rules\". Davos latest - US says it won't use force over Greenland 'A rupture, not a transition' Canadian Prime Minister ​Mark Carney headed home from Davos without meeting Trump - and said the world is \"in the midst of a rupture, not a transition\". He added: \"Every day we're reminded that we live in an era of great-power rivalry. \"That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.\" He warned the \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu\". \"There is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along,\" he said. \"To accommodate. To avoid trouble. To hope that compliance will buy safety. It won't. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.\" 'Imperial ambitions are resurfacing' French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"It's a shift towards a world without rules. \"Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing.\" He denounced competition from the US \"through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions\". Such moves \"openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe\", said Mr Macron, and when combined with an \"endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable\", they are used as \"leverage against territorial sovereignty\". 'Time to build a new Europe' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was time to \"build a new independent Europe\" and any diplomatic \"downward spiral\" in the West would only embolden its adversaries. \"The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies,\" she said. \"My point is: if this change is permanent, then Europe must change permanently too. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe. \"We consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends. \"And plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape.\" In a speech in the European Parliament, she added: \"We are at a crossroads. Europe prefers dialogue and solutions - but we are fully prepared to act, if necessary, with unity, urgency and determination. \"In this increasingly lawless world, Europe needs its own levers of power.\" 'Say no and we'll remember' The US president said the US \"won't use force\" to take Greenland, calling instead for \"immediate negotiations\". He said: \"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force,\" Mr Trump said. \"We would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that.\" He then addresses Denmark and Europe directly. \"They have a choice - you can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.\" Trump then reiterates that \"a strong and secure America means a strong NATO\"."

        "Content": "Elon Musk has said he could buy Ryanair amid an ongoing public spat with the budget airline's boss Michael O'Leary.  The two have clashed numerous times over the past few days, resulting in Mr Musk asking his X followers if he should buy Ryanair and \"restore Ryan as their rightful ruler\". Ryanair responded by announcing a \"big idiot seat sale\", which it says is for the billionaire tech mogul and any other \"idiots\" on Mr Musk's social media platform. Here is everything you need to know about why the two outspoken chief executives are trading insults, from what has been said to why it began in the first place. What is the row about? The spat appears to have stemmed from Mr O'Leary ruling out equipping Ryanair jets with Mr Musk's Starlink satellite internet service, after rivals Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS announced a deal to install Starlink on its aircraft. In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on 16 January, Mr O'Leary said he would not install the technology because he believed that passengers on Ryanair's short-haul flights would \"not be willing to pay\" to use it. He added it would cost the company about €200-250m per-year to use the tech and add 1-2% to their fuel bill due to the two aerials required on each flight, which would impact the aerodynamics of the aircraft. He told the radio station he would \"pay no attention whatsoever\" to Mr Musk, labelling him an \"idiot\". \"Musk knows even less about airline ownership rules than he does about aircraft aerodynamics,\" he said. Read more:How Musk is boosting the British rightMusk's race for space What has happened since? The Ryanair X account - which is known for its posts which mock criticisms of the airline and weighs in on current events - has since goaded Mr Musk over the issue of wifi. Unsurprisingly, Mr Musk has not ignored the temptation to reply. He has labelled Mr O'Leary an \"utter idiot\", a \"chimp\", called for him to be sacked and said he \"has no idea how aeroplanes even fly\". Ireland correspondent For an utter idiot, Michael O'Leary is a happy man. The Ryanair boss lounged cheerfully around the Mayson Hotel in Dublin today, not exactly looking like a CEO at war with the world's richest man.  It’s clear - in time-honoured Ryanair fashion - he's welcoming the free publicity generated from his week-long feud with Elon Musk, who regards him as an \"utter idiot\" and an \"insufferable chimp\" among other epithets. \"I think I probably agree with that\", O'Leary told me, laughing. \"I have four teenage children who regularly call me an utter idiot and an insufferable chimp.\" This is a free swing for the Ryanair boss, who has launched a seat sale off the back of the row - garnering millions of views online already. There's no real threat - it would seem - of Musk forcing a buyout of his airline.  EU regulations are in place to prevent airline ownership by citizens of countries outside the EU and a few others. The share price has remained stable - investors aren't panicking.  As for the insults - water off a duck's back for O'Leary.   Even so, he pulled some punches at his press conference today - there were no fresh barbs for Musk. Rather, an air of bemusement was the order of the day - as Ireland's most savvy PR operator reaps the rewards of a feud being closely watched by millions.  At a news conference on 21 January, in which he said he would address Mr Musk's \"Twitter tantrum\", Mr O'Leary quipped that he is not insulted by the remarks. Speaking to Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy he quipped: \"I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp.\" Is the 'big idiot sale' real? Using the argument to promote its start-of-the-year sale, Ryanair launched the \"great idiots seat sale\" which essentially involves 100,000 one-way tickets being sold for £16.99 for flights from January to April. Both Ryanair's website and X page have been changed to feature the promotion, which involves what appears to be an AI-generated image of Mr O'Leary and Mr Musk. Could Musk actually buy Ryanair? While the social media posts from the world's richest man have widely been taken as provocative rather than serious, Mr Musk's takeover of X, formerly Twitter, began with a surprise offer to buy it after he built up a stake. After asking his 232 million X followers whether he should buy Ryanair and replace Mr O'Leary with someone called Ryan, an overwhelming majority (76.5%) said Mr Musk should do so. Ryanair is listed on the Euronext index in Dublin and its shares have a market capitalisation of around €30.4bn (£26.5bn). However, under EU law, EU-based airlines must be majority-owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtensten, meaning it wouldn't be as simple as Mr Musk buying the company outright. Mr O'Leary did, however, say the company would be open to investment from Mr Musk. He told Sky News' Stephen Murphy: \"Elon Musk is very welcome to buy shares in Ryanair, I think it would be a very good investment for him but as a non-European he can't acquire or take ownership of the company.\""

        "Content": "\n          Sports correspondent\n              @RobHarris\n Matches at this summer's World Cup are set to see more incidents sent for VAR reviews - but referees have been told to be quicker to stop frustrating fans with long delays. Players will also face more clampdowns on time-wasting as the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the independent global body responsible for safeguarding, compiling and amending the laws of the game, prioritises increasing the tempo and excitement of games. The first expansion of the remit of video reviews since they first entered football a decade ago is set to be approved by IFAB next month. Video assistant referees have only been allowed to intervene to assess goals, the awarding of penalties, direct red cards and whether the wrong player has been booked or sent off. But IFAB - led this year by Wales - has now backed allowing referees to defer to VAR if: • A second yellow card has been incorrectly shown based on a \"clear factual error\", leading to a dismissal;• The wrong team has been punished, resulting in a card being shown;• A corner has been wrongly awarded. Referees have been told to take these decisions \"immediately and without delaying the restart\". \"I think that people get the principle of getting the correct decision, but also fans don't want to see us extend delays to the game any more,\" Football Association of Wales CEO Noel Mooney told Sky News. \"Nobody is looking to get more disruption to the game. VAR has been so positive in so many ways but there's nothing as frustrating when you see a really clearly wrong decision against your team. Nobody wants that.\" Read more:Everything you need to know about World Cup 2026 Player welfare concerns as match time increases Some matches are creeping over 100 minutes - creating player welfare concerns - as referees deliberate over decisions, often watching multiple replays provided by VAR on pitch-side screens. Mr Mooney, who chaired an IFAB meeting this week, said: \"The theme of the IFAB this year will be reducing time-wasting, reducing distractions from the enjoyment of the game, so there's no desire whatsoever to see VAR used in a way that would delay the game in any shape or form.\" The first trials with VAR were introduced in 2016 after years of concerns about the impact on football. The expansion of VAR will address an inconsistency where a player's direct red card could be overturned for being wrong or harsh, but an offence leading to a second yellow card could not be reviewed by watching replays - even if TV viewers can see it's clearly wrong. New limit on how long goalkeepers can hold on to ball IFAB will also look to speed up the taking of throw-ins and goal kicks by adopting the eight-second time limit, restricting how long goalkeepers can hold on to the ball. It's intended to stop teams from tactically holding up games. \"We want to see the game more entertaining,\" Mr Mooney said. \"So when you go to a match of 90 minutes, you're seeing a lot more time of the ball moving and exciting moments.\" FIFA holds half of the IFAB votes, with the other four held by the UK's four football associations, who formed the law-making body 140 years ago."

        "Content": "By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor, and Azad Safarov, Ukraine producer  Attacks by Donald Trump against his NATO allies over Greenland, the Chagos islands and the future of global security have sidelined critical plans to secure new support for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, was expected to attend a gathering of world leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week to sign an economic prosperity package with the US and European allies that diplomats had been working to finalise, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source. The source said there had also been an aspiration to seal a bilateral agreement between Washington and Kyiv that would include US security guarantees for Ukraine. It's something the Ukrainian side have long been trying to lock in as they fight to ensure the sovereignty of their country following any future peace accord with Vladimir Putin's Russia. However, on Tuesday, Mr Zelenskyy suddenly delayed his Davos travel schedule, saying he would only head to Switzerland if documents on security guarantees and the prosperity plan were ready to be signed there. Instead, the only confirmed offer from the US president appears to be an invitation for Ukraine to join what he is calling a \"Board of Peace\" - an invitation that has also been extended to Mr Putin. Mr Trump, meanwhile, appears far more focused on other areas of the globe that he sees as being in America's national interest rather than the future of Ukraine. \n                  European leaders to meet after Trump claims 'ultimate' deal in works over Greenland\n                 \n                  Is a new world 'without rules' emerging? What global leaders have said\n                 \n                  Britain will not be 'buffeted around' by Trump tariffs, says Rachel Reeves\n                 This includes a threat to acquire Greenland even though the vast Arctic territory is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a NATO ally. The US president has also unleashed a blistering attack against Sir Keir Starmer over a decision by the UK government to hand the Chagos Islands - including Diego Garcia, which hosts a vital, joint American-British military base - back to Mauritius. Read more: Trump's Chagos broadside leaves Starmer walking an even thinner tightrope The blunt language from Mr Trump and his administration - accusing the Starmer government of weakness and of letting its US partners down - could point to a widening rift in what was once a special relationship. Any unravelling of that bond would be particularly devastating for the UK, given its uniquely close cooperation with the US - even reliance on - over a range of military capabilities, such as nuclear weapons, warplanes and missiles. With the future of the entire NATO alliance at stake, Mr Trump and his demands are dominating the agenda at Davos instead of the future of Ukraine, even as its people freeze after repeated Russian missile strikes against power stations across the country that have caused widespread blackouts and an energy state of emergency. The FT first reported that European opposition to Mr Trump's Greenland threats and his Board for Peace had disrupted plans for the economic support package for ⁠postwar Ukraine. Read more from Sky News:Analysis: Putin's peace board invite will disgust UkraineTanning ads banned over misleading safety claims The Ukrainian diplomatic source said the plan for Davos had been for an $800bn \"prosperity package\" to be signed by Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Trump, as well as potentially US security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a bilateral agreement. This was \"almost ready for signing\", the source added. A second Ukrainian source said: \"The Americans were not ready to sign, but if they are ready, they will sign. There were still some technical issues in the agreement that needed to be finalised.\""

        "Content": "Donald Trump has said everyone is \"very happy\" after claiming a deal is in the works over the future of Greenland - and scrapping a threat to impose tariffs on European allies.  An emergency EU leaders summit is set to go ahead today despite the US president's announcement in Davos on Wednesday. Trump's climbdown as it happened Mr Trump said he won't impose the 10% tariffs threatened on eight European nations, including the UK, over their opposition to his proposed takeover of the Arctic territory, following a \"very productive\" meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte. Posting on Truth Social, Mr Trump said they had formed the framework of a future deal with regard to Greenland and the \"entire Arctic region\", saying the \"solution\" will be great for the US and all NATO countries. The US president said \"everybody's very happy\" with the \"ultimate long-term deal\" - and it \"gives us everything we needed to get\". He added he had spoken with other European leaders about it, but nothing had yet been signed and details have not been forthcoming. He also declared the US \"won't use force\" to take Greenland, but added his military would be \"unstoppable\" in that scenario. US correspondent The expansive ambitions for Greenland that put Trump in conflict with NATO allies, politically at least, disappeared following a meeting with the man who calls him \"Daddy\". Did NATO chief Rutte crack the code?  If he turned him round in a meeting over nibbles on the sidelines at Davos, he truly is the \"Trump Whisperer\". An alternative theory would be Trump came to realise he needed an off-ramp on Greenland, that his territorial ambitions provoked a resistance amongst old allies that he hadn't foreseen and couldn't fight. NATO countries had complied with Trump on increasing their contributions to the alliance. They have bent the knee to the unpredictable, erratic president but on Greenland, they made it clear they would bend no further. He was staring down the barrel of an economic trade war and a hostility previously unseen. The temperature has warmed, for now. For how long is the next question for the mercurial president. How did we get here? The US president had said on Sunday he will charge a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent from some countries - including the UK and European allies - to the US. It came after his threats to take Greenland prompted a furious response from leaders on the continent and in London, even uniting Sir Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch, and Nigel Farage in their opposition. Speaking ahead of Mr Trump's U-turn, Sir Keir said at PMQs he would \"not yield\" in his stance over Greenland, the future of which is a matter for Denmark and Greenlanders. He will host the Danish prime minister in Downing Street later today. Read more from Sky News:Is new world 'without rules' emerging?Why is Ryanair fighting with Elon Musk? Mr Trump's threats appeared on the verge of rupturing NATO, which was founded by leading European nations, the US, and Canada to counter the Soviet Union. The alliance's other members were steadfast in saying Greenland is not for sale and cannot be wrested from Denmark, while angrily rejecting Mr Trump's promised tariffs. Thursday's EU summit, which is being held ​in Brussels, was organised prior to Mr Trump's climbdown and would have seen leaders discuss possible retaliation to the now cancelled tariffs. Mr Trump himself is still in Davos this morning, where he will attend a signing ceremony for his Board of Peace, which aims to resolve global conflicts, proposed last September when he announced his plan to end the Gaza war. He will then meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war in Ukraine, as drone and missile attacks on Kyiv continue."

The US president opened his remarks by saying it was \"great to be back in beautiful Davos\" and address \"so many respected business leaders, so many friends, a few enemies\" but as he spoke, he took aim at Europe, Greenland and the UK. Here are the key point's from Trump's more than 70-minute speech. Follow live updates from Davos Claims US won't use force to take Greenland Perhaps one of the biggest moments throughout the speech was Trump appearing to declare that the US \"won't use force\" to take Greenland, despite saying his military would be \"unstoppable\". It was the first time the president appeared to formally rule out taking the territory through military intervention, after weeks of rising tension. \"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force,\" Mr Trump said. \"We would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that.\" The US president then said everyone would be thankful because \"people thought I would use force\". \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force,\" he added. 'Without us, you'd all be speaking German' Elaborating on why he thinks America deserves to acquire Greenland, Trump frequently referred back to the Second World War, saying the US successfully defended it after Denmark was invaded by Germany. \"We saved Greenland and successfully prevented our enemies from gaining a foothold in our hemisphere,\" Trump said. \"After the war, which we won, we won it big. Without us, right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps.\" He added: \"After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it. We gave it back, but how ungrateful are they now?\" America has 'got nothing' from NATO Trump has been critical of NATO in the past, and his Davos speech was no different, in which he said the United States is \"treated very unfairly\" by the 32-nation alliance. \"When you think about it, nobody can dispute it,\" he claimed. \"We give so much and we get so little in return, and I've been a critic of NATO for many years, and yet I've done more to help NATO than any other president by far. \"You wouldn't have NATO if I didn't get involved in my first term.\" US not looking to 'destroy' countries with tariffs In his push for Greenland, Trump has threatened to slap more tariffs on European countries that are defending the territory and Denmark's right to it. He has said 10% tariffs would come into effect on 1 February for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, unless the US could buy Greenland. The rate would then climb to 25% on 1 June if no deal was in place, he warned earlier this month. The prospect of further US tariffs on European countries over Greenland has been a source of huge discussion in recent days. At Davos, the president said the US \"wants to work with the countries\" and that \"we're not looking to destroy them\". During a separate part of the speech, Trump said Europe is \"not recognisable\". He said: \"I don't want to insult anybody and say 'I don't recognise it', and that's not in a positive way, that's in a very negative way. \"I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it's not heading in the right direction.\" Takes aim at UK over North Sea energy When speaking about the use of green energy, Trump criticised Sir Keir Starmer's policies on North Sea oil and gas. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said the UK should be prioritising net zero by 2030 to limit climate change, rather than issuing new oil and gas-drilling licences. The US president, who has repeatedly denounced what he calls the green energy \"scam\", said the UK government had made it \"impossible\" for oil firms to exploit North Sea reserves. \"The United Kingdom produces just one third of the total energy from all sources that it did in 1999 - think of that, one-third - and they're sitting on top of the North Sea, one of the greatest reserves anywhere in the world, but they don't use it,\" he said. \"That's one reason why their energy has reached catastrophically low levels, with equally high prices.\" He went on to say that he \"wants Europe to do great\" as well as the UK, before reiterating \"they don't use... one of the greatest energy sources in the world\". Canada should be 'grateful' At one stage Trump diverted his attention to Canada, and its prime minister, Mark Carney, who spoke at Davos on Tuesday. In a direct dig at Carney's speech, during which he called for \"middle powers\" to \"act together\", Trump said Canada gets a lot of \"freebies\" from America, and it should be \"grateful\". \"Canada lives because of the United States,\" he said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Macron's 'beautiful sunglasses' Turning to French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Trump first asked \"what the hell\" had happened to the leader to make him wear what the US president said were \"beautiful sunglasses\" during his Davos speech on Tuesday. Mr Macron's office said the ‍French leader's choice to wear the dark, reflective aviators during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his ‌eyes because of a burst blood vessel. Images of him went viral on social media, some comparing him to something out of the film Top Gun, as ​he used part of his speech to criticise Trump over Greenland. But Trump crushed any hostilities towards Macron, adding: \"I like him, I actually like him [that's] hard to believe, isn't it?\""

        "Content": "A judge has agreed to release actor Timothy Busfield from jail in New Mexico, where he is facing child sex abuse charges. Prosecutors allege the Emmy Award-winning actor, 68, inappropriately touched two boys on the set of a television series. Busfield, who first appeared in court via a video link from jail last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse, has previously called the allegations against him \"lies\". At a court hearing in Albuquerque on Tuesday, he appeared in handcuffs and dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. Busfield's lawyers successfully argued that the actor - best known for appearances in The West Wing, Field Of Dreams and Thirtysomething - was not a danger to the community and should not be behind bars while he awaits potential trial. His wife, actor Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s/80s TV series Little House On The Prairie, was in court for the hearing. Prosecutors allege Busfield groomed and sexually abused the children. Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the court the allegations against Busfield were \"specific and not exaggerated\". She also said witnesses expressed fear about potential retaliation and professional harm. Busfield's lawyers suggested the parental claims were an act of revenge after producers decided to replace the children in the series. Judge David Murphy said while the crimes Busfield is accused of inherently are dangerous and involve children, prosecutors did not prove the public would not be safe if he was released. \"There's no evidence of a pattern of criminal conduct, there are no similar allegations involving children in his past,\" he said. \"Rather, this defendant self-surrendered and submitted himself to this court's jurisdiction, demonstrating compliance with the court order for his arrest.\" Outside the court building, Gilbert thanked the judge for the ruling.

The White House moved last year to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's board, from her role, claiming she had committed mortgage fraud - a claim she has strongly denied and that has resulted in no criminal charges. Financial markets and political commentators widely saw the move as part of the US president's efforts to force interest rate cuts out of the central bank, in defiance of its mandate and independence. Money latest: Nationwide reveals expansion of mortgages worth six times salary He has previously called for the removal of Fed chair Jay Powell, who spoke out against the administration earlier this month when it emerged he himself was facing a criminal investigation. While Ms Cook - a Biden-era appointee - is bringing her own legal case, the Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday over whether she could stay on while her challenge plays out.

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The rate of price increases rose again in December, official figures have confirmed, with inflation rising to 3.4%. It's higher than anticipated - an increase to 3.3% was forecast by economists polled by the Reuters news agency. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation ticked up from 3.2% a month earlier. It's the first time since July there's been an increase. Higher tobacco prices, due to raised taxes, and more expensive airfares are behind the increase, the ONS said. Elevated food costs, especially bread and cereal, were also said to have brought overall inflation up. Food inflation rose to 4.5% in the key Christmas shopping month. The overall inflation rate was kept in check as rent rises were not as steep as before. Lower oil prices also helped slow the rise in the cost of raw materials. \n                  Britain will not be 'buffeted around' by Trump tariffs, says Rachel Reeves\n                 \n                  Whitakers' real-life Willy Wonka on shrinkflation and the rise of chocolate-flavour bars\n                 \n                  Is Trump breaking up with Europe?\n                 Falls to come Looking ahead, inflation is expected to slow and could hit the Bank of England's 2% target by as early as April this year. Other economists don't see it nearing that 2% level until the summer. The rise recorded today is said to be a \"temporary blip\" by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which is forecasting a drop to 2% by the summer due to expected lower energy bills in April. What does it mean for interest rates? That could mean an interest rate cut or two and cheaper borrowing as a result. But the surprisingly high rise in inflation makes it even less likely interest rates will be brought down next month. There has, however, been no change in core inflation, a measure that excludes volatile food and energy costs, which is closely watched by the rate-setters at the Bank of England. A slight increase had been anticipated. There's also been only a slight increase in the rate of price increases in the largest part of the UK economy. Services inflation ticked up to 4.5% in December from 4.4% in November."

The company has benefited from growing consumer interest in gut health and its impact on their general physical and mental wellbeing. Under bd-capital's ownership since 2020, it has grown to become Europe's largest subscription business of its kind, with chief executive Will Bowler overseeing rapid annual sales increases. Sources said Symprove had had takeover interest from a wide range of strategic and financial investors, but that its owners had prioritised finding a new owner which could grow its international reach while maintaining its scientific focus. Metagenics is backed by Gryphon Investors, a US-based private investment firm which was advised by Greenhill and Spayne Lindsay on the acquisition. Jefferies advised Symprove's owners on the sale. The deal represents the first exit from an investment for bd-capital, which was co-founded by Richard Baker, the former Boots chief executive, and Andy Dawson, a senior figure in the UK private equity industry from his time at Advent International.

        "Content": "Elon Musk has said he could buy Ryanair amid an ongoing public spat with the budget airline's boss Michael O'Leary.  The two have clashed numerous times over the past few days, resulting in Mr Musk asking his X followers if he should buy Ryanair and \"restore Ryan as their rightful ruler\". Ryanair responded by announcing a \"big idiot seat sale\", which it says is for the billionaire tech mogul and any other \"idiots\" on Mr Musk's social media platform. Here is everything you need to know about why the two outspoken chief executives are trading insults, from what has been said to why it began in the first place. What is the row about? The spat appears to have stemmed from Mr O'Leary ruling out equipping Ryanair jets with Mr Musk's Starlink satellite internet service, after rivals Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS announced a deal to install Starlink on its aircraft. In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on 16 January, Mr O'Leary said he would not install the technology because he believed that passengers on Ryanair's short-haul flights would \"not be willing to pay\" to use it. He added it would cost the company about €200-250m per-year to use the tech and add 1-2% to their fuel bill due to the two aerials required on each flight, which would impact the aerodynamics of the aircraft. He told the radio station he would \"pay no attention whatsoever\" to Mr Musk, labelling him an \"idiot\". \"Musk knows even less about airline ownership rules than he does about aircraft aerodynamics,\" he said. Read more:How Musk is boosting the British rightMusk's race for space What has happened since? The Ryanair X account - which is known for its posts which mock criticisms of the airline and weighs in on current events - has since goaded Mr Musk over the issue of wifi. Unsurprisingly, Mr Musk has not ignored the temptation to reply. He has labelled Mr O'Leary an \"utter idiot\", a \"chimp\", called for him to be sacked and said he \"has no idea how aeroplanes even fly\". Ireland correspondent For an utter idiot, Michael O'Leary is a happy man. The Ryanair boss lounged cheerfully around the Mayson Hotel in Dublin today, not exactly looking like a CEO at war with the world's richest man.  It’s clear - in time-honoured Ryanair fashion - he's welcoming the free publicity generated from his week-long feud with Elon Musk, who regards him as an \"utter idiot\" and an \"insufferable chimp\" among other epithets. \"I think I probably agree with that\", O'Leary told me, laughing. \"I have four teenage children who regularly call me an utter idiot and an insufferable chimp.\" This is a free swing for the Ryanair boss, who has launched a seat sale off the back of the row - garnering millions of views online already. There's no real threat - it would seem - of Musk forcing a buyout of his airline.  EU regulations are in place to prevent airline ownership by citizens of countries outside the EU and a few others. The share price has remained stable - investors aren't panicking.  As for the insults - water off a duck's back for O'Leary.   Even so, he pulled some punches at his press conference today - there were no fresh barbs for Musk. Rather, an air of bemusement was the order of the day - as Ireland's most savvy PR operator reaps the rewards of a feud being closely watched by millions.  At a news conference on 21 January, in which he said he would address Mr Musk's \"Twitter tantrum\", Mr O'Leary quipped that he is not insulted by the remarks. Speaking to Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy he quipped: \"I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp.\" Is the 'big idiot sale' real? Using the argument to promote its start-of-the-year sale, Ryanair launched the \"great idiots seat sale\" which essentially involves 100,000 one-way tickets being sold for £16.99 for flights from January to April. Both Ryanair's website and X page have been changed to feature the promotion, which involves what appears to be an AI-generated image of Mr O'Leary and Mr Musk. Could Musk actually buy Ryanair? While the social media posts from the world's richest man have widely been taken as provocative rather than serious, Mr Musk's takeover of X, formerly Twitter, began with a surprise offer to buy it after he built up a stake. After asking his 232 million X followers whether he should buy Ryanair and replace Mr O'Leary with someone called Ryan, an overwhelming majority (76.5%) said Mr Musk should do so. Ryanair is listed on the Euronext index in Dublin and its shares have a market capitalisation of around €30.4bn (£26.5bn). However, under EU law, EU-based airlines must be majority-owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtensten, meaning it wouldn't be as simple as Mr Musk buying the company outright. Mr O'Leary did, however, say the company would be open to investment from Mr Musk. He told Sky News' Stephen Murphy: \"Elon Musk is very welcome to buy shares in Ryanair, I think it would be a very good investment for him but as a non-European he can't acquire or take ownership of the company.\""

        "Content": "\n          Chief political correspondent\n              @joncraig\n It was billed as an emergency meeting of Tory MPs after a trio of defections to Reform UK, but judging by the noise that greeted Kemi Badenoch it could have been a victory rally. When the Tory leader entered parliament's committee room 14 for what could have been an awkward showdown with her backbenchers, the loud banging of desks and cheering lasted 25 seconds. Cynics will say that the ritual of banging desks for Tory leaders at 1922 Committee meetings is purely for the benefit of journalists in the corridor. And if that's true, the whips had done their job. But her MPs liked what they heard in her speech. The Conservative Party would not be moving to the left after the defections and would always be a party of the right, she declared. The tone of her speech, coming after the defections of Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell, was clearly designed to reassure those Conservative MPs who backed Mr Jenrick in the Tory leadership election. And speaking to Sky News as she left the meeting, she re-opened her battle with Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, insisting: \"He's right on Greenland and wrong on Chagos.\" And attacking Nigel Farage's backing in Davos for \"a strong America in Greenland\", she told Sky News: \"People can see the difference between populism and Conservatism.\" An olive branch to Jenrick supporters? Earlier, one of the first to arrive at the '22 meeting had been the new Tory peer Sharron Davies, the Olympic swimming silver medallist and women's campaigner, who only took her seat in the Lords the previous day. And as Ms Badenoch rose to speak, she immediately dived into Mr Jenrick's defection, admitting it had left a big gap in the shadow cabinet and acknowledging he did a \"fabulous job\" as shadow justice secretary. Despite describing sacking him ahead of his defection last week as \"spring cleaning\", here was a Tory leader now clearly accepting that her defeated leadership rival had strong support among MPs on the right of the party. She claimed, not surprisingly, that Mr Jenrick's resignation was based \"not on ideology, but personal ambition\", something that all her MPs would undoubtedly agree with. Read more from Sky News:All ex-Tory MPs who've joined Reform 'Britain not broken beyond repair' But the Tory leader also claimed an \"unholy alliance of Reform and some of the left of our party are undermining what we want to do\". And she told her MPs: \"We are not moving leftwards, we are the party of the right and will always be a party of the right.\" She said the Conservative Party \"remains the best vehicle to deliver proper Conservatism\" and defended her claim that Britain is not broken, on which she clashed with Mr Jenrick before his defection. \"There is a lot to fix in this country,\" she said. \"A lot of stuff isn't working, a lot is broken, but the whole country isn't broken beyond repair.\" This emergency meeting was called as the Tory leader fired off a defiant letter to her MPs on Monday following the latest defection to Reform UK, by Mr Rosindell. \"Differences of opinion are part of a healthy party,\" she wrote. \"But there is a clear line between disagreement and trying to damage the party from within. \"Those who cannot be part of a Conservative Party that is changing in this way are free to make other choices. \"Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly. \"There will be no hard feelings about that as they will create space for those who share our values and purpose.\" In other words, if you're going to defect, go now. But on the evidence of the noisy show of support at this meeting, the bulk of her MPs are backing her. For now, anyway."

The Investigation and Commencement of Repair (Scotland) Regulations 2026 will introduce new duties on landlords to investigate reports of damp and mould and initiate any necessary repairs within a set timescale, subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. This is the first set of regulations for the implementation of Awaab's Law, named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who died in 2020 from a severe respiratory illness caused by prolonged exposure to the mould in his family's housing association flat in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. The toddler's death caused outrage and prompted the passage of Awaab's Law south of the border with a requirement for landlords to fix reported hazards in social housing more speedily and rehouse tenants in safe accommodation if necessary. The new law came into force in England in October, with Awaab's father, Faisal Abdullah, telling Sky News that although it would \"never bring Awaab back... it might be enough to protect others\".

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"Threats of tariffs to pressurise allies are completely wrong. \"But I do want to be clear with the House: I will not yield, Britain will not yield on our principles and values about the future of Greenland under threats of tariffs.\" Politics latest - follow live President Donald Trump threatened the UK and other European nations with a 10% tariff on all baseline goods coming to the US over the weekend, unless a deal can be reached on Greenland. He says he wants to purchase Greenland, a self-autonomous Danish territory, for national security reasons. But Sir Keir insisted to MPs that he had \"made [his] position on Greenland absolutely clear\", and added that he would \"engage constructively\" with Mr Trump. \"The first of those is that the future of Greenland is for the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he reiterated. Sir Keir did not explicitly rule out retaliatory tariffs, but appeared to steer away from them, saying he was \"working hard to make sure we do not get to that point\". On Tuesday, the president hit out at the government's deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, calling it \"an act of great stupidity\" and saying the agreement is another reason why the US must own Greenland. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch sought to use those criticisms of the Chagos deal to her advantage. But the prime minister insisted Mr Trump's comments were only an attempt to force his hand on Greenland. Sir Keir said: \"President Trump deployed words on Chagos yesterday that were different to his previous words of welcome and support when I met him in the White House. \"He deployed those words yesterday for the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain in relation to my values and principles on the future of Greenland.\" \"[Trump] wants me to yield on my position, and I'm not going to do so.\" The PM also hit out at Ms Badenoch raising the US president's comments on the deal. He said: \"Now she appears to support words by President Trump to undermine the government's position on the future of Greenland. She's chosen naked opportunism over the national interest.\" Challenged by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, over his handling of the international row, Sir Keir responded that \"the relationship with the US matters\". Sir Ed has called on the government to stand up to Mr Trump and hit back. The PM said: \"It's foolhardy to think that we should rip up our relationship with the US, abandon Ukraine and so many other things that are important to our defence.\" Leaders trade blows over defections and party rows During PMQs, the prime minister also sought to wind up the Conservative Party leader about people leaving her party to join Reform UK, following the recent high-profile defections of Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell. Sir Keir said: \"They shout on a Wednesday, and they defect on a Thursday. \"The loudest shouter used to be the former shadow justice secretary [Robert Jenrick]. We should take a note of who's shouting most loudly this week.\" But Ms Badenoch rose to Sir Keir's challenge with a smile, saying: \"The prime minister wants to talk about defections - let me tell him that when I had someone undermining my party, I sacked him.\" This led to roars of approval in the chamber, which drowned out the Tory leader. She then continued: \"We all know that if he sacked everyone undermining his party, his frontbench would be empty.\" But the prime minister bit back, saying: \"She's claiming strength. She read the guy's defection letter and then at that point decided to sack him. What was she going to do? Correct the typos and give it back to him?\" Sir Keir added that the Tory leader should have sacked Mr Jenrick earlier for his \"comment about faces in Birmingham\". One member of the shadow cabinet did leave the Conservative Party benches during PMQs. Shadow transport secretary Richard Holden was ordered to leave the Commons by the Speaker for being too rowdy."

Last month, Equity members voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning on set. With a turnout of over 75%, over 99% of those who voted said they would be prepared to refuse a set scan. Digital scanning is a process through which an actor's likeness is captured for future use. There have been growing concerns among actors that their work, voice and likeness are being used without their explicit consent, with Equity pushing for transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage via an enforced industry standard. Equity says it has now received an offer with \"new wording\" concerning AI protections from the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT), which showed \"improvements\". The two unions agreed to enter a further period of negotiations \"in good faith\" on Tuesday. Equity general secretary Paul W Fleming said: \"Equity members should be in no doubt that it is their support and determination to secure AI protections which led to this improved offer. \"Last month's ballot result showed that an overwhelming majority of performers are prepared to refuse scanning on set, and that focused the minds of producers leading to this improved offer. \"It doesn't cover everything we've asked for, and the coming weeks will be instrumental in securing the protections performers need in the age of AI and scanning on set.\" Equity said PACT had met its deadline on Monday, providing new wording with improvements in relation to AI protections, which had been in dispute.

        "Content": "Elon Musk has said he could buy Ryanair amid an ongoing public spat with the budget airline's boss Michael O'Leary.  The two have clashed numerous times over the past few days, resulting in Mr Musk asking his X followers if he should buy Ryanair and \"restore Ryan as their rightful ruler\". Ryanair responded by announcing a \"big idiot seat sale\", which it says is for the billionaire tech mogul and any other \"idiots\" on Mr Musk's social media platform. Here is everything you need to know about why the two outspoken chief executives are trading insults, from what has been said to why it began in the first place. What is the row about? The spat appears to have stemmed from Mr O'Leary ruling out equipping Ryanair jets with Mr Musk's Starlink satellite internet service, after rivals Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS announced a deal to install Starlink on its aircraft. In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on 16 January, Mr O'Leary said he would not install the technology because he believed that passengers on Ryanair's short-haul flights would \"not be willing to pay\" to use it. He added it would cost the company about €200-250m per-year to use the tech and add 1-2% to their fuel bill due to the two aerials required on each flight, which would impact the aerodynamics of the aircraft. He told the radio station he would \"pay no attention whatsoever\" to Mr Musk, labelling him an \"idiot\". \"Musk knows even less about airline ownership rules than he does about aircraft aerodynamics,\" he said. Read more:How Musk is boosting the British rightMusk's race for space What has happened since? The Ryanair X account - which is known for its posts which mock criticisms of the airline and weighs in on current events - has since goaded Mr Musk over the issue of wifi. Unsurprisingly, Mr Musk has not ignored the temptation to reply. He has labelled Mr O'Leary an \"utter idiot\", a \"chimp\", called for him to be sacked and said he \"has no idea how aeroplanes even fly\". Ireland correspondent For an utter idiot, Michael O'Leary is a happy man. The Ryanair boss lounged cheerfully around the Mayson Hotel in Dublin today, not exactly looking like a CEO at war with the world's richest man.  It’s clear - in time-honoured Ryanair fashion - he's welcoming the free publicity generated from his week-long feud with Elon Musk, who regards him as an \"utter idiot\" and an \"insufferable chimp\" among other epithets. \"I think I probably agree with that\", O'Leary told me, laughing. \"I have four teenage children who regularly call me an utter idiot and an insufferable chimp.\" This is a free swing for the Ryanair boss, who has launched a seat sale off the back of the row - garnering millions of views online already. There's no real threat - it would seem - of Musk forcing a buyout of his airline.  EU regulations are in place to prevent airline ownership by citizens of countries outside the EU and a few others. The share price has remained stable - investors aren't panicking.  As for the insults - water off a duck's back for O'Leary.   Even so, he pulled some punches at his press conference today - there were no fresh barbs for Musk. Rather, an air of bemusement was the order of the day - as Ireland's most savvy PR operator reaps the rewards of a feud being closely watched by millions.  At a news conference on 21 January, in which he said he would address Mr Musk's \"Twitter tantrum\", Mr O'Leary quipped that he is not insulted by the remarks. Speaking to Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy he quipped: \"I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp.\" Is the 'big idiot sale' real? Using the argument to promote its start-of-the-year sale, Ryanair launched the \"great idiots seat sale\" which essentially involves 100,000 one-way tickets being sold for £16.99 for flights from January to April. Both Ryanair's website and X page have been changed to feature the promotion, which involves what appears to be an AI-generated image of Mr O'Leary and Mr Musk. Could Musk actually buy Ryanair? While the social media posts from the world's richest man have widely been taken as provocative rather than serious, Mr Musk's takeover of X, formerly Twitter, began with a surprise offer to buy it after he built up a stake. After asking his 232 million X followers whether he should buy Ryanair and replace Mr O'Leary with someone called Ryan, an overwhelming majority (76.5%) said Mr Musk should do so. Ryanair is listed on the Euronext index in Dublin and its shares have a market capitalisation of around €30.4bn (£26.5bn). However, under EU law, EU-based airlines must be majority-owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtensten, meaning it wouldn't be as simple as Mr Musk buying the company outright. Mr O'Leary did, however, say the company would be open to investment from Mr Musk. He told Sky News' Stephen Murphy: \"Elon Musk is very welcome to buy shares in Ryanair, I think it would be a very good investment for him but as a non-European he can't acquire or take ownership of the company.\""

        "Content": "A landmark study has paved the way for type 1 diabetes screening among children to stop them \"crash landing\" into diagnosis.  NHS pre-diabetes clinics for children are to be set up after the study confirmed the feasibility of using finger-prick blood tests to spot the disease before symptoms arise. The study found children can be diagnosed in the earliest stage of type 1 (T1) diabetes, with experts saying the findings could lead to a \"step change\" in diagnosis and treatment. Up to 400,000 people in the UK have T1 diabetes - which is around 8% of those with diabetes. About a quarter of children with T1 are only diagnosed in an emergency situation. If children can be identified in the earliest stages, they can get access to treatments that can delay the need for insulin for years. How was the study carried out? The Early Surveillance for Autoimmune Diabetes (Elsa) study, led by the University of Birmingham and co-funded by Diabetes UK and Breakthrough T1D, was set up to assess the viability of screening in the UK. The results from the first two years of the study have been published in correspondence published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology. Children aged three to 13 without T1 diabetes were invited to participate. They provided a fingerprint blood sample checked for antibodies which have previously been found in pre-symptomatic patients. Children identified as potentially at risk of T1 diabetes were invited for further blood tests or sugar tolerance tests. Overall, 17,283 tests were analysed and more than 200 children were found to be at risk or have markers in their blood that indicate risk of T1D. What happens next? The next phase of the study, Elsa 2, will involve more children recruited, aged between two and 17. This part of the study will support NHS clinics for four years at each of the UK's 20 study sites. The clinics will help support and educate families where children are found to be at risk of, or have, early T1 diabetes. Staff will also be able to help children as they start insulin treatment. If approved by the NHS's spending watchdog, some youngsters may have access to a new type of treatment, teplizumab - approved for UK use last year - which can help delay the need for insulin treatment.

A new screening programme could, in the future, prevent children from \"crash landing\" into a diagnosis, said lead researcher Parth Narendran, professor of diabetes medicine at the University of Birmingham. Treatments such as teplizumab, and others that are in the pipeline, could potentially be offered, he said. Prof Narendran said this will mean they don't need insulin therapy in the long-term, and they are kept in the \"very early stage of T1 diabetes without insulin requirements\". \"It's a massive step change,\" he added."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n Microsoft, the $3.4trn computing behemoth, will this week unveil a partnership with the Mercedes Formula One team that will underline the sport's resurgent appeal among the world's biggest technology companies. Sky News understands that Microsoft will be announced as a major sponsor of the Brackley-based outfit when it unveils its 2026 car livery and design at an event on Thursday. One sponsorship expert estimated that the deal could be worth in the region of $60m-a-year, adding that if that figure was accurate, it would rank among F1's biggest individual team sponsorship agreements. Money blog: Inflation rises again - here's what it could mean for you The deal will make Microsoft the latest tech company to sign a big commercial agreement in F1, with rivals such as Google already having a presence through a partnership with McLaren Racing, the reigning world champions. The sport has enjoyed commercial success in recent years under the ownership of Liberty Media, with race attendances, TV audiences and its global fanbase all growing to varying degrees. This week's announcement will come soon after Toto Wolff, the Mercedes F1 chief executive and team principal, sold a 15% stake in the outfit to George Kurtz, the American billionaire who runs cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Last year, CrowdStrike and Microsoft announced an alliance aimed at identifying the protagonists behind cyber threats. The team's stake sale was reported to have valued it at over £4.6bn, a record for the sport. That is despite the fact that Mercedes remains without an F1 constructors' title since 2021. This year, its cars will continue to be driven by Briton George Russell and Kimi Antonelli of Italy. It emerged this week that John Owen - designer of Mercedes' F1 cars during its period of dominance between 2014 and 2021, when it won the team championship for eight consecutive years - would step down during the course of 2026.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n Prince Harry became emotional as he finished an intense day of evidence against the publisher of the Daily Mail - telling the High Court his wife Meghan's life had been made an \"absolute misery\". The Duke of Sussex spent about two hours being cross-examined by Associated Newspapers Limited's lawyer, at times appearing visibly frustrated with the line of questioning. He told the court the idea that he has no right to privacy is \"disgusting\" and it was \"fundamentally wrong to put us through this again when all we wanted was an apology and accountability\". Harry, 41, has brought legal action against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over alleged unlawful information gathering between 1993 and 2011, alongside fellow claimants Baroness Doreen Lawrence, politician Sir Simon Hughes, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley, and Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish. ANL strongly denies the claims and also says they have been brought too late. After two days of opening statements from the lawyers for both parties, Harry became the first witness to give evidence on Wednesday. He told the court: \"I have never believed that my life is open season to be commercialised by these people.\" It was right at the end of his evidence, as he mentioned Meghan, that he became emotional. \"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife's life an absolute misery, my Lord,\" he said, his voice faltering. The Duchess of Sussex sued ANL and won in 2021 after The Mail on Sunday published parts of a \"personal and private\" letter to her father, Thomas Markle. In Harry's written witness statement, which was released on Tuesday, he told of the \"uneasy relationship\" he had had with the press ever since the death of his mother, Diana, when he was just 12 years old. He said that when his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, he started to become \"increasingly troubled by the approach of not taking action against the press\" in the wake of \"vicious, persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles\". Harry is relying on 14 articles in his case against ANL. During his exchanges in court with Anthony White, the lawyer representing ANL, it was clear Harry was frustrated with some of the points being made and told the court he wanted to get his point across. A couple of times during the hearing, Judge Nicklin politely reminded the duke he did not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today\", but simply had to answer questions put to him; however, Harry told him he had had a \"bad experience\" previously. During his questioning, he denied having \"leaky\" social circles and said his life had been \"commercialised\" since he was a teenager, with the press\"delving into every aspect of my private life\". Read more:The latest updates from courtAnalysis: Harry's biggest case against the press He also told the court he could not have complained about what he felt was press intrusion when he was an active member of the Royal Family, due to the \"institution\" he was in, and also because there were \"thousands\" of articles written about him. \"If you complain, they double down on you, in my experience,\" he said. In a statement shared after the hearing, Prince Harry said: \"Today we reminded the Mail Group who is on trial and why.\" In court on Tuesday, Mr White described the case as \"threadbare\" and said that journalists would show how they sourced articles legitimately. In written submissions, the lawyer said the publisher \"strongly denies\" that there was any unlawful information gathering, including voicemail interception, directed at the duke. The trial continues - with Hurley expected to give evidence tomorrow."

        "Content": "Artificial intelligence protections for performers could be implemented for the first time, as union negotiations to establish a framework progress. Last month, Equity members voted overwhelmingly to refuse digital scanning on set. With a turnout of over 75%, over 99% of those who voted said they would be prepared to refuse a set scan. Digital scanning is a process through which an actor's likeness is captured for future use. There have been growing concerns among actors that their work, voice and likeness are being used without their explicit consent, with Equity pushing for transparency of terms, and fair remuneration for usage via an enforced industry standard. Equity says it has now received an offer with \"new wording\" concerning AI protections from the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT), which showed \"improvements\". The two unions agreed to enter a further period of negotiations \"in good faith\" on Tuesday. Equity general secretary Paul W Fleming said: \"Equity members should be in no doubt that it is their support and determination to secure AI protections which led to this improved offer. \"Last month's ballot result showed that an overwhelming majority of performers are prepared to refuse scanning on set, and that focused the minds of producers leading to this improved offer. \"It doesn't cover everything we've asked for, and the coming weeks will be instrumental in securing the protections performers need in the age of AI and scanning on set.\" Equity said PACT had met its deadline on Monday, providing new wording with improvements in relation to AI protections, which had been in dispute.

The union has raised concerns that artists' likeness, voice and work could be used by generative AI without their consent. Mr Fleming has said previously that it was a \"basic right of performers to have autonomy over their own personhood and identity\"."

        "Content": "A judge has agreed to release actor Timothy Busfield from jail in New Mexico, where he is facing child sex abuse charges. Prosecutors allege the Emmy Award-winning actor, 68, inappropriately touched two boys on the set of a television series. Busfield, who first appeared in court via a video link from jail last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse, has previously called the allegations against him \"lies\". At a court hearing in Albuquerque on Tuesday, he appeared in handcuffs and dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. Busfield's lawyers successfully argued that the actor - best known for appearances in The West Wing, Field Of Dreams and Thirtysomething - was not a danger to the community and should not be behind bars while he awaits potential trial. His wife, actor Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s/80s TV series Little House On The Prairie, was in court for the hearing. Prosecutors allege Busfield groomed and sexually abused the children. Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the court the allegations against Busfield were \"specific and not exaggerated\". She also said witnesses expressed fear about potential retaliation and professional harm. Busfield's lawyers suggested the parental claims were an act of revenge after producers decided to replace the children in the series. Judge David Murphy said while the crimes Busfield is accused of inherently are dangerous and involve children, prosecutors did not prove the public would not be safe if he was released. \"There's no evidence of a pattern of criminal conduct, there are no similar allegations involving children in his past,\" he said. \"Rather, this defendant self-surrendered and submitted himself to this court's jurisdiction, demonstrating compliance with the court order for his arrest.\" Outside the court building, Gilbert thanked the judge for the ruling.
