        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n  A woman who is under police investigation after assisting the suicide of her husband at Dignitas in Switzerland has told Sky News she has no regrets. Louise Shackleton has spoken publicly for the first time since her husband's death in December, as parliament prepares to vote again on legislation to introduce assisted dying in England and Wales. Mrs Shackleton surrendered herself to police after returning from Switzerland having seen her husband Anthony die. He had been suffering with motor neurone disease for six years. \"I have committed a crime, which I have admitted to, of assisting him by simply pushing him on to a plane and being with him, which I don't regret for one moment. He was my husband and I loved him,\" she said. \"We talked at length over two years about this. What he said to me on many occasions is 'look at my options, look at what my options are. I can either go there and I can die peacefully, with grace, without pain, without suffering or I could be laid in a bed not being able to move, not even being able to look at anything unless you move my head'. \"He didn't have options. What he wanted was nothing more than a good death.\" The law in the UK prohibits people from assisting in the suicide of others, but prosecutions have been rare. In a statement, a North Yorkshire Police spokesman told Sky News: \"The investigation is ongoing. There is nothing further to add at this stage.\" The next vote on the assisted dying bill for England and Wales has been delayed by three weeks to give MPs time to consider amendments. The legislation would permit a person who is terminally ill with less than six months to live to legally end their life after approval by two doctors and an expert panel. 'He was at total peace with his decision'  Mrs Shackleton says she saw her husband \"physically and mentally\" relax once on the flight to Switzerland. She said: \"We had the most wonderful four days. \"He was laughing. He was at total peace with his decision. \"It was in those four days that I realised that he wanted the peaceful death more than he wanted to suffer and stay with me, which was hard, but that's how resolute he was in having this peace. \"I was his wife, we'd been together 25 years, we'd known each other since we were 18. I couldn't do anything else but help him.\" 'We need to safeguard people' She said the hardest part of the journey came after her husband's death. \"There was this panic and this fear that I was leaving him,\" she said. \"That was a horrific experience. \"If the law had changed in this country, I would have been with family, family would have been with us, family would've been with him. But as it was, that couldn't happen.\" Opponents to the assisted dying bill have raised concerns about the safety of vulnerable people and the risk of coercion and a change in attitudes toward the elderly, seriously ill and disabled. They say improvements to palliative care should be a priority. \"I think that we need to safeguard people,\" said Mrs Shackleton. \"I think that sometimes we need to suffer other people's choices, and when I mean suffer I mean we have to acknowledge that whilst we're not comfortable with those, that we need to respect other people, other people wishes.\" Read more:Assisted dying: What is in the legislation?Debate over assisted dying delayed  Anthony, who died aged 59, was a furniture restorer who had earned worldwide recognition for making rocking horses. \"I think the measure of the man is that nobody has ever said a bad word about him in the whole of his life because he was just so caring and giving,\" his widow said. 'This is about a dying person's choice' She said she had chosen to speak publicly because of a promise she had made him. \"I felt that my husband's journey shouldn't be in vain. We discussed this on our last day and my husband made me promise to tell his story. \"He told me to fight and the simple thing that I'm fighting for is people to have the choice. \"This is about a dying person's choice to either follow their journey through with disease or to die peacefully when they want to, on their terms, and have a good death. It's that simple.\""

        "Content": "The White House has hit out at an \"appalling\" attempt by a Democratic senator to return a father wrongly deported to El Salvador. Chris Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to speak to the country's leaders about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the US by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Washington acknowledged Mr Garcia was deported due to an \"administrative error\". The US Supreme Court has called on the administration to facilitate his return, upholding a court order by Judge Paula Xinis, but Trump officials have claimed Mr Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang.  Mr Garcia's lawyers have argued there is no evidence of this. Speaking about Mr Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Democrats \"still refuse to accept the will of the American people\". She alleged Mr Garcia was an \"illegal alien MS-13 terrorist\" and claimed his wife petitioned for court protection against him after alleged incidents of domestic violence. After outlining the allegations against Mr Garcia, she went on: \"All of that is not enough to stop the Democrat Party from their lies. \"The number one issue they are focused on right now is bringing back this illegal alien terrorist to America. \"It's appalling and sad that Senator Van Hollen and the Democrats are plotting his trip to El Salvador today, are incapable of having any shred of common sense or empathy for their own constituents and our citizens.\" After making a statement, Ms Leavitt introduced Patty Morin, who described graphic details of her daughter's murder by an immigrant from El Salvador. Rachel Morin was raped and murdered by Victor Martinez-Hernandez along a popular hiking trail northeast of Baltimore. Afterwards, Ms Leavitt left without taking any questions from reporters. Senator travels to El Salvador Mr Van Hollen met with the El Salvador vice president during his trip to the Central American country. But he did not meet with President Nayib Bukele, who publicly met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office this week, nor did he meet Mr Garcia himself. In a post on X, he said he would continue to fight for Mr Garcia's return. During Mr Bukele's trip to the White House earlier this week, he said he would not return Mr Garcia, likening it to smuggling \"a terrorist into the United States\". Along with Mr Garcia, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, mostly Venezuelans, who it claims are gang members without presenting evidence and without a trial.  Judge's contempt warning It comes hours after a US federal judge warned that he could hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. The comments are an escalation in a row which began last month when US district judge James E Boasberg issued an order temporarily blocking the deportations. However, lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air - one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Mr Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be turned around, but the directive was not included in his written order. The Trump administration then denied refusing to comply. Charges could be brought forward by the Justice Department, NBC News, Sky's US partner network, reported.

If the executive-led Justice Department refused to prosecute the matter, Judge Boasberg said he would appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt. The judge wrote: \"The Constitution does not tolerate wilful disobedience of judicial orders - especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it.\" He gave the government a 23 April deadline. White House director of communications Steven Cheung said the administration would seek \"immediate appellate relief\" - a review of a decision within a lower court before the case has been resolved."

        "Content": " A former Labour MP who quit the party over Sir Keir Starmer's leadership has welcomed the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman as a \"victory for feminists\". Rosie Duffield, now the independent MP for Canterbury, said the judgment helped resolve the \"lack of clarity\" that has existed in the politics around the issue \"for years\". She was speaking to Ali Fortescue on the Politics Hub on the same day the UK's highest court delivered its verdict on one of the most contentious debates in politics. Politics latest: MPs respond to Supreme Court ruling on gender  The judges were asked to rule on how \"sex\" is defined in the 2010 Equality Act - whether that means biological sex or \"certificated\" sex, as legally defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. Their unanimous decision was that the definition of a \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". Asked what she made about comments by fellow independent MP John McDonnell - who said the court \"failed to hear the voice of a single trans person\" and that the decision \"lacked humanity and fairness\" as a result, she said: \"This ruling doesn't affect trans people in the slightest. \"It's about women's rights - women's rights to single sex spaces, women's rights, not to be discriminated against. \"It literally doesn't change a single thing for trans rights and that lack of understanding from a senior politician about the law is a bit worrying, actually.\" However, Maggie Chapman, a Scottish Green MSP, disagreed with Ms Duffield and said she was \"concerned\" about the impact the ruling would have on trans people \"and for the services and facilities they have been using and have had access to for decades now\". \"One of the grave concerns that we have with this ruling is that it will embolden people to challenge trans people who have every right to access services,\" she said. \"We know that over the last few years... their [trans people's] lives have become increasingly difficult, they have been blocked from accessing services they need.\"  Delivering the ruling at the London court on Wednesday, Lord Hodge said: \"But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another. It is not. \"The Equality Act 2010 gives transgender people protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender. \"This is the application of the principle of discrimination by association. Those statutory protections are available to transgender people, whether or not they possess a gender recognition certificate.\" Read more:Supreme Court decision has immediate real-world consequencesPrisons across England and Wales now 98.9% full Asked whether she believed the judgment could \"draw a line\" under the culture war, Ms Chapman told Fortescue: \"Today's judgment only stokes that culture war further.\" And she said that while Lord Hodge was correct to say there were protections in law for trans people in the 2020 Equality Act, the judgment \"doesn't prevent things happening\". \"It may offer protections once bad things have happened, once harassment, once discrimination, once bigotry, once assaults have happened,\" she said. She also warned some groups \"aren't going to be satisfied with today's ruling\". \"We know that there are individuals and there are groups who actually want to roll back even further - they want to get rid of the Gender Recognition Act from 2004,\" she said. \"I think today's ruling just emboldens those views.\""

        "Content": "US stock markets suffered more significant losses on Wednesday, with stocks in leading AI chipmakers slumping after firms said new restrictions on exports to China would cost them billions. Nvidia fell 6.87% - and was at one point down 10% - after revealing it would now need a US government licence to sell its H20 chip. Rival chipmaker AMD slumped 7.35% after it predicted a $800m (£604m) charge due to its MI308 also needing a licence. Dutch firm ASML, which makes hardware essential to chip manufacturing, fell more than 5% after it missed order expectations and said US tariffs created uncertainty. The losses filtered into the tech-dominated Nasdaq index, which recovered slightly to end 3% down, while the larger S&P 500 fell 2.2%. Such losses would have been among the worst in years were it not for the turmoil over recent weeks. It comes as China remains the focus of Donald Trump's tariff regime, with both countries imposing tit-for-tat charges of over 100% on imports. The US commerce department said in a statement it was \"committed to acting on the president's directive to safeguard our national and economic security\".  Nvidia's bespoke China chip is already deliberately less powerful than products sold elsewhere after intervention from the previous Biden administration. However, the Trump government is worried the H20 and others could still be used to build a supercomputer in China, threatening national security and US dominance in AI. Nvidia said the move would cost it around $5.5bn (£4.1bn) and the licensing requirement would be in place for the \"indefinite future\". Nvidia's recently announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment to build infrastructure in America - something Mr Trump heralded as a victory in his mission to boost US manufacturing. However, it appears to have been too little to stave off the new restrictions. Pressure has also come from the Democrats, with senator Elizabeth Warren writing to the commerce secretary and urging him to limit chip sales to China. Meanwhile, the head of US central bank also warned on Wednesday that US tariffs could slow the economy and raise inflation more than expected. Jerome Powell said the bank would need more time to decide on lowering interest rates. \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated,\" he said. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\" Predictions of a recession in the US have risen significantly since the president revealed details of the import taxes a few weeks ago. However, he subsequently paused the higher rates for 90 days to allow for negotiations."

        "Content": "Scientists have found what they are calling the strongest sign yet of possible life beyond our solar system after detecting the chemical footprint of gases in an alien planet's atmosphere that on Earth are only produced by living organisms. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists found traces of two gases - dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) - on a planet named K2-18 b. On Earth, those gases are generated primarily by living organisms including algae, suggesting K2-18 b could be teeming with microbial life. Researchers have stressed the findings are not an announcement of the discovery of actual living organisms, but rather an indicator of a biological process. K2-18 b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo, is 8.6 times as massive as Earth and has a diameter about 2.6 times as large as our planet. It orbits in the \"habitable zone\" - a distance where liquid water, a key ingredient for life, can exist on a planetary surface. Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, said it was a \"transformational moment in the search for life beyond the solar system\". \n                  US markets fall as AI chipmakers mourn new restrictions on China exports\n                 \n                  Spotify down: Streaming app suffers major outage - as company confirms 'issues'\n                 \n                  'The end of 4chan as we know it': Why hacking attack could kill notorious internet forum\n                 \"We have entered the era of observational astrobiology,\" Professor Madhusudhan said. Earlier observations by Webb, which was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022, had identified methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18 b's atmosphere, the first time that carbon-based molecules were discovered in the atmosphere of an exoplanet in a star's habitable zone. \"The only scenario that currently explains all the data obtained so far from JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), including the past and present observations, is one where K2-18 b is a hycean world teeming with life,\" Professor Madhusudhan said.

        "Content": "People arriving in Britain from the EU and other European countries are no longer allowed to bring in a range of meat and dairy products - including cheese. It is part of a move by the UK government to try and stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease from abroad. The new rules, introduced on Saturday 12 April, mean travellers face restrictions on meat from pigs, cows, sheep and goats, as well as dairy items such as milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also include items like sandwiches filled with meat or dairy products, along with cured meats and raw meats - regardless of whether they are packed or packaged or whether they have been bought at duty-free. The restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Britain, and will not be imposed on personal imports from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man. There are currently no reported cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, with the last outbreak in 2007, but there have been confirmed cases this year in Germany in January, and in Hungary and Slovakia last month. The UK government had already banned \"personal imports of cattle, sheep and other ruminants and pig meat as well as dairy products\" from those three countries \"in response to confirmed outbreaks of FMD\". The list of banned items has now been extended to such products from the whole of the EU as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Here's everything you need to know about the restrictions. What does the ban include? The government says you can't bring the following products back from the countries listed above: • Pork• Beef• Lamb• Mutton• Goat• Venison• Other products made from these meats, such as sausages• Milk and dairy products like butter, cheese and yoghurt The government has said you can bring in up to 2kg per person of powdered infant milk, infant food, or special food needed for medical reasons, but only if it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging - unless it is in current use. There are also pet food restrictions: The government says you cannot bring in pig, cow, sheep, goat and deer products that are not for human consumption, like products made with pig meat. You can bring in up to 2kg per person of special pet food needed for medical reasons, as long as it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging. If you are bringing in any other permitted animal products, such as pet food made with chicken meat, they must be either commercially packaged with the manufacturer's name and address or have an animal by-product commercial document. What can people continue to bring in? • Fish• Poultry, such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these meats• Other animal products like eggs and honey And from the EU, Switzerland or Liechtenstein people can bring in the following as well: • Fruit• Vegetables• Nuts and seeds What happens if you break the rules? Banned food products will be taken away and destroyed if you declare them to Border Force officers at customs. The government warns that you could be prosecuted if you do not declare banned food products. Border Force can take away your products if they think you've brought something into the country illegally or brought in too much of a restricted product. They can also throw away any items, including clothing or bags, which they believe has been contaminated by the product - for example with blood from meat. What is foot-and-mouth disease and what has been happening in other countries? The latest restrictions are to \"protect the health of British livestock, the security of farmers, and the UK's food security\", said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Foot-and-mouth is a viral disease which causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats. It poses no risk to humans, but outbreaks often lead to trade restrictions such as the ones in place now. In 2001, the disease led to the culling of millions of animals in the UK and the loss of billions of pounds, prompting a crisis in British farming. There were 2,000 cases, but each case meant a farm having to kill and burn all its livestock, with more than six million sheep, cattle and pigs slaughtered. The first outbreak in Germany for 36 years occurred in January, leading to the precautionary slaughter of 55 goats, sheep and cattle on a farm in Brandenburg. Reports of foot-and-mouth emerged in Hungary in mid-March, with more than 3,500 cattle slaughtered in the country's northern county of Gyor-Moson-Sopron. After the outbreak in Hungary, cases were then reported across five farms in southern Slovakia, prompting the country to declare an emergency. On 2 April, Hungary deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures in the northwest close to border regions to contain the outbreak. Austria then closed 21 crossings into Hungary and two into Slovakia a day later."

The north London side, who became the first English team to win twice at the Bernabeu following their triumph there 19 years ago, will face Paris Saint-Germain in the last four after the French side beat Aston Villa on Tuesday. It is the third time the Gunners have made it through to the semis of the top club football tournament in Europe, and the first since 2009. Arsenal went into the second leg of their quarter-final clash on Wednesday with a 3-0 lead. Backed by a raucous home crowd, Madrid tried to get off to a strong start and Kylian Mbappe scored after two minutes. However, the goal was disallowed for a clear offside. Arsenal had the chance to go ahead in the 13th minute but winger Bukayo Saka missed a penalty.

Arsenal's resolute defending kept the home side at bay until Gabriel Martinelli made a late break through the home side's defence to put his side 2-1 ahead three minutes into injury time, as the Gunners made it 5-1 on aggregate. 'We knew we were going to win', says Rice Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has insisted his team are intent on winning the Champions League after their victory in Madrid. Speaking to TNT Sport, Rice, who was named player of the match, said: \"It's such a special night, a historic one for the club.

        "Content": "Israel's troops will remain in \"security zones\" in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, according to the country's defence minister. Israeli forces have taken over more than half of the Gaza Strip in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure the territory's rulers Hamas to free hostages after a ceasefire ended last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a truce with Hezbollah last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after President Assad's regime was overthrown last December. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said his forces \"will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza - as in Lebanon and Syria\".  He said that \"unlike in the past\" the military was \"not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized\". His comments could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and the release of hostages.  On Wednesday, health officials said Israeli strikes in Gaza killed 22 people, including a girl who was less than a year old. Fifty-nine hostages are still inside Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after dozens of others were previously released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Meanwhile, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Israel's continued presence in some areas in Lebanon was \"hindering\" the Lebanese army's full deployment as required by the ceasefire negotiated with Israel. The war left over 4,000 people dead, many of them civilians. Two Israeli drone strikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday killed two people, the health ministry said. The United Nations said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November.

The war began when militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 51,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. The figure includes more than 1,600 people killed since a ceasefire ended and Israel resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its total count but said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children."

        "Content": "\n          Chief North of England correspondent\n              @GregMilamSky\n  A woman who is under police investigation after assisting the suicide of her husband at Dignitas in Switzerland has told Sky News she has no regrets. Louise Shackleton has spoken publicly for the first time since her husband's death in December, as parliament prepares to vote again on legislation to introduce assisted dying in England and Wales. Mrs Shackleton surrendered herself to police after returning from Switzerland having seen her husband Anthony die. He had been suffering with motor neurone disease for six years. \"I have committed a crime, which I have admitted to, of assisting him by simply pushing him on to a plane and being with him, which I don't regret for one moment. He was my husband and I loved him,\" she said. \"We talked at length over two years about this. What he said to me on many occasions is 'look at my options, look at what my options are. I can either go there and I can die peacefully, with grace, without pain, without suffering or I could be laid in a bed not being able to move, not even being able to look at anything unless you move my head'. \"He didn't have options. What he wanted was nothing more than a good death.\" The law in the UK prohibits people from assisting in the suicide of others, but prosecutions have been rare. In a statement, a North Yorkshire Police spokesman told Sky News: \"The investigation is ongoing. There is nothing further to add at this stage.\" The next vote on the assisted dying bill for England and Wales has been delayed by three weeks to give MPs time to consider amendments. The legislation would permit a person who is terminally ill with less than six months to live to legally end their life after approval by two doctors and an expert panel. 'He was at total peace with his decision'  Mrs Shackleton says she saw her husband \"physically and mentally\" relax once on the flight to Switzerland. She said: \"We had the most wonderful four days. \"He was laughing. He was at total peace with his decision. \"It was in those four days that I realised that he wanted the peaceful death more than he wanted to suffer and stay with me, which was hard, but that's how resolute he was in having this peace. \"I was his wife, we'd been together 25 years, we'd known each other since we were 18. I couldn't do anything else but help him.\" 'We need to safeguard people' She said the hardest part of the journey came after her husband's death. \"There was this panic and this fear that I was leaving him,\" she said. \"That was a horrific experience. \"If the law had changed in this country, I would have been with family, family would have been with us, family would've been with him. But as it was, that couldn't happen.\" Opponents to the assisted dying bill have raised concerns about the safety of vulnerable people and the risk of coercion and a change in attitudes toward the elderly, seriously ill and disabled. They say improvements to palliative care should be a priority. \"I think that we need to safeguard people,\" said Mrs Shackleton. \"I think that sometimes we need to suffer other people's choices, and when I mean suffer I mean we have to acknowledge that whilst we're not comfortable with those, that we need to respect other people, other people wishes.\" Read more:Assisted dying: What is in the legislation?Debate over assisted dying delayed  Anthony, who died aged 59, was a furniture restorer who had earned worldwide recognition for making rocking horses. \"I think the measure of the man is that nobody has ever said a bad word about him in the whole of his life because he was just so caring and giving,\" his widow said. 'This is about a dying person's choice' She said she had chosen to speak publicly because of a promise she had made him. \"I felt that my husband's journey shouldn't be in vain. We discussed this on our last day and my husband made me promise to tell his story. \"He told me to fight and the simple thing that I'm fighting for is people to have the choice. \"This is about a dying person's choice to either follow their journey through with disease or to die peacefully when they want to, on their terms, and have a good death. It's that simple.\""

        "Content": " A former Labour MP who quit the party over Sir Keir Starmer's leadership has welcomed the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman as a \"victory for feminists\". Rosie Duffield, now the independent MP for Canterbury, said the judgment helped resolve the \"lack of clarity\" that has existed in the politics around the issue \"for years\". She was speaking to Ali Fortescue on the Politics Hub on the same day the UK's highest court delivered its verdict on one of the most contentious debates in politics. Politics latest: MPs respond to Supreme Court ruling on gender  The judges were asked to rule on how \"sex\" is defined in the 2010 Equality Act - whether that means biological sex or \"certificated\" sex, as legally defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. Their unanimous decision was that the definition of a \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". Asked what she made about comments by fellow independent MP John McDonnell - who said the court \"failed to hear the voice of a single trans person\" and that the decision \"lacked humanity and fairness\" as a result, she said: \"This ruling doesn't affect trans people in the slightest. \"It's about women's rights - women's rights to single sex spaces, women's rights, not to be discriminated against. \"It literally doesn't change a single thing for trans rights and that lack of understanding from a senior politician about the law is a bit worrying, actually.\" However, Maggie Chapman, a Scottish Green MSP, disagreed with Ms Duffield and said she was \"concerned\" about the impact the ruling would have on trans people \"and for the services and facilities they have been using and have had access to for decades now\". \"One of the grave concerns that we have with this ruling is that it will embolden people to challenge trans people who have every right to access services,\" she said. \"We know that over the last few years... their [trans people's] lives have become increasingly difficult, they have been blocked from accessing services they need.\"  Delivering the ruling at the London court on Wednesday, Lord Hodge said: \"But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another. It is not. \"The Equality Act 2010 gives transgender people protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender. \"This is the application of the principle of discrimination by association. Those statutory protections are available to transgender people, whether or not they possess a gender recognition certificate.\" Read more:Supreme Court decision has immediate real-world consequencesPrisons across England and Wales now 98.9% full Asked whether she believed the judgment could \"draw a line\" under the culture war, Ms Chapman told Fortescue: \"Today's judgment only stokes that culture war further.\" And she said that while Lord Hodge was correct to say there were protections in law for trans people in the 2020 Equality Act, the judgment \"doesn't prevent things happening\". \"It may offer protections once bad things have happened, once harassment, once discrimination, once bigotry, once assaults have happened,\" she said. She also warned some groups \"aren't going to be satisfied with today's ruling\". \"We know that there are individuals and there are groups who actually want to roll back even further - they want to get rid of the Gender Recognition Act from 2004,\" she said. \"I think today's ruling just emboldens those views.\""

The north London side, who became the first English team to win twice at the Bernabeu following their triumph there 19 years ago, will face Paris Saint-Germain in the last four after the French side beat Aston Villa on Tuesday. It is the third time the Gunners have made it through to the semis of the top club football tournament in Europe, and the first since 2009. Arsenal went into the second leg of their quarter-final clash on Wednesday with a 3-0 lead. Backed by a raucous home crowd, Madrid tried to get off to a strong start and Kylian Mbappe scored after two minutes. However, the goal was disallowed for a clear offside. Arsenal had the chance to go ahead in the 13th minute but winger Bukayo Saka missed a penalty.

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  After a dramatic weekend with ministers passing legislation to wrest control of British Steel from its Chinese owners, Labour's China policy is under the spotlight. Sir Keir Starmer's government came in, promising a \"strategic and long term\" relationship with Beijing, after years of \"inconsistency\" under the Conservatives. David Lammy went on the first trip by a foreign secretary in six years. Sir Keir met Xi Jinping in the margins of the G20 in November and floated a UK-China visit. Rachel Reeves went to the Chinese capital in January, saying her trip had secured £600m of growth for the UK economy.  Politics latest: Record number of migrants cross the English Channel Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds appeared to turn the tables this weekend, suggesting Chinese parent company Jingye had neglected or even sabotaged British Steel after buying it five years ago. He told Sky News he would not personally \"bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\". He changed his tune on Tuesday, while visiting Scunthorpe to oversee the delivery of a shipment of materials, saying the row was just with one company. It's now emerged he is expected to travel to China later this year, to restart a joint economic and trade commission which has been on ice since 2018. But this is no return to the golden age of some years back. Tensions in government over China may well emerge in the coming months - as the Treasury's drive for investment and growth jars with concerns over security. Ministers are discussing whether parts of the Chinese state should be designated a national security threat, under new rules on foreign influence, due to come in this summer. Russia and Iran will be covered by the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme - but ministers are yet to say anything about China. Applying it even in a limited way would be controversial with large companies and within government - seen as a barrier to doing business.  The Treasury's view is that engagement with the world's second largest economy is essential to economic growth. Ed Miliband's energy department is pursuing big clean energy projects, many of them backed by Chinese investment. Wholly state-owned companies already own stakes in Heathrow Airport and Thames Water. While Huawei was dramatically banned from the UK's 5G network back in 2020, Chinese companies fund nuclear power, and the National Grid network. Senior Conservatives, some sanctioned by the Chinese government, have been vocal about what they see as national security risks from this approach. A report by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee in 2023 said China had penetrated \"every sector\" of the UK economy. It warned that \"Chinese money was readily accepted by HM Government with few questions asked\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Some Labour MPs view this with growing concern. One senior MP, speaking privately, said: \"The problem is it costs billions of pounds to build reservoirs and nuclear reactors, and we're not raising that from taxes, so China is where we get that investment. \"There are significant concerns in the party - whether it's about the security of critical sectors, espionage, or concerns about the use of slave labour in their products.\" Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business and trade committee, said there needed to be clearer ground rules on Chinese investment.

China is now embroiled in a trade war with the US, and the global trade rules are changing. The tension emerging is whether economic growth overrides security concerns."

        "Content": "People arriving in Britain from the EU and other European countries are no longer allowed to bring in a range of meat and dairy products - including cheese. It is part of a move by the UK government to try and stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease from abroad. The new rules, introduced on Saturday 12 April, mean travellers face restrictions on meat from pigs, cows, sheep and goats, as well as dairy items such as milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also include items like sandwiches filled with meat or dairy products, along with cured meats and raw meats - regardless of whether they are packed or packaged or whether they have been bought at duty-free. The restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Britain, and will not be imposed on personal imports from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man. There are currently no reported cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, with the last outbreak in 2007, but there have been confirmed cases this year in Germany in January, and in Hungary and Slovakia last month. The UK government had already banned \"personal imports of cattle, sheep and other ruminants and pig meat as well as dairy products\" from those three countries \"in response to confirmed outbreaks of FMD\". The list of banned items has now been extended to such products from the whole of the EU as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Here's everything you need to know about the restrictions. What does the ban include? The government says you can't bring the following products back from the countries listed above: • Pork• Beef• Lamb• Mutton• Goat• Venison• Other products made from these meats, such as sausages• Milk and dairy products like butter, cheese and yoghurt The government has said you can bring in up to 2kg per person of powdered infant milk, infant food, or special food needed for medical reasons, but only if it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging - unless it is in current use. There are also pet food restrictions: The government says you cannot bring in pig, cow, sheep, goat and deer products that are not for human consumption, like products made with pig meat. You can bring in up to 2kg per person of special pet food needed for medical reasons, as long as it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging. If you are bringing in any other permitted animal products, such as pet food made with chicken meat, they must be either commercially packaged with the manufacturer's name and address or have an animal by-product commercial document. What can people continue to bring in? • Fish• Poultry, such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these meats• Other animal products like eggs and honey And from the EU, Switzerland or Liechtenstein people can bring in the following as well: • Fruit• Vegetables• Nuts and seeds What happens if you break the rules? Banned food products will be taken away and destroyed if you declare them to Border Force officers at customs. The government warns that you could be prosecuted if you do not declare banned food products. Border Force can take away your products if they think you've brought something into the country illegally or brought in too much of a restricted product. They can also throw away any items, including clothing or bags, which they believe has been contaminated by the product - for example with blood from meat. What is foot-and-mouth disease and what has been happening in other countries? The latest restrictions are to \"protect the health of British livestock, the security of farmers, and the UK's food security\", said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Foot-and-mouth is a viral disease which causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats. It poses no risk to humans, but outbreaks often lead to trade restrictions such as the ones in place now. In 2001, the disease led to the culling of millions of animals in the UK and the loss of billions of pounds, prompting a crisis in British farming. There were 2,000 cases, but each case meant a farm having to kill and burn all its livestock, with more than six million sheep, cattle and pigs slaughtered. The first outbreak in Germany for 36 years occurred in January, leading to the precautionary slaughter of 55 goats, sheep and cattle on a farm in Brandenburg. Reports of foot-and-mouth emerged in Hungary in mid-March, with more than 3,500 cattle slaughtered in the country's northern county of Gyor-Moson-Sopron. After the outbreak in Hungary, cases were then reported across five farms in southern Slovakia, prompting the country to declare an emergency. On 2 April, Hungary deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures in the northwest close to border regions to contain the outbreak. Austria then closed 21 crossings into Hungary and two into Slovakia a day later."

        "Content": " The Northern Lights were spotted in the UK on Tuesday - and could return again tonight. Known as the aurora borealis, they are typically seen further north in countries like Iceland and northern parts of Finland, Norway and Canada. But after being spotted in northern parts of the UK on Tuesday night, geomagnetic activity has spiked again on Wednesday afternoon, opening the door to it returning. It comes after recent months have seen the Northern Lights make repeated returns to the UK. This is because the Sun is currently undergoing its solar maximum, the peak of its 11-year cycle of activity. During this, there is an increased number of sunspots, which means there's a greater chance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. These, in turn, can lead to the Northern Lights being visible on Earth. \n                  Threat of heavy rain, storms and flash floods mark end to Britain's sun\n                 \n                  UK may be on track to see worst year for wildfires, data shows\n                 \n                  UK weather: Temperatures to soar up to 23C in some areas today - as warning issued by fire brigade\n                 The sightings overnight on Tuesday coincided with a spike in geomagnetic activity caused by a CME. Later on Wednesday afternoon, geomagnetic activity spiked again, according to AuroraWatch UK, a site run by Lancaster University, to red alert levels more than double those seen on Tuesday night - raising the prospect of a repeat. According to the university, a red alert means \"it is likely that aurora will be visible by eye and camera from anywhere in the UK.\" However, chances of seeing the aurora on Wednesday night took a hit because the CME that reached Earth on Tuesday has now passed, and because northern areas, where it tends to be most visible, look like they will see overcast cloud cover with some rain. The south will have clearer skies, but it's less likely to reach as far. Similarly, there will be some associated effects from the CME on Tuesday, but it isn't clear how strong these will be. What's the best way to capture them? While the Northern Lights are visible to the naked eye, the colours often appear faint and muted compared to those captured by camera. To take better pictures of the aerial phenomena, Adobe recommends using manual camera settings and a wide aperture on a camera. It suggests using low shutter speeds, up to 20 seconds, as well as setting the camera's ISO value all the way to 2,000 or higher - such settings are usually available in smartphones' camera settings. What causes the Northern Lights? The shimmering spectacle occurs when energy and charged particles released from the sun through CMEs and solar flares travel towards Earth on the solar wind. They then collide with the Earth's magnetic field and upper atmosphere, interacting with gases to create spectacular displays of blue, purple, green, pink and red.

        "Content": "The White House has hit out at an \"appalling\" attempt by a Democratic senator to return a father wrongly deported to El Salvador. Chris Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to speak to the country's leaders about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the US by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Washington acknowledged Mr Garcia was deported due to an \"administrative error\". The US Supreme Court has called on the administration to facilitate his return, upholding a court order by Judge Paula Xinis, but Trump officials have claimed Mr Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang.  Mr Garcia's lawyers have argued there is no evidence of this. Speaking about Mr Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Democrats \"still refuse to accept the will of the American people\". She alleged Mr Garcia was an \"illegal alien MS-13 terrorist\" and claimed his wife petitioned for court protection against him after alleged incidents of domestic violence. After outlining the allegations against Mr Garcia, she went on: \"All of that is not enough to stop the Democrat Party from their lies. \"The number one issue they are focused on right now is bringing back this illegal alien terrorist to America. \"It's appalling and sad that Senator Van Hollen and the Democrats are plotting his trip to El Salvador today, are incapable of having any shred of common sense or empathy for their own constituents and our citizens.\" After making a statement, Ms Leavitt introduced Patty Morin, who described graphic details of her daughter's murder by an immigrant from El Salvador. Rachel Morin was raped and murdered by Victor Martinez-Hernandez along a popular hiking trail northeast of Baltimore. Afterwards, Ms Leavitt left without taking any questions from reporters. Senator travels to El Salvador Mr Van Hollen met with the El Salvador vice president during his trip to the Central American country. But he did not meet with President Nayib Bukele, who publicly met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office this week, nor did he meet Mr Garcia himself. In a post on X, he said he would continue to fight for Mr Garcia's return. During Mr Bukele's trip to the White House earlier this week, he said he would not return Mr Garcia, likening it to smuggling \"a terrorist into the United States\". Along with Mr Garcia, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, mostly Venezuelans, who it claims are gang members without presenting evidence and without a trial.  Judge's contempt warning It comes hours after a US federal judge warned that he could hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. The comments are an escalation in a row which began last month when US district judge James E Boasberg issued an order temporarily blocking the deportations. However, lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air - one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Mr Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be turned around, but the directive was not included in his written order. The Trump administration then denied refusing to comply. Charges could be brought forward by the Justice Department, NBC News, Sky's US partner network, reported.

If the executive-led Justice Department refused to prosecute the matter, Judge Boasberg said he would appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt. The judge wrote: \"The Constitution does not tolerate wilful disobedience of judicial orders - especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it.\" He gave the government a 23 April deadline. White House director of communications Steven Cheung said the administration would seek \"immediate appellate relief\" - a review of a decision within a lower court before the case has been resolved."

        "Content": "Israel's troops will remain in \"security zones\" in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, according to the country's defence minister. Israeli forces have taken over more than half of the Gaza Strip in recent weeks in a renewed campaign to pressure the territory's rulers Hamas to free hostages after a ceasefire ended last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a truce with Hezbollah last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after President Assad's regime was overthrown last December. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said his forces \"will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza - as in Lebanon and Syria\".  He said that \"unlike in the past\" the military was \"not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized\". His comments could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and the release of hostages.  On Wednesday, health officials said Israeli strikes in Gaza killed 22 people, including a girl who was less than a year old. Fifty-nine hostages are still inside Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after dozens of others were previously released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Meanwhile, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Israel's continued presence in some areas in Lebanon was \"hindering\" the Lebanese army's full deployment as required by the ceasefire negotiated with Israel. The war left over 4,000 people dead, many of them civilians. Two Israeli drone strikes in southern Lebanon on Wednesday killed two people, the health ministry said. The United Nations said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 51,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. The figure includes more than 1,600 people killed since a ceasefire ended and Israel resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its total count but said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children."

Using the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists found traces of two gases - dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) - on a planet named K2-18 b. On Earth, those gases are generated primarily by living organisms including algae, suggesting K2-18 b could be teeming with microbial life. Researchers have stressed the findings are not an announcement of the discovery of actual living organisms, but rather an indicator of a biological process. K2-18 b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo, is 8.6 times as massive as Earth and has a diameter about 2.6 times as large as our planet. It orbits in the \"habitable zone\" - a distance where liquid water, a key ingredient for life, can exist on a planetary surface.

        "Content": "Iran appears to have hit out at the decision to change the venue of its latest nuclear talks with the US from Oman to Italy, saying the \"goalposts were being moved\" as it blamed \"hawks\". Esmaeil Baghaei, a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry, seemed to reference the switch of location to Rome for the second round of negotiations this weekend when he said moving the goalposts in diplomacy could be seen as a \"lack of seriousness\". It had earlier been announced that the talks about Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear programme would resume in Oman.   Writing on X, Mr Baghaei said moving the goalposts in football \"constitutes a professional foul and an unfair act\". He added that in diplomacy \"any such shifting… could simply risk any overtures falling apart\". Mr Baghaei said the move had been pushed by \"hawks who fail to grasp the logic/art of commonsense deal-making\". And he said the decision \"could be perceived as a lack of seriousness, let alone good faith\". \"We're still in testing mode,\" he said. During the first round of talks in Oman last weekend, the host nation's officials mediated between representatives of Iran and the US, who were seated in separate rooms, according to Mr Baghaei. After the meeting, Oman's foreign minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi thanked Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff for joining the negotiations aimed at \"global peace, security and stability\", in an X post. \"We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,\" he added. It comes as the US announced new sanctions which will target shipping companies' oil tankers under its Iran-related programme. Tehran defiant over enriching uranium Mr Araghchi has said Iran's right to enrich uranium is not negotiable ahead of the second round of talks. The discussions began last Saturday with Oman acting as a mediator in the capital Muscat. They were the first between the two adversaries under US President Donald Trump who has threatened military action if there is no deal. Both sides described the initial talks as positive and constructive. Mr Araghchi was reacting on Wednesday after Mr Witkoff said the Islamic Republic must \"stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment\" to reach a deal with Washington. 'Contradictory statements from Witkoff' The foreign minister was quoted by Iranian state media in Tehran as saying: \"We have heard contradictory statements from Witkoff, but real positions will be made clear at the negotiating table. \"We are ready to build trust regarding possible concerns over Iran's enrichment, but the principle of enrichment is not negotiable.\" According to Western countries, Iran is refining uranium to a high degree of fissile purity - more than what is justifiable for a civilian energy programme and close to the level suitable for atomic bomb fuel.

It is part of a move by the UK government to try and stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease from abroad. The new rules, introduced on Saturday 12 April, mean travellers face restrictions on meat from pigs, cows, sheep and goats, as well as dairy items such as milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also include items like sandwiches filled with meat or dairy products, along with cured meats and raw meats - regardless of whether they are packed or packaged or whether they have been bought at duty-free. The restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Britain, and will not be imposed on personal imports from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man. There are currently no reported cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, with the last outbreak in 2007, but there have been confirmed cases this year in Germany in January, and in Hungary and Slovakia last month. The UK government had already banned \"personal imports of cattle, sheep and other ruminants and pig meat as well as dairy products\" from those three countries \"in response to confirmed outbreaks of FMD\".

The government says you can't bring the following products back from the countries listed above: • Pork• Beef• Lamb• Mutton• Goat• Venison• Other products made from these meats, such as sausages• Milk and dairy products like butter, cheese and yoghurt The government has said you can bring in up to 2kg per person of powdered infant milk, infant food, or special food needed for medical reasons, but only if it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging - unless it is in current use. There are also pet food restrictions: The government says you cannot bring in pig, cow, sheep, goat and deer products that are not for human consumption, like products made with pig meat. You can bring in up to 2kg per person of special pet food needed for medical reasons, as long as it does not need to be refrigerated before use, and is in branded, unopened packaging. If you are bringing in any other permitted animal products, such as pet food made with chicken meat, they must be either commercially packaged with the manufacturer's name and address or have an animal by-product commercial document. What can people continue to bring in? • Fish• Poultry, such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these meats• Other animal products like eggs and honey And from the EU, Switzerland or Liechtenstein people can bring in the following as well: • Fruit• Vegetables• Nuts and seeds What happens if you break the rules? Banned food products will be taken away and destroyed if you declare them to Border Force officers at customs. The government warns that you could be prosecuted if you do not declare banned food products. Border Force can take away your products if they think you've brought something into the country illegally or brought in too much of a restricted product. They can also throw away any items, including clothing or bags, which they believe has been contaminated by the product - for example with blood from meat. What is foot-and-mouth disease and what has been happening in other countries? The latest restrictions are to \"protect the health of British livestock, the security of farmers, and the UK's food security\", said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Foot-and-mouth is a viral disease which causes fever and mouth blisters in cloven-hoofed ruminants such as cattle, swine, sheep and goats. It poses no risk to humans, but outbreaks often lead to trade restrictions such as the ones in place now. In 2001, the disease led to the culling of millions of animals in the UK and the loss of billions of pounds, prompting a crisis in British farming. There were 2,000 cases, but each case meant a farm having to kill and burn all its livestock, with more than six million sheep, cattle and pigs slaughtered. The first outbreak in Germany for 36 years occurred in January, leading to the precautionary slaughter of 55 goats, sheep and cattle on a farm in Brandenburg. Reports of foot-and-mouth emerged in Hungary in mid-March, with more than 3,500 cattle slaughtered in the country's northern county of Gyor-Moson-Sopron. After the outbreak in Hungary, cases were then reported across five farms in southern Slovakia, prompting the country to declare an emergency. On 2 April, Hungary deployed soldiers and launched new disinfection measures in the northwest close to border regions to contain the outbreak. Austria then closed 21 crossings into Hungary and two into Slovakia a day later."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @ConnorSephton\n Peru's former president Ollanta Humala has been sentenced to 15 years in jail for money laundering. His wife Nadine Heredia received the same punishment, but she has been granted asylum after entering the Brazilian embassy in Lima. The couple were found guilty of receiving $3m (£2.3m) in illegal contributions from a Brazilian construction firm called Odebrecht. That cash was used to finance Humala's presidential campaigns in 2006 and 2011, with his lawyer describing the sentence as \"excessive\". Odebrecht previously admitted it had doled out bribes to governments across Latin America to build a vast empire, and it is currently going through bankruptcy. Humala, a 62-year-old retired military officer, was jailed immediately - and the National Superior Court's verdict means he will be behind bars until 2039.

A police base has been specially built to accommodate the country's jailed leaders - and it is likely Humala will serve his sentence there alongside Toledo. His lawyers have vowed to appeal once the final ruling is issued later this month, and argue prosecutors failed to prove that the funds had come from an illegal source.

Fernando Quintalla, a resident who lives in Lima, said he was \"totally displeased\" that Humala's wife had been granted asylum. He added: \"I believe that the Peruvian population is really upset, extremely upset, with this string of (various) presidents - who since 2000 until now - have been plaguing us with an incredible corruption that has never been seen before in the country.\""

Measuring just 30cm long, the juvenile squid was spotted at a depth of 600m (1,968ft) near the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. Experts believe colossal squid eventually grow up to 7m (23ft) in length - and can weigh up to 500kg (1,100lbs). That's equivalent to a Fiat 500 car, making it the heaviest invertebrate on the planet. The footage was captured by crew on board the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Falkor (too) vessel, with a remotely operated vehicle called SuBastian filming the video.

The colossal squid remains shrouded in mystery - and while little is known about their lifecycle, adults eventually lose the see-through appearance of juveniles.

        "Content": "The White House has hit out at an \"appalling\" attempt by a Democratic senator to return a father wrongly deported to El Salvador. Chris Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to speak to the country's leaders about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the US by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Washington acknowledged Mr Garcia was deported due to an \"administrative error\". The US Supreme Court has called on the administration to facilitate his return, upholding a court order by Judge Paula Xinis, but Trump officials have claimed Mr Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang.  Mr Garcia's lawyers have argued there is no evidence of this. Speaking about Mr Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Democrats \"still refuse to accept the will of the American people\". She alleged Mr Garcia was an \"illegal alien MS-13 terrorist\" and claimed his wife petitioned for court protection against him after alleged incidents of domestic violence. After outlining the allegations against Mr Garcia, she went on: \"All of that is not enough to stop the Democrat Party from their lies. \"The number one issue they are focused on right now is bringing back this illegal alien terrorist to America. \"It's appalling and sad that Senator Van Hollen and the Democrats are plotting his trip to El Salvador today, are incapable of having any shred of common sense or empathy for their own constituents and our citizens.\" After making a statement, Ms Leavitt introduced Patty Morin, who described graphic details of her daughter's murder by an immigrant from El Salvador. Rachel Morin was raped and murdered by Victor Martinez-Hernandez along a popular hiking trail northeast of Baltimore. Afterwards, Ms Leavitt left without taking any questions from reporters. Senator travels to El Salvador Mr Van Hollen met with the El Salvador vice president during his trip to the Central American country. But he did not meet with President Nayib Bukele, who publicly met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office this week, nor did he meet Mr Garcia himself. In a post on X, he said he would continue to fight for Mr Garcia's return. During Mr Bukele's trip to the White House earlier this week, he said he would not return Mr Garcia, likening it to smuggling \"a terrorist into the United States\". Along with Mr Garcia, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, mostly Venezuelans, who it claims are gang members without presenting evidence and without a trial.  Judge's contempt warning It comes hours after a US federal judge warned that he could hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. The comments are an escalation in a row which began last month when US district judge James E Boasberg issued an order temporarily blocking the deportations. However, lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air - one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Mr Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be turned around, but the directive was not included in his written order. The Trump administration then denied refusing to comply. Charges could be brought forward by the Justice Department, NBC News, Sky's US partner network, reported.

If the executive-led Justice Department refused to prosecute the matter, Judge Boasberg said he would appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt. The judge wrote: \"The Constitution does not tolerate wilful disobedience of judicial orders - especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it.\" He gave the government a 23 April deadline. White House director of communications Steven Cheung said the administration would seek \"immediate appellate relief\" - a review of a decision within a lower court before the case has been resolved."

        "Content": "US stock markets suffered more significant losses on Wednesday, with stocks in leading AI chipmakers slumping after firms said new restrictions on exports to China would cost them billions. Nvidia fell 6.87% - and was at one point down 10% - after revealing it would now need a US government licence to sell its H20 chip. Rival chipmaker AMD slumped 7.35% after it predicted a $800m (£604m) charge due to its MI308 also needing a licence. Dutch firm ASML, which makes hardware essential to chip manufacturing, fell more than 5% after it missed order expectations and said US tariffs created uncertainty. The losses filtered into the tech-dominated Nasdaq index, which recovered slightly to end 3% down, while the larger S&P 500 fell 2.2%. Such losses would have been among the worst in years were it not for the turmoil over recent weeks. It comes as China remains the focus of Donald Trump's tariff regime, with both countries imposing tit-for-tat charges of over 100% on imports. The US commerce department said in a statement it was \"committed to acting on the president's directive to safeguard our national and economic security\".  Nvidia's bespoke China chip is already deliberately less powerful than products sold elsewhere after intervention from the previous Biden administration. However, the Trump government is worried the H20 and others could still be used to build a supercomputer in China, threatening national security and US dominance in AI. Nvidia said the move would cost it around $5.5bn (£4.1bn) and the licensing requirement would be in place for the \"indefinite future\". Nvidia's recently announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment to build infrastructure in America - something Mr Trump heralded as a victory in his mission to boost US manufacturing. However, it appears to have been too little to stave off the new restrictions. Pressure has also come from the Democrats, with senator Elizabeth Warren writing to the commerce secretary and urging him to limit chip sales to China. Meanwhile, the head of US central bank also warned on Wednesday that US tariffs could slow the economy and raise inflation more than expected. Jerome Powell said the bank would need more time to decide on lowering interest rates. \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated,\" he said. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\" Predictions of a recession in the US have risen significantly since the president revealed details of the import taxes a few weeks ago. However, he subsequently paused the higher rates for 90 days to allow for negotiations."

The video captured by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office shows officers inside and outside the property in northern New Mexico, with a German shepherd barking at some points as they carry out their search. The bodies of Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found in separate rooms of their home on 26 February. \"He's guarding her,\" a male officer can be heard saying, about the dog found alive at the home. \"He seems pretty friendly.\" There is another \"10-7 dog\" - meaning the pet is dead - \"round the corner in the kennel\", the officer says. Authorities also released a report detailing some of Arakawa's last emails and internet searches, revealing she was investigating information on flu-like symptoms, COVID-19, and breathing techniques before she died. Rat nests and dead rodents were also discovered in several outbuildings around the property, an environmental assessment by the New Mexico Department of Health revealed. The inside of the home was clean and showed no evidence of rodent activity. In March, a medical investigator concluded Arakawa died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare infectious disease that can be caused by exposure to rodents. Hackman had advanced Alzheimer's and died from heart disease about a week later, with data from his pacemaker last registering on 18 February.

Search history on the morning of 12 February showed she was looking into a medical concierge service in Santa Fe. Investigators said there was a call to the service which lasted under two minutes, and a follow-up call from them later that afternoon was missed. The police footage shows officers checking the home and finding no signs of forced entry or other suspicious signs. What is hantavirus? HPS, commonly known as hantavirus disease, is a respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses - which are carried by several types of rodents. It is a rare condition in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. This was the first confirmed case in New Mexico this year. There has so far been no confirmation about any potential link by authorities between the rodents and the hantavirus disease that claimed Arakawa's life. Who was Gene Hackman? Hackman was a former Marine whose work on screen began with an uncredited TV role in 1961. Acting became his career for many years, and he went on to play villains, heroes and antiheroes in more than 80 films spanning a range of genres. He was best known by many for playing evil genius Lex Luthor in the Superman films in the late 1970s and '80s, and won Oscars for his performances in The French Connection and Unforgiven. After roles in The Royal Tenenbaums, Behind Enemy Lines and Runaway Jury in the 2000s, he left acting behind after his final film, Welcome To Mooseport. He and Arakawa, a pianist, had been together since the mid-1980s."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n Post Office auditor and big four accounting firm EY is being investigated by the industry's regulator. Accounting and audit watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said the investigation related to EY's 2015 to 2018 audits of Post Office accounts and the faulty accounting software, Horizon IT. The regulator will be examining the role of EY in meeting the auditing standards, the FRC said. Money: Best mobile phone providers ranked  The Horizon computer programme, made by Fujitsu, wrongly generated financial shortfalls. This led many sub-postmasters to take on significant debt to repay the imagined losses, causing some to lose homes, become bankrupt, suffer ill health, and experience relationship breakdown. Evidence from Horizon was used to prosecute hundreds of innocent sub-postmasters for theft and false accounting. It is understood that the years from 2015 and 2018 were selected, as looking at a longer period of time would slow down the investigation, which would not be in the public interest. \n                  Sir Alan Bates urges victims of Post Office scandal to take govt to court over compensation delays\n                 \n                  Former sub-postmaster Lee Castleton becomes first individual to sue Post Office and Fujitsu after uncovering 'fraud'\n                 \n                  Post Office scandal: Fujitsu agrees to talks about contributing to victims' compensation\n                  Information available to the FRC has to pass a threshold for an investigation to be launched, as the body does not undertake such examinations with the hope of making a discovery. By 2015, the scandal had been reported on in the media, and the Post Office ceased bringing prosecutions using Horizon data. Towards the end of 2015, 555 sub-postmasters instigated legal proceedings against the Post Office that would lead to the public admission of Horizon flaws. The last prosecution with Horizon data is believed to have been in 2014.

It had been the auditor of Royal Mail since 1986, when Royal Mail and the Post Office were a single entity, and since the split-off of the businesses in 2013. What next? The FRC announcing this investigation neither precludes nor indicates further inquiries into EY audits across other years, Sky News understands. While it is not possible to know how long the investigation will take, 50% of FRC cases are concluded within two years and 80% finish within three years. The regulator can hit a firm with financial penalties or apply mitigation policies to a company to improve standards. The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry ran for two-and-a-half years to establish a clear account of the introduction and failure of Horizon, but its scope did not include the role or knowledge of external auditors. Its developments had been monitored, the FRC said. Responding to the announcement, EY said: \"We take our public interest responsibilities extremely seriously and will be fully cooperating with the FRC during their investigation.\""

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A serial investor in consumer and retail businesses is in talks to buy a big stake in the German Doner Kebab (GDK) chain as it seeks to promote itself as a day-round destination for hungry diners. Sky News has learnt that True, which has backed companies including the energy drinks manufacturer Sneak and Ray Studios, a tattoo removal specialist, is proposing to make the investment at what casual dining industry sources described as a \"stellar valuation\". GDK is currently part of Hero Brands, a Glasgow-based incubator of food and beverage concepts. The chain, which is run by chief executive Simon Wallis, will open its 150th UK outlet next month as it seeks to capitalise on a surge in demand. GDK has embarked on a marketing campaign with the slogan 'Doners worthy of the daylight' in recent months as it tries to dispel the notion that doner kebabs are primarily a food choice for inebriated late-night consumers. In recent media interviews, Mr Wallis has remarked on the challenge associated with changing that perception. \"Essentially, the great British public have got this association [with kebabs] that you only ever eat them at about 2.30am,\" he told MailOnline last month. \n                  Inflation continues to fall but expect an April rebound due to across-the-board bill hikes\n                 \n                  Money: Best mobile phone providers ranked after UK survey - and big names don't fare well\n                 \n                  Post Office auditor EY under investigation by accounting regulator FRC\n                 He added that just 4% of its sales were generated after 11pm. GDK operates a franchise model, and is said to have much more ambitious expansion plans in gestation. Further details of the proposed transaction between True and Hero Brands were unclear on Wednesday. A number of other bidders are said to have held talks with Hero Brands earlier in the process, with one party which looked at making an investment in the business saying that bankers at Cavendish had been orchestrating the process. True Capital declined to comment, while Hero Brands has been contacted for comment and a spokesperson for GDK could not be reached."

EE, O2, Three and Vodafone, all of whom are charging annual price rises, were outshone by the likes of Smarty, Voxi and Talkmobile in customer scores collected by Which?. Read all the latest Money news here With that in mind, our Money team joined forces with the consumer champion to produce a guide to getting a good deal - from perks to haggling, roaming charges to annual price hikes. Here Which?'s head of home products and services Natalie Hitchins gives her top tips... Best perks right now Some of the best perks on the market are the data flexibility and data roaming offered by the smaller providers. \n                  Inflation continues to fall but expect an April rebound due to across-the-board bill hikes\n                 \n                  Money: Best mobile phone providers ranked after UK survey - and big names don't fare well\n                 \n                  Post Office auditor EY under investigation by accounting regulator FRC\n                 Several providers offer free EU roaming. iD Mobile and Lebara offer 30GB of roaming, Smarty offers 12GB and Talkmobile and Giffgaff both offer 5GB. At GiffGaff, you can change the data allowance on your 18-month contract as needed - meaning you aren't stuck paying for data you don't need if your circumstances change. Voxi also offers data-free use of social media, video and music streaming apps. Some providers, like Sky and iD Mobile, also allow you to roll over unused data. This means low data users can opt for a cheap deal and still have the security of top-ups from any data that's gone unused the previous month. Don't pay more than £8 a month for sim-only contract The biggest mistake most people make is paying more than £8 a month for a sim-only contract. You can get great rolling sim-only deals with plenty of data from smaller providers - like Smarty, Talkmobile and Voxi - for a fraction of the cost of the big four providers. It's always worth shopping around and checking prices at the smaller providers before you settle on a contract. Another common mistake is paying for more data than you need. Our research has found that although 17% of people are paying for unlimited data, only 13% of consumers use more than 20GB per month. Check the signal Check what the signal is like in your area before you decide on a network - you can do this using the Ofcom website and by checking the website of the provider you're looking to switch to. If you're still unsure or want evidence of which is the best, you can just get a one-month sim-only deal with a network and see how it performs, then try a different one next month. Consider second-hand If you're in the market for a new phone and aren't bothered about having the latest model, don't overlook second-hand websites. Our research shows you can get good savings on a smartphone by looking at the second-hand and refurbished market. Comparison sites or buy direct? Comparison sites can be a really good place to start to get an understanding of what's available and what might be the best deal for you. The most important decision to make before you start shopping around is whether you'd be better off on a bundled contract with a phone, or a sim-only contract where you use your existing phone, or buy one outright. Which? has a mobile contract calculator you can use to decide which type of contract is best for you. Can you haggle? Absolutely! Haggling is expected by providers and is a good opportunity to discuss the elements of your deal and upgrade or downgrade if the package doesn't quite fit your needs. Our latest research found that the average mobile customer saved £61 a year by haggling, but this was bested by an average of £58 for both O2 and Vodafone customers and a startlingly high £101 for EE customers. Mid-contract price hikes Look out for any annual price rises included in the contract. For sim-only contracts with the big four providers - EE, O2, Three and Vodafone - customers will see their bill increase by £1 to £1.80 a month from this month and for those on bundled contracts with EE, costs will increase by £4 a month. Most smaller providers do not impose mid-contract price hikes so Which? would recommend choosing one of these over the big four for a cheap, flexible sim-only deal. You should also check what the extra charges are if you use more than your texts, calls or data allowance. Read more:'I paid a builder £500 and they ghosted me'How to complain in a restaurantBritish passports have just got more expensive  Exit fees and contract length Importantly, make sure you know how long a contract lasts - typically it'll be 24 months, 12 or one month. If your contract is longer than one month, check what the exit fees are if you need to get out of the contract early - this helps to ensure you don't encounter any nasty surprises down the road. Choosing a rolling one-month contract will give you flexibility if you want to switch to a different provider. Roaming charges It's also worth looking out for details of any roaming charges when you join as some networks will charge you to send texts, make calls and use data abroad. Smaller providers often allow you to use your data, calls and texts allowance for free in Europe with no additional charges."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n A British health technology company which uses AI to conduct skin cancer tests within five minutes has landed £15m in a funding round led by a leading global financier. Sky News has learnt that Skin Analytics, whose derm device has been shown to diagnose the disease with a 99.9% accuracy rate, will this week announce the closing of its series B fundraising. Skin Analytics, whose partnership with London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital was branded a world first, plans to use its injection of capital to broaden its capability across the spectrum of dermatological concerns. The funding round has been led by Intrepid Growth Partners, an AI-focused growth investor founded by Mark Machin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who more recently was chief executive of CPPIB, the giant Canadian pension fund. Intrepid was also jointly founded by Mark Shulgan, a former executive at OMERS, another Canadian pension fund, and Ajay Agrawal, an expert on the economics of AI at the University of Toronto. Skin Analytics describes its mission as \"building a future where nobody dies of skin cancer\". DERM is said to be the world's first legally authorised AI medical device which can make clinical decisions on skin cancer without being reviewed by a doctor. \n                  Inflation continues to fall but expect an April rebound due to across-the-board bill hikes\n                 \n                  Money: Best mobile phone providers ranked after UK survey - and big names don't fare well\n                 \n                  Post Office auditor EY under investigation by accounting regulator FRC\n                 Skin Analytics believes it can help tackle a bottleneck in the diagnosis of skin cancers, with an average of just 30 dermatologists per one million people in Europe. Its AI medical device has been deployed at 26 NHS sites, with DERM able to autonomously discharge up to 40% of urgent suspected skin cancer referrals. The company claims that NHS trusts across England which have deployed DERM have reduced unnecessary face-to-face dermatology appointments by up to 95%, easing pressure on NHS resources. Neil Daly, founder and CEO of Skin Analytics, said: \"AI allows us to move from a world of specialist scarcity to one where we have the capacity to see everyone who is concerned about their skin. \"Starting with skin cancer, this funding allows us to work with our partners to build new models of care that everyone can access, whenever they want to\" Founded in 2012, Skin Analytics says it has seen more than 150,000 NHS patients and detected more than 14,000 cancers. Mr Machin said Skin Analytics was an example of a company which reflected Intrepid's Focus on \"transformative machine intelligence-driven solutions that address critical challenges\". \"Their technology is redefining early skin cancer detection, improving patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. \"We are excited to support their growth as they scale their impact globally.\""

        "Content": "\n          Asia correspondent\n              @HelenAnnSmith0\n China's economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of the year - but it reflects a moment in time before the explosive trade war with the US, which has seen the world's two biggest economies effectively decouple. Economists had predicted that gross domestic product would grow by about 5.1% in January to March, compared with a year earlier. In the end, it grew 5.4%. But these impressive figures obscure the very serious challenges China's economy is facing in the wake of Donald Tump's trade war - and it is almost certain growth will not remain this strong as the year goes on.  The worst of Trump's tariffs came into force in April, meaning they were not reflected in these figures. In Q1, China faced an initial 10% tariff on all its exports to the US - which was then raised to 20% from 10 March. But Beijing had planned and prepared for taxes at that level, and thus the impact was pretty minimal. Growth was also propelled by the fact that exporters rushed to deliver orders in bulk before the tariffs came into force. \n                  US markets fall as AI chipmakers mourn new restrictions on China exports\n                 \n                  Labour's policy on China under the spotlight\n                 \n                  From Shanghai to Scunthorpe - what's China's influence on UK industry?  \n                 In fact, exports surged a remarkable 12% in March compared to a year earlier, a rate that will not be sustained. Read more from Sky News:White House looking at new trade dealsThe art of doing a deal with TrumpUS and UK 'working hard' on agreement  Current tariffs on goods sold from China to America stand at 145%. Trade at that price is all but impossible. Given exports account for a fifth of China's economy, and consumer confidence domestically is still sluggish, there will be a significant hit to come. Experts agree China will most likely miss its annual growth target of 5% - the question is by how much."

        "Content": " A former Labour MP who quit the party over Sir Keir Starmer's leadership has welcomed the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman as a \"victory for feminists\". Rosie Duffield, now the independent MP for Canterbury, said the judgment helped resolve the \"lack of clarity\" that has existed in the politics around the issue \"for years\". She was speaking to Ali Fortescue on the Politics Hub on the same day the UK's highest court delivered its verdict on one of the most contentious debates in politics. Politics latest: MPs respond to Supreme Court ruling on gender  The judges were asked to rule on how \"sex\" is defined in the 2010 Equality Act - whether that means biological sex or \"certificated\" sex, as legally defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. Their unanimous decision was that the definition of a \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to \"a biological woman and biological sex\". Asked what she made about comments by fellow independent MP John McDonnell - who said the court \"failed to hear the voice of a single trans person\" and that the decision \"lacked humanity and fairness\" as a result, she said: \"This ruling doesn't affect trans people in the slightest. \"It's about women's rights - women's rights to single sex spaces, women's rights, not to be discriminated against. \"It literally doesn't change a single thing for trans rights and that lack of understanding from a senior politician about the law is a bit worrying, actually.\" However, Maggie Chapman, a Scottish Green MSP, disagreed with Ms Duffield and said she was \"concerned\" about the impact the ruling would have on trans people \"and for the services and facilities they have been using and have had access to for decades now\". \"One of the grave concerns that we have with this ruling is that it will embolden people to challenge trans people who have every right to access services,\" she said. \"We know that over the last few years... their [trans people's] lives have become increasingly difficult, they have been blocked from accessing services they need.\"  Delivering the ruling at the London court on Wednesday, Lord Hodge said: \"But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another. It is not. \"The Equality Act 2010 gives transgender people protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender. \"This is the application of the principle of discrimination by association. Those statutory protections are available to transgender people, whether or not they possess a gender recognition certificate.\" Read more:Supreme Court decision has immediate real-world consequencesPrisons across England and Wales now 98.9% full Asked whether she believed the judgment could \"draw a line\" under the culture war, Ms Chapman told Fortescue: \"Today's judgment only stokes that culture war further.\" And she said that while Lord Hodge was correct to say there were protections in law for trans people in the 2020 Equality Act, the judgment \"doesn't prevent things happening\". \"It may offer protections once bad things have happened, once harassment, once discrimination, once bigotry, once assaults have happened,\" she said. She also warned some groups \"aren't going to be satisfied with today's ruling\". \"We know that there are individuals and there are groups who actually want to roll back even further - they want to get rid of the Gender Recognition Act from 2004,\" she said. \"I think today's ruling just emboldens those views.\""

        "Content": " Hitting potholes is \"all too common\", a minister has insisted amid scrutiny of the government's claim that new road measures will save drivers £500 a year. Lillian Greenwood told Sky News Breakfast with Anna Jones that people face \"eyewatering\" costs if a pothole causes more damage to their car than a puncture, with the average repair job setting them back by £460, according to the RAC. Politics Live: UK in 'discussions' with France over migrant returns deal This, along with the continued freeze on fuel duty, will save drivers over £500 a year, the government has said, claiming its interventions are easing the cost-of-living crisis for drivers. It was put to Ms Greenwood that the savings only apply if you hit a pothole in the first place. Asked if she thinks it's a common occurrence, she said: \"Unfortunately, it's all too common. And because we've had more than 10 years of the Conservatives under investing in our road network, that's left it absolutely cratered with potholes.\" She said potholes are \"probably the biggest issue\" when she doorsteps constituents, adding: \"They're really angry about the state of their local roads. \n                  More than 1,000 miles of roadworks lifted to allow 'smooth' Easter getaway\n                 \n                  Lower Thames Crossing plan for Kent and Essex approved - 16 years after work on road scheme started\n                 \n                  'Self-healing roads' could help fix pothole problem, scientists say\n                 \"Far too many people are hitting a pothole and finding they're having to fork out to get their car fixed.\" Earlier this year, an annual industry report estimated that 17% of the local road network in England and Wales are in poor condition. It predicted that the one-time catch-up cost to clear the backlog of maintenance issues would cost £16.81bn and take 12 years to complete. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's autumn budget contained a £1.6bn investment to maintain roads and fix potholes, which it said was an increase of £500m on the 2024-25 budget. Local authorities will get the first tranche of that money this month. It comes ahead of the local elections in May, when support for drivers could become a dividing line.

She said the government has left decisions on Low Traffic Neighbourhoods to local authorities and many people \"want to see drivers going slower\". The government's announcement on savings today came alongside a pledge to remove 1,000 miles of roadworks over the Easter weekend in a bid to cut journey times. The works will be reinstated after Easter Monday. However, bank holiday engineering works on the railway lines will not be halted, meaning there will be disruption for people who don't have a car.

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n The government is facing a backlash for \"slipping out\" cuts to the amount that families can access for adopted children to have therapy. The Fair Access Limit (FAL) will be reduced from £5,000 to £3,000 as part of a package of changes to the Adoption and Special Guardianship Support Fund (ASGSF), which helped nearly 20,000 children last year. Politics Live: Judges rule on definition of a woman - as campaigners celebrate The cuts were confirmed in an email to the sector over parliament's Easter recess rather than through a formal announcement. The email, seen by Sky News, says the ASGSF will continue from April 2025 with a budget of £50m, the same as last year, but there will be changes to how it is allocated. This includes cutting the limit of grants for therapy by 40% and scrapping a separate allowance of £2,500 for specialist assessments. Specialist assessments up to the level of £2,500 will be considered for funding, but only within the overall limit of £3,000. \n                  Feminists 'feel braver about speaking out' after gender ruling - but critics say it 'stokes culture war'\n                 \n                  Politics latest: MPs respond to Supreme Court ruling on gender\n                 \n                  Government claims car interventions will save £500 a year - but only if you hit a pothole\n                 In addition, the government will no longer match fund more expensive therapy above the limits. The letter said: \"We recognise that this is a significant change, but it is being made to ensure that the funding can continue to support as many families as possible. \"The Adoption and Special Guardianship Fund will still enable those eligible to access a significant package of therapeutic support, tailored to meet their individual needs.\" The ASGSF helped 16,333 children in the year 2023/24, up from 14,862 the previous financial year. 'Deep concerns' Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson criticised the government for \"slipping out\" the changes during recess, despite her raising an urgent question in the Commons on 1 April over whether the funding would continue. At the time, children and families minister Janet Daby responded to confirm £50m had been allocated overall and apologised for the delay in saying so, but didn't mention the cuts. The future of the ASGSF had been in doubt up until then, as it was due to run out in March 2025. In a letter to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, Ms Wilson said it is \"unacceptable the government took so long to confirm the fund and even more unacceptable that MPs were provided with incomplete information\". She called on ministers to reverse the \"deeply concerning\" cuts, saying she and her parliamentary colleagues have been contacted by constituents \"sharing the deeply traumatic stories children in their care have experienced\". She said the changes will have a \"huge impact on the quality of life\" for vulnerable children and even in light of the fiscal challenges \"cannot be justified\". 'Most adopted children have suffered abuse or neglect' Charities have also hit out at the government with Adoption UK saying the decision is a consequence of \"belt tightening across government\". The organisation says around 3,000 children in England are placed in adoptive families each year, and most have suffered abuse, neglect, or violence and spend an average of 15 months in care before adoption - so need therapy for most of their life. CEO Emily Frith said: \"These decisions will have a direct impact on children and young people who have had a very tough start in life and deserve the same chance to thrive as everyone else. \"It's very short-sighted at a time when there are more adoptive families in crisis than ever before, and distressing news for everyone who has already faced an agonising wait to find out whether the fund will continue to exist at all.\" Kinship, which supports people who step in to raise a friend or family member's child, warned 13% of carers are concerned about their ability to carry on because of behavioural difficulties stemming from trauma and loss, so the cuts risk family breakdowns and \"children entering an already overstretched care system\". Both charities called on the government to rethink the changes at the June Spending Review, when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her plans for spending and key public sector reforms for future years. Ms Reeves is under pressure after announcing a raft of cuts in her spring statement, after poor economic growth and global instability wiped out her fiscal headroom. The chancellor is determined to keep the headroom as part of her self-imposed fiscal rules, which require day-to-day spending to be met through tax receipts rather than borrowing. But there is concern the headroom is even more fragile amid Donald Trump's global trade tariffs, meaning further cuts or tax rises could be on the cards. The Department for Education has been contacted for comment."

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  After a dramatic weekend with ministers passing legislation to wrest control of British Steel from its Chinese owners, Labour's China policy is under the spotlight. Sir Keir Starmer's government came in, promising a \"strategic and long term\" relationship with Beijing, after years of \"inconsistency\" under the Conservatives. David Lammy went on the first trip by a foreign secretary in six years. Sir Keir met Xi Jinping in the margins of the G20 in November and floated a UK-China visit. Rachel Reeves went to the Chinese capital in January, saying her trip had secured £600m of growth for the UK economy.  Politics latest: Record number of migrants cross the English Channel Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds appeared to turn the tables this weekend, suggesting Chinese parent company Jingye had neglected or even sabotaged British Steel after buying it five years ago. He told Sky News he would not personally \"bring a Chinese company into our steel sector\". He changed his tune on Tuesday, while visiting Scunthorpe to oversee the delivery of a shipment of materials, saying the row was just with one company. It's now emerged he is expected to travel to China later this year, to restart a joint economic and trade commission which has been on ice since 2018. But this is no return to the golden age of some years back. Tensions in government over China may well emerge in the coming months - as the Treasury's drive for investment and growth jars with concerns over security. Ministers are discussing whether parts of the Chinese state should be designated a national security threat, under new rules on foreign influence, due to come in this summer. Russia and Iran will be covered by the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme - but ministers are yet to say anything about China. Applying it even in a limited way would be controversial with large companies and within government - seen as a barrier to doing business.  The Treasury's view is that engagement with the world's second largest economy is essential to economic growth. Ed Miliband's energy department is pursuing big clean energy projects, many of them backed by Chinese investment. Wholly state-owned companies already own stakes in Heathrow Airport and Thames Water. While Huawei was dramatically banned from the UK's 5G network back in 2020, Chinese companies fund nuclear power, and the National Grid network. Senior Conservatives, some sanctioned by the Chinese government, have been vocal about what they see as national security risks from this approach. A report by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee in 2023 said China had penetrated \"every sector\" of the UK economy. It warned that \"Chinese money was readily accepted by HM Government with few questions asked\". 👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈 Some Labour MPs view this with growing concern. One senior MP, speaking privately, said: \"The problem is it costs billions of pounds to build reservoirs and nuclear reactors, and we're not raising that from taxes, so China is where we get that investment. \"There are significant concerns in the party - whether it's about the security of critical sectors, espionage, or concerns about the use of slave labour in their products.\" Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business and trade committee, said there needed to be clearer ground rules on Chinese investment. Read more:'Likely' British Steel will be nationalisedWas Reynolds nobbled by Number 10 over China? \"If we want to stay ahead of our adversaries, we've got to make sure that we're not handing the most advanced technology to our adversaries,\" he said. \"We need a clear definition of economic security from the government, we need a clear threat assessment, and we need a clear way in which business and government are going to work hand in hand to keep our country safe in what are now very different and more dangerous times.\" After a rebuke from the Chinese embassy, which defended the actions of Jingye, the government insists nothing has changed in the relationship. China is now embroiled in a trade war with the US, and the global trade rules are changing. The tension emerging is whether economic growth overrides security concerns."

Britain would then receive migrants from France who would have a right to be in the UK, like those who already have family settled in the UK. Government minister Lilian Greenwood told Sky News: \"I can confirm there are discussions ongoing with the French government about how we stop this appalling and dangerous trade in people that's happening across the English Channel. \"We want to make sure that we are returning people, as we have been since the election, in record numbers, where people don't have a right to be here.\" It comes as 705 people arrived in the UK by small boat on Tuesday - a record number for this year. While Ms Greenwood did not elaborate on the details, the measure does form part of Labour's policy on illegal immigration, announced in May 2024, in which Sir Keir Starmer argued for \"fast-track reforms\" to the asylum system with \"an enforcement unit and a returns agreement with the EU\". \n                  Asylum system leading people to 'consider taking their own lives', says charity\n                 \n                  GPS-tagged asylum seeker trial ended with no benefit, Home Office says\n                 \n                  Government contract ends for controversial asylum barge Bibby Stockholm\n                 Sir Keir vowed in the election campaign to tackle people smuggling by \"smashing the gangs\" and deter migrants making the potentially dangerous, and sometimes deadly, crossing to the UK by small boat. On Wednesday, a government source told Sky News: \"We have always said we would explore options to increase returns to Europe, particularly prioritising family reunion and respect for the rules... so safe to assume conversations are happening with a range of countries including France.\" Read more from Sky News:Asylum applications at record highClaims could be processed overseasAsylum system leading people to suicide A Home Office spokesperson added: \"The prime minister and home secretary have been clear the UK and France must work closely together to prevent dangerous small boat crossings, particularly on vital law enforcement cooperation. \"We have already secured agreement from the French to deploy a new elite unit of officers at the coast, launch a specialist intelligence unit, increase police numbers and introduce new powers for the French authorities to intervene in shallow waters.\" \"We are intensifying our collaboration with France and other European countries who face the same challenges by exploring fresh and innovative measures to dismantle the business models of the criminal smuggling gangs.\" The start of 2025 has been the busiest year so far for crossings since records began in 2018."

        "Content": "Scientists have found what they are calling the strongest sign yet of possible life beyond our solar system after detecting the chemical footprint of gases in an alien planet's atmosphere that on Earth are only produced by living organisms. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists found traces of two gases - dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) - on a planet named K2-18 b. On Earth, those gases are generated primarily by living organisms including algae, suggesting K2-18 b could be teeming with microbial life. Researchers have stressed the findings are not an announcement of the discovery of actual living organisms, but rather an indicator of a biological process. K2-18 b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo, is 8.6 times as massive as Earth and has a diameter about 2.6 times as large as our planet. It orbits in the \"habitable zone\" - a distance where liquid water, a key ingredient for life, can exist on a planetary surface. Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, said it was a \"transformational moment in the search for life beyond the solar system\". \n                  US markets fall as AI chipmakers mourn new restrictions on China exports\n                 \n                  Spotify down: Streaming app suffers major outage - as company confirms 'issues'\n                 \n                  'The end of 4chan as we know it': Why hacking attack could kill notorious internet forum\n                 \"We have entered the era of observational astrobiology,\" Professor Madhusudhan said.

        "Content": "US stock markets suffered more significant losses on Wednesday, with stocks in leading AI chipmakers slumping after firms said new restrictions on exports to China would cost them billions. Nvidia fell 6.87% - and was at one point down 10% - after revealing it would now need a US government licence to sell its H20 chip. Rival chipmaker AMD slumped 7.35% after it predicted a $800m (£604m) charge due to its MI308 also needing a licence. Dutch firm ASML, which makes hardware essential to chip manufacturing, fell more than 5% after it missed order expectations and said US tariffs created uncertainty. The losses filtered into the tech-dominated Nasdaq index, which recovered slightly to end 3% down, while the larger S&P 500 fell 2.2%. Such losses would have been among the worst in years were it not for the turmoil over recent weeks. It comes as China remains the focus of Donald Trump's tariff regime, with both countries imposing tit-for-tat charges of over 100% on imports. The US commerce department said in a statement it was \"committed to acting on the president's directive to safeguard our national and economic security\".  Nvidia's bespoke China chip is already deliberately less powerful than products sold elsewhere after intervention from the previous Biden administration. However, the Trump government is worried the H20 and others could still be used to build a supercomputer in China, threatening national security and US dominance in AI. Nvidia said the move would cost it around $5.5bn (£4.1bn) and the licensing requirement would be in place for the \"indefinite future\". Nvidia's recently announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment to build infrastructure in America - something Mr Trump heralded as a victory in his mission to boost US manufacturing. However, it appears to have been too little to stave off the new restrictions. Pressure has also come from the Democrats, with senator Elizabeth Warren writing to the commerce secretary and urging him to limit chip sales to China. Meanwhile, the head of US central bank also warned on Wednesday that US tariffs could slow the economy and raise inflation more than expected. Jerome Powell said the bank would need more time to decide on lowering interest rates. \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated,\" he said. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\" Predictions of a recession in the US have risen significantly since the president revealed details of the import taxes a few weeks ago. However, he subsequently paused the higher rates for 90 days to allow for negotiations."

        "Content": "\n          News reporter\n              @ConnorSephton\n  A colossal squid has been filmed in its natural environment for the first time - exactly 100 years after the species was first identified.  The footage was recorded in March by a team of international scientists on an expedition searching for new marine life. Measuring just 30cm long, the juvenile squid was spotted at a depth of 600m (1,968ft) near the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. Experts believe colossal squid eventually grow up to 7m (23ft) in length - and can weigh up to 500kg (1,100lbs). That's equivalent to a Fiat 500 car, making it the heaviest invertebrate on the planet. The footage was captured by crew on board the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Falkor (too) vessel, with a remotely operated vehicle called SuBastian filming the video. Experts from the University of Plymouth and the British Antarctic Survey were among those involved in the 35-day quest. \n                  Biden bans oil and gas drilling along most of US coastline - weeks before Trump takes office\n                 \n                  One of the world's rarest whales may have washed up on New Zealand beach, say experts\n                 \n                  Stranded sailors rescued from remote Pacific island after spelling 'HELP' with palm tree leaves\n                 Dr Kat Bolstad, who helped verify the footage, says that - until now - colossal squid had mainly been encountered as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs. \"It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,\" she added. The colossal squid remains shrouded in mystery - and while little is known about their lifecycle, adults eventually lose the see-through appearance of juveniles. Another distinguishing characteristic of this species - formally known as Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni - is the presence of hooks on the middle of their eight arms.

        "Content": "\n          Culture and entertainment reporter\n              @gemmapeplow\n  Body camera footage of Gene Hackman's home has been released by authorities investigating the deaths of the actor and his wife. The video captured by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office shows officers inside and outside the property in northern New Mexico, with a German shepherd barking at some points as they carry out their search. The bodies of Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found in separate rooms of their home on 26 February. \"He's guarding her,\" a male officer can be heard saying, about the dog found alive at the home. \"He seems pretty friendly.\" There is another \"10-7 dog\" - meaning the pet is dead - \"round the corner in the kennel\", the officer says. Authorities also released a report detailing some of Arakawa's last emails and internet searches, revealing she was investigating information on flu-like symptoms, COVID-19, and breathing techniques before she died. Rat nests and dead rodents were also discovered in several outbuildings around the property, an environmental assessment by the New Mexico Department of Health revealed. The inside of the home was clean and showed no evidence of rodent activity. In March, a medical investigator concluded Arakawa died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare infectious disease that can be caused by exposure to rodents. Hackman had advanced Alzheimer's and died from heart disease about a week later, with data from his pacemaker last registering on 18 February. Read more:What is hantavirus?The reluctant star who turned his back on Hollywood According to the records now released by the county sheriff's office, Arakawa was researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu between 8 February and the morning of 12 February. In one email to a masseuse, she said Hackman had woken on 11 February with flu or cold-like symptoms and that she wanted to reschedule an appointment \"out of an abundance of caution\". Search history on the morning of 12 February showed she was looking into a medical concierge service in Santa Fe. Investigators said there was a call to the service which lasted under two minutes, and a follow-up call from them later that afternoon was missed. The police footage shows officers checking the home and finding no signs of forced entry or other suspicious signs. What is hantavirus? HPS, commonly known as hantavirus disease, is a respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses - which are carried by several types of rodents. It is a rare condition in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. This was the first confirmed case in New Mexico this year. There has so far been no confirmation about any potential link by authorities between the rodents and the hantavirus disease that claimed Arakawa's life. Who was Gene Hackman? Hackman was a former Marine whose work on screen began with an uncredited TV role in 1961. Acting became his career for many years, and he went on to play villains, heroes and antiheroes in more than 80 films spanning a range of genres. He was best known by many for playing evil genius Lex Luthor in the Superman films in the late 1970s and '80s, and won Oscars for his performances in The French Connection and Unforgiven. After roles in The Royal Tenenbaums, Behind Enemy Lines and Runaway Jury in the 2000s, he left acting behind after his final film, Welcome To Mooseport. He and Arakawa, a pianist, had been together since the mid-1980s."
