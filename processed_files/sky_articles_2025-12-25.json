        "Content": "The US has launched airstrikes against Islamic State militant \"scum\" in Nigeria, Donald Trump has said. US Africa Command said the strikes were conducted \"in coordination with Nigerian authorities\" in Sokoto State, while a US official told the Reuters news agency the strikes killed multiple targets. Announcing the military intervention on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump said: \"Tonight, at ‌my direction as Commander ‌in Chief, the United States launched ​a powerful and deadly strike against ‍ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting ‌and viciously killing, primarily, ⁠innocent Christians, ‌at levels not seen ‍for many years, and even Centuries! \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing. \"Under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper.\" On X, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar [Department of War] is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight - on Christmas. More to come...\" \n                  Families reunited with kidnapped Nigerian schoolchildren in time for Christmas\n                 \n                  130 children and staff abducted from Nigerian school last month freed 'in time for Christmas'\n                 \n                  Abducted Nigerian children reunited with parents - but 150 still being held\n                 He added he was grateful to the Nigerian government for its \"support and cooperation\". Following the updates from US officials, Nigeria's foreign ministry confirmed ​that ​precision ‍air strikes by the ‌US had hit \"terrorist targets\" ​in the country's ‍north west. It said the country was cooperating with the US in \"addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism\".

His government also designated Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act and said it would restrict visas for Nigerians and their family members involved in mass killings and violence against Christians in the West African country. Nigeria's population is split between ‌Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south. The Nigerian government previously said Mr Trump's claims that Christians face persecution there is a misrepresentation of the country's complex security challenges, and that armed groups also target Muslims - but it has agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against terrorist activity. After the US strikes, Nigeria's foreign ministry said: \"Nigeria reiterates that all counter-terrorism efforts are guided by the primacy of protecting civilian lives, safeguarding national unity, and upholding the rights and dignity of all citizens, irrespective of faith or ethnicity. Terrorist violence in any form whether directed at Christians, Muslims, or other communities remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security.\" Last month, one of the country's biggest mass abduction saw more than 300 students taken from a catholic school in northern Nigeria. They were all freed by 22 December."

Ukraine's President Zelenskyy posted on Telegram to say he had spoken to the US's Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner \"for nearly an hour\". \"It was truly a good conversation: many details, good ideas, and we discussed them,\" he said. \"We have some new ideas on how to bring real peace closer, and this concerns formats, meetings, and of course, timing.\""

The pontiff later toured the square in the \"popemobile\" before giving the traditional Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) blessing. Speaking from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, he referenced conflicts in countries such as Sudan, Thailand and Cambodia - and said Ukrainians in particular had been \"tormented by violence\". \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue,\" said the Pope. The Archbishop of York, meanwhile, said in his own sermon that he had been \"intimidated\" by Israeli militias in the Holy Land earlier this year. He called the visit \"sobering\" and said he was \"stopped at various checkpoints and intimidated by local Israeli militias who told us that we couldn't visit Palestinian families in the occupied West Bank\". The Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell added: \"The strangers we encounter in the homeless on our streets, refugees seeking asylum, young people robbed of opportunity and growing up without hope for the future, means that we are in danger of even failing to welcome Christ when he comes.\" The King's Christmas message - recorded in Westminster Abbey - will be broadcast at 3pm. He and other members of the Royal Family attended church in Sandringham this morning."

        "Content": "A powerful atmospheric river storm has swept across California, forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes. Widespread flash flooding occurred on Christmas Eve in the south of the US state as a result of torrential rain. In one mountain resort, debris and mud was filmed cascading down roads and fast-moving water was seen rushing through the porch of several homes. The US National Weather Service said \"life-threatening atmospheric river conditions\" will continue throughout Christmas Day, with a rare \"high risk of excessive rainfall\" warning remaining in effect. A man was killed by a falling tree in San Diego on Wednesday, local news reported; and a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died in what appeared to be a storm-related vehicle crash. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow what he referred to as \"emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe\". An estimated 130 evacuation orders were issued to vulnerable homes, Los Angeles County officials said, many of which are in the same area that was scorched by wildfires at the beginning of the year. Southern California typically gets up to 2.5cm of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see 10 to 20cm, with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that carry water vapour in the atmosphere from tropical regions.   When making landfall, water vapour is released in the form of rain or snow. Atmospheric rivers occur around the globe but are especially significant on the West Coast of the United States - making up 30% to 50% of annual precipitation. Not all atmospheric rivers cause destruction and actually play a key part in the global water cycle. However due to Earth warming up, atmospheric rivers are getting bigger, wetter and more frequent, according to a 2025 study published in the Journal of Climate. Heavy snow and gusts were expected to create \"near white-out conditions\" in parts of the Sierra Nevada and make travel \"nearly impossible\" through mountain passes. There was also a \"considerable\" avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, according to the Sierra Avalanche Centre. More than 165,000 homes have had power restored after experiencing outages due to the storm, according to the provider Pacific Gas and Electric.

        "Content": "\n          Royal correspondent\n              @SkyRhiannon\n The King's message has alluded to the Bondi Beach and Manchester synagogue attacks as he paid tribute to those who show \"spontaneous bravery\" and put \"themselves in harm's way to defend others\". The monarch shared a powerful message about the need for kindness, compassion and hope \"in times of uncertainty\", \"as we hear of division both at home and abroad\". He also appeared to encourage us all to switch off from our gadgets for a while to \"allow our souls to renew\". In his annual message, with an overriding theme of pilgrimage, the King used the traditional Christmas story, the journey of the holy family, the shepherds and wise men visiting Jesus, to reflect on the challenges faced in society today. \"In each case,\" he said, \"they journeyed with others; and relied on the companionship and kindness of others. Through physical and mental challenge, they found an inner strength. \"To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope: of resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.\" The monarch did not mention specific examples of division in the UK or global conflicts, but his message appears to be one with a strong social purpose, underlining his desire to use his role to help build better relations across different communities and between countries. \n                  Andrew's daughters join Royal Family in Sandringham without their father on Christmas Day\n                 \n                  Kate and Princess Charlotte perform surprise piano duet for Christmas carol service show\n                 \n                  Prince William and Prince George help prepare Christmas lunch for the homeless\n                 It is emphasised by the appearance of the Songs for Ukraine Chorus choir. Founded in 2023 in response to the war in Ukraine, it brings together singers from across the Ukrainian community and supporters living in the UK. The carol they sang inside Westminster Abbey, Carol of the Bells, is based on a song by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych. The King has hosted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on several occasions this year to show his support. In a year in which the Royal Family joined veterans to celebrate the 80th Anniversaries of VE and VJ Day, the King also reflected on the importance of learning from that wartime generation. \"The courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all,\" he said, adding: \"These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. \"As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.\" 'In harm's way to defend others' In a very up-to-date addition to the message, pictures are shown of the aftermath of the Bondi Beach attack, alongside images of the King's visit to the scene of the Manchester synagogue attack, as he talks about the bravery of unexpected heroes. \"This year, I have heard so many examples of this, both here and abroad,\" he said. \"These stories of the triumph of courage over adversity give me hope, from our venerable military veterans to selfless humanitarian workers in this century's most dangerous conflict zones; to the ways in which individuals and communities display spontaneous bravery, instinctively placing themselves in harm's way to defend others. \"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common; a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" the King said. \"If we can find time in our journey through life to think on these virtues, we can all make the future more hopeful.\" The King also appeared to encourage us all to switch off from our gadgets, saying: \"Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds - in T.S. Eliot's words: 'At the still point of the turning world' - and allow our souls to renew.\" 'Digital detox' Asked about the phrasing, a palace source said the King \"has in mind the effect that new technologies can have on society\". They added: \"I think His Majesty hopes that, if nothing else, Christmas might afford a moment when people could experiment with something of a 'digital detox' to focus more on our friendships, our families and our faith for those who practise. \"In this way, the King hopes our minds may find greater peace, our souls can renew, and our communities grow stronger.\" Royal correspondent It's a rare time of the year when the King can speak without seeking any guidance or advice from the government, which is what makes his annual Christmas message particularly personal and an insight into what really matters to him. While the King doesn't mention any specific examples of division in the UK or global conflicts, his message, with its heavy emphasis on community - and we're told the themes of \"kindness, compassion and hope\" - appears to be one with a strong social purpose, and hints at his desire to play his part in healing divisions between communities and different countries. Listening to him, you can't help but feel there is an underlying nod to the protests we've seen in the UK on migration, the St George flag movement, conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. The appearance of a choir from Ukraine is the only clear display of a conflict he wants to draw attention to. The late addition of pictures from the aftermath of the Bondi Beach attack, an example of the importance he puts on being connected to all parts of the Commonwealth and what matters to people right now. It's the most outward, rather than inward-looking message - deliberately so we're told.  There is nothing personal in it. No mentions of his health, and certainly no nods to what has been a very difficult year for the royals. His message about learning from the past, as we continue to face difficult times, undoubtedly has its own resonance when you consider the headlines around his brother this week and more widely during 2025. But, as he also encourages us to take a break from our screens, it's the broader message he conveys and how it relates to us all, that he would rather we focus on as we head into 2026. Read more from Sky News:Kate and Princess Charlotte do piano duet for ChristmasWhat it's like celebrating Christmas where it's banned The message featured the usual mixture of footage of members of the Royal Family visiting all four nations and carrying out overseas tours. Westminster Abbey was seen as a perfect location to reflect the theme of pilgrimage, as pilgrims visit every year to remember the legacy of Edward the Confessor, whose shrine lies at the heart of the abbey, and because of its strong royal connections. The message is always seen as a deeply personal one from the monarch, as a rare speech delivered by the King without advice from, or consultation with, the government."

        "Content": "Weather warnings and a cold health alert have been issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day - as forecasters said those hoping for a white Christmas are likely to be disappointed. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued the yellow alert for the south west of England from 6pm on 25 December to midday on 27 December. The alert warns of a \"greater risk to life of vulnerable people\", as well as an \"increased use of healthcare services\" among that group. However, Sky News weather producer, Joanna Robinson, says, there is a less than 10% chance that showers across south west England will bring snow to high ground. But in Jersey, the meteorological department said snowflakes were seen early in the morning - making it the third official white christmas since their records began. The last time is believed to be 1970. In the UK, the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for wind in the South West and Wales, with the forecaster warning of potential disruption due to strong, gusty winds from 4am until midnight. Wind speeds of 45-55mph are expected, with highs of 65mph in coastal regions. \"Given the more unusual wind direction, this may lead to some disruption to transport and power supplies,\" the Met Office said, adding that \"large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts\". Blustery conditions have already prompted the cancellation of numerous swimming events planned for Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Organisers of the Coverack swim in Cornwall said the annual event has been postponed until New Year's Day to ensure everyone's safety, while the Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was \"really sad\" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled due to rough seas. Elsewhere in the country, temperatures are expected to peak around 7C in the North East of England and 6C in the South East. Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said it was \"highly unlikely\" the UK will see a white Christmas this year, adding: \"We've got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days.\" Travellers warned get 'road ready' The switch to colder weather may also lead to a rise in breakdowns on the road, the RAC has warned. It says for those still planning to travel drivers should ensure their vehicles are \"road ready\" before setting off, which includes \"checking tyres are free of damage; have plenty of tread and are properly inflated; and ensuring oil and coolant levels are correct; headlights are adjusted according to the load being carried\". Travel disruption was felt on the road and rail on Christmas Eve, when an expected 4.2 million people travelled by car for festive getaways, according to the RAC. A fatal collision on the London-bound M2, between junctions 5 and 4 - near the Medway services - caused the road to close just after midday. A 20-year-old woman from the Faversham area was pronounced dead at the scene, Kent Police said.

The closure will affect journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth - a signed diversion via the A27 will be in place but delays are expected between 10am and 4pm daily."

The pontiff later toured the square in the \"popemobile\" before giving the traditional Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) blessing. Speaking from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, he referenced conflicts in countries such as Sudan, Thailand and Cambodia - and said Ukrainians in particular had been \"tormented by violence\". \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue,\" said the Pope. The Archbishop of York, meanwhile, said in his own sermon that he had been \"intimidated\" by Israeli militias in the Holy Land earlier this year. He called the visit \"sobering\" and said he was \"stopped at various checkpoints and intimidated by local Israeli militias who told us that we couldn't visit Palestinian families in the occupied West Bank\". The Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell added: \"The strangers we encounter in the homeless on our streets, refugees seeking asylum, young people robbed of opportunity and growing up without hope for the future, means that we are in danger of even failing to welcome Christ when he comes.\" The King's Christmas message - recorded in Westminster Abbey - will be broadcast at 3pm. He and other members of the Royal Family attended church in Sandringham this morning."

Following the updates from US officials, Nigeria's foreign ministry confirmed ​that ​precision ‍air strikes by the ‌US had hit \"terrorist targets\" ​in the country's ‍north west.

Nigeria's population is split between ‌Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south. The Nigerian government previously said Mr Trump's claims that Christians face persecution there is a misrepresentation of the country's complex security challenges, and that armed groups also target Muslims - but it has agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against terrorist activity. After the US strikes, Nigeria's foreign ministry said: \"Nigeria reiterates that all counter-terrorism efforts are guided by the primacy of protecting civilian lives, safeguarding national unity, and upholding the rights and dignity of all citizens, irrespective of faith or ethnicity. Terrorist violence in any form whether directed at Christians, Muslims, or other communities remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security.\" Last month, one of the country's biggest mass abduction saw more than 300 students taken from a catholic school in northern Nigeria.

        "Content": "By Nick Alipour, news reporter  At Christmas, the world can seem a little more humane than usual - even in wartime. One such glimpse of peace appears each year in what is widely considered the world's longest-running communist insurgency. Fought in the Philippines, the guerrilla conflict between the Maoist New People's Army (NPA) and the government is set to enter its 57th year in 2026 and has claimed some 60,000 lives. But once a year, the fighting tends to pause as both sides down their arms for Christmas. The tradition has been observed in many years since at least 1986, a rare moment of restraint in a world that is now more violent than at any point since the Second World War. According to the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), the number of conflicts involving states reached its highest level since 1946 at the end of last year. In all, 61 conflicts were active in 2024 - nearly twice as many as 20 years ago. Last year was also the fourth-most violent since the end of the Cold War, surpassed only by the three preceding years in terms of battle deaths. The spread of Islamic State franchises since 2014, along with the heavy toll of wars in Ukraine and Gaza, were among the main drivers of these spikes, said Siri Aas Rustad, a researcher at PRIO. Conflicts now tended to last longer than in the past, she added, while peacekeeping operations and peace processes had declined. The peace order is fraying Experts see a discouraging broader trend behind this shift: the moribund state of the Western-grounded liberal order and multilateral institutions like the UN. That order, grounded in ideas of universal human rights and democracy, encouraged dispute resolution through non-violent means, said Oliver Richmond, a leading peace researcher at the University of Manchester. But the US-led western allies failed to establish a genuinely fair global system and often prioritised their own interests, inviting challenges, he said. Read more:How Trump has supercharged the new world dis-orderWar, peace and nature: Pictures that defined 2025 Emerging powers such as China, Turkey, Russia and Gulf states had styled themselves as peacemakers but were pursuing their own systems of domination, Mr Richmond argued. Conflicts from Ukraine to Sudan now grind on as outside actors tolerate - or enable - violence in pursuit of a \"victor's peace\", he added. Small pauses can have larger meanings Against this bleak backdrop, Christmas ceasefires in the Philippines offer a glimpse of an alternative approach. The tradition of halting hostilities over the holidays - reflecting the biblical message of peace on earth - goes way back. The most famous example came in 1914, when British and German troops crossed trenches during the First World War to celebrate Christmas together. Such brief ceasefires rarely ended conflicts, but they aided the \"long-term trust building needed to establish long-term... peace agreements\", said Ms Rustad. In the Philippines, it has become custom that both sides independently declare unilateral Christmas ceasefires without signing an agreement. Even former president Rodrigo Duterte - notorious for his brutal \"war on drugs\" and now facing the International Criminal Court - occasionally called Christmas truces, promising \"quietude and serenity\" for Filipinos during the holidays. 👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈 The motives were not purely altruistic as \"Christmas ceasefires were good propaganda on both sides\", said Patricio Abinales, a political historian at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. \"With the guns temporarily silenced, rural communities could celebrate Christmas peacefully - as could government troops in their camps and the NPA in their guerrilla zones,\" he said. Peace from the ground up Mr Richmond, the peace researcher, argued that peacemaking was more successful in any case when informed by such grassroots practices and local communities, rather than driven by meddling geopolitical powers and institutions. \"The victims are directly affected by the conflict and tend to have a clearer understanding of what a peaceful settlement may require,\" he said. In 2023, a Russian-proposed truce for Orthodox Christmas was rejected by Ukraine, which suspected Moscow was seeking time to regroup. \"There was clearly not enough trust to agree on this,\" said Ms Rustad. Russia declared a brief unilateral ceasefire in May this year but Ukraine branded it a farce, saying attacks continued. Ultimately, ending protracted conflicts comes down to political will, according to Mr Richmond. The tools for peace are well-known: major powers could oppose violence and invest in \"truly multilateral institutions like the UN, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, mediation and international human rights law\", he added. \"But they are unwilling to do that even as societies clamour for peace,\" Mr Richmond said. A fading tradition? Away from that geopolitical tug-of-war, the Christmas tradition of peace in the Philippines still survives - just. This year, as in 2023, the NPA declared a four-day ceasefire covering Christmas and New Year, even if it wasn't reciprocated by government forces. Prof Abinales said the insurgency had been badly weakened and was becoming increasingly irrelevant - which may eventually bring the decades-long conflict to an end. \"If the current trend continues, Christmas ceasefires will become a thing of the past,\" he said."

        "Content": "North Korea is showcasing what appears to be progress on a nuclear-powered submarine, with state media images revealing a largely completed hull. Images released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Thursday showed leader Kim Jong Un visiting a shipyard to inspect the construction of what it said was an 8,700-ton-class nuclear-propelled submarine. Mr Kim has said the completion of the submarine would mark an \"epoch-making\" change in strengthening the country's nuclear deterrent against what he described as enemy threats. During the visit, Mr Kim denounced South Korea's US-backed efforts to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine as an \"offensive act\" that he said gravely infringes on the North's security and maritime sovereignty. He added that South Korea's ambitions further underscore the need to advance and nuclear arm North Korea's navy. KCNA did not specify when Kim visited the shipyard, but it was the first time North Korean state media had released images of the submarine since March, when coverage mostly showed the vessel's lower sections. It was also not immediately clear how close North Korea is to finishing the submarine, though images showing an apparently near-complete hull suggest that key components, including the engine and possibly the reactor, have already been installed, according to experts. \n                  North Korea defector reveals what it's like celebrating Christmas in country where it's banned\n                 \n                  Russia sending Ukrainian children to 'harmful and abusive' camp in North Korea, says human rights group\n                 \n                  Trump orders nuclear weapons tests as he meets Xi\n                 \"Showing the entire vessel now seems to indicate that most of the equipment has already been installed and it is just about ready to be launched into the water,\" said Moon Keun-sik, a submarine expert at Seoul's Hanyang University and a former officer in the South Korean navy. He believes the submarine could be tested at sea within months. A nuclear-powered submarine was among the advanced weapons Mr Kim outlined at a 2021 party meeting to counter what he described as growing US-led threats, alongside solid-fuelled ICBMs, which enable faster launches, hypersonic weapons, and spy satellites. North Korea has since tested several of these systems and recently unveiled a new destroyer, which Mr Kim said would expand the range and preemptive strike capabilities of its nuclear forces. Read more from Sky News:What is Christmas like in North Korea?Kim Jong Un unveils 'most powerful' missile Analysts say a nuclear-powered submarine capable of prolonged stealth patrols and underwater missile launches would significantly complicate detection for neighbouring countries, though doubts remain over whether sanctions-hit North Korea has the resources and technology to build one. Some experts suggest Pyongyang's closer ties with Russia - including military support for Moscow's war in Ukraine - may have helped it obtain key technologies. While some suspect Russia could have provided a reactor, others argue North Korea likely developed its own, possibly with limited Russian assistance. During a November summit with Donald Trump, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung sought US support for acquiring nuclear-powered submarines and pledged to boost defence spending to reduce America's burden. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have remained high as Mr Kim pushes forward with his nuclear weapons programme. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down its nuclear and missile programmes. Negotiations collapsed in 2019 following a failed summit with Mr Trump during the US president's first term."

Widespread flash flooding occurred on Christmas Eve in the south of the US state as a result of torrential rain. In one mountain resort, debris and mud was filmed cascading down roads and fast-moving water was seen rushing through the porch of several homes. The US National Weather Service said \"life-threatening atmospheric river conditions\" will continue throughout Christmas Day, with a rare \"high risk of excessive rainfall\" warning remaining in effect. A man was killed by a falling tree in San Diego on Wednesday, local news reported; and a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died in what appeared to be a storm-related vehicle crash. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow what he referred to as \"emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe\". An estimated 130 evacuation orders were issued to vulnerable homes, Los Angeles County officials said, many of which are in the same area that was scorched by wildfires at the beginning of the year. Southern California typically gets up to 2.5cm of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see 10 to 20cm, with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that carry water vapour in the atmosphere from tropical regions.   When making landfall, water vapour is released in the form of rain or snow. Atmospheric rivers occur around the globe but are especially significant on the West Coast of the United States - making up 30% to 50% of annual precipitation. Not all atmospheric rivers cause destruction and actually play a key part in the global water cycle. However due to Earth warming up, atmospheric rivers are getting bigger, wetter and more frequent, according to a 2025 study published in the Journal of Climate. Heavy snow and gusts were expected to create \"near white-out conditions\" in parts of the Sierra Nevada and make travel \"nearly impossible\" through mountain passes. There was also a \"considerable\" avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, according to the Sierra Avalanche Centre. More than 165,000 homes have had power restored after experiencing outages due to the storm, according to the provider Pacific Gas and Electric.

        "Content": "A ticket sold in Arkansas claimed a $1.8bn Powerball jackpot following Wednesday night's draw, making it one of the largest lottery prizes in US history and arriving just in time for Christmas. The jackpot had surged after Monday's draw produced no winners, with last-minute ticket sales pushing the total to $1.817bn (£1.36bn). It is the second-largest US lottery prize ever and the biggest Powerball of 2025, according to the Powerball website. The winning numbers - 4, 25, 31, 52, 59 and the Powerball 19 - were drawn shortly before midnight. The odds of hitting the jackpot? A staggering one in 292.2 million. Wednesday's Powerball drawing was the 47th in the current jackpot run, making it the longest run of drawings the prize had gone without being claimed, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. This marks only the second time Arkansas has produced a Powerball jackpot winner, the first being in 2010. Powerball tickets cost $2 each. The winner can choose between an annuitised payout of $1.8bn over 29 years or a lump-sum cash option of roughly $834.9m (£623m) before taxes. \n                  Trump tells children he won't let 'a bad Santa' infiltrate US - and discusses 'beautiful' coal\n                 \n                  'Life-threatening' atmospheric river storm causes floods in California\n                 \n                  White House orders US military to 'quarantine' Venezuela oil, official says\n                 The previous Powerball jackpot was claimed on 6 September by two tickets in Missouri and Texas, which shared a $1.787bn (£1.33bn) prize. Jackpots grow when no one wins, though the odds are far better for the smaller prizes. \"This is truly an extraordinary, life-changing prize,\" said Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair and CEO of the Iowa Lottery. Historically, the jackpot has been won once on Christmas Eve in 2011 and four times on Christmas Day. New York musician Richie Vitale, 71, who had bought five tickets on Wednesday, said: \"The chance of winning the lottery is, like, less than getting hit by lightning, and sometimes I think my lottery is going to get hit by lightning. \"I think, 'Let's be more hopeful and take a chance,' and I don't buy lottery tickets all the time.\" Read more from Sky News:Kate and Princess Charlotte perform piano duet for ChristmasTrump tells children about 'beautiful' coal in Christmas call Nationwide, nine secondary prizes of $1m (£747,000) were claimed in Monday's draw. \"I came out in the rain to get the winning ticket, and I just bought the winning ticket. So everybody else can stay home. I'm getting it. I'll share it with you,\" said John Campbell, a Long Beach, California resident. Asked what else he would do with the money, Campbell said he will share it with the homeless. \"I'm tired of seeing them sleeping on the street.\" The largest US lottery prize on record remains a Powerball jackpot of $2.04bn (£1.52bn), won in California in 2022. Large jackpots tend to boost ticket sales, which in turn increases revenue for state lottery funds that support education and other public spending. \"It's scary, scary and exciting and a little bit daunting because what would one do with so much money? But we'll see, we hope,\" said New York theatre director Carl Schmehl."
