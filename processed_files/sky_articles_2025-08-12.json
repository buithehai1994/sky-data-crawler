        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  It's beginning to feel like \"Midnight Sun\" diplomacy. In parts of Alaska, the sun doesn't set in summer, casting light through the night but leaving you disorientated. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy reject's Putin's proposal The Trump-Putin summit is pitched as \"transparent\" but it's difficult to find any path to peace right now. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has reduced it to a \"listening exercise\" where Donald Trump will seek a \"better understanding\" of the situation. There isn't much to understand - Russia wants territory, Ukraine isn't ceding it - but Ms Levitt rejects talk of them \"tempering expectations\". It's possible to be both hopeful and measured, she says, because Mr Trump wants peace but is only meeting one side on Friday. It's the fact that he's only meeting Vladimir Putin that concerns European leaders, who fear Ukraine could be side-lined by any Trump-Putin pact. Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims Mr Putin wants the rest of Donetsk and, in effect, the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He's ruled out surrendering that because it would rob him of key defence lines and leave Kyiv vulnerable to future offensives.  European leaders - including Sir Keir Starmer - will hold online talks with Mr Zelenskyy twice on Wednesday, on either side of a virtual call with Mr Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Their concerns may be getting through, hence the White House now framing the summit as a cautious fact-finding exercise and nothing more. The only thing we really learned from the latest news conference is that the first Trump-Putin meeting in six years will be in Anchorage. A White House official later confirmed it would be at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a US military facility.

A remote but strategic frontier where the lines of ownership and the rules of negotiation are once again being sketched out. On a clear day, you can see Russia from Alaska, but without Mr Zelenskyy in the room, it's difficult to see them conquering any summit. In the place where the sun never sets, the deal might never start."

        "Content": " The US State Department has accused the UK of having \"significant human rights issues\", including restrictions on free speech. The unflattering assessment comes via a new version of an annual Human Rights Practices report, with its publication coinciding with Vice President JD Vance's holiday in the Cotswolds. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis It says human rights in the UK \"worsened\" in 2024, with \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression\", as well as \"crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism\" since the 7 October Hamas attack against Israel. On free speech, while \"generally provided\" for, the report cites \"specific areas of concern\" around limits on \"political speech deemed 'hateful' or 'offensive'\". Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended the UK's record on free speech after concerns were raised by Mr Vance. In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\" The US report highlights Britain's public space protection orders, which allow councils to restrict certain activities in some public places to prevent antisocial behaviour. It also references \"safe access zones\" around abortion clinics, which the Home Office says are designed to protect women from harassment or distress. They have been criticised by Mr Vance before, notably back in February during a headline-grabbing speech at the Munich Security Conference. The report also criticises the Online Safety Act and accuses ministers of intervening to \"chill speech\" about last summer's murders in Southport, highlighting arrests made in the wake of the subsequent riots. Ministers have said the Online Safety Act is about protecting children, and repeatedly gone so far as to suggest people who are opposed to it are on the side of predators. Read more politics news:Is Keir Starmer falling into booby trap?What is ex-minister Tulip Siddiq on trial for?  The report comes months after Sir Keir bit back at Mr Vance during a summit at the White House, cutting in when Donald Trump's VP claimed there are \"infringements on free speech\" in the UK. \"We've had free speech for a very long time, it will last a long time, and we are very proud of that,\" the PM said. But Mr Vance again raised concerns during a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his country estate in Kent last week, saying he didn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech.  The US State Department's report echoes similar accusations made by the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk. The Trump administration itself has been accused of trying to curtail free speech and stifle criticism, most notably by targeting universities - Harvard chief among them."

        "Content": " The police's use of facial recognition technology is to be significantly expanded in an attempt to catch more offenders, ministers have announced. Under the plans, 10 live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be used by seven forces across England to help identify \"sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes\", according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis The tech, which has been trialled in London and south Wales, will be subject to strict rules, the Home Office said, but human rights groups have warned it is \"dangerous and discriminatory\". Amnesty International UK said the plans should be \"immediately scrapped\", with facial recognition proven to be \"discriminatory against communities of colour\". \"It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest,\" said Alba Kapoor, the charity's racial justice lead, \"and it's also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour.\" The Home Office said the LFR vans will only be deployed when there is \"specific intelligence\", and will be operated by trained officers who will check every match made by the cameras. The vehicles will also only be used against bespoke watch lists, compiled for each use under guidelines set by the College of Policing. The vans will be operated by police forces in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly). 'The most serious offenders' Ms Cooper has said ministers are focused on making sure \"there are proper safeguards in place\". As part of the plans, the home secretary has announced she will be launching a consultation on how and when the cameras should be used, and with what safeguards, which the government will use to draw up a new legal framework for the use of the cameras. Ms Cooper said the tech had been used in London and South Wales \"in a targeted way\", and helped catch \"the most serious offenders, including people wanted for violent assaults or for sex offences\". According to the Metropolitan Police, the tech has led to 580 arrests for offences such as rape, domestic crime and knife crime in the space of 12 months. The government has pointed to independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory, which it said found the tech was \"accurate\" and showed \"no bias for ethnicity, age, or gender\". Read more politics news:Is Keir Starmer falling into booby trap?What is ex-minister Tulip Siddiq on trial for? Liberty has welcomed the government's decision to create a statutory framework for using facial recognition, but said that should be in place before the tech is rolled out. \"There's no reasonable excuse to be putting even more cameras on our streets before the public have had their say and legislation is brought in to protect all of us,\" said a statement. The civil liberties charity cited how more than 1.6 million people have had their faces scanned in South Wales, mostly on football match days in Cardiff city centre. But Lindsey Chiswick, from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), has said the expansion \"is an excellent opportunity for policing\", and will help officers locate suspects \"quickly and accurately\"."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Police should consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects when they are charged in high-profile and sensitive cases, new national guidance says. Coming into force today, it says there must be a policing reason to release the information, such as where there are high levels of disinformation, if it will improve public safety, or if it is significantly in the public interest. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they will support the new guidance by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information if appropriate. The change comes after two men charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton were reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, sparking protests. Warwickshire Police did not confirm the immigration status, leading to Reform UK accusing them of a \"cover-up\", something the force strongly denied. Responding to the row, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said last week she wanted police to be more transparent, and that new guidance was being worked up.  How high-profile cases sparked debate When considering what information to release, police must consider contempt of court laws which aim to give defendants a fair trial, as well as media guidance from the College of Policing. Until now, the media guidance said once a suspect has been charged, police can give out information such as their name, date of birth and address. It did not mention anything about ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status. The Southport murders committed by Axel Rudakubana last July led to speculation about his ethnicity and immigration status, fuelling riots in many parts of the country. While the details were not initially released in that case, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool's Premier League win earlier this year, Merseyside Police were quick to say the suspect was a white British man. In the Nuneaton case, Reform leader Nigel Farage said retaining the \"basic and sober facts\" was \"a cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings\". Warwickshire Police said officers \"did not and will not cover up such criminality\", and followed national guidance. Read more politics news:Council asks High Court to stop asylum hotelIs Keir Starmer falling into a small boats trap? How will new guidance work? The new guidance says it is at the discretion of the police force to decide whether to release ethnicity and nationality details, and that they must consider the ethical and legal implications. It says it is not the job of police to verify a suspect's immigration status, which rests with the Home Office. The advice has been developed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, in consultation with the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, said: \"We saw during last summer's disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major, real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the public domain. \"We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels. \"Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.\"  'A chilling message' The guidance is interim, and will be considered as part of a wider review of the College of Policing's authorised professional practice for media relations later this year. Chief constable Sir Andy Marsh, the college's CEO, said officers will continue to police \"without fear or favour\". But the guidance is likely to provoke backlash from anti-racism campaigners. Last week, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants warned that revealing ethnicity and migration status would \"send a chilling message: that some people are inherently more 'suspect'\". 'Public trust requires transparency' A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they welcome the new guidance, adding: \"Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them.\" They added: \"The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld. \"The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. All cases will of course take account of consultation with the police and CPS. \"The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial.\""

        "Content": "​​​​​​​New \"hearing glasses\" are being created that use artificial intelligence to help people hear conversations more clearly in real-time. Scientists in Scotland are developing a prototype set of glasses that combine lip-reading technology, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to clean up conversations in people's hearing aids. The smart glasses are fitted with a camera that records dialogue and uses visual cues to detect the main speaker. The wearer's phone then sends the recording to a cloud server, where the speaker's voice is isolated and background noise removed. The cleaned-up audio is then sent back to the listener's hearing aid almost instantly, despite travelling to servers all the way over in Sweden and back. \"We're not trying to reinvent hearing aids. We're trying to give them superpowers,\" said project leader Professor Mathini Sellathurai, of Heriot-Watt University. \"You simply point the camera or look at the person you want to hear. \"Even if two people are talking at once, the AI uses visual cues to extract the voice of the person you're looking at.\" Read more science and tech news:Water shortfall declared 'nationally significant'New pancreatic cancer vaccine shows promise in trialCould flashing mouthguards help rugby's safety problem Over 1.2 million UK adults struggle with ordinary conversation because of hearing loss, according to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. Although noise-cancelling technology does exist for hearing aids, it often struggles with voices overlapping in conversation or when there are lots of different background noises. The researchers say that by using cloud servers to do the heavy lifting on cleaning up audio, the glasses can take advantage of powerful artificial intelligence while still being wearable. They hope to have a working version of the glasses by 2026, and are already speaking to hearing aid manufacturers about ways to reduce costs and make the devices more widely available. Scientists from Heriot-Watt University led the project and worked with researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Napier University and the University of Stirling."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  A would-be assassin who flew from the US to kill a Birmingham shop owner as part of a violent feud has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Birmingham Crown Court heard how Aimee Betro, 45, flew from the US to murder shopkeeper Sikander Ali at point-blank range outside his home in the Yardley area of the city in September 2019. Prosecutors alleged that Betro hid her identity using a niqab when she tried to shoot Mr Ali - but the gun jammed, allowing him to flee. Betro - originally from Wisconsin - was part of a plot orchestrated by co-conspirators Mohammed Nabil Nazir, 31, and his father, Mohammed Aslam, 56, who were in a violent feud with Mr Ali's family. During her trial, Betro said she had travelled to the UK on two previous occasions, having met Nazir on a dating app. Asked why she had paid a third visit to the UK, arriving at Manchester Airport from Atlanta around two weeks before the shooting, Betro told jurors: \"To celebrate my birthday, and I won tickets for another boat party in London.\" The court was shown CCTV of Betro waiting for 45 minutes outside Mr Ali's house on the night of 7 September 2019. As Mr Ali arrived home, Betro approached him with a firearm, but the gun failed to fire. Mr Ali is seen jumping back into his car and reversing away, clipping Betro's driver's side door in the process. The court heard Betro then goaded Mr Ali's father, Aslat Mahumad, with whom her co-conspirators had a feud, through text messages including: \"Where are you hiding?\", \"Stop playing hide and seek, you are lucky it jammed,\" and asking him to meet her at a nearby Asda. Jurors were told co-conspirators Nazir and Aslam had been injured during disorder at Mr Mahumad's clothing boutique in Birmingham in July 2018, leading them to conspire to have someone kill him or a member of his family. In the early hours of the next morning and just hours after the failed shooting, Betro booked a taxi and returned to Mr Ali's home, where she fired three shots at the property, which was empty at the time. She then fled back to the US the next day before becoming involved in another of Nazir's plots to get revenge on a rival. Read more from Sadiya Chowdhury:Two terminally ill people give their views on assisted dying voteTeen who murdered his family will not be given whole-life order Prosecutors also said Betro sent three parcels full of ammunition and gun parts to the UK on 16 October 2019. The court heard the parts, which were wrapped in foil and paper inside three cardboard boxes, were addressed to a man from Derby, with Nazir tipping off the police with the intent to frame him. While the packages were intercepted and the man arrested as part of what the prosecution said was Nazir's \"devious scheme\", his involvement in the plan eventually came to light, and he was released without charge. Betro, it said, was seen at a post office 100 miles away from her home address in the US posting the parcels under a fake name. In the case of each of those three packages, Betro's DNA has been found on the gun parts and ammunition inside them. Betro had claimed it was all a coincidence, saying the woman on the CCTV was another American who looked, dressed and sounded like her. It was alleged that Betro was in Armenia when Nazir and Aslam were jailed for 32 years and 10 years respectively in November 2024, but was extradited in January this year to face her own criminal proceedings. Jurors deliberated for almost 21 hours before convicting Betro of conspiracy to murder, possessing a self-loading pistol with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge of illegally importing ammunition. She was found guilty by majority verdicts on the conspiracy to murder and firearm charges, and by a unanimous verdict on the ammunition charge. Speaking to Sky News, Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Orencas, from West Midlands Police's Major Crime Unit, called Betro's crime \"a brazen attempt,\" adding that there \"doesn't seem to be a whole lot of effort to avoid detection\". \"I think she fell foul of a really slick, dynamic law enforcement operation over here,\" he said. \"I don't know whether that was her perspective from America, that that's how we operate, but zero tolerance around firearms, criminality on these shores.\" Betro was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 21 August. Hannah Sidaway, specialist prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service in the West Midlands, said: \"Only Betro knows what truly motivated her or what she sought to gain from becoming embroiled in a crime that meant she travelled hundreds of miles from Wisconsin to Birmingham to execute an attack on a man she did not know.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  As a milestone is reached of 50,000 migrants crossing the Channel since he became prime minister, Keir Starmer finds himself in a familiar place - seemingly unable to either stop the boats, or escape talking about them.  Home Office data shows 50,271 people made the journey since the election last July, after 474 migrants arrived on Monday. This is around 13,000 higher than the comparable period the previous year. Politics Live: Starmer hits unwanted small boat crossings milestone Starmer has tweeted more than 10 times about this issue in the past week alone, more than any other. On Monday he wrote on X: \"If you come to this country illegally, you will face detention and return. If you come to this country and commit a crime, we will deport you as soon as possible.\" It could be a tweet by a politician of any party on the right - and many voters (and Labour MPs) will say it's right that the prime minister is taking this issue seriously. Illegal - or irregular - migration is a relatively small proportion of total migration. Net migration was down at 431,000 in 2024 which the OCED say is comparable to other high-income countries. But it is of course highly visible and politically charged. \n                  US accuses UK of 'significant human rights issues' and restricting free speech\n                 \n                  Facial recognition vans to be rolled out across police forces in England\n                 \n                  Police ordered to consider revealing ethnicity of suspects\n                 Nigel Farage's Reform party have had a busy few months campaigning on it, and the prime minister has been toughening up his language in response. Shortly after the local elections in May in which Reform won hundreds of seats and took control of councils, Starmer made his speech in which he warned: \"In a diverse nation like ours, without fair immigration rules, we risk becoming an island of strangers.\" It outraged some in his own party, and he later said he regretted that language. But it was part of a speech which made clear that he wanted action - vowing to end \"years of uncontrolled migration\" in a way \"that will finally take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter for our politics.\" It's a long way from his early months as Labour leader in 2020 when he said: \"We welcome migrants, we don't scapegoat them.\" Migration did not feature as one of his five missions for \"change\" at the general election. The strategy by Starmer and his minister is to talk up forthcoming new measures - a crackdown on social media adverts by traffickers, returns of people without a right to be in the UK which are indeed higher than under the Conservatives, and last week, a \"one in, one out\" deal with France to send people back across the channel. The government say some people have been detained, although it is not known when these returns will happen. Ministers are also still pointing the finger at the previous Conservative government - which found stopping the boats easy to say and hard to achieve. Read More:Kemi Badenoch suggests asylum seekers should be housed in 'Nightingale' campsWhat is the UK-France migrant returns deal, who will be returned and how many? Baroness Jacqui Smith, a former home secretary, said this morning: \"I don't think it was our fault that it was enabled to take root. We've taken our responsibility to work internationally, to change the law, to improve the way in which the asylum system works, to take through legislation to strengthen the powers that are available. \"The last government did none of those things and focused on gimmicks. And it's because of that, that the crime behind this got embedded in the way which it did. And that won't be solved overnight.\" But for a prime minister who appears to have come to this issue reluctantly, talking about it a lot - and suggesting he'll be judged on whether he can tackle it - risks raising expectations. Joe Twyman, of the pollsters Deltapoll said: \"You cannot simply out-Farage Nigel Farage when it comes to the subject of immigration. In a sense, Labour is falling into precisely the same trap that the Conservatives fell into. They're giving significant prominence to a subject where they don't have much control\". Starmer has avoided mentioning firm numbers on how many migrants his crackdown may stop, but as previous prime ministers have found with the difficult issue of controlling migration, if you ask to be judged on delivery, voters will do so."

        "Content": "Jeremy Clarkson has joined a backlash in the Cotswolds after US vice president JD Vance arrived at a picturesque hamlet in the region for his summer holiday. Mr Vance and his family are staying at Dean Manor, a Grade II-listed country home in the tiny hamlet of Dean, during a trip where they also stayed with the Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kent and will later travel to Scotland. Local residents reportedly expressed their frustrations after Mr Vance's enormous motorcade, consisting of 18 vehicles, caused a lockdown in the countryside on Monday. People in the Cotswolds faced road closures and security checkpoints overseen by police with sniffer dogs as Mr Vance made his way to Dean Manor on Monday, according to GloucestershireLive. It came before a \"Vance Not Welcome Party\" protest was organised by the groups \"Everybody Hates Elon\" and the \"Stop Trump Coalition\" in Charlbury, close to where Mr Vance is staying, today. The demonstrators held banners mocking the US vice president and calling him a \"war criminal\", in an apparent reference to America's support for Israel. Several protesters held images of a widely shared meme depicting Mr Vance with a bald head.

He wrote: \"I could have easily went on my way and got it in the shed without getting in the way.\" Cooper also joked that if Mr Vance simply \"drove around in a VW Polo nobody would know who he was\".

A Conservative spokesman said the party leader's team had spoken to Mr Vance's but that \"scheduling\" had proved difficult. Both sides have played down the notion of a snub, the Telegraph reported. It comes as the US vice president will travel to Scotland later this week in a trip that could see up to 1,000 police officers deployed as part of security efforts. Sky News understands the Vance family are likely to visit Ayrshire but are not thought to be planning to stay at Mr Trump's Turnberry resort in the area.  In Kent, Mr Vance said he had a \"love\" for the UK but joked he had committed a diplomatic faux pas as he began his holiday. \"Unfortunately, the one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,\" he said. He also said he doesn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech. Mr Vance described Mr Lammy as a \"very, very gracious host\"."

        "Content": " The US State Department has accused the UK of having \"significant human rights issues\", including restrictions on free speech. The unflattering assessment comes via a new version of an annual Human Rights Practices report, with its publication coinciding with Vice President JD Vance's holiday in the Cotswolds. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis It says human rights in the UK \"worsened\" in 2024, with \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression\", as well as \"crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism\" since the 7 October Hamas attack against Israel. On free speech, while \"generally provided\" for, the report cites \"specific areas of concern\" around limits on \"political speech deemed 'hateful' or 'offensive'\". Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended the UK's record on free speech after concerns were raised by Mr Vance. In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\" The US report highlights Britain's public space protection orders, which allow councils to restrict certain activities in some public places to prevent antisocial behaviour. It also references \"safe access zones\" around abortion clinics, which the Home Office says are designed to protect women from harassment or distress. They have been criticised by Mr Vance before, notably back in February during a headline-grabbing speech at the Munich Security Conference. The report also criticises the Online Safety Act and accuses ministers of intervening to \"chill speech\" about last summer's murders in Southport, highlighting arrests made in the wake of the subsequent riots. Ministers have said the Online Safety Act is about protecting children, and repeatedly gone so far as to suggest people who are opposed to it are on the side of predators. Read more politics news:Is Keir Starmer falling into booby trap?What is ex-minister Tulip Siddiq on trial for?  The report comes months after Sir Keir bit back at Mr Vance during a summit at the White House, cutting in when Donald Trump's VP claimed there are \"infringements on free speech\" in the UK. \"We've had free speech for a very long time, it will last a long time, and we are very proud of that,\" the PM said. But Mr Vance again raised concerns during a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his country estate in Kent last week, saying he didn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech.  The US State Department's report echoes similar accusations made by the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk. The Trump administration itself has been accused of trying to curtail free speech and stifle criticism, most notably by targeting universities - Harvard chief among them."

        "Content": "\n          Political reporter\n              @fayebrownSky\n Police should consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects when they are charged in high-profile and sensitive cases, new national guidance says. Coming into force today, it says there must be a policing reason to release the information, such as where there are high levels of disinformation, if it will improve public safety, or if it is significantly in the public interest. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they will support the new guidance by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information if appropriate. The change comes after two men charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton were reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, sparking protests. Warwickshire Police did not confirm the immigration status, leading to Reform UK accusing them of a \"cover-up\", something the force strongly denied. Responding to the row, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said last week she wanted police to be more transparent, and that new guidance was being worked up.  How high-profile cases sparked debate When considering what information to release, police must consider contempt of court laws which aim to give defendants a fair trial, as well as media guidance from the College of Policing. Until now, the media guidance said once a suspect has been charged, police can give out information such as their name, date of birth and address. It did not mention anything about ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status. The Southport murders committed by Axel Rudakubana last July led to speculation about his ethnicity and immigration status, fuelling riots in many parts of the country. While the details were not initially released in that case, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool's Premier League win earlier this year, Merseyside Police were quick to say the suspect was a white British man. In the Nuneaton case, Reform leader Nigel Farage said retaining the \"basic and sober facts\" was \"a cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings\". Warwickshire Police said officers \"did not and will not cover up such criminality\", and followed national guidance. Read more politics news:Council asks High Court to stop asylum hotelIs Keir Starmer falling into a small boats trap? How will new guidance work? The new guidance says it is at the discretion of the police force to decide whether to release ethnicity and nationality details, and that they must consider the ethical and legal implications. It says it is not the job of police to verify a suspect's immigration status, which rests with the Home Office. The advice has been developed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, in consultation with the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, said: \"We saw during last summer's disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major, real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the public domain. \"We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels. \"Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.\"  'A chilling message' The guidance is interim, and will be considered as part of a wider review of the College of Policing's authorised professional practice for media relations later this year. Chief constable Sir Andy Marsh, the college's CEO, said officers will continue to police \"without fear or favour\". But the guidance is likely to provoke backlash from anti-racism campaigners. Last week, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants warned that revealing ethnicity and migration status would \"send a chilling message: that some people are inherently more 'suspect'\". 'Public trust requires transparency' A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they welcome the new guidance, adding: \"Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them.\" They added: \"The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld. \"The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. All cases will of course take account of consultation with the police and CPS. \"The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial.\""

Under the plans, 10 live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be used by seven forces across England to help identify \"sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes\", according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis The tech, which has been trialled in London and south Wales, will be subject to strict rules, the Home Office said, but human rights groups have warned it is \"dangerous and discriminatory\". Amnesty International UK said the plans should be \"immediately scrapped\", with facial recognition proven to be \"discriminatory against communities of colour\". \"It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest,\" said Alba Kapoor, the charity's racial justice lead, \"and it's also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour.\" The Home Office said the LFR vans will only be deployed when there is \"specific intelligence\", and will be operated by trained officers who will check every match made by the cameras. The vehicles will also only be used against bespoke watch lists, compiled for each use under guidelines set by the College of Policing. The vans will be operated by police forces in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly). 'The most serious offenders' Ms Cooper has said ministers are focused on making sure \"there are proper safeguards in place\". As part of the plans, the home secretary has announced she will be launching a consultation on how and when the cameras should be used, and with what safeguards, which the government will use to draw up a new legal framework for the use of the cameras. Ms Cooper said the tech had been used in London and South Wales \"in a targeted way\", and helped catch \"the most serious offenders, including people wanted for violent assaults or for sex offences\". According to the Metropolitan Police, the tech has led to 580 arrests for offences such as rape, domestic crime and knife crime in the space of 12 months. The government has pointed to independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory, which it said found the tech was \"accurate\" and showed \"no bias for ethnicity, age, or gender\".

The civil liberties charity cited how more than 1.6 million people have had their faces scanned in South Wales, mostly on football match days in Cardiff city centre. But Lindsey Chiswick, from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), has said the expansion \"is an excellent opportunity for policing\", and will help officers locate suspects \"quickly and accurately\"."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  A would-be assassin who flew from the US to kill a Birmingham shop owner as part of a violent feud has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Birmingham Crown Court heard how Aimee Betro, 45, flew from the US to murder shopkeeper Sikander Ali at point-blank range outside his home in the Yardley area of the city in September 2019. Prosecutors alleged that Betro hid her identity using a niqab when she tried to shoot Mr Ali - but the gun jammed, allowing him to flee. Betro - originally from Wisconsin - was part of a plot orchestrated by co-conspirators Mohammed Nabil Nazir, 31, and his father, Mohammed Aslam, 56, who were in a violent feud with Mr Ali's family. During her trial, Betro said she had travelled to the UK on two previous occasions, having met Nazir on a dating app. Asked why she had paid a third visit to the UK, arriving at Manchester Airport from Atlanta around two weeks before the shooting, Betro told jurors: \"To celebrate my birthday, and I won tickets for another boat party in London.\" The court was shown CCTV of Betro waiting for 45 minutes outside Mr Ali's house on the night of 7 September 2019. As Mr Ali arrived home, Betro approached him with a firearm, but the gun failed to fire. Mr Ali is seen jumping back into his car and reversing away, clipping Betro's driver's side door in the process. The court heard Betro then goaded Mr Ali's father, Aslat Mahumad, with whom her co-conspirators had a feud, through text messages including: \"Where are you hiding?\", \"Stop playing hide and seek, you are lucky it jammed,\" and asking him to meet her at a nearby Asda. Jurors were told co-conspirators Nazir and Aslam had been injured during disorder at Mr Mahumad's clothing boutique in Birmingham in July 2018, leading them to conspire to have someone kill him or a member of his family. In the early hours of the next morning and just hours after the failed shooting, Betro booked a taxi and returned to Mr Ali's home, where she fired three shots at the property, which was empty at the time. She then fled back to the US the next day before becoming involved in another of Nazir's plots to get revenge on a rival. Read more from Sadiya Chowdhury:Two terminally ill people give their views on assisted dying voteTeen who murdered his family will not be given whole-life order Prosecutors also said Betro sent three parcels full of ammunition and gun parts to the UK on 16 October 2019. The court heard the parts, which were wrapped in foil and paper inside three cardboard boxes, were addressed to a man from Derby, with Nazir tipping off the police with the intent to frame him. While the packages were intercepted and the man arrested as part of what the prosecution said was Nazir's \"devious scheme\", his involvement in the plan eventually came to light, and he was released without charge. Betro, it said, was seen at a post office 100 miles away from her home address in the US posting the parcels under a fake name. In the case of each of those three packages, Betro's DNA has been found on the gun parts and ammunition inside them. Betro had claimed it was all a coincidence, saying the woman on the CCTV was another American who looked, dressed and sounded like her. It was alleged that Betro was in Armenia when Nazir and Aslam were jailed for 32 years and 10 years respectively in November 2024, but was extradited in January this year to face her own criminal proceedings. Jurors deliberated for almost 21 hours before convicting Betro of conspiracy to murder, possessing a self-loading pistol with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge of illegally importing ammunition. She was found guilty by majority verdicts on the conspiracy to murder and firearm charges, and by a unanimous verdict on the ammunition charge. Speaking to Sky News, Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Orencas, from West Midlands Police's Major Crime Unit, called Betro's crime \"a brazen attempt,\" adding that there \"doesn't seem to be a whole lot of effort to avoid detection\". \"I think she fell foul of a really slick, dynamic law enforcement operation over here,\" he said. \"I don't know whether that was her perspective from America, that that's how we operate, but zero tolerance around firearms, criminality on these shores.\" Betro was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 21 August. Hannah Sidaway, specialist prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service in the West Midlands, said: \"Only Betro knows what truly motivated her or what she sought to gain from becoming embroiled in a crime that meant she travelled hundreds of miles from Wisconsin to Birmingham to execute an attack on a man she did not know.\""

        "Content": "The parents of a woman who refused chemotherapy following a cancer diagnosis have been warned about their conduct in court during the inquest into her death. Cambridge graduate Paloma Shemirani, 23, collapsed on 19 July 2024 and died five days later on 24 July at Royal Sussex County Hospital, after earlier declining treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Her mother, Kay \"Kate\" Shemirani, a well-known conspiracy theorist online, and her father, Dr Faramarz Shemirani, who is \"sympathetic\" to some of her views, blame medical professionals for their daughter's death. On Tuesday afternoon, Coroner Catherine Wood, presiding over the inquest at Kent and Medway Coroner's Court in Maidstone, left the court due to the parents' behaviour. The inquest, initially set to finish on Wednesday, has been extended, because presenting evidence and questioning witnesses had taken longer than expected. On Tuesday, Mrs Shemirani, who was struck off as a nurse in 2021 for spreading dangerous COVID-19 misinformation, was cross-examined by Dr Shemirani. Questioning broke down when Dr Shemirani, who is understood to have a PhD in computational fluid dynamics, tried to ask his ex-wife's opinion of medical evidence which she would then try to answer, despite warnings from the coroner. \n                  US accuses UK of 'significant human rights issues' and restricting free speech\n                 \n                  Police ordered to consider revealing ethnicity of suspects\n                 \n                  Facial recognition vans to be rolled out across police forces in England\n                 \"Mrs Shemirani, I've told you not to speak, I'll find you in contempt if you keep on speaking now,\" the coroner said. \"Confine (yourself) to asking questions of this witness as a witness of fact,\" she told Dr Shemirani. As Dr Shemirani argued back via video-link, the coroner said: \"Dr Shemirani, challenge me by judicial review later\" before trying to move on. \"Of course I will, of course I will,\" he said. Later, Dr Shemirani attempted once again to raise questions that the coroner had already deemed irrelevant. \"I'm going to rise for a few minutes because I'm finding it incredibly difficult to keep you on track,\" said Ms Wood. Dr Shemirani continued to talk until the coroner shouted: \"Dr Shemirani, listen\". \"Your behaviour has been bordering on contemptuous to the court - when I make a ruling on something you cannot come back,\" she added. Mrs Shemirani also accused osteopath Nick Gosset of lying under oath earlier in the inquest. Mr Gosset treated Miss Shemirani the day she collapsed and said she had appeared to be in the \"last stages of a very difficult disease\".

Mr Gosset told the court: \"It was obvious to me that I was not the right person to be helping her, normally you see a patient like that, you would refer her (to a GP). \"Any referral was refused - when I suggested that the proper avenue of approach was through a normal, medical channel she dismissed it.\" Mrs Shemirani said \"his statement under oath is completely opposed with the truth\" and has argued her daughter was healthy the day she collapsed."

In parts of Alaska, the sun doesn't set in summer, casting light through the night but leaving you disorientated. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy reject's Putin's proposal The Trump-Putin summit is pitched as \"transparent\" but it's difficult to find any path to peace right now. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has reduced it to a \"listening exercise\" where Donald Trump will seek a \"better understanding\" of the situation. There isn't much to understand - Russia wants territory, Ukraine isn't ceding it - but Ms Levitt rejects talk of them \"tempering expectations\". It's possible to be both hopeful and measured, she says, because Mr Trump wants peace but is only meeting one side on Friday. It's the fact that he's only meeting Vladimir Putin that concerns European leaders, who fear Ukraine could be side-lined by any Trump-Putin pact. Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims Mr Putin wants the rest of Donetsk and, in effect, the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He's ruled out surrendering that because it would rob him of key defence lines and leave Kyiv vulnerable to future offensives.  European leaders - including Sir Keir Starmer - will hold online talks with Mr Zelenskyy twice on Wednesday, on either side of a virtual call with Mr Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Their concerns may be getting through, hence the White House now framing the summit as a cautious fact-finding exercise and nothing more. The only thing we really learned from the latest news conference is that the first Trump-Putin meeting in six years will be in Anchorage. A White House official later confirmed it would be at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a US military facility.

On a clear day, you can see Russia from Alaska, but without Mr Zelenskyy in the room, it's difficult to see them conquering any summit.

        "Content": " There are increasing reports of violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers in occupied Palestinian territory. Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay has been inside the West Bank, where he's found settlers feeling emboldened since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. With the government largely supporting them, they act with impunity and are in many ways enabled by Israel security forces. But what are the settlements, and why are they controversial? What are settlements? A settlement is an Israeli-built village, town, or city in occupied Palestinian territory - either in the West Bank or East Jerusalem. Thousands of homes have been demolished over the years to build the settlements, while vast areas used for farmland and grazing have also been requisitioned. More territory has been taken to build roads and checkpoints that restrict Palestinians' movement in those areas and effectively lock out existing landowners, says Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. Today, an estimated 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The largest settlement, Modi'in Illit, is thought to house around 82,000 people. There is also a growing movement of Israelis wanting to build settlements in Gaza. Settlements are illegal under international law and have been condemned by the UN. They are, however, authorised by the Israeli government. As well as official, government-approved settlements, there are also Israeli outposts.  These are established without government approval and are considered illegal by Israeli authorities. But reports suggest the government often turns a blind eye to their creation. In May, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government approved 22 new settlements, including the legalisation of outposts that had previously been built without authorisation. Israel began building settlements shortly after the 1967 Six-Day War. The Etzion Bloc in Hebron, which was established that year, now houses around 40,000 people. Read more:Israel-Hamas war: A glossary of termsIsraeli-Palestinian conflict: A century of war, heartbreak, hopeWhat is the two-state solution? According to the Israel Policy Forum, the settlement programme is intended to protect Israel's security, with settlers acting as the first line of defence \"against an invasion\". The Israeli public appears divided on the effectiveness of the settlements, however. A 2024 Pew Research Centre poll found that 40% of Israelis believe settlements help Israeli security, 35% say they hurt it, and 21% think they make no difference. Why are they controversial? Israeli settlements are built on land that is internationally recognised as Palestinian territory. Sky News has spoken to multiple Palestinians who say they were forced out of their homes by Israeli settlers, despite having lived there for generations. \"They gradually invade the community and expand. The goal is to terrorise people, to make them flee,\" Rachel Abramovitz, a member of the group Looking The Occupation In The Eye, told Sky News in May. Mohammed Robin, a farmer owner who's been forcibly displaced from land outside Ramallah, said it had been in his family since 1952. \"When I was growing up I used to come here and play, we used to come and visit our grandfather and grandmother,\" he told Sky News. \"I have to go the legal route to defend my land, but even with a legal process ... there's not much chance. This is aggression.\"  Mutaz Tawafsha, mayor of Sinjel - a Palestinian town nearly totally surrounded by settlements, said he believed it would eventually be completely isolated. He showed Sky News footage of a farm being attacked - with a building being ransacked and set on fire. Pointing out a spot in the distance, he said: \"If you just try to go close to the settlers, you will see they're gonna come and start to attack you.\" But settlers also told us they have a holy right to occupy the land. American-born Israeli settler Daniel Winston told Stuart Ramsay: \"God's real, and he wrote the Bible, and the Bible says, 'I made this land, and I want you to be here'.\" Settlers make up around 5% of Israel's population and 15% of the West Bank's population, according to data from Peace Now. How have things escalated since 7 October 2023? Since the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's subsequent military bombardment of Gaza, more than 100 Israeli outposts have been established, according to Peace Now. Settler violence against Palestinians has also increased, according to the UN, with an average of 118 incidents each month - up from 108 in 2023, which was already a record year. The UK has sanctioned two far-right members of Mr Netanyahu's cabinet, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for \"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian civilians\" - notably in the West Bank. Last year, Smotrich ordered preparations for the annexation of the West Bank. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in June that the ministers had been \"encouraging egregious abuses of human rights\" for \"months\". The UN's latest report on Israeli settlements notes that in October 2024, there were 162 settler attacks on Palestinian olive harvesters, many of them in the presence of IDF soldiers. Of the 174 settler violence incidents studied by the UN, 109 were not reported to Israeli authorities. Most Palestinian victims said they didn't report the attacks due to a lack of trust in the Israeli system; some said they feared retaliation by settlers or the authorities if they did."

        "Content": " Thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes as deadly wildfires continue to burn across southern Europe amid a record-breaking heatwave. Firefighters worked through the night to contain a blaze which broke out near Madrid in Spain. A man caught in the fire in Tres Cantos, near the Spanish capital, died in hospital after suffering 98% burns. Blazes also erupted across several Spanish regions, including Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha, Andalusia and Galicia. Spain's interior ministry declared a \"pre-emergency\", putting national services on standby to support firefighters. Almost 1,000 members of the country's armed forces are already helping. Temperatures are expected to reach 44C (112.2F) in some parts of the country, according to forecasters. In Portugal, more than 700 firefighters were working to control a fire in Trancoso, about 217 miles northeast of Lisbon. Smaller fires were burning further north of the country. \"We are being cooked alive, this cannot continue,\" said Vila Real mayor Alexandre Favaios. A fire in the Portuguese city has been burning for 10 days. Firefighters were also battling several wildfires across Turkey on Tuesday, including in the northwestern province of Canakkale, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes. Blazes forced the temporary closure of Canakkale Airport, and also the Dardanelles Strait to shipping. By Jo Wheeler, weather presenter It's hot over Europe at the moment thanks to a heat dome; a high pressure system which acts like a pan lid, preventing cooler air masses moving in and causing temperatures to rise as air is forced down and compressed.   So Iberia and France have seen daytime highs well above average.  \n At the same time, we have high pressure to the east of the country (clockwise winds), and low pressure to the south-west (anticlockwise winds). Combined they're creating a strong draw of air from the South.   And whilst we won't see the dizzy heights of 40C here, we are seeing temperatures topping 30C.    Now, a heatwave is defined in different regions at different temperatures across the UK and Ireland but it seems likely that quite an extensive part of England and Wales will be experiencing a heatwave over the next couple of days.  And not for the first time this summer! And even though it becomes less hot in the UK through the coming week, we won't be reaching for the thermals either.    Temperatures will remain above average into the weekend and beyond. Long range forecasts are somewhat unreliable when we are not seeing any major drivers in force (El Nino, La Nina, North Atlantic Oscillation to name a few).  But the Met Office is leaning towards a more settled weather picture for the rest of the month for the UK. That's not to say there won't be any rain, but little sign of anything significant.    Above all, we can probably rely on the British weather to deliver a surprise when we least expect it!    Wildfires in Greece forced the evacuation of several villages and a hotel on the tourist islands of Zakynthos and Cephalonia in the Ionian Sea, along with four other parts of the mainland. \"Winds are strong and the wildfire is out of control,\" Zakynthos mayor Yiorgos Stasinopoulos told Greek public broadcaster ERT.

All-time records were also broken in Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service, Meteo France. Global warming is giving the Mediterranean region hotter, drier summers, scientists say. Europe is warming faster than any other continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Last year was the hottest year on record in Europe and globally, the monitoring agency said."

Beijing also announced the extension of the tariff pause at the same time, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Those tariffs on goods entering the US from China were due to take effect on Tuesday. The extension allows for further negotiations with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and also prevents tariffs from rising to 145%, a level threatened after tit for tat increases in the wake of Trump's so-called liberation day announcement on 2 April.  It's the second 90-day truce between the sides. The countries reached an initial framework for cooperation in May, with the US reducing its 145% tariff on Chinese goods to 30%, while China's 125% retaliatory tariffs went down to 10% on US items.

Seles was told she has myasthenia gravis (MG), a condition which causes muscle weakness, in 2022. The 51-year-old has told the Associated Press she first noticed the symptoms of the disease while she was playing tennis. The Serbian-American tennis great said: \"I would be playing with some kids or family members, and I would miss a ball. I was like, 'Yeah, I see two balls'. \"These are obviously symptoms that you can't ignore. \"And, for me, this is when this journey started.

America's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls it \"a chronic neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the voluntary muscles\" and \"most commonly impacts young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60)\" but ... can occur at any age, including childhood\". It is an autoimmune disease - used to describe a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, tissues, and organs.

She said: \"I had to, in tennis terms, I guess, reset - hard reset - a few times. I call my first hard reset when I came to the US as a young 13-year-old (from Yugoslavia). Didn't speak the language; left my family. It's a very tough time. Then, obviously, becoming a great player, it's a reset, too, because the fame, money, the attention, changes (everything), and it's hard as a 16-year-old to deal with all that. Then obviously my stabbing - I had to do a huge reset.\" Seles continued: \"And then, really, being diagnosed with myasthenia gravis: another reset. But one thing, as I tell kids that I mentor: 'You've got to always adjust. That ball is bouncing, and you've just got to adjust'. And that's what I'm doing now.\""

        "Content": " The Philippines has criticised China for what it called \"dangerous manoeuvres and unlawful interference\" after two Chinese vessels collided while chasing a Philippine craft in the South China Sea. A Chinese Coastguard patrol boat hit a Chinese navy ship in the disputed Scarborough Shoal on Monday as they harassed a Philippines Coastguard patrol boat delivering supplies, including fuel and ice, to dozens of fishing boats. Manila's foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the actions of the Chinese boats \"not only posed a grave danger to Philippine personnel and vessels, but also resulted in the unfortunate collision between the two Chinese vessels\". Philippine Coastguard spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a widely-reported statement: \"The [China Coastguard vessel] CCG 3104, which was chasing the [Filipino Coastguard vessel] BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the [Philippine] vessel's starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA [People's Liberation Army] navy warship. \"This resulted in substantial damage to the CCG vessel's forecastle, rendering it unseaworthy.\" The Philippines Armed Forces' Chief of Staff General Romeo Brawner told reporters on Tuesday they believed the navy ship was trying \"to ram our Philippine Coastguard (vessel). That is also (the) assessment of our Philippine Coastguard\". US Ambassador to Manila, MaryKay Carlson, condemned on X what she called \"latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel... and commend the Philippine Coastguard for their professionalism and their offer to render assistance\". China's defence ministry and its embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Monday, China's Coastguard said it took necessary measures to expel Philippine vessels from waters in the area. Philippine Coastguard footage showed a Chinese Coastguard ship tracking the Suluan before a Chinese navy ship, bearing the number 164 on its hull, suddenly cut across its path, colliding with it and damaging the smaller vessel's forecastle. People can be heard shouting in alarm before a loud crash at the moment of impact.

        "Content": "\n          US correspondent\n              @skydavidblevins\n  It's beginning to feel like \"Midnight Sun\" diplomacy. In parts of Alaska, the sun doesn't set in summer, casting light through the night but leaving you disorientated. Ukraine latest: Zelenskyy reject's Putin's proposal The Trump-Putin summit is pitched as \"transparent\" but it's difficult to find any path to peace right now. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has reduced it to a \"listening exercise\" where Donald Trump will seek a \"better understanding\" of the situation. There isn't much to understand - Russia wants territory, Ukraine isn't ceding it - but Ms Levitt rejects talk of them \"tempering expectations\". It's possible to be both hopeful and measured, she says, because Mr Trump wants peace but is only meeting one side on Friday. It's the fact that he's only meeting Vladimir Putin that concerns European leaders, who fear Ukraine could be side-lined by any Trump-Putin pact. Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims Mr Putin wants the rest of Donetsk and, in effect, the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He's ruled out surrendering that because it would rob him of key defence lines and leave Kyiv vulnerable to future offensives.  European leaders - including Sir Keir Starmer - will hold online talks with Mr Zelenskyy twice on Wednesday, on either side of a virtual call with Mr Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Their concerns may be getting through, hence the White House now framing the summit as a cautious fact-finding exercise and nothing more. The only thing we really learned from the latest news conference is that the first Trump-Putin meeting in six years will be in Anchorage. A White House official later confirmed it would be at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a US military facility.

On a clear day, you can see Russia from Alaska, but without Mr Zelenskyy in the room, it's difficult to see them conquering any summit.

        "Content": " The US State Department has accused the UK of having \"significant human rights issues\", including restrictions on free speech. The unflattering assessment comes via a new version of an annual Human Rights Practices report, with its publication coinciding with Vice President JD Vance's holiday in the Cotswolds. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis It says human rights in the UK \"worsened\" in 2024, with \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression\", as well as \"crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism\" since the 7 October Hamas attack against Israel. On free speech, while \"generally provided\" for, the report cites \"specific areas of concern\" around limits on \"political speech deemed 'hateful' or 'offensive'\". Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended the UK's record on free speech after concerns were raised by Mr Vance. In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\" The US report highlights Britain's public space protection orders, which allow councils to restrict certain activities in some public places to prevent antisocial behaviour. It also references \"safe access zones\" around abortion clinics, which the Home Office says are designed to protect women from harassment or distress. They have been criticised by Mr Vance before, notably back in February during a headline-grabbing speech at the Munich Security Conference. The report also criticises the Online Safety Act and accuses ministers of intervening to \"chill speech\" about last summer's murders in Southport, highlighting arrests made in the wake of the subsequent riots. Ministers have said the Online Safety Act is about protecting children, and repeatedly gone so far as to suggest people who are opposed to it are on the side of predators. Read more politics news:Is Keir Starmer falling into booby trap?What is ex-minister Tulip Siddiq on trial for?  The report comes months after Sir Keir bit back at Mr Vance during a summit at the White House, cutting in when Donald Trump's VP claimed there are \"infringements on free speech\" in the UK. \"We've had free speech for a very long time, it will last a long time, and we are very proud of that,\" the PM said. But Mr Vance again raised concerns during a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his country estate in Kent last week, saying he didn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech.  The US State Department's report echoes similar accusations made by the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk. The Trump administration itself has been accused of trying to curtail free speech and stifle criticism, most notably by targeting universities - Harvard chief among them."

        "Content": "\n          News correspondent\n              @esadiya\n  A would-be assassin who flew from the US to kill a Birmingham shop owner as part of a violent feud has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Birmingham Crown Court heard how Aimee Betro, 45, flew from the US to murder shopkeeper Sikander Ali at point-blank range outside his home in the Yardley area of the city in September 2019. Prosecutors alleged that Betro hid her identity using a niqab when she tried to shoot Mr Ali - but the gun jammed, allowing him to flee. Betro - originally from Wisconsin - was part of a plot orchestrated by co-conspirators Mohammed Nabil Nazir, 31, and his father, Mohammed Aslam, 56, who were in a violent feud with Mr Ali's family. During her trial, Betro said she had travelled to the UK on two previous occasions, having met Nazir on a dating app. Asked why she had paid a third visit to the UK, arriving at Manchester Airport from Atlanta around two weeks before the shooting, Betro told jurors: \"To celebrate my birthday, and I won tickets for another boat party in London.\" The court was shown CCTV of Betro waiting for 45 minutes outside Mr Ali's house on the night of 7 September 2019. As Mr Ali arrived home, Betro approached him with a firearm, but the gun failed to fire. Mr Ali is seen jumping back into his car and reversing away, clipping Betro's driver's side door in the process. The court heard Betro then goaded Mr Ali's father, Aslat Mahumad, with whom her co-conspirators had a feud, through text messages including: \"Where are you hiding?\", \"Stop playing hide and seek, you are lucky it jammed,\" and asking him to meet her at a nearby Asda. Jurors were told co-conspirators Nazir and Aslam had been injured during disorder at Mr Mahumad's clothing boutique in Birmingham in July 2018, leading them to conspire to have someone kill him or a member of his family. In the early hours of the next morning and just hours after the failed shooting, Betro booked a taxi and returned to Mr Ali's home, where she fired three shots at the property, which was empty at the time. She then fled back to the US the next day before becoming involved in another of Nazir's plots to get revenge on a rival. Read more from Sadiya Chowdhury:Two terminally ill people give their views on assisted dying voteTeen who murdered his family will not be given whole-life order Prosecutors also said Betro sent three parcels full of ammunition and gun parts to the UK on 16 October 2019. The court heard the parts, which were wrapped in foil and paper inside three cardboard boxes, were addressed to a man from Derby, with Nazir tipping off the police with the intent to frame him. While the packages were intercepted and the man arrested as part of what the prosecution said was Nazir's \"devious scheme\", his involvement in the plan eventually came to light, and he was released without charge. Betro, it said, was seen at a post office 100 miles away from her home address in the US posting the parcels under a fake name. In the case of each of those three packages, Betro's DNA has been found on the gun parts and ammunition inside them. Betro had claimed it was all a coincidence, saying the woman on the CCTV was another American who looked, dressed and sounded like her. It was alleged that Betro was in Armenia when Nazir and Aslam were jailed for 32 years and 10 years respectively in November 2024, but was extradited in January this year to face her own criminal proceedings. Jurors deliberated for almost 21 hours before convicting Betro of conspiracy to murder, possessing a self-loading pistol with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge of illegally importing ammunition. She was found guilty by majority verdicts on the conspiracy to murder and firearm charges, and by a unanimous verdict on the ammunition charge. Speaking to Sky News, Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Orencas, from West Midlands Police's Major Crime Unit, called Betro's crime \"a brazen attempt,\" adding that there \"doesn't seem to be a whole lot of effort to avoid detection\". \"I think she fell foul of a really slick, dynamic law enforcement operation over here,\" he said. \"I don't know whether that was her perspective from America, that that's how we operate, but zero tolerance around firearms, criminality on these shores.\" Betro was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 21 August. Hannah Sidaway, specialist prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service in the West Midlands, said: \"Only Betro knows what truly motivated her or what she sought to gain from becoming embroiled in a crime that meant she travelled hundreds of miles from Wisconsin to Birmingham to execute an attack on a man she did not know.\""

Seles was told she has myasthenia gravis (MG), a condition which causes muscle weakness, in 2022. The 51-year-old has told the Associated Press she first noticed the symptoms of the disease while she was playing tennis. The Serbian-American tennis great said: \"I would be playing with some kids or family members, and I would miss a ball.

But no. The singer-songwriter has announced her 12th album, her sixth in six years. Since her self-titled debut in 2006, the longest period Swifties have had to wait is just three years, between 2014’s 1989 and 2017’s Reputation; the period in which the star took time out following her public feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Over the past few years, Swift has also re-recorded and re-released four of her early albums in a (now resolved) battle over the rights to her master recordings. With the new announcement, she's living up to her reputation as the hardest-working star in pop. Album number 12 is titled The Life Of A Showgirl, hinting at inspiration drawn from spending the best part of two years on the road – and perhaps a return to pop after embracing folk and her more gothic side. Fans are now eagerly waiting to find out what Swift's new era will bring. New Heights had previously teased Swift's appearance by posting an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, which many correctly identified as the pop star. The Life Of A Showgirl follows Swift's The Tortured Poets Department, released last year during her record-breaking Eras tour, which generated more than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) across two years and five continents, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time.

In an effort to regain control over her music in recent years, Swift has been re-recording and releasing her first six albums. The move was prompted by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun's purchase and sale of her early catalogue. Some of the 'Taylor's Version' releases have included new songs as well as Easter eggs and visuals to offer a deeper understanding of her work. The four re-recorded albums released so far have been massive commercial and cultural successes, each one entering the Billboard 200 US album chart at number one, helping her become the woman with the most number one albums in history."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n  Ministers have lined up insolvency practitioners to prepare for the potential collapse of Thames Water, Britain's biggest water utility. Sky News can exclusively reveal that Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has signed off the appointment of FTI Consulting to advise on contingency plans for Thames Water to be placed into a Special Administration regime (SAR). Sources said on Tuesday that the advisory role established FTI Consulting as the frontrunner to act as the company's administrator if it fails to secure a private sector bailout - although approval of such an appointment would be decided in court. Money latest: Supermarket coffee beats big brands in taste test Thames Water, its largest group of creditors and Ofwat, the industry regulator, have been locked in talks for months about a deal that would see its lenders injecting about £5bn of new capital and writing off roughly £12bn of value across its capital structure. The discussions are said to be progressing constructively, although they appear to rely in part on the prospect of the company being granted forbearance on hundreds of millions of pounds of regulatory fines. Responding to an enquiry from Sky News on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said: \"The government will always act in the national interest on these issues. \n                  Does water's 'Great Stink' moment pass the sniff test? \n                 \n                  Thames Water turnaround will take 'at least a decade', boss warns\n                 \n                  Hong Kong giant CKI demands to rejoin auction of stricken Thames Water\n                 \"The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for a Special Administration Regime if that were to become necessary.\" Insiders stressed that FTI Consulting's engagement by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) did not signal that Thames Water was about to collapse into insolvency proceedings. A SAR would ensure that customers would continue to receive water and sewage services if Thames Water collapsed, while putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of pounds in bailout costs - a scenario the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is keen to avoid at a time when the public finances are already severely constrained. The SAR process can only be instigated in the event that a company becomes insolvent, can no longer fulfil its statutory duties or breaches an enforcement order, according to insiders. Mr Reed has repeatedly stressed the government's desire to avoid taking Thames Water into temporary public ownership, but that it was ready to deal with \"all eventualities\". \"Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to its customers and to the environment--it is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company. The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities,\" he told the House of Commons in June. Thames Water, which has about 16m customers, serves about a quarter of the UK's population. It is drowning under close to £20bn of debt, and was previously owned by Macquarie, the Australian infrastructure and banking behemoth. Its most recent consortium of shareholders, which included the Universities Superannuation Scheme and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, have written off the value of their investments in the company. The government's SAR process has only been tested once before, when the energy retailer Bulb failed in 2021. Bulb was ultimately sold to Octopus Energy with the taxpayer funding used to save and run the company since having been repaid. Thames Water is racing to secure a rescue plan involving funds such as Elliott Management and Silver Point Capital, with a deadline of late October to appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority against Ofwat's final determination on its next five-year spending plan. Ofwat has ruled that Thames Water can spend £20.5bn during the period from 2026, with the company arguing that it requires a further sum of approximately £4bn. Mike McTighe, a veteran corporate troubleshooter who chairs BT Group's Openreach division, has been parachuted in to work with the funds. The company said in its accounts last month that there was \"material uncertainty\" over whether it could be solvently recapitalised. Earlier this year, Thames Water was fined a record £123m over sewage leaks and the payment of dividends, with Ofwat lambasting the company over its performance and governance. In recent weeks, Thames Water has been engulfed in a row over the legitimacy of bonuses paid to chief executive Chris Weston and other bosses, even as it attempts to secure its survival. Under new laws, Thames Water is among half a dozen water companies which have been barred from paying bonuses this year because of their poor environmental records. The creditor group was effectively left as the sole bidder for Thames Water after the private equity firm KKR withdrew from the process, citing political and reputational risks. The Hong Kong-based investor CK Infrastructure Holdings (CKI), which already owns Northumbrian Water, has sought to re-engage in talks about a rescue deal but has gained little traction in doing so. News of FTI Consulting's appointment also comes on the same day as a \"nationally significant\" water shortfall was declared across swathes of the country. Last week, Sky News revealed that David Black, the Ofwat chief executive, was to step down following the publication of a government-commissioned review which recommended the regulator's abolition. He has been replaced by Chris Walters, another Ofwat executive, on an interim basis."

        "Content": "\n          Business and economics reporter\n              @taaffems\n The rate of wage rises in the UK continued to slow as the number of job vacancies and people in work fell, according to new figures. Average weekly earnings slowed to 4.6% down from 5%, while pay excluding bonuses continued to grow 5%, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the three months to June. It means the gap between inflation - the rate of price rises - and wage increases is narrowing, and the labour market is slowing. Inflation stood at 3.6% in June. Money latest: Supermarket coffee beats big brands in Americano taste test The number of employees on payroll has fallen in ten of the last 12 months, with the falls concentrated in hospitality and retail, the ONS said. It came as employers faced higher wage bills from increased minimum wages and upped national insurance contributions. As a result, it's harder to get a job now than a year ago. \"Job vacancies, likewise, have continued to fall, also driven by fewer opportunities in these industries,\" the ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said. The number of job vacancies fell for the 37th consecutive period and in 16 of the 18 industry sectors. Feedback from employers suggested firms may not be recruiting new workers or replacing those who left. Unemployment remained at 4.7% in June, the same as in May. The ONS, however, continued to advise caution in interpreting changes in the monthly unemployment rate due to concerns over the figures' reliability. Read more:US and China extend tariffs deadline againFull-time workers relying on food handouts The exact number of unemployed people is unknown, partly because people do not respond to surveys and answer the phone when the ONS calls. The worst is yet to come Wage rises are expected to fall further, and redundancies are anticipated to rise. \"Wage growth is likely to weaken over the course of the year as softening economic conditions, rising redundancies and elevated staffing costs increasingly hinder pay settlements,\" said Suren Thiru, the economics director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). \"The UK jobs market is facing more pain in the coming months with higher labour costs likely to lift unemployment moderately higher, particularly given growing concerns over more tax rises in this autumn's budget.\"  What does it mean for interest rates? While wage rises are slowing, the fact that they're still above inflation means the interest rate setters of the Bank of England could be cautious about further cuts. Higher pay can cause inflation to rise. The central bank is mandated to bring down inflation to 2%. But one more interest rate cut this year, in December, is currently expected by investors, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The evidence of a weakening labour market provides justification for the interest rate cut of last week."

On free speech, while \"generally provided\" for, the report cites \"specific areas of concern\" around limits on \"political speech deemed 'hateful' or 'offensive'\". Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended the UK's record on free speech after concerns were raised by Mr Vance. In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\" The US report highlights Britain's public space protection orders, which allow councils to restrict certain activities in some public places to prevent antisocial behaviour. It also references \"safe access zones\" around abortion clinics, which the Home Office says are designed to protect women from harassment or distress. They have been criticised by Mr Vance before, notably back in February during a headline-grabbing speech at the Munich Security Conference. The report also criticises the Online Safety Act and accuses ministers of intervening to \"chill speech\" about last summer's murders in Southport, highlighting arrests made in the wake of the subsequent riots. Ministers have said the Online Safety Act is about protecting children, and repeatedly gone so far as to suggest people who are opposed to it are on the side of predators.

But Mr Vance again raised concerns during a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his country estate in Kent last week, saying he didn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech.  The US State Department's report echoes similar accusations made by the likes of Nigel Farage and Elon Musk. The Trump administration itself has been accused of trying to curtail free speech and stifle criticism, most notably by targeting universities - Harvard chief among them."

Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis The tech, which has been trialled in London and south Wales, will be subject to strict rules, the Home Office said, but human rights groups have warned it is \"dangerous and discriminatory\". Amnesty International UK said the plans should be \"immediately scrapped\", with facial recognition proven to be \"discriminatory against communities of colour\". \"It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest,\" said Alba Kapoor, the charity's racial justice lead, \"and it's also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour.\" The Home Office said the LFR vans will only be deployed when there is \"specific intelligence\", and will be operated by trained officers who will check every match made by the cameras. The vehicles will also only be used against bespoke watch lists, compiled for each use under guidelines set by the College of Policing. The vans will be operated by police forces in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly).

According to the Metropolitan Police, the tech has led to 580 arrests for offences such as rape, domestic crime and knife crime in the space of 12 months.

Coming into force today, it says there must be a policing reason to release the information, such as where there are high levels of disinformation, if it will improve public safety, or if it is significantly in the public interest. Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they will support the new guidance by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information if appropriate. The change comes after two men charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton were reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, sparking protests. Warwickshire Police did not confirm the immigration status, leading to Reform UK accusing them of a \"cover-up\", something the force strongly denied. Responding to the row, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said last week she wanted police to be more transparent, and that new guidance was being worked up.  How high-profile cases sparked debate When considering what information to release, police must consider contempt of court laws which aim to give defendants a fair trial, as well as media guidance from the College of Policing. Until now, the media guidance said once a suspect has been charged, police can give out information such as their name, date of birth and address. It did not mention anything about ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status. The Southport murders committed by Axel Rudakubana last July led to speculation about his ethnicity and immigration status, fuelling riots in many parts of the country. While the details were not initially released in that case, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool's Premier League win earlier this year, Merseyside Police were quick to say the suspect was a white British man. In the Nuneaton case, Reform leader Nigel Farage said retaining the \"basic and sober facts\" was \"a cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings\". Warwickshire Police said officers \"did not and will not cover up such criminality\", and followed national guidance. Read more politics news:Council asks High Court to stop asylum hotelIs Keir Starmer falling into a small boats trap? How will new guidance work? The new guidance says it is at the discretion of the police force to decide whether to release ethnicity and nationality details, and that they must consider the ethical and legal implications. It says it is not the job of police to verify a suspect's immigration status, which rests with the Home Office. The advice has been developed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, in consultation with the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, said: \"We saw during last summer's disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major, real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the public domain. \"We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels. \"Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.\"  'A chilling message' The guidance is interim, and will be considered as part of a wider review of the College of Policing's authorised professional practice for media relations later this year. Chief constable Sir Andy Marsh, the college's CEO, said officers will continue to police \"without fear or favour\". But the guidance is likely to provoke backlash from anti-racism campaigners. Last week, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants warned that revealing ethnicity and migration status would \"send a chilling message: that some people are inherently more 'suspect'\". 'Public trust requires transparency' A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News they welcome the new guidance, adding: \"Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them.\" They added: \"The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld. \"The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. All cases will of course take account of consultation with the police and CPS. \"The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial.\""

        "Content": "\n          Political correspondent\n              @tamcohen\n  As a milestone is reached of 50,000 migrants crossing the Channel since he became prime minister, Keir Starmer finds himself in a familiar place - seemingly unable to either stop the boats, or escape talking about them.  Home Office data shows 50,271 people made the journey since the election last July, after 474 migrants arrived on Monday. This is around 13,000 higher than the comparable period the previous year. Politics Live: Starmer hits unwanted small boat crossings milestone Starmer has tweeted more than 10 times about this issue in the past week alone, more than any other. On Monday he wrote on X: \"If you come to this country illegally, you will face detention and return. If you come to this country and commit a crime, we will deport you as soon as possible.\" It could be a tweet by a politician of any party on the right - and many voters (and Labour MPs) will say it's right that the prime minister is taking this issue seriously. Illegal - or irregular - migration is a relatively small proportion of total migration. Net migration was down at 431,000 in 2024 which the OCED say is comparable to other high-income countries. But it is of course highly visible and politically charged. \n                  US accuses UK of 'significant human rights issues' and restricting free speech\n                 \n                  Facial recognition vans to be rolled out across police forces in England\n                 \n                  Police ordered to consider revealing ethnicity of suspects\n                 Nigel Farage's Reform party have had a busy few months campaigning on it, and the prime minister has been toughening up his language in response. Shortly after the local elections in May in which Reform won hundreds of seats and took control of councils, Starmer made his speech in which he warned: \"In a diverse nation like ours, without fair immigration rules, we risk becoming an island of strangers.\" It outraged some in his own party, and he later said he regretted that language. But it was part of a speech which made clear that he wanted action - vowing to end \"years of uncontrolled migration\" in a way \"that will finally take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter for our politics.\" It's a long way from his early months as Labour leader in 2020 when he said: \"We welcome migrants, we don't scapegoat them.\" Migration did not feature as one of his five missions for \"change\" at the general election. The strategy by Starmer and his minister is to talk up forthcoming new measures - a crackdown on social media adverts by traffickers, returns of people without a right to be in the UK which are indeed higher than under the Conservatives, and last week, a \"one in, one out\" deal with France to send people back across the channel. The government say some people have been detained, although it is not known when these returns will happen. Ministers are also still pointing the finger at the previous Conservative government - which found stopping the boats easy to say and hard to achieve. Read More:Kemi Badenoch suggests asylum seekers should be housed in 'Nightingale' campsWhat is the UK-France migrant returns deal, who will be returned and how many? Baroness Jacqui Smith, a former home secretary, said this morning: \"I don't think it was our fault that it was enabled to take root. We've taken our responsibility to work internationally, to change the law, to improve the way in which the asylum system works, to take through legislation to strengthen the powers that are available. \"The last government did none of those things and focused on gimmicks. And it's because of that, that the crime behind this got embedded in the way which it did. And that won't be solved overnight.\" But for a prime minister who appears to have come to this issue reluctantly, talking about it a lot - and suggesting he'll be judged on whether he can tackle it - risks raising expectations. Joe Twyman, of the pollsters Deltapoll said: \"You cannot simply out-Farage Nigel Farage when it comes to the subject of immigration. In a sense, Labour is falling into precisely the same trap that the Conservatives fell into. They're giving significant prominence to a subject where they don't have much control\". Starmer has avoided mentioning firm numbers on how many migrants his crackdown may stop, but as previous prime ministers have found with the difficult issue of controlling migration, if you ask to be judged on delivery, voters will do so."

        "Content": "\n          City editor\n              @MarkKleinmanSky\n  Ministers have lined up insolvency practitioners to prepare for the potential collapse of Thames Water, Britain's biggest water utility. Sky News can exclusively reveal that Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has signed off the appointment of FTI Consulting to advise on contingency plans for Thames Water to be placed into a Special Administration regime (SAR). Sources said on Tuesday that the advisory role established FTI Consulting as the frontrunner to act as the company's administrator if it fails to secure a private sector bailout - although approval of such an appointment would be decided in court. Money latest: Supermarket coffee beats big brands in taste test Thames Water, its largest group of creditors and Ofwat, the industry regulator, have been locked in talks for months about a deal that would see its lenders injecting about £5bn of new capital and writing off roughly £12bn of value across its capital structure. The discussions are said to be progressing constructively, although they appear to rely in part on the prospect of the company being granted forbearance on hundreds of millions of pounds of regulatory fines. Responding to an enquiry from Sky News on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said: \"The government will always act in the national interest on these issues. \n                  Does water's 'Great Stink' moment pass the sniff test? \n                 \n                  Thames Water turnaround will take 'at least a decade', boss warns\n                 \n                  Hong Kong giant CKI demands to rejoin auction of stricken Thames Water\n                 \"The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for a Special Administration Regime if that were to become necessary.\" Insiders stressed that FTI Consulting's engagement by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) did not signal that Thames Water was about to collapse into insolvency proceedings. A SAR would ensure that customers would continue to receive water and sewage services if Thames Water collapsed, while putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of pounds in bailout costs - a scenario the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is keen to avoid at a time when the public finances are already severely constrained. The SAR process can only be instigated in the event that a company becomes insolvent, can no longer fulfil its statutory duties or breaches an enforcement order, according to insiders. Mr Reed has repeatedly stressed the government's desire to avoid taking Thames Water into temporary public ownership, but that it was ready to deal with \"all eventualities\". \"Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to its customers and to the environment--it is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company. The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities,\" he told the House of Commons in June. Thames Water, which has about 16m customers, serves about a quarter of the UK's population. It is drowning under close to £20bn of debt, and was previously owned by Macquarie, the Australian infrastructure and banking behemoth. Its most recent consortium of shareholders, which included the Universities Superannuation Scheme and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, have written off the value of their investments in the company. The government's SAR process has only been tested once before, when the energy retailer Bulb failed in 2021. Bulb was ultimately sold to Octopus Energy with the taxpayer funding used to save and run the company since having been repaid. Thames Water is racing to secure a rescue plan involving funds such as Elliott Management and Silver Point Capital, with a deadline of late October to appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority against Ofwat's final determination on its next five-year spending plan. Ofwat has ruled that Thames Water can spend £20.5bn during the period from 2026, with the company arguing that it requires a further sum of approximately £4bn. Mike McTighe, a veteran corporate troubleshooter who chairs BT Group's Openreach division, has been parachuted in to work with the funds. The company said in its accounts last month that there was \"material uncertainty\" over whether it could be solvently recapitalised. Earlier this year, Thames Water was fined a record £123m over sewage leaks and the payment of dividends, with Ofwat lambasting the company over its performance and governance. In recent weeks, Thames Water has been engulfed in a row over the legitimacy of bonuses paid to chief executive Chris Weston and other bosses, even as it attempts to secure its survival. Under new laws, Thames Water is among half a dozen water companies which have been barred from paying bonuses this year because of their poor environmental records. The creditor group was effectively left as the sole bidder for Thames Water after the private equity firm KKR withdrew from the process, citing political and reputational risks. The Hong Kong-based investor CK Infrastructure Holdings (CKI), which already owns Northumbrian Water, has sought to re-engage in talks about a rescue deal but has gained little traction in doing so. News of FTI Consulting's appointment also comes on the same day as a \"nationally significant\" water shortfall was declared across swathes of the country. Last week, Sky News revealed that David Black, the Ofwat chief executive, was to step down following the publication of a government-commissioned review which recommended the regulator's abolition. He has been replaced by Chris Walters, another Ofwat executive, on an interim basis."

        "Content": "​​​​​​​New \"hearing glasses\" are being created that use artificial intelligence to help people hear conversations more clearly in real-time. Scientists in Scotland are developing a prototype set of glasses that combine lip-reading technology, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to clean up conversations in people's hearing aids. The smart glasses are fitted with a camera that records dialogue and uses visual cues to detect the main speaker. The wearer's phone then sends the recording to a cloud server, where the speaker's voice is isolated and background noise removed. The cleaned-up audio is then sent back to the listener's hearing aid almost instantly, despite travelling to servers all the way over in Sweden and back. \"We're not trying to reinvent hearing aids. We're trying to give them superpowers,\" said project leader Professor Mathini Sellathurai, of Heriot-Watt University. \"You simply point the camera or look at the person you want to hear. \"Even if two people are talking at once, the AI uses visual cues to extract the voice of the person you're looking at.\" Read more science and tech news:Water shortfall declared 'nationally significant'New pancreatic cancer vaccine shows promise in trialCould flashing mouthguards help rugby's safety problem Over 1.2 million UK adults struggle with ordinary conversation because of hearing loss, according to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. Although noise-cancelling technology does exist for hearing aids, it often struggles with voices overlapping in conversation or when there are lots of different background noises. The researchers say that by using cloud servers to do the heavy lifting on cleaning up audio, the glasses can take advantage of powerful artificial intelligence while still being wearable. They hope to have a working version of the glasses by 2026, and are already speaking to hearing aid manufacturers about ways to reduce costs and make the devices more widely available. Scientists from Heriot-Watt University led the project and worked with researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Napier University and the University of Stirling."

        "Content": " Thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes as deadly wildfires continue to burn across southern Europe amid a record-breaking heatwave. Firefighters worked through the night to contain a blaze which broke out near Madrid in Spain. A man caught in the fire in Tres Cantos, near the Spanish capital, died in hospital after suffering 98% burns. Blazes also erupted across several Spanish regions, including Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha, Andalusia and Galicia. Spain's interior ministry declared a \"pre-emergency\", putting national services on standby to support firefighters. Almost 1,000 members of the country's armed forces are already helping. Temperatures are expected to reach 44C (112.2F) in some parts of the country, according to forecasters. In Portugal, more than 700 firefighters were working to control a fire in Trancoso, about 217 miles northeast of Lisbon. Smaller fires were burning further north of the country. \"We are being cooked alive, this cannot continue,\" said Vila Real mayor Alexandre Favaios. A fire in the Portuguese city has been burning for 10 days. Firefighters were also battling several wildfires across Turkey on Tuesday, including in the northwestern province of Canakkale, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes. Blazes forced the temporary closure of Canakkale Airport, and also the Dardanelles Strait to shipping. By Jo Wheeler, weather presenter It's hot over Europe at the moment thanks to a heat dome; a high pressure system which acts like a pan lid, preventing cooler air masses moving in and causing temperatures to rise as air is forced down and compressed.   So Iberia and France have seen daytime highs well above average.  \n At the same time, we have high pressure to the east of the country (clockwise winds), and low pressure to the south-west (anticlockwise winds). Combined they're creating a strong draw of air from the South.   And whilst we won't see the dizzy heights of 40C here, we are seeing temperatures topping 30C.    Now, a heatwave is defined in different regions at different temperatures across the UK and Ireland but it seems likely that quite an extensive part of England and Wales will be experiencing a heatwave over the next couple of days.  And not for the first time this summer! And even though it becomes less hot in the UK through the coming week, we won't be reaching for the thermals either.    Temperatures will remain above average into the weekend and beyond. Long range forecasts are somewhat unreliable when we are not seeing any major drivers in force (El Nino, La Nina, North Atlantic Oscillation to name a few).  But the Met Office is leaning towards a more settled weather picture for the rest of the month for the UK. That's not to say there won't be any rain, but little sign of anything significant.    Above all, we can probably rely on the British weather to deliver a surprise when we least expect it!    Wildfires in Greece forced the evacuation of several villages and a hotel on the tourist islands of Zakynthos and Cephalonia in the Ionian Sea, along with four other parts of the mainland. \"Winds are strong and the wildfire is out of control,\" Zakynthos mayor Yiorgos Stasinopoulos told Greek public broadcaster ERT.

All-time records were also broken in Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service, Meteo France. Global warming is giving the Mediterranean region hotter, drier summers, scientists say. Europe is warming faster than any other continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Last year was the hottest year on record in Europe and globally, the monitoring agency said."

        "Content": "Jeremy Clarkson has joined a backlash in the Cotswolds after US vice president JD Vance arrived at a picturesque hamlet in the region for his summer holiday. Mr Vance and his family are staying at Dean Manor, a Grade II-listed country home in the tiny hamlet of Dean, during a trip where they also stayed with the Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kent and will later travel to Scotland. Local residents reportedly expressed their frustrations after Mr Vance's enormous motorcade, consisting of 18 vehicles, caused a lockdown in the countryside on Monday. People in the Cotswolds faced road closures and security checkpoints overseen by police with sniffer dogs as Mr Vance made his way to Dean Manor on Monday, according to GloucestershireLive. It came before a \"Vance Not Welcome Party\" protest was organised by the groups \"Everybody Hates Elon\" and the \"Stop Trump Coalition\" in Charlbury, close to where Mr Vance is staying, today. The demonstrators held banners mocking the US vice president and calling him a \"war criminal\", in an apparent reference to America's support for Israel. Several protesters held images of a widely shared meme depicting Mr Vance with a bald head. The meme went viral after a Norwegian tourist claimed he was not allowed into the US after immigration agents saw it on his phone. \n                  US accuses UK of 'significant human rights issues' and restricting free speech\n                 \n                  Police ordered to consider revealing ethnicity of suspects\n                 \n                  Facial recognition vans to be rolled out across police forces in England\n                 One protester in Charlbury held a banner reading \"JD Vance's Netflix password is 'password'\", while another held a sign which said: \"JD Vance claps when the plane lands.\" Meanwhile, a van displaying the image of a bald Mr Vance was seen driving through Charlbury. A large sign outside a property in nearby Chipping Norton read: \"Gaza starves, Vance not welcome.\" The demonstrations took place as former Top Gear presenter Clarkson shared an image on Instagram which highlighted how his farm is under a no-fly zone over the Cotswolds areas of Chadlington and Spelsbury. In an apparent reference to filming for the fifth series of his show Clarkson's Farm, the 65-year-old wrote: \"The JD Vance no fly zone. We are the pin. So on the downside, no drone shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.\" However, he later sarcastically shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene and wrote: \"Utter chaos caused by Vance. How will we ever manage?\" Read more:Vance doesn't want UK to go down 'dark path'The ungodly history of Lammy's grace-and-favour mansion Kaleb Cooper, a farmer who is Clarkson's co-star on the Amazon Prime show, said some of his \"wheat got wet\" after he got stuck behind Mr Vance's convoy. He wrote: \"I could have easily went on my way and got it in the shed without getting in the way.\" Cooper also joked that if Mr Vance simply \"drove around in a VW Polo nobody would know who he was\". Clarkson's \"Diddly Squat Farm\" in Chadlington is around three miles from the hamlet of Dean where Mr Vance is staying. Well known for being popular with members of the British elite - former UK prime minister David Cameron lives in Dean - the Cotswolds is also becoming increasingly popular with wealthy Americans. Some of them moved to the region after the election of Donald Trump last year. TV presenter Ellen DeGeneres is among those who has relocated to the area. Not all of Dean's residents appreciate its growing popularity. Jonathan Mazower, the head of communications for NGO Survival International, who owns one of Dean's 15 homes, said he had to speak out against Mr Vance's presence, adding: \"It's a massive intrusion and it's not just the fact our lives are disrupted but it's who he is.\" Vance's UK tour The US vice president is expected to host shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick during his holiday - but not Tory leader Kemi Badenoch. Mr Jenrick has been invited to meet Mr Vance before a drinks event on Tuesday, it is understood. A Conservative spokesman said the party leader's team had spoken to Mr Vance's but that \"scheduling\" had proved difficult. Both sides have played down the notion of a snub, the Telegraph reported. It comes as the US vice president will travel to Scotland later this week in a trip that could see up to 1,000 police officers deployed as part of security efforts. Sky News understands the Vance family are likely to visit Ayrshire but are not thought to be planning to stay at Mr Trump's Turnberry resort in the area.  In Kent, Mr Vance said he had a \"love\" for the UK but joked he had committed a diplomatic faux pas as he began his holiday. \"Unfortunately, the one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,\" he said. He also said he doesn't want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech. Mr Vance described Mr Lammy as a \"very, very gracious host\"."

        "Content": " Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album during an appearance on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast.  The pop megastar, appearing on New Heights, did not say when the record, titled The Life Of A Showgirl, will be released. Fans can pre-order the album in various formats now, and Swift's website says physical copies will be shipped by 13 October. On Monday, Taylor Nation - an official branch of the singer's marketing team - teased the release on TikTok with a slideshow of 12 images alongside the caption: \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era…'\" Swift is seen wearing orange in every picture. A special limited vinyl edition of the album will be released in \"Portofino orange glitter\", according to a pre-order page on her site. A special cassette edition is also available for pre-order. A brief clip from the New Heights podcast, hosted by Swift's NFL star boyfriend, Travis Kelce and his brother Jason, a former NFL player, was posted on Instagram early on Tuesday. The video showed Swift pulling a copy of the album from a briefcase with the cover blurred. The full podcast episode will be released at 11pm on Tuesday, UK time. Culture and entertainment reporter You might think that after pulling off the highest-grossing tour in history, all while writing and releasing an unexpected record-breaking double album at the same time, Taylor Swift would be happy to take a little break. But no. The singer-songwriter has announced her 12th album, her sixth in six years. Since her self-titled debut in 2006, the longest period Swifties have had to wait is just three years, between 2014’s 1989 and 2017’s Reputation; the period in which the star took time out following her public feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Over the past few years, Swift has also re-recorded and re-released four of her early albums in a (now resolved) battle over the rights to her master recordings. With the new announcement, she's living up to her reputation as the hardest-working star in pop. Album number 12 is titled The Life Of A Showgirl, hinting at inspiration drawn from spending the best part of two years on the road – and perhaps a return to pop after embracing folk and her more gothic side. Fans are now eagerly waiting to find out what Swift's new era will bring. New Heights had previously teased Swift's appearance by posting an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, which many correctly identified as the pop star. The Life Of A Showgirl follows Swift's The Tortured Poets Department, released last year during her record-breaking Eras tour, which generated more than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) across two years and five continents, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. Read more about Taylor Swift:Swift's final London show was the 'best'The impact of the 'excruciating' Era's tourHer new chart record It marks her first release since she took back control over her entire back catalogue from private equity firm Shamrock Capital for an undisclosed amount. In an effort to regain control over her music in recent years, Swift has been re-recording and releasing her first six albums. The move was prompted by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun's purchase and sale of her early catalogue. Some of the 'Taylor's Version' releases have included new songs as well as Easter eggs and visuals to offer a deeper understanding of her work. The four re-recorded albums released so far have been massive commercial and cultural successes, each one entering the Billboard 200 US album chart at number one, helping her become the woman with the most number one albums in history."
